An old woman of seventy, brisk, dignified, old-fashioned.\n\nMICHAEL. Her son, thirty-five years old, passionate, self-satisfied,\nvain and strong.\n\nMARTHA. Her daughter-in-law, a grumbler, speaks much and rapidly.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81SHKA. Ten years old, daughter of Martha and Michael.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. The village elder\'s assistant, speaks slowly and gives himself\nairs.\n\nA TRAMP. Forty years old, restless, thin, speaks impressively; when\ndrunk is particularly free and easy.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. Forty years old, a buffoon, merry and stupid.\n\n\n\n\n                           THE CAUSE OF IT ALL\n\n\n\n\nACT I\n\n    Autumn. A peasant\'s hut, with a small room partitioned off. Akul\xc3\xadna\n    sits spinning; Martha the housewife is kneading bread; little\n    Par\xc3\xa1shka is rocking a cradle.\n\n\nMARTHA. Oh dear, my heart feels heavy! I know it means trouble; there\'s\nnothing to keep him there. It will again be like the other day, when he\nwent to town to sell the firewood and drank nearly half of it. And he\nblames me for everything.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Why look for trouble? It is still early, and the town is a long\nway off. For the present\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARTHA. What do you mean by early? Ak\xc3\xadmych is back already. He started\nafter Michael but Michael\'s not back yet! It\'s worry worry all day long;\nthat\'s all the pleasure one gets.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Ak\xc3\xadmych took his load straight to a customer; but our man took\nhis to sell at the market.\n\nMARTHA. If he were alone I shouldn\'t worry, but Ign\xc3\xa1t is with him; and\nwhen he\'s with that lousy hound (God forgive me!), he\'s sure to get\ndrunk. Early and late one toils and moils. Everything is on our\nshoulders! If one only got anything by it! But no! hustling about all\nday long is all the pleasure one gets.\n\n    Door opens and Tar\xc3\xa1s enters with a ragged Tramp.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Good day to you! I\'ve brought a man who wants a night\'s\nlodging.[1]\n\n  [1] It is customary for the village authorities to quarter tramps on\n  each peasant household in a village in turn, or in such order as\n  appears convenient.\n\nTRAMP [bows] My respects to you.\n\nMARTHA. Why do you bring them to us so often? We put up a tramp last\nWednesday night; you always bring them to us. You should make Stepan\xc3\xadda\nput them up; there are no children there. It\'s more than I can do to\nlook after my own family, and you always bring these people to us.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Everyone in turn has to put them up.\n\nMARTHA. It\'s all very well to say "everyone in turn," but I have\nchildren, and besides, the master is not at home to-day.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Never mind, let the fellow sleep here to-night; he\'ll not wear\nout the place he lies on.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [to Tramp] Come in and sit down, and be our guest.\n\nTRAMP. I tender my gratitude. I should like a bite of something, if\npossible.\n\nMARTHA. You haven\'t had time to look round, and want to eat already.\nDidn\'t you beg anything in the village?\n\nTRAMP [sighs] I\'m not in the habit of begging because of my position,\nand having no producks of my own\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Akul\xc3\xadna rises, goes to the table, takes a loaf of bread, cuts a\n    slice, and gives it to the Tramp.\n\nTRAMP [taking the bread] Merci.[2] [Sits down on the bench and eats\ngreedily].\n\n  [2] The tramp, who has had some acquaintance with educated\n  Revolutionaries, tries to introduce foreign words, or words not\n  generally used by workmen, into his talk. In this instance he used the\n  French word _merci_ instead of the plain "thank you."\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. And where is Michael?\n\nMARTHA. Why, he took hay to the town. It\'s time he was back, but he\'s\nnot here. Something must have happened.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Why, what should happen?\n\nMARTHA. What indeed? Not anything good; it\'s only bad one has to expect.\nAs soon as he\'s out of the house he forgets all about us! I expect he\'ll\ncome back tipsy!\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [sitting down to spin, points at Martha and says to Tar\xc3\xa1s] It\'s\nnot in her to be quiet. As I always say, we women must find something to\ngrumble about.\n\nMARTHA. If he were alone I should not be afraid, but he went with Ign\xc3\xa1t.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S [smiling] Ah well, Ign\xc3\xa1t Iv\xc3\xa1novich certainly is fond of a drop of\nv\xc3\xb3dka.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Doesn\'t he know what Ign\xc3\xa1t is like! Ign\xc3\xa1t is one man, and our\nMichael\'s another.\n\nMARTHA. It\'s all very well for you to talk, mother; but I\'m sick of his\ndrinking. While he is sober it would be a sin to complain of him, but\nwhen he\'s drunk, you know what he is like. One can\'t say a word;\neverything is wrong.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Yes, but look at you women too; a man has a drink. Well, he\nswaggers about a bit, and sleeps it off, and everything goes on all\nright; but then the likes of you keep on nagging at him.\n\nMARTHA. When he\'s drunk there\'s no pleasing him, do what you will.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. But you should understand that we can\'t help having a drop now\nand then. Your woman\'s business is at home, but the likes of us must\nhave a drop when we\'re on business, or for company\'s sake. Well, so one\ndrinks, and where is the harm?\n\nMARTHA. You may talk, but it\'s hard on us women. Oh, how hard it is! If\none harnessed you men to our work just for a week, you would sing a\ndifferent tune. Kneading, cooking, baking, spinning, weaving, and the\ncattle to look after, and all the rest of it, and the brats to keep\nwashed and clothed and fed; it\'s all on our shoulders, and if anything\nis the least bit not to his fancy, there you are, especially when he\'s\ndrunk. Oh dear, what a life ours is!\n\nTRAMP [chewing] That\'s quite correct. It\'s the cause of it all; I mean\nall the catastrophes of life proceed from alcoholic liquors.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. It seems to have bowled you over too!\n\nTRAMP. No, not exactly that, though I have suffered from that too. The\ncareer of my life might have been different but for the drink.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Now, to my thinking, if you drink reasonably, there\'s no manner\nof harm in it.\n\nTRAMP. But I say that it is so strong that it may completely ruin a man.\n\nMARTHA. That\'s what I say: you worry and do your best, and the only\ncomfort you get is to be scolded and beaten like a dog.\n\nTRAMP. And that\'s not all. There are some people, persons I mean, that\nare quite deprived of their reason through it and commit entirely\ninappropriate actions. While he does not drink, give him anything you\nlike and he won\'t take what is not his; but when drunk, he grabs\nwhatever comes handy. Many a time one gets beaten and put in prison. As\nlong as I don\'t drink, all goes honestly and honourably, but as soon as\nI drink, I mean as soon as that same person drinks, he at once begins\ngrabbing whatever comes his way.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. And I think it\'s all in oneself.\n\nTRAMP. Of course it\'s in oneself as long as one is well, but this is a\nkind of disease.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. A nice kind of disease. A good hiding would soon cure that\ndisease. Well, goodbye for the present. [Exit].\n\nMARTHA [wipes her hands and turns to go].\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [sees that the Tramp has finished his bread] Martha, I say,\nMartha! Cut him another piece.\n\nMARTHA. Bother him, I must get the samov\xc3\xa1r to boil. [Exit].\n\n    Akul\xc3\xadna rises, goes to the table, cuts a chunk of bread and gives it\n    to the Tramp.\n\nTRAMP. _Merci_, I have acquired a great appetite.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Are you a workman?\n\nTRAMP. Who? I? I was a mechanic.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. And what wages did you get?\n\nTRAMP. I used to get fifty, and even seventy roubles, a month.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. That\'s a good lot! Then how have you come down so low?\n\nTRAMP. Come down! I\'m not the only one. I\'ve come down because the times\nare such that it is impossible for an honest man to live.\n\nMARTHA [brings in the samov\xc3\xa1r] Oh Lord! it\'s certain sure he\'ll come\nhome drunk. I feel it in my heart.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. I\'m afraid he must really have gone on the spree.\n\nMARTHA. There it is. One struggles and struggles and kneads and bakes\nand cooks and spins and weaves and tends the cattle; everything on one\'s\nown shoulders. [The baby in the cradle cries] Par\xc3\xa1shka, rock the boy. Oh\ndear, what a life it is for us women. And when he is drunk, nothing is\nright!... If one only says a word he doesn\'t like\xc2\xa0...\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [making the tea] And this is the last of the tea. Did you tell\nhim to get some?\n\nMARTHA. Of course. He said he would, but he\'ll have forgotten all about\nhis home!... [She puts the samov\xc3\xa1r on the table].\n\n    The Tramp moves away.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Why do you leave the table? We are going to drink tea.\n\nTRAMP. I tender my gratitude for the hearty hospitality. [Throws away\nthe cheap cigar[3] he was smoking and comes to the table].\n\n  [3] The "cigar" will have probably consisted of some bad tobacco\n  rolled up in a bit of newspaper.\n\nMARTHA. And what sort do you belong to? Peasants, or some other?\n\nTRAMP. Well, I\'m not of the peasant class, nor of the aristocracy. I\'m\nof the double-edged class.\n\nMARTHA. What\'s that? [hands him a cup of tea].\n\nTRAMP. _Merci._ Why this; that my father was a Polish Count, and besides\nhim I had many others; and I also had two mothers. In general my\nbiography presents many difficulties.\n\nMARTHA. Have another cup? Well, did you get any learning?\n\nTRAMP. My learning has also been very uncircumstantial. Not my mother,\nbut my godmother apprenticed me to a blacksmith. That blacksmith was my\nfirst perdagogue; and his perdagogy consisted in this--that he did not\nbeat his anvil as often as he beat my unfortunate head. Nevertheless,\nhowever much he hit me, he could not deprive me of talent. Then I went\nto a locksmith\'s, and there I was appreciated, and became foreman. I\nmade acquaintance with educated people, and belonged to a political\nfaction. I was able to master intellectual literature; and my life might\nhave been elevated for I possessed immense talent.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Of course.\n\nTRAMP. But here came an upset. The despotic yoke oppressing the life of\nthe people! I got into prison; I mean, I suffered the incarceration of\nfreedom.\n\nMARTHA. What for?\n\nTRAMP. For our rights.\n\nMARTHA. What rights?\n\nTRAMP. What rights? Why the rights that the bourgeois should not feast\ncontinually, and that the labouring proletariat might reap the rewards\nof labour.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. And get back the land, I suppose?\n\nTRAMP. Well naturally. The Agromoric question too.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. May God and the Holy Queen of Heaven grant it. We are that\npressed for land. Well, and how are things now?\n\nTRAMP. Now? I am off to Moscow. I shall go to an exploiter of labour.\nCan\'t be helped; I shall humble myself and say--give me what work you\nwill, only take me.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Well, have some more tea.\n\nTRAMP. Thank you; _merci_ I mean.\n\n    Noise and talk in the passage outside.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Here\'s Michael, just in time for tea.\n\nMARTHA [rises] Oh, my goodness, Ign\xc3\xa1t is with him! That means he\'s\ndrunk.\n\n    Michael and Ign\xc3\xa1t stagger in.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. How are you all? [Crosses himself before the icon] Here we are,\ndamn you, just in time for tea. We went to church, service was done; we\nwent to dine, all eaten and gone; to the pub, we went in, just time to\nbegin. Ha, ha, ha! You give us some tea and we\'ll give you some v\xc3\xb3dka.\nThat\'s fair. [Laughs].\n\nMICHAEL. Where has this swell come from? [Points to Tramp. Takes a\nbottle from the bosom of his coat and puts it on the table] Bring some\ncups.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Well, did you get on all right?\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. Nothing could be better, damn you; drank, and had a spree, and\nhave brought some home.\n\nMICHAEL [fills the cups with v\xc3\xb3dka, hands one to his mother and then one\nto the Tramp] Drink, you too!\n\nTRAMP [taking cup] I offer most heartfelt thanks. Your health. [Empties\nthe cup].\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. Fine fellow, how he swills, damn him! I should think hunger makes\nit run through all his veins. [Pours out some more].\n\nTRAMP [drinks] I wish you success in all your undertakings.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Well, did you get a good price for the hay?\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. Good or bad, we\'ve drunk it all, damn you! Am I right, Michael?\n\nMICHAEL. Why, of course. It\'s not made to be looked at! One must have\nsome fun once in a hundred years.\n\nMARTHA. What are you swaggering for? There\'s not much good in that.\nWe\'ve nothing to eat at home, and see what you\'re doing.\n\nMICHAEL [threateningly] Martha!\n\nMARTHA. Well, what of Martha? I know I\'m Martha. Oh, it makes me sick to\nlook at you.\n\nMICHAEL. Martha, look!\n\nMARTHA. There\'s nothing to see. I don\'t want to look.\n\nMICHAEL. Pour out the v\xc3\xb3dka and serve it round to our visitors.\n\nMARTHA. Faugh, you bleary-eyed hound. I don\'t want to speak to you.\n\nMICHAEL. You don\'t? Ah, you baggage, what did you say?\n\nMARTHA [rocks cradle. Par\xc3\xa1shka is frightened and comes to her] What I\nsaid? I said I do not want to talk to you, that\'s all.\n\nMICHAEL. Have you forgotten? [Jumps up from the table, strikes her on\nthe head and knocks off her kerchief] One!\n\nMARTHA. Oh! Oh! Oh! [Runs crying to the door].\n\nMICHAEL. You\'ll not get away, you jade! [Rushes at her].\n\nTRAMP [jumps up from the table and seizes his arm] You have no kind of\ncomplete right.\n\nMICHAEL [stops and looks at Tramp with surprise] Is it long since you\nhad a thrashing?\n\nTRAMP. You have no complete right to subject the female sex to insults.\n\nMICHAEL. Oh, you son of a bitch! Do you see this? [Shows his fist].\n\nTRAMP. I will not allow exploitations to be performed on the female sex.\n\nMICHAEL. I\'ll give you such an extolpation that you\'ll not know which\nend you stand on....\n\nTRAMP. Go on, strike away! Why don\'t you? [Holds out his face].\n\nMICHAEL [shrugs his shoulders and spreads out his arms] Suppose I really\ngo for you?\n\nTRAMP. I tell you, strike!\n\nMICHAEL. Well, you are a rum chap, now I come to look at you. [Drops his\narms and shakes his head].\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T [to Tramp] One sees at once that you\'re pretty sweet on the women,\ndamn you!\n\nTRAMP. I stand up for their rights.\n\nMICHAEL [to Martha as, breathing heavily, he steps to the table] Well\nMartha, you must set a big candle before the saints for his sake. But\nfor him, I\'d have beaten you to a jelly.\n\nMARTHA. What else can one expect of you. One worries all one\'s life,\nbaking and cooking; and as soon as\xc2\xa0...\n\nMICHAEL. Now, have done, have done! [Offers v\xc3\xb3dka to the Tramp] Drink.\n[To his wife] And what are you slobbering for? Mayn\'t a fellow have his\njoke? There you are [gives her money], put it away. Here are two\nthree-rouble notes and two twenty-copeck pieces.\n\nMARTHA. And the tea and sugar I wanted?\n\nMICHAEL [takes parcel from his pocket and hands it to his wife. Martha\ntakes the money and the parcel and goes into the little room, silently\narranging the kerchief on her head] What an unreasonable lot these women\nare. [He again offers v\xc3\xb3dka to the Tramp] There, drink.\n\nTRAMP [declining it] Drink it yourself.\n\nMICHAEL. Come now, don\'t fuss.\n\nTRAMP [drinking] Success to you.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T [to Tramp] You must have seen many a strange sight, I suppose.\nOh, what a fine coat you\'ve got! Latest fashion. Where did you get it\nfrom? [pointing to Tramp\'s tattered jacket]. Don\'t you mend it, it\'s\nfine as it is! It\'s getting on in years, I fancy. Well, it can\'t be\nhelped. If I had one like it, the women would be sweet on me too! [To\nMartha] Ain\'t that true?\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. You should not, Ign\xc3\xa1t Iv\xc3\xa1nych. Before seeing anything of him,\nwhy go and hold up a man to laughter?\n\nTRAMP. It comes of his uneducatedness.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. I\'m doing it friendly-like. Drink [offers v\xc3\xb3dka].\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. He says himself--it\'s the cause of all evil--and he\'s been in\nprison because of it.\n\nMICHAEL. What were you in prison for?\n\nTRAMP [very drunk] I\'ve suffered for expropriation.\n\nMICHAEL. What\'s that?\n\nTRAMP. Why, this way. Came up to a fat paunch: "Give up your money, else\nhere\'s a levolver."[4] He tries this way and that, but forks out 2,300\nroubles.\n\n  [4] As usual he mispronounces his word and calls a "revolver" "a\n  levolver."\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Oh Lord!\n\nTRAMP. We meant to dispose of it the proper way. Zembrik\xc3\xb3f was our\nleader. Then those ravens swooped down on us. At once under arrest, and\ninto prison.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. And took the money away?\n\nTRAMP. Of course. Only they could not convict me. At the trial the\nprocurator said these words to me: "You\'ve stolen money" says he; and I\nanswer him straight: "Thieves steal, but we have performed an\nexpropriation for our Party." And he didn\'t know what to say. He tried\nthis way and that, but couldn\'t answer me. "Lead him," says he, "to\nprison," that is--to the incarceration of free life.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. Clever dog! A regular brick! [Offering v\xc3\xb3dka] Drink, damn you.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Fie, how nastily you speak!\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. I, Grannie? I don\'t mean it for abuse; it\'s a manner of speech of\nmine. Damn you, damn you!... Your good health, Grannie.\n\nMARTHA [returns and stands at the table pouring out tea].\n\nMICHAEL. That\'s right. Fancy taking offence! I say, it\'s thanks to him.\n[To Tramp] What do you think? [Embraces Martha] I cherish my old woman.\nSee, how I cherish her. In a word, my old woman is first-rate. I would\nnot change her for anybody.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. There, that\'s good. Grannie, drink! I stand treat.\n\nTRAMP. What it means--the power of enershy! One was in a state of\nmelancholy, and now there\'s nothing but pleasantness and friendly\ndisposition. Grannie, I feel much love for you and for everybody.\nBrothers dear [sings revolutionary song].\n\nMICHAEL. It has got right hold of him in his hunger.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n    Same hut. Morning\n\n    Martha and Akul\xc3\xadna. Michael is asleep\n\n\nMARTHA [takes hatchet] I must go and chop some firewood.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [with a pail] He\'d have beaten you black and blue yesterday, had\nit not been for that fellow. I don\'t see him. Has he gone? I suppose he\nhas. [Exit one after the other].\n\nMICHAEL [climbs down from the top of the oven] Just look, the sun\'s\nalready quite high. [Puts on his boots] She must have gone to fetch\nwater with mother. How my head aches! I won\'t do it again; the devil\ntake it! [Crosses himself before the icon, prays, and then washes his\nhands and face] I\'ll go and harness.\n\n    Enter Martha with firewood.\n\nMARTHA. And yesterday\'s beggar? Has he gone?\n\nMICHAEL. Must have gone. Can\'t see him.\n\nMARTHA. Oh well, let him go. He seemed a clever chap though.\n\nMICHAEL. He took your part!\n\nMARTHA. What of that!\n\n    Michael puts on his coat.\n\nMARTHA. And the tea and sugar? Did you put them away last night, eh?\n\nMICHAEL. I thought you did.\n\n    Enter Akul\xc3\xadna with a pail of water.\n\nMARTHA [to Akul\xc3\xadna] Mother, have you taken the parcel?\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. No, I know nothing about it. I haven\'t seen it.\n\nMARTHA. Last night, I put it on the window-sill.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Yes, I saw it there.\n\nMARTHA. Where can it be? [They look for it].\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Dear me, what a shame!\n\n    Enter Neighbour.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Well Michael Tikh\xc3\xb3nych, are we to go for the wood?\n\nMICHAEL. Yes, of course. I\'m just going to harness; but you see we\'ve\nlost something.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Dear me! What is it?\n\nMARTHA. Why, you see, my old man brought a parcel from town yesterday,\nwith tea and sugar in it, and I put it down here on the window-sill and\ndidn\'t remember to put it away; and now it\'s gone.\n\nMICHAEL. And we\'re committing the sin of suspecting a tramp who spent\nthe night here.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. What sort of tramp?\n\nMARTHA. Well, he\'s rather thin and has no beard.\n\nMICHAEL. His coat\'s all in rags.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Curly hair and rather hooked nose?\n\nMICHAEL. Yes, yes!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. I\'ve just met him, and wondered why he was stepping out so\nfast.\n\nMICHAEL. It must be him. Where was he?\n\nNEIGHBOUR. I don\'t think he can have crossed the bridge yet.\n\nMICHAEL [snatches up his cap and goes out quickly, followed by the\nNeighbour] I\'ll catch the knave. It\'s him.\n\nMARTHA. Oh, what a shame, what a shame! It\'s surely him.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. And suppose it\'s not. It happened once, some twenty years ago,\nthat they accused a man of having stolen a horse. A crowd collected. One\nsays: "I myself saw him catching it." Another says he saw him leading\nit. It was a big piebald horse, easily noticed. All the people began\nsearching for it, and in the forest they found the lad. "It\'s you," they\nsay. He protests and swears it was not him. They say: "What\'s the good\nof listening to him; the women said quite certainly it\'s him." Then he\nsaid something rude. George Lap\xc3\xbashkin (he\'s dead now) was a hot-tempered\nman. He dashed at him slap bang, and struck him on the mouth. "It was\nyou," said he, and hit out at him. Then all the others fell on him and\nbegan beating him with sticks and fists till they killed him. And what\ndo you think!.... Next day the real thief was found. The lad they killed\nhad only gone into the forest to choose a tree to cut down.\n\nMARTHA. Yes, of course, we may be sinning against him. He has come down\nvery low, but seemed a good fellow.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Yes, he has sunk very low. One can\'t expect much from the likes\nof him.\n\nMARTHA. They\'re shouting. I expect they\'re bringing him back.\n\n    Enter Michael, Neighbour, an old man and a lad, pushing the Tramp\n    before them.\n\nMICHAEL [with the parcel in his hands, excitedly to his wife] It was\nfound on him. [To Tramp] You thief! You dog!\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [to Martha] It\'s him, poor soul. See how he hangs his head.\n\nMARTHA. It seems it was himself he spoke about yesterday that grabs\nanything that\'s handy when he\'s had some drink.\n\nTRAMP. I\'m not a thief; I\'m an expropriator. I am a worker and must\nlive. You can\'t understand it. Do what you like with me.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Take him to the village Elder or straight to the police!\n\nTRAMP. I tell you, do whatever you like. I am not afraid, and am ready\nto suffer for my convictions. If you were educated you would understand.\n\nMARTHA [to her husband] Suppose we let him go, in God\'s name. We\'ve got\nthe parcel back. Let him go and let\'s not commit another sin.\n\nMICHAEL [repeating] "Another sin!" Taken to teaching? One wouldn\'t know\nwhat to do without you, eh?\n\nMARTHA. Why not let him go?\n\nMICHAEL. "Let him go!" One knows what to do without you, you fool. "Let\nhim go!" Go he may, but he must hear a word or two so that he should\nfeel. [To Tramp] Well then, listen, you sir, to what I have to say to\nyou. Though you are in a very low state, still you have done very\nwrong--very wrong. Another man would have caved your ribs in, and have\ntaken you to the police; but I will only say this. You\'ve done wrong, as\nwrong as may be; only you are in a very bad way and I don\'t want to hurt\nyou. [Pauses. Everyone is silent. Then he continues solemnly] Go, and\nGod be with you, and do not do it again. [Looks at his wife] And you\nwant to teach me!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. You shouldn\'t, Michael; oh, you should not. You\'re\nencouraging that sort of thing.\n\nMICHAEL [the parcel still in his hand] Whether I should or not is my\nbusiness. [To his wife] And you tried to teach me! [Stops, looks at the\nparcel, then at his wife, and gives it to the Tramp with decision] Take\nit, you can drink it on the way. [To wife] And you wanted to teach me!\n[To Tramp] Go, you\'ve been told to go. Then go, and no palavering.\n\nTRAMP [takes parcel. Silence] You think I don\'t understand. [His voice\ntrembles] I fully understand. Had you beaten me like a dog, it would\nhave felt less hard. Don\'t I understand what I am? I am a rascal, a\ndegenerate, I mean. Forgive me for the Lord\'s sake. [Sobs, throws the\nparcel on the table, and goes out hurriedly].\n\nMARTHA. A good thing he didn\'t take the tea, or we should have had none\nto drink.\n\nMICHAEL [to wife] And you wanted to teach me!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. How he cried, poor soul.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. He too was a man.\n\n[ Transcriber\'s Note:\n\n  The following is a list of corrections made to the original.

An old woman of seventy, brisk, dignified, old-fashioned.\n\nMICHAEL. Her son, thirty-five years old, passionate, self-satisfied,\nvain and strong.\n\nMARTHA. Her daughter-in-law, a grumbler, speaks much and rapidly.\n\nPAR\xc3\x81SHKA. Ten years old, daughter of Martha and Michael.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. The village elder\'s assistant, speaks slowly and gives himself\nairs.\n\nA TRAMP. Forty years old, restless, thin, speaks impressively; when\ndrunk is particularly free and easy.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. Forty years old, a buffoon, merry and stupid.\n\n\n\n\n                           THE CAUSE OF IT ALL\n\n\n\n\nACT I\n\n    Autumn. A peasant\'s hut, with a small room partitioned off. Akul\xc3\xadna\n    sits spinning; Martha the housewife is kneading bread; little\n    Par\xc3\xa1shka is rocking a cradle.\n\n\nMARTHA. Oh dear, my heart feels heavy! I know it means trouble; there\'s\nnothing to keep him there. It will again be like the other day, when he\nwent to town to sell the firewood and drank nearly half of it. And he\nblames me for everything.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Why look for trouble? It is still early, and the town is a long\nway off. For the present\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARTHA. What do you mean by early? Ak\xc3\xadmych is back already. He started\nafter Michael but Michael\'s not back yet! It\'s worry worry all day long;\nthat\'s all the pleasure one gets.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Ak\xc3\xadmych took his load straight to a customer; but our man took\nhis to sell at the market.\n\nMARTHA. If he were alone I shouldn\'t worry, but Ign\xc3\xa1t is with him; and\nwhen he\'s with that lousy hound (God forgive me!), he\'s sure to get\ndrunk. Early and late one toils and moils. Everything is on our\nshoulders! If one only got anything by it! But no! hustling about all\nday long is all the pleasure one gets.\n\n    Door opens and Tar\xc3\xa1s enters with a ragged Tramp.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Good day to you! I\'ve brought a man who wants a night\'s\nlodging.[1]\n\n  [1] It is customary for the village authorities to quarter tramps on\n  each peasant household in a village in turn, or in such order as\n  appears convenient.\n\nTRAMP [bows] My respects to you.\n\nMARTHA. Why do you bring them to us so often? We put up a tramp last\nWednesday night; you always bring them to us. You should make Stepan\xc3\xadda\nput them up; there are no children there. It\'s more than I can do to\nlook after my own family, and you always bring these people to us.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Everyone in turn has to put them up.\n\nMARTHA. It\'s all very well to say "everyone in turn," but I have\nchildren, and besides, the master is not at home to-day.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Never mind, let the fellow sleep here to-night; he\'ll not wear\nout the place he lies on.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [to Tramp] Come in and sit down, and be our guest.\n\nTRAMP. I tender my gratitude. I should like a bite of something, if\npossible.\n\nMARTHA. You haven\'t had time to look round, and want to eat already.\nDidn\'t you beg anything in the village?\n\nTRAMP [sighs] I\'m not in the habit of begging because of my position,\nand having no producks of my own\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Akul\xc3\xadna rises, goes to the table, takes a loaf of bread, cuts a\n    slice, and gives it to the Tramp.\n\nTRAMP [taking the bread] Merci.[2] [Sits down on the bench and eats\ngreedily].\n\n  [2] The tramp, who has had some acquaintance with educated\n  Revolutionaries, tries to introduce foreign words, or words not\n  generally used by workmen, into his talk. In this instance he used the\n  French word _merci_ instead of the plain "thank you."\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. And where is Michael?\n\nMARTHA. Why, he took hay to the town. It\'s time he was back, but he\'s\nnot here. Something must have happened.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Why, what should happen?\n\nMARTHA. What indeed? Not anything good; it\'s only bad one has to expect.\nAs soon as he\'s out of the house he forgets all about us! I expect he\'ll\ncome back tipsy!\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [sitting down to spin, points at Martha and says to Tar\xc3\xa1s] It\'s\nnot in her to be quiet. As I always say, we women must find something to\ngrumble about.\n\nMARTHA. If he were alone I should not be afraid, but he went with Ign\xc3\xa1t.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S [smiling] Ah well, Ign\xc3\xa1t Iv\xc3\xa1novich certainly is fond of a drop of\nv\xc3\xb3dka.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Doesn\'t he know what Ign\xc3\xa1t is like! Ign\xc3\xa1t is one man, and our\nMichael\'s another.\n\nMARTHA. It\'s all very well for you to talk, mother; but I\'m sick of his\ndrinking. While he is sober it would be a sin to complain of him, but\nwhen he\'s drunk, you know what he is like. One can\'t say a word;\neverything is wrong.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Yes, but look at you women too; a man has a drink. Well, he\nswaggers about a bit, and sleeps it off, and everything goes on all\nright; but then the likes of you keep on nagging at him.\n\nMARTHA. When he\'s drunk there\'s no pleasing him, do what you will.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. But you should understand that we can\'t help having a drop now\nand then. Your woman\'s business is at home, but the likes of us must\nhave a drop when we\'re on business, or for company\'s sake. Well, so one\ndrinks, and where is the harm?\n\nMARTHA. You may talk, but it\'s hard on us women. Oh, how hard it is! If\none harnessed you men to our work just for a week, you would sing a\ndifferent tune. Kneading, cooking, baking, spinning, weaving, and the\ncattle to look after, and all the rest of it, and the brats to keep\nwashed and clothed and fed; it\'s all on our shoulders, and if anything\nis the least bit not to his fancy, there you are, especially when he\'s\ndrunk. Oh dear, what a life ours is!\n\nTRAMP [chewing] That\'s quite correct. It\'s the cause of it all; I mean\nall the catastrophes of life proceed from alcoholic liquors.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. It seems to have bowled you over too!\n\nTRAMP. No, not exactly that, though I have suffered from that too. The\ncareer of my life might have been different but for the drink.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. Now, to my thinking, if you drink reasonably, there\'s no manner\nof harm in it.\n\nTRAMP. But I say that it is so strong that it may completely ruin a man.\n\nMARTHA. That\'s what I say: you worry and do your best, and the only\ncomfort you get is to be scolded and beaten like a dog.\n\nTRAMP. And that\'s not all. There are some people, persons I mean, that\nare quite deprived of their reason through it and commit entirely\ninappropriate actions. While he does not drink, give him anything you\nlike and he won\'t take what is not his; but when drunk, he grabs\nwhatever comes handy. Many a time one gets beaten and put in prison. As\nlong as I don\'t drink, all goes honestly and honourably, but as soon as\nI drink, I mean as soon as that same person drinks, he at once begins\ngrabbing whatever comes his way.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. And I think it\'s all in oneself.\n\nTRAMP. Of course it\'s in oneself as long as one is well, but this is a\nkind of disease.\n\nTAR\xc3\x81S. A nice kind of disease. A good hiding would soon cure that\ndisease. Well, goodbye for the present. [Exit].\n\nMARTHA [wipes her hands and turns to go].\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [sees that the Tramp has finished his bread] Martha, I say,\nMartha! Cut him another piece.\n\nMARTHA. Bother him, I must get the samov\xc3\xa1r to boil. [Exit].\n\n    Akul\xc3\xadna rises, goes to the table, cuts a chunk of bread and gives it\n    to the Tramp.\n\nTRAMP. _Merci_, I have acquired a great appetite.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Are you a workman?\n\nTRAMP. Who? I? I was a mechanic.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. And what wages did you get?\n\nTRAMP. I used to get fifty, and even seventy roubles, a month.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. That\'s a good lot! Then how have you come down so low?\n\nTRAMP. Come down! I\'m not the only one. I\'ve come down because the times\nare such that it is impossible for an honest man to live.\n\nMARTHA [brings in the samov\xc3\xa1r] Oh Lord! it\'s certain sure he\'ll come\nhome drunk. I feel it in my heart.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. I\'m afraid he must really have gone on the spree.\n\nMARTHA. There it is. One struggles and struggles and kneads and bakes\nand cooks and spins and weaves and tends the cattle; everything on one\'s\nown shoulders. [The baby in the cradle cries] Par\xc3\xa1shka, rock the boy. Oh\ndear, what a life it is for us women. And when he is drunk, nothing is\nright!... If one only says a word he doesn\'t like\xc2\xa0...\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [making the tea] And this is the last of the tea. Did you tell\nhim to get some?\n\nMARTHA. Of course. He said he would, but he\'ll have forgotten all about\nhis home!... [She puts the samov\xc3\xa1r on the table].\n\n    The Tramp moves away.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Why do you leave the table? We are going to drink tea.\n\nTRAMP. I tender my gratitude for the hearty hospitality. [Throws away\nthe cheap cigar[3] he was smoking and comes to the table].\n\n  [3] The "cigar" will have probably consisted of some bad tobacco\n  rolled up in a bit of newspaper.\n\nMARTHA. And what sort do you belong to? Peasants, or some other?\n\nTRAMP. Well, I\'m not of the peasant class, nor of the aristocracy. I\'m\nof the double-edged class.\n\nMARTHA. What\'s that? [hands him a cup of tea].\n\nTRAMP. _Merci._ Why this; that my father was a Polish Count, and besides\nhim I had many others; and I also had two mothers. In general my\nbiography presents many difficulties.\n\nMARTHA. Have another cup? Well, did you get any learning?\n\nTRAMP. My learning has also been very uncircumstantial. Not my mother,\nbut my godmother apprenticed me to a blacksmith. That blacksmith was my\nfirst perdagogue; and his perdagogy consisted in this--that he did not\nbeat his anvil as often as he beat my unfortunate head. Nevertheless,\nhowever much he hit me, he could not deprive me of talent. Then I went\nto a locksmith\'s, and there I was appreciated, and became foreman. I\nmade acquaintance with educated people, and belonged to a political\nfaction. I was able to master intellectual literature; and my life might\nhave been elevated for I possessed immense talent.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Of course.\n\nTRAMP. But here came an upset. The despotic yoke oppressing the life of\nthe people! I got into prison; I mean, I suffered the incarceration of\nfreedom.\n\nMARTHA. What for?\n\nTRAMP. For our rights.\n\nMARTHA. What rights?\n\nTRAMP. What rights? Why the rights that the bourgeois should not feast\ncontinually, and that the labouring proletariat might reap the rewards\nof labour.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. And get back the land, I suppose?\n\nTRAMP. Well naturally. The Agromoric question too.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. May God and the Holy Queen of Heaven grant it. We are that\npressed for land. Well, and how are things now?\n\nTRAMP. Now? I am off to Moscow. I shall go to an exploiter of labour.\nCan\'t be helped; I shall humble myself and say--give me what work you\nwill, only take me.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Well, have some more tea.\n\nTRAMP. Thank you; _merci_ I mean.\n\n    Noise and talk in the passage outside.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Here\'s Michael, just in time for tea.\n\nMARTHA [rises] Oh, my goodness, Ign\xc3\xa1t is with him! That means he\'s\ndrunk.\n\n    Michael and Ign\xc3\xa1t stagger in.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. How are you all? [Crosses himself before the icon] Here we are,\ndamn you, just in time for tea. We went to church, service was done; we\nwent to dine, all eaten and gone; to the pub, we went in, just time to\nbegin. Ha, ha, ha! You give us some tea and we\'ll give you some v\xc3\xb3dka.\nThat\'s fair. [Laughs].\n\nMICHAEL. Where has this swell come from? [Points to Tramp. Takes a\nbottle from the bosom of his coat and puts it on the table] Bring some\ncups.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Well, did you get on all right?\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. Nothing could be better, damn you; drank, and had a spree, and\nhave brought some home.\n\nMICHAEL [fills the cups with v\xc3\xb3dka, hands one to his mother and then one\nto the Tramp] Drink, you too!\n\nTRAMP [taking cup] I offer most heartfelt thanks. Your health. [Empties\nthe cup].\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. Fine fellow, how he swills, damn him! I should think hunger makes\nit run through all his veins. [Pours out some more].\n\nTRAMP [drinks] I wish you success in all your undertakings.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Well, did you get a good price for the hay?\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. Good or bad, we\'ve drunk it all, damn you! Am I right, Michael?\n\nMICHAEL. Why, of course. It\'s not made to be looked at! One must have\nsome fun once in a hundred years.\n\nMARTHA. What are you swaggering for? There\'s not much good in that.\nWe\'ve nothing to eat at home, and see what you\'re doing.\n\nMICHAEL [threateningly] Martha!\n\nMARTHA. Well, what of Martha? I know I\'m Martha. Oh, it makes me sick to\nlook at you.\n\nMICHAEL. Martha, look!\n\nMARTHA. There\'s nothing to see. I don\'t want to look.\n\nMICHAEL. Pour out the v\xc3\xb3dka and serve it round to our visitors.\n\nMARTHA. Faugh, you bleary-eyed hound. I don\'t want to speak to you.\n\nMICHAEL. You don\'t? Ah, you baggage, what did you say?\n\nMARTHA [rocks cradle. Par\xc3\xa1shka is frightened and comes to her] What I\nsaid? I said I do not want to talk to you, that\'s all.\n\nMICHAEL. Have you forgotten? [Jumps up from the table, strikes her on\nthe head and knocks off her kerchief] One!\n\nMARTHA. Oh! Oh! Oh! [Runs crying to the door].\n\nMICHAEL. You\'ll not get away, you jade! [Rushes at her].\n\nTRAMP [jumps up from the table and seizes his arm] You have no kind of\ncomplete right.\n\nMICHAEL [stops and looks at Tramp with surprise] Is it long since you\nhad a thrashing?\n\nTRAMP. You have no complete right to subject the female sex to insults.\n\nMICHAEL. Oh, you son of a bitch! Do you see this? [Shows his fist].\n\nTRAMP. I will not allow exploitations to be performed on the female sex.\n\nMICHAEL. I\'ll give you such an extolpation that you\'ll not know which\nend you stand on....\n\nTRAMP. Go on, strike away! Why don\'t you? [Holds out his face].\n\nMICHAEL [shrugs his shoulders and spreads out his arms] Suppose I really\ngo for you?\n\nTRAMP. I tell you, strike!\n\nMICHAEL. Well, you are a rum chap, now I come to look at you. [Drops his\narms and shakes his head].\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T [to Tramp] One sees at once that you\'re pretty sweet on the women,\ndamn you!\n\nTRAMP. I stand up for their rights.\n\nMICHAEL [to Martha as, breathing heavily, he steps to the table] Well\nMartha, you must set a big candle before the saints for his sake. But\nfor him, I\'d have beaten you to a jelly.\n\nMARTHA. What else can one expect of you. One worries all one\'s life,\nbaking and cooking; and as soon as\xc2\xa0...\n\nMICHAEL. Now, have done, have done! [Offers v\xc3\xb3dka to the Tramp] Drink.\n[To his wife] And what are you slobbering for? Mayn\'t a fellow have his\njoke? There you are [gives her money], put it away. Here are two\nthree-rouble notes and two twenty-copeck pieces.\n\nMARTHA. And the tea and sugar I wanted?\n\nMICHAEL [takes parcel from his pocket and hands it to his wife. Martha\ntakes the money and the parcel and goes into the little room, silently\narranging the kerchief on her head] What an unreasonable lot these women\nare. [He again offers v\xc3\xb3dka to the Tramp] There, drink.\n\nTRAMP [declining it] Drink it yourself.\n\nMICHAEL. Come now, don\'t fuss.\n\nTRAMP [drinking] Success to you.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T [to Tramp] You must have seen many a strange sight, I suppose.\nOh, what a fine coat you\'ve got! Latest fashion. Where did you get it\nfrom? [pointing to Tramp\'s tattered jacket]. Don\'t you mend it, it\'s\nfine as it is! It\'s getting on in years, I fancy. Well, it can\'t be\nhelped. If I had one like it, the women would be sweet on me too! [To\nMartha] Ain\'t that true?\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. You should not, Ign\xc3\xa1t Iv\xc3\xa1nych. Before seeing anything of him,\nwhy go and hold up a man to laughter?\n\nTRAMP. It comes of his uneducatedness.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. I\'m doing it friendly-like. Drink [offers v\xc3\xb3dka].\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. He says himself--it\'s the cause of all evil--and he\'s been in\nprison because of it.\n\nMICHAEL. What were you in prison for?\n\nTRAMP [very drunk] I\'ve suffered for expropriation.\n\nMICHAEL. What\'s that?\n\nTRAMP. Why, this way. Came up to a fat paunch: "Give up your money, else\nhere\'s a levolver."[4] He tries this way and that, but forks out 2,300\nroubles.\n\n  [4] As usual he mispronounces his word and calls a "revolver" "a\n  levolver."\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Oh Lord!\n\nTRAMP. We meant to dispose of it the proper way. Zembrik\xc3\xb3f was our\nleader. Then those ravens swooped down on us. At once under arrest, and\ninto prison.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. And took the money away?\n\nTRAMP. Of course. Only they could not convict me. At the trial the\nprocurator said these words to me: "You\'ve stolen money" says he; and I\nanswer him straight: "Thieves steal, but we have performed an\nexpropriation for our Party." And he didn\'t know what to say. He tried\nthis way and that, but couldn\'t answer me. "Lead him," says he, "to\nprison," that is--to the incarceration of free life.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. Clever dog! A regular brick! [Offering v\xc3\xb3dka] Drink, damn you.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Fie, how nastily you speak!\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. I, Grannie? I don\'t mean it for abuse; it\'s a manner of speech of\nmine. Damn you, damn you!... Your good health, Grannie.\n\nMARTHA [returns and stands at the table pouring out tea].\n\nMICHAEL. That\'s right. Fancy taking offence! I say, it\'s thanks to him.\n[To Tramp] What do you think? [Embraces Martha] I cherish my old woman.\nSee, how I cherish her. In a word, my old woman is first-rate. I would\nnot change her for anybody.\n\nIGN\xc3\x81T. There, that\'s good. Grannie, drink! I stand treat.\n\nTRAMP. What it means--the power of enershy! One was in a state of\nmelancholy, and now there\'s nothing but pleasantness and friendly\ndisposition. Grannie, I feel much love for you and for everybody.\nBrothers dear [sings revolutionary song].\n\nMICHAEL. It has got right hold of him in his hunger.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n    Same hut. Morning\n\n    Martha and Akul\xc3\xadna. Michael is asleep\n\n\nMARTHA [takes hatchet] I must go and chop some firewood.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [with a pail] He\'d have beaten you black and blue yesterday, had\nit not been for that fellow. I don\'t see him. Has he gone? I suppose he\nhas. [Exit one after the other].\n\nMICHAEL [climbs down from the top of the oven] Just look, the sun\'s\nalready quite high. [Puts on his boots] She must have gone to fetch\nwater with mother. How my head aches! I won\'t do it again; the devil\ntake it! [Crosses himself before the icon, prays, and then washes his\nhands and face] I\'ll go and harness.\n\n    Enter Martha with firewood.\n\nMARTHA. And yesterday\'s beggar? Has he gone?\n\nMICHAEL. Must have gone. Can\'t see him.\n\nMARTHA. Oh well, let him go. He seemed a clever chap though.\n\nMICHAEL. He took your part!\n\nMARTHA. What of that!\n\n    Michael puts on his coat.\n\nMARTHA. And the tea and sugar? Did you put them away last night, eh?\n\nMICHAEL. I thought you did.\n\n    Enter Akul\xc3\xadna with a pail of water.\n\nMARTHA [to Akul\xc3\xadna] Mother, have you taken the parcel?\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. No, I know nothing about it. I haven\'t seen it.\n\nMARTHA. Last night, I put it on the window-sill.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Yes, I saw it there.\n\nMARTHA. Where can it be? [They look for it].\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Dear me, what a shame!\n\n    Enter Neighbour.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Well Michael Tikh\xc3\xb3nych, are we to go for the wood?\n\nMICHAEL. Yes, of course. I\'m just going to harness; but you see we\'ve\nlost something.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Dear me! What is it?\n\nMARTHA. Why, you see, my old man brought a parcel from town yesterday,\nwith tea and sugar in it, and I put it down here on the window-sill and\ndidn\'t remember to put it away; and now it\'s gone.\n\nMICHAEL. And we\'re committing the sin of suspecting a tramp who spent\nthe night here.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. What sort of tramp?\n\nMARTHA. Well, he\'s rather thin and has no beard.\n\nMICHAEL. His coat\'s all in rags.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Curly hair and rather hooked nose?\n\nMICHAEL. Yes, yes!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. I\'ve just met him, and wondered why he was stepping out so\nfast.\n\nMICHAEL. It must be him. Where was he?\n\nNEIGHBOUR. I don\'t think he can have crossed the bridge yet.\n\nMICHAEL [snatches up his cap and goes out quickly, followed by the\nNeighbour] I\'ll catch the knave. It\'s him.\n\nMARTHA. Oh, what a shame, what a shame! It\'s surely him.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. And suppose it\'s not. It happened once, some twenty years ago,\nthat they accused a man of having stolen a horse. A crowd collected. One\nsays: "I myself saw him catching it." Another says he saw him leading\nit. It was a big piebald horse, easily noticed. All the people began\nsearching for it, and in the forest they found the lad. "It\'s you," they\nsay. He protests and swears it was not him. They say: "What\'s the good\nof listening to him; the women said quite certainly it\'s him." Then he\nsaid something rude. George Lap\xc3\xbashkin (he\'s dead now) was a hot-tempered\nman. He dashed at him slap bang, and struck him on the mouth. "It was\nyou," said he, and hit out at him. Then all the others fell on him and\nbegan beating him with sticks and fists till they killed him. And what\ndo you think!.... Next day the real thief was found. The lad they killed\nhad only gone into the forest to choose a tree to cut down.\n\nMARTHA. Yes, of course, we may be sinning against him. He has come down\nvery low, but seemed a good fellow.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. Yes, he has sunk very low. One can\'t expect much from the likes\nof him.\n\nMARTHA. They\'re shouting. I expect they\'re bringing him back.\n\n    Enter Michael, Neighbour, an old man and a lad, pushing the Tramp\n    before them.\n\nMICHAEL [with the parcel in his hands, excitedly to his wife] It was\nfound on him. [To Tramp] You thief! You dog!\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA [to Martha] It\'s him, poor soul. See how he hangs his head.\n\nMARTHA. It seems it was himself he spoke about yesterday that grabs\nanything that\'s handy when he\'s had some drink.\n\nTRAMP. I\'m not a thief; I\'m an expropriator. I am a worker and must\nlive. You can\'t understand it. Do what you like with me.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Take him to the village Elder or straight to the police!\n\nTRAMP. I tell you, do whatever you like. I am not afraid, and am ready\nto suffer for my convictions. If you were educated you would understand.\n\nMARTHA [to her husband] Suppose we let him go, in God\'s name. We\'ve got\nthe parcel back. Let him go and let\'s not commit another sin.\n\nMICHAEL [repeating] "Another sin!" Taken to teaching? One wouldn\'t know\nwhat to do without you, eh?\n\nMARTHA. Why not let him go?\n\nMICHAEL. "Let him go!" One knows what to do without you, you fool. "Let\nhim go!" Go he may, but he must hear a word or two so that he should\nfeel. [To Tramp] Well then, listen, you sir, to what I have to say to\nyou. Though you are in a very low state, still you have done very\nwrong--very wrong. Another man would have caved your ribs in, and have\ntaken you to the police; but I will only say this. You\'ve done wrong, as\nwrong as may be; only you are in a very bad way and I don\'t want to hurt\nyou. [Pauses. Everyone is silent. Then he continues solemnly] Go, and\nGod be with you, and do not do it again. [Looks at his wife] And you\nwant to teach me!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. You shouldn\'t, Michael; oh, you should not. You\'re\nencouraging that sort of thing.\n\nMICHAEL [the parcel still in his hand] Whether I should or not is my\nbusiness. [To his wife] And you tried to teach me! [Stops, looks at the\nparcel, then at his wife, and gives it to the Tramp with decision] Take\nit, you can drink it on the way. [To wife] And you wanted to teach me!\n[To Tramp] Go, you\'ve been told to go. Then go, and no palavering.\n\nTRAMP [takes parcel. Silence] You think I don\'t understand. [His voice\ntrembles] I fully understand. Had you beaten me like a dog, it would\nhave felt less hard. Don\'t I understand what I am? I am a rascal, a\ndegenerate, I mean. Forgive me for the Lord\'s sake. [Sobs, throws the\nparcel on the table, and goes out hurriedly].\n\nMARTHA. A good thing he didn\'t take the tea, or we should have had none\nto drink.\n\nMICHAEL [to wife] And you wanted to teach me!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. How he cried, poor soul.\n\nAKUL\xc3\x8dNA. He too was a man.\n\n[ Transcriber\'s Note:\n\n  The following is a list of corrections made to the original.
