b'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMASTER AND MAN\n\nBy Leo Tolstoy\n\n\nTranslated by Louise and Aylmer Maude\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nIt happened in the \'seventies in winter, on the day after St. Nicholas\'s\nDay. There was a fete in the parish and the innkeeper, Vasili Andreevich\nBrekhunov, a Second Guild merchant, being a church elder had to go to\nchurch, and had also to entertain his relatives and friends at home.\n\nBut when the last of them had gone he at once began to prepare to drive\nover to see a neighbouring proprietor about a grove which he had been\nbargaining over for a long time. He was now in a hurry to start,\nlest buyers from the town might forestall him in making a profitable\npurchase.\n\nThe youthful landowner was asking ten thousand rubles for the grove\nsimply because Vasili Andreevich was offering seven thousand. Seven\nthousand was, however, only a third of its real value. Vasili Andreevich\nmight perhaps have got it down to his own price, for the woods were in\nhis district and he had a long-standing agreement with the other village\ndealers that no one should run up the price in another\'s district, but\nhe had now learnt that some timber-dealers from town meant to bid for\nthe Goryachkin grove, and he resolved to go at once and get the matter\nsettled. So as soon as the feast was over, he took seven hundred rubles\nfrom his strong box, added to them two thousand three hundred rubles of\nchurch money he had in his keeping, so as to make up the sum to three\nthousand; carefully counted the notes, and having put them into his\npocket-book made haste to start.\n\nNikita, the only one of Vasili Andreevich\'s labourers who was not drunk\nthat day, ran to harness the horse. Nikita, though an habitual drunkard,\nwas not drunk that day because since the last day before the fast, when\nhe had drunk his coat and leather boots, he had sworn off drink and\nhad kept his vow for two months, and was still keeping it despite the\ntemptation of the vodka that had been drunk everywhere during the first\ntwo days of the feast.\n\nNikita was a peasant of about fifty from a neighbouring village, \'not\na manager\' as the peasants said of him, meaning that he was not the\nthrifty head of a household but lived most of his time away from home\nas a labourer. He was valued everywhere for his industry, dexterity, and\nstrength at work, and still more for his kindly and pleasant temper. But\nhe never settled down anywhere for long because about twice a year, or\neven oftener, he had a drinking bout, and then besides spending all his\nclothes on drink he became turbulent and quarrelsome. Vasili Andreevich\nhimself had turned him away several times, but had afterwards taken him\nback again--valuing his honesty, his kindness to animals, and especially\nhis cheapness. Vasili Andreevich did not pay Nikita the eighty rubles\na year such a man was worth, but only about forty, which he gave him\nhaphazard, in small sums, and even that mostly not in cash but in goods\nfrom his own shop and at high prices.\n\nNikita\'s wife Martha, who had once been a handsome vigorous woman,\nmanaged the homestead with the help of her son and two daughters, and\ndid not urge Nikita to live at home: first because she had been living\nfor some twenty years already with a cooper, a peasant from another\nvillage who lodged in their house; and secondly because though she\nmanaged her husband as she pleased when he was sober, she feared him\nlike fire when he was drunk. Once when he had got drunk at home, Nikita,\nprobably to make up for his submissiveness when sober, broke open her\nbox, took out her best clothes, snatched up an axe, and chopped all her\nundergarments and dresses to bits. All the wages Nikita earned went to\nhis wife, and he raised no objection to that. So now, two days before\nthe holiday, Martha had been twice to see Vasili Andreevich and had got\nfrom him wheat flour, tea, sugar, and a quart of vodka, the lot costing\nthree rubles, and also five rubles in cash, for which she thanked him as\nfor a special favour, though he owed Nikita at least twenty rubles.\n\n\'What agreement did we ever draw up with you?\' said Vasili Andreevich\nto Nikita. \'If you need anything, take it; you will work it off. I\'m not\nlike others to keep you waiting, and making up accounts and reckoning\nfines. We deal straight-forwardly. You serve me and I don\'t neglect\nyou.\'\n\nAnd when saying this Vasili Andreevich was honestly convinced that he\nwas Nikita\'s benefactor, and he knew how to put it so plausibly that\nall those who depended on him for their money, beginning with Nikita,\nconfirmed him in the conviction that he was their benefactor and did not\noverreach them.\n\n\'Yes, I understand, Vasili Andreevich. You know that I serve you and\ntake as much pains as I would for my own father. I understand very\nwell!\' Nikita would reply. He was quite aware that Vasili Andreevich was\ncheating him, but at the same time he felt that it was useless to try\nto clear up his accounts with him or explain his side of the matter, and\nthat as long as he had nowhere to go he must accept what he could get.\n\nNow, having heard his master\'s order to harness, he went as usual\ncheerfully and willingly to the shed, stepping briskly and easily on his\nrather turned-in feet; took down from a nail the heavy tasselled leather\nbridle, and jingling the rings of the bit went to the closed stable\nwhere the horse he was to harness was standing by himself.\n\n\'What, feeling lonely, feeling lonely, little silly?\' said Nikita in\nanswer to the low whinny with which he was greeted by the good-tempered,\nmedium-sized bay stallion, with a rather slanting crupper, who stood\nalone in the shed. \'Now then, now then, there\'s time enough. Let me\nwater you first,\' he went on, speaking to the horse just as to someone\nwho understood the words he was using, and having whisked the dusty,\ngrooved back of the well-fed young stallion with the skirt of his\ncoat, he put a bridle on his handsome head, straightened his ears and\nforelock, and having taken off his halter led him out to water.\n\nPicking his way out of the dung-strewn stable, Mukhorty frisked, and\nmaking play with his hind leg pretended that he meant to kick Nikita,\nwho was running at a trot beside him to the pump.\n\n\'Now then, now then, you rascal!\' Nikita called out, well knowing how\ncarefully Mukhorty threw out his hind leg just to touch his greasy\nsheepskin coat but not to strike him--a trick Nikita much appreciated.\n\nAfter a drink of the cold water the horse sighed, moving his strong wet\nlips, from the hairs of which transparent drops fell into the trough;\nthen standing still as if in thought, he suddenly gave a loud snort.\n\n\'If you don\'t want any more, you needn\'t. But don\'t go asking for any\nlater,\' said Nikita quite seriously and fully explaining his conduct to\nMukhorty. Then he ran back to the shed pulling the playful young horse,\nwho wanted to gambol all over the yard, by the rein.\n\nThere was no one else in the yard except a stranger, the cook\'s husband,\nwho had come for the holiday.\n\n\'Go and ask which sledge is to be harnessed--the wide one or the small\none--there\'s a good fellow!\'\n\nThe cook\'s husband went into the house, which stood on an iron\nfoundation and was iron-roofed, and soon returned saying that the little\none was to be harnessed. By that time Nikita had put the collar and\nbrass-studded belly-band on Mukhorty and, carrying a light, painted\nshaft-bow in one hand, was leading the horse with the other up to two\nsledges that stood in the shed.\n\n\'All right, let it be the little one!\' he said, backing the intelligent\nhorse, which all the time kept pretending to bite him, into the shafts,\nand with the aid of the cook\'s husband he proceeded to harness. When\neverything was nearly ready and only the reins had to be adjusted,\nNikita sent the other man to the shed for some straw and to the barn for\na drugget.\n\n\'There, that\'s all right! Now, now, don\'t bristle up!\' said Nikita,\npressing down into the sledge the freshly threshed oat straw the cook\'s\nhusband had brought. \'And now let\'s spread the sacking like this, and\nthe drugget over it. There, like that it will be comfortable sitting,\'\nhe went on, suiting the action to the words and tucking the drugget all\nround over the straw to make a seat.\n\n\'Thank you, dear man. Things always go quicker with two working at it!\'\nhe added. And gathering up the leather reins fastened together by a\nbrass ring, Nikita took the driver\'s seat and started the impatient\nhorse over the frozen manure which lay in the yard, towards the gate.\n\n\'Uncle Nikita! I say, Uncle, Uncle!\' a high-pitched voice shouted, and a\nseven-year-old boy in a black sheepskin coat, new white felt boots, and\na warm cap, ran hurriedly out of the house into the yard. \'Take me with\nyou!\' he cried, fastening up his coat as he ran.\n\n\'All right, come along, darling!\' said Nikita, and stopping the sledge\nhe picked up the master\'s pale thin little son, radiant with joy, and\ndrove out into the road.\n\nIt was past two o\'clock and the day was windy, dull, and cold, with more\nthan twenty degrees Fahrenheit of frost. Half the sky was hidden by a\nlowering dark cloud. In the yard it was quiet, but in the street the\nwind was felt more keenly. The snow swept down from a neighbouring shed\nand whirled about in the corner near the bath-house.\n\nHardly had Nikita driven out of the yard and turned the horse\'s head to\nthe house, before Vasili Andreevich emerged from the high porch in front\nof the house with a cigarette in his mouth and wearing a cloth-covered\nsheep-skin coat tightly girdled low at his waist, and stepped onto the\nhard-trodden snow which squeaked under the leather soles of his felt\nboots, and stopped. Taking a last whiff of his cigarette he threw it\ndown, stepped on it, and letting the smoke escape through his moustache\nand looking askance at the horse that was coming up, began to tuck\nin his sheepskin collar on both sides of his ruddy face, clean-shaven\nexcept for the moustache, so that his breath should not moisten the\ncollar.\n\n\'See now! The young scamp is there already!\' he exclaimed when he saw\nhis little son in the sledge. Vasili Andreevich was excited by the vodka\nhe had drunk with his visitors, and so he was even more pleased than\nusual with everything that was his and all that he did. The sight of\nhis son, whom he always thought of as his heir, now gave him great\nsatisfaction. He looked at him, screwing up his eyes and showing his\nlong teeth.\n\nHis wife--pregnant, thin and pale, with her head and shoulders wrapped\nin a shawl so that nothing of her face could be seen but her eyes--stood\nbehind him in the vestibule to see him off.\n\n\'Now really, you ought to take Nikita with you,\' she said timidly,\nstepping out from the doorway.\n\nVasili Andreevich did not answer. Her words evidently annoyed him and he\nfrowned angrily and spat.\n\n\'You have money on you,\' she continued in the same plaintive voice.\n\'What if the weather gets worse! Do take him, for goodness\' sake!\'\n\n\'Why? Don\'t I know the road that I must needs take a guide?\' exclaimed\nVasili Andreevich, uttering every word very distinctly and compressing\nhis lips unnaturally, as he usually did when speaking to buyers and\nsellers.\n\n\'Really you ought to take him. I beg you in God\'s name!\' his wife\nrepeated, wrapping her shawl more closely round her head.\n\n\'There, she sticks to it like a leech!... Where am I to take him?\'\n\n\'I\'m quite ready to go with you, Vasili Andreevich,\' said Nikita\ncheerfully. \'But they must feed the horses while I am away,\' he added,\nturning to his master\'s wife.\n\n\'I\'ll look after them, Nikita dear. I\'ll tell Simon,\' replied the\nmistress.\n\n\'Well, Vasili Andreevich, am I to come with you?\' said Nikita, awaiting\na decision.\n\n\'It seems I must humour my old woman. But if you\'re coming you\'d better\nput on a warmer cloak,\' said Vasili Andreevich, smiling again as he\nwinked at Nikita\'s short sheepskin coat, which was torn under the arms\nand at the back, was greasy and out of shape, frayed to a fringe round\nthe skirt, and had endured many things in its lifetime.\n\n\'Hey, dear man, come and hold the horse!\' shouted Nikita to the cook\'s\nhusband, who was still in the yard.\n\n\'No, I will myself, I will myself!\' shrieked the little boy, pulling his\nhands, red with cold, out of his pockets, and seizing the cold leather\nreins.\n\n\'Only don\'t be too long dressing yourself up. Look alive!\' shouted\nVasili Andreevich, grinning at Nikita.\n\n\'Only a moment, Father, Vasili Andreevich!\' replied Nikita, and running\nquickly with his inturned toes in his felt boots with their soles\npatched with felt, he hurried across the yard and into the workmen\'s\nhut.\n\n\'Arinushka! Get my coat down from the stove. I\'m going with the master,\'\nhe said, as he ran into the hut and took down his girdle from the nail\non which it hung.\n\nThe workmen\'s cook, who had had a sleep after dinner and was now getting\nthe samovar ready for her husband, turned cheerfully to Nikita, and\ninfected by his hurry began to move as quickly as he did, got down his\nmiserable worn-out cloth coat from the stove where it was drying, and\nbegan hurriedly shaking it out and smoothing it down.\n\n\'There now, you\'ll have a chance of a holiday with your good man,\' said\nNikita, who from kindhearted politeness always said something to anyone\nhe was alone with.\n\nThen, drawing his worn narrow girdle round him, he drew in his breath,\npulling in his lean stomach still more, and girdled himself as tightly\nas he could over his sheepskin.\n\n\'There now,\' he said addressing himself no longer to the cook but the\ngirdle, as he tucked the ends in at the waist, \'now you won\'t come\nundone!\' And working his shoulders up and down to free his arms, he put\nthe coat over his sheepskin, arched his back more strongly to ease his\narms, poked himself under the armpits, and took down his leather-covered\nmittens from the shelf. \'Now we\'re all right!\'\n\n\'You ought to wrap your feet up, Nikita. Your boots are very bad.\'\n\nNikita stopped as if he had suddenly realized this.\n\n\'Yes, I ought to.... But they\'ll do like this. It isn\'t far!\' and he\nran out into the yard.\n\n\'Won\'t you be cold, Nikita?\' said the mistress as he came up to the\nsledge.\n\n\'Cold? No, I\'m quite warm,\' answered Nikita as he pushed some straw\nup to the forepart of the sledge so that it should cover his feet, and\nstowed away the whip, which the good horse would not need, at the bottom\nof the sledge.\n\nVasili Andreevich, who was wearing two fur-lined coats one over the\nother, was already in the sledge, his broad back filling nearly its\nwhole rounded width, and taking the reins he immediately touched the\nhorse. Nikita jumped in just as the sledge started, and seated himself\nin front on the left side, with one leg hanging over the edge.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe good stallion took the sledge along at a brisk pace over the\nsmooth-frozen road through the village, the runners squeaking slightly\nas they went.\n\n\'Look at him hanging on there! Hand me the whip, Nikita!\' shouted Vasili\nAndreevich, evidently enjoying the sight of his \'heir,\' who standing on\nthe runners was hanging on at the back of the sledge. \'I\'ll give it you!\nBe off to mamma, you dog!\'\n\nThe boy jumped down. The horse increased his amble and, suddenly\nchanging foot, broke into a fast trot.\n\nThe Crosses, the village where Vasili Andreevich lived, consisted of six\nhouses. As soon as they had passed the blacksmith\'s hut, the last in\nthe village, they realized that the wind was much stronger than they\nhad thought. The road could hardly be seen. The tracks left by the\nsledge-runners were immediately covered by snow and the road was only\ndistinguished by the fact that it was higher than the rest of the\nground. There was a swirl of snow over the fields and the line where sky\nand earth met could not be seen. The Telyatin forest, usually clearly\nvisible, now only loomed up occasionally and dimly through the driving\nsnowy dust. The wind came from the left, insistently blowing over to\none side the mane on Mukhorty\'s sleek neck and carrying aside even his\nfluffy tail, which was tied in a simple knot. Nikita\'s wide coat-collar,\nas he sat on the windy side, pressed close to his cheek and nose.\n\n\'This road doesn\'t give him a chance--it\'s too snowy,\' said Vasili\nAndreevich, who prided himself on his good horse. \'I once drove to\nPashutino with him in half an hour.\'\n\n\'What?\' asked Nikita, who could not hear on account of his collar.\n\n\'I say I once went to Pashutino in half an hour,\' shouted Vasili\nAndreevich.\n\n\'It goes without saying that he\'s a good horse,\' replied Nikita.\n\nThey were silent for a while. But Vasili Andreevich wished to talk.\n\n\'Well, did you tell your wife not to give the cooper any vodka?\' he\nbegan in the same loud tone, quite convinced that Nikita must feel\nflattered to be talking with so clever and important a person as\nhimself, and he was so pleased with his jest that it did not enter his\nhead that the remark might be unpleasant to Nikita.\n\nThe wind again prevented Nikita\'s hearing his master\'s words.\n\nVasili Andreevich repeated the jest about the cooper in his loud, clear\nvoice.\n\n\'That\'s their business, Vasili Andreevich. I don\'t pry into their\naffairs. As long as she doesn\'t ill-treat our boy--God be with them.\'\n\n\'That\'s so,\' said Vasili Andreevich. \'Well, and will you be buying a\nhorse in spring?\' he went on, changing the subject.\n\n\'Yes, I can\'t avoid it,\' answered Nikita, turning down his collar and\nleaning back towards his master.\n\nThe conversation now became interesting to him and he did not wish to\nlose a word.\n\n\'The lad\'s growing up. He must begin to plough for himself, but till now\nwe\'ve always had to hire someone,\' he said.\n\n\'Well, why not have the lean-cruppered one. I won\'t charge much for it,\'\nshouted Vasili Andreevich, feeling animated, and consequently starting\non his favourite occupation--that of horse-dealing--which absorbed all\nhis mental powers.\n\n\'Or you might let me have fifteen rubles and I\'ll buy one at the\nhorse-market,\' said Nikita, who knew that the horse Vasili Andreevich\nwanted to sell him would be dear at seven rubles, but that if he took it\nfrom him it would be charged at twenty-five, and then he would be unable\nto draw any money for half a year.\n\n\'It\'s a good horse. I think of your interest as of my own--according to\nconscience. Brekhunov isn\'t a man to wrong anyone. Let the loss be mine.\nI\'m not like others. Honestly!\' he shouted in the voice in which he\nhypnotized his customers and dealers. \'It\'s a real good horse.\'\n\n\'Quite so!\' said Nikita with a sigh, and convinced that there was\nnothing more to listen to, he again released his collar, which\nimmediately covered his ear and face.\n\nThey drove on in silence for about half an hour. The wind blew sharply\nonto Nikita\'s side and arm where his sheepskin was torn.\n\nHe huddled up and breathed into the collar which covered his mouth, and\nwas not wholly cold.\n\n\'What do you think--shall we go through Karamyshevo or by the straight\nroad?\' asked Vasili Andreevich.\n\nThe road through Karamyshevo was more frequented and was well marked\nwith a double row of high stakes. The straight road was nearer but\nlittle used and had no stakes, or only poor ones covered with snow.\n\nNikita thought awhile.\n\n\'Though Karamyshevo is farther, it is better going,\' he said.\n\n\'But by the straight road, when once we get through the hollow by the\nforest, it\'s good going--sheltered,\' said Vasili Andreevich, who wished\nto go the nearest way.\n\n\'Just as you please,\' said Nikita, and again let go of his collar.\n\nVasili Andreevich did as he had said, and having gone about half a verst\ncame to a tall oak stake which had a few dry leaves still dangling on\nit, and there he turned to the left.\n\nOn turning they faced directly against the wind, and snow was beginning\nto fall. Vasili Andreevich, who was driving, inflated his cheeks,\nblowing the breath out through his moustache. Nikita dozed.\n\nSo they went on in silence for about ten minutes. Suddenly Vasili\nAndreevich began saying something.\n\n\'Eh, what?\' asked Nikita, opening his eyes.\n\nVasili Andreevich did not answer, but bent over, looking behind them and\nthen ahead of the horse. The sweat had curled Mukhorty\'s coat between\nhis legs and on his neck. He went at a walk.\n\n\'What is it?\' Nikita asked again.\n\n\'What is it? What is it?\' Vasili Andreevich mimicked him angrily. \'There\nare no stakes to be seen! We must have got off the road!\'\n\n\'Well, pull up then, and I\'ll look for it,\' said Nikita, and jumping\ndown lightly from the sledge and taking the whip from under the straw,\nhe went off to the left from his own side of the sledge.\n\nThe snow was not deep that year, so that it was possible to walk\nanywhere, but still in places it was knee-deep and got into Nikita\'s\nboots. He went about feeling the ground with his feet and the whip, but\ncould not find the road anywhere.\n\n\'Well, how is it?\' asked Vasili Andreevich when Nikita came back to the\nsledge.\n\n\'There is no road this side. I must go to the other side and try there,\'\nsaid Nikita.\n\n\'There\'s something there in front. Go and have a look.\'\n\nNikita went to what had appeared dark, but found that it was earth which\nthe wind had blown from the bare fields of winter oats and had strewn\nover the snow, colouring it. Having searched to the right also, he\nreturned to the sledge, brushed the snow from his coat, shook it out of\nhis boots, and seated himself once more.\n\n\'We must go to the right,\' he said decidedly. \'The wind was blowing on\nour left before, but now it is straight in my face. Drive to the right,\'\nhe repeated with decision.\n\nVasili Andreevich took his advice and turned to the right, but still\nthere was no road. They went on in that direction for some time. The\nwind was as fierce as ever and it was snowing lightly.\n\n\'It seems, Vasili Andreevich, that we have gone quite astray,\' Nikita\nsuddenly remarked, as if it were a pleasant thing. \'What is that?\' he\nadded, pointing to some potato vines that showed up from under the snow.\n\nVasili Andreevich stopped the perspiring horse, whose deep sides were\nheaving heavily.\n\n\'What is it?\'\n\n\'Why, we are on the Zakharov lands. See where we\'ve got to!\'\n\n\'Nonsense!\' retorted Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'It\'s not nonsense, Vasili Andreevich. It\'s the truth,\' replied Nikita.\n\'You can feel that the sledge is going over a potato-field, and there\nare the heaps of vines which have been carted here. It\'s the Zakharov\nfactory land.\'\n\n\'Dear me, how we have gone astray!\' said Vasili Andreevich. \'What are we\nto do now?\'\n\n\'We must go straight on, that\'s all. We shall come out somewhere--if not\nat Zakharova, then at the proprietor\'s farm,\' said Nikita.\n\nVasili Andreevich agreed, and drove as Nikita had indicated. So they\nwent on for a considerable time. At times they came onto bare fields and\nthe sledge-runners rattled over frozen lumps of earth. Sometimes they\ngot onto a winter-rye field, or a fallow field on which they could see\nstalks of wormwood, and straws sticking up through the snow and swaying\nin the wind; sometimes they came onto deep and even white snow, above\nwhich nothing was to be seen.\n\nThe snow was falling from above and sometimes rose from below. The horse\nwas evidently exhausted, his hair had all curled up from sweat and was\ncovered with hoar-frost, and he went at a walk. Suddenly he stumbled and\nsat down in a ditch or water-course. Vasili Andreevich wanted to stop,\nbut Nikita cried to him:\n\n\'Why stop? We\'ve got in and must get out. Hey, pet! Hey, darling! Gee\nup, old fellow!\' he shouted in a cheerful tone to the horse, jumping out\nof the sledge and himself getting stuck in the ditch.\n\nThe horse gave a start and quickly climbed out onto the frozen bank. It\nwas evidently a ditch that had been dug there.\n\n\'Where are we now?\' asked Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'We\'ll soon find out!\' Nikita replied. \'Go on, we\'ll get somewhere.\'\n\n\'Why, this must be the Goryachkin forest!\' said Vasili Andreevich,\npointing to something dark that appeared amid the snow in front of them.\n\n\'We\'ll see what forest it is when we get there,\' said Nikita.\n\nHe saw that beside the black thing they had noticed, dry, oblong\nwillow-leaves were fluttering, and so he knew it was not a forest but a\nsettlement, but he did not wish to say so. And in fact they had not gone\ntwenty-five yards beyond the ditch before something in front of them,\nevidently trees, showed up black, and they heard a new and melancholy\nsound. Nikita had guessed right: it was not a wood, but a row of tall\nwillows with a few leaves still fluttering on them here and there. They\nhad evidently been planted along the ditch round a threshing-floor.\nComing up to the willows, which moaned sadly in the wind, the horse\nsuddenly planted his forelegs above the height of the sledge, drew up\nhis hind legs also, pulling the sledge onto higher ground, and turned to\nthe left, no longer sinking up to his knees in snow. They were back on a\nroad.\n\n\'Well, here we are, but heaven only knows where!\' said Nikita.\n\nThe horse kept straight along the road through the drifted snow, and\nbefore they had gone another hundred yards the straight line of the\ndark wattle wall of a barn showed up black before them, its roof heavily\ncovered with snow which poured down from it. After passing the barn the\nroad turned to the wind and they drove into a snow-drift. But ahead of\nthem was a lane with houses on either side, so evidently the snow had\nbeen blown across the road and they had to drive through the drift. And\nso in fact it was. Having driven through the snow they came out into a\nstreet. At the end house of the village some frozen clothes hanging on\na line--shirts, one red and one white, trousers, leg-bands, and a\npetticoat--fluttered wildly in the wind. The white shirt in particular\nstruggled desperately, waving its sleeves about.\n\n\'There now, either a lazy woman or a dead one has not taken her clothes\ndown before the holiday,\' remarked Nikita, looking at the fluttering\nshirts.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nAt the entrance to the street the wind still raged and the road was\nthickly covered with snow, but well within the village it was calm,\nwarm, and cheerful. At one house a dog was barking, at another a woman,\ncovering her head with her coat, came running from somewhere and entered\nthe door of a hut, stopping on the threshold to have a look at the\npassing sledge. In the middle of the village girls could be heard\nsinging.\n\nHere in the village there seemed to be less wind and snow, and the frost\nwas less keen.\n\n\'Why, this is Grishkino,\' said Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'So it is,\' responded Nikita.\n\nIt really was Grishkino, which meant that they had gone too far to the\nleft and had travelled some six miles, not quite in the direction they\naimed at, but towards their destination for all that.\n\nFrom Grishkino to Goryachkin was about another four miles.\n\nIn the middle of the village they almost ran into a tall man walking\ndown the middle of the street.\n\n\'Who are you?\' shouted the man, stopping the horse, and recognizing\nVasili Anereevich he immediately took hold of the shaft, went along it\nhand over hand till he reached the sledge, and placed himself on the\ndriver\'s seat.\n\nHe was Isay, a peasant of Vasili Andreevich\'s acquaintance, and well\nknown as the principal horse-thief in the district.\n\n\'Ah, Vasili Andreevich! Where are you off to?\' said Isay, enveloping\nNikita in the odour of the vodka he had drunk.\n\n\'We were going to Goryachkin.\'\n\n\'And look where you\'ve got to! You should have gone through\nMolchanovka.\'\n\n\'Should have, but didn\'t manage it,\' said Vasili Andreevich, holding in\nthe horse.\n\n\'That\'s a good horse,\' said Isay, with a shrewd glance at Mukhorty, and\nwith a practised hand he tightened the loosened knot high in the horse\'s\nbushy tail.\n\n\'Are you going to stay the night?\'\n\n\'No, friend. I must get on.\'\n\n\'Your business must be pressing. And who is this? Ah, Nikita Stepanych!\'\n\n\'Who else?\' replied Nikita. \'But I say, good friend, how are we to avoid\ngoing astray again?\'\n\n\'Where can you go astray here? Turn back straight down the street and\nthen when you come out keep straight on. Don\'t take to the left. You\nwill come out onto the high road, and then turn to the right.\'\n\n\'And where do we turn off the high road? As in summer, or the winter\nway?\' asked Nikita.\n\n\'The winter way. As soon as you turn off you\'ll see some bushes, and\nopposite them there is a way-mark--a large oak, one with branches--and\nthat\'s the way.\'\n\nVasili Andreevich turned the horse back and drove through the outskirts\nof the village.\n\n\'Why not stay the night?\' Isay shouted after them.\n\nBut Vasili Andreevich did not answer and touched up the horse. Four\nmiles of good road, two of which lay through the forest, seemed easy to\nmanage, especially as the wind was apparently quieter and the snow had\nstopped.\n\nHaving driven along the trodden village street, darkened here and there\nby fresh manure, past the yard where the clothes hung out and where the\nwhite shirt had broken loose and was now attached only by one frozen\nsleeve, they again came within sound of the weird moan of the willows,\nand again emerged on the open fields. The storm, far from ceasing,\nseemed to have grown yet stronger. The road was completely covered with\ndrifting snow, and only the stakes showed that they had not lost their\nway. But even the stakes ahead of them were not easy to see, since the\nwind blew in their faces.\n\nVasili Andreevich screwed up his eyes, bent down his head, and looked\nout for the way-marks, but trusted mainly to the horse\'s sagacity,\nletting it take its own way. And the horse really did not lose the road\nbut followed its windings, turning now to the right and now to the left\nand sensing it under his feet, so that though the snow fell thicker and\nthe wind strengthened they still continued to see way-marks now to the\nleft and now to the right of them.\n\nSo they travelled on for about ten minutes, when suddenly, through the\nslanting screen of wind-driven snow, something black showed up which\nmoved in front of the horse.\n\nThis was another sledge with fellow-travellers. Mukhorty overtook them,\nand struck his hoofs against the back of the sledge in front of them.\n\n\'Pass on... hey there... get in front!\' cried voices from the\nsledge.\n\nVasili Andreevich swerved aside to pass the other sledge.\n\nIn it sat three men and a woman, evidently visitors returning from a\nfeast. One peasant was whacking the snow-covered croup of their little\nhorse with a long switch, and the other two sitting in front waved their\narms and shouted something. The woman, completely wrapped up and covered\nwith snow, sat drowsing and bumping at the back.\n\n\'Who are you?\' shouted Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'From A-a-a...\' was all that could be heard.\n\n\'I say, where are you from?\'\n\n\'From A-a-a-a!\' one of the peasants shouted with all his might, but\nstill it was impossible to make out who they were.\n\n\'Get along! Keep up!\' shouted another, ceaselessly beating his horse\nwith the switch.\n\n\'So you\'re from a feast, it seems?\'\n\n\'Go on, go on! Faster, Simon! Get in front! Faster!\'\n\nThe wings of the sledges bumped against one another, almost got jammed\nbut managed to separate, and the peasants\' sledge began to fall behind.\n\nTheir shaggy, big-bellied horse, all covered with snow, breathed heavily\nunder the low shaft-bow and, evidently using the last of its strength,\nvainly endeavoured to escape from the switch, hobbling with its short\nlegs through the deep snow which it threw up under itself.\n\nIts muzzle, young-looking, with the nether lip drawn up like that of a\nfish, nostrils distended and ears pressed back from fear, kept up for a\nfew seconds near Nikita\'s shoulder and then began to fall behind.\n\n\'Just see what liquor does!\' said Nikita. \'They\'ve tired that little\nhorse to death. What pagans!\'\n\nFor a few minutes they heard the panting of the tired little horse and\nthe drunken shouting of the peasants. Then the panting and the shouts\ndied away, and around them nothing could be heard but the whistling\nof the wind in their ears and now and then the squeak of their\nsledge-runners over a windswept part of the road.\n\nThis encounter cheered and enlivened Vasili Andreevich, and he drove\non more boldly without examining the way-marks, urging on the horse and\ntrusting to him.\n\nNikita had nothing to do, and as usual in such circumstances he drowsed,\nmaking up for much sleepless time. Suddenly the horse stopped and Nikita\nnearly fell forward onto his nose.\n\n\'You know we\'re off the track again!\' said Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'How\'s that?\'\n\n\'Why, there are no way-marks to be seen. We must have got off the road\nagain.\'\n\n\'Well, if we\'ve lost the road we must find it,\' said Nikita curtly, and\ngetting out and stepping lightly on his pigeon-toed feet he started once\nmore going about on the snow.\n\nHe walked about for a long time, now disappearing and now reappearing,\nand finally he came back.\n\n\'There is no road here. There may be farther on,\' he said, getting into\nthe sledge.\n\nIt was already growing dark. The snow-storm had not increased but had\nalso not subsided.\n\n\'If we could only hear those peasants!\' said Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'Well they haven\'t caught us up. We must have gone far astray. Or maybe\nthey have lost their way too.\'\n\n\'Where are we to go then?\' asked Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'Why, we must let the horse take its own way,\' said Nikita. \'He will\ntake us right. Let me have the reins.\'\n\nVasili Andreevich gave him the reins, the more willingly because his\nhands were beginning to feel frozen in his thick gloves.\n\nNikita took the reins, but only held them, trying not to shake them\nand rejoicing at his favourite\'s sagacity. And indeed the clever horse,\nturning first one ear and then the other now to one side and then to the\nother, began to wheel round.\n\n\'The one thing he can\'t do is to talk,\' Nikita kept saying. \'See what he\nis doing! Go on, go on! You know best. That\'s it, that\'s it!\'\n\nThe wind was now blowing from behind and it felt warmer.\n\n\'Yes, he\'s clever,\' Nikita continued, admiring the horse. \'A Kirgiz\nhorse is strong but stupid. But this one--just see what he\'s doing with\nhis ears! He doesn\'t need any telegraph. He can scent a mile off.\'\n\nBefore another half-hour had passed they saw something dark ahead of\nthem--a wood or a village--and stakes again appeared to the right. They\nhad evidently come out onto the road.\n\n\'Why, that\'s Grishkino again!\' Nikita suddenly exclaimed.\n\nAnd indeed, there on their left was that same barn with the snow flying\nfrom it, and farther on the same line with the frozen washing, shirts\nand trousers, which still fluttered desperately in the wind.\n\nAgain they drove into the street and again it grew quiet, warm, and\ncheerful, and again they could see the manure-stained street and hear\nvoices and songs and the barking of a dog. It was already so dark that\nthere were lights in some of the windows.\n\nHalf-way through the village Vasili Andreevich turned the horse towards\na large double-fronted brick house and stopped at the porch.\n\nNikita went to the lighted snow-covered window, in the rays of which\nflying snow-flakes glittered, and knocked at it with his whip.\n\n\'Who is there?\' a voice replied to his knock.\n\n\'From Kresty, the Brekhunovs, dear fellow,\' answered Nikita. \'Just come\nout for a minute.\'\n\nSomeone moved from the window, and a minute or two later there was the\nsound of the passage door as it came unstuck, then the latch of the\noutside door clicked and a tall white-bearded peasant, with a sheepskin\ncoat thrown over his white holiday shirt, pushed his way out holding the\ndoor firmly against the wind, followed by a lad in a red shirt and high\nleather boots.\n\n\'Is that you, Andreevich?\' asked the old man.\n\n\'Yes, friend, we\'ve gone astray,\' said Vasili Andreevich. \'We wanted to\nget to Goryachkin but found ourselves here. We went a second time but\nlost our way again.\'\n\n\'Just see how you have gone astray!\' said the old man. \'Petrushka, go\nand open the gate!\' he added, turning to the lad in the red shirt.\n\n\'All right,\' said the lad in a cheerful voice, and ran back into the\npassage.\n\n\'But we\'re not staying the night,\' said Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'Where will you go in the night? You\'d better stay!\'\n\n\'I\'d be glad to, but I must go on. It\'s business, and it can\'t be\nhelped.\'\n\n\'Well, warm yourself at least. The samovar is just ready.\'\n\n\'Warm myself? Yes, I\'ll do that,\' said Vasili Andreevich. \'It won\'t get\ndarker. The moon will rise and it will be lighter. Let\'s go in and warm\nourselves, Nikita.\'\n\n\'Well, why not? Let us warm ourselves,\' replied Nikita, who was stiff\nwith cold and anxious to warm his frozen limbs.\n\nVasili Andreevich went into the room with the old man, and Nikita drove\nthrough the gate opened for him by Petrushka, by whose advice he backed\nthe horse under the penthouse. The ground was covered with manure and\nthe tall bow over the horse\'s head caught against the beam. The hens\nand the cock had already settled to roost there, and clucked peevishly,\nclinging to the beam with their claws. The disturbed sheep shied and\nrushed aside trampling the frozen manure with their hooves. The dog\nyelped desperately with fright and anger and then burst out barking like\na puppy at the stranger.\n\nNikita talked to them all, excused himself to the fowls and assured\nthem that he would not disturb them again, rebuked the sheep for being\nfrightened without knowing why, and kept soothing the dog, while he tied\nup the horse.\n\n\'Now that will be all right,\' he said, knocking the snow off his\nclothes. \'Just hear how he barks!\' he added, turning to the dog. \'Be\nquiet, stupid! Be quiet. You are only troubling yourself for nothing.\nWe\'re not thieves, we\'re friends....\'\n\n\'And these are, it\'s said, the three domestic counsellors,\' remarked the\nlad, and with his strong arms he pushed under the pent-roof the sledge\nthat had remained outside.\n\n\'Why counsellors?\' asked Nikita.\n\n\'That\'s what is printed in Paulson. A thief creeps to a house--the dog\nbarks, that means "Be on your guard!" The cock crows, that means, "Get\nup!" The cat licks herself--that means, "A welcome guest is coming. Get\nready to receive him!"\' said the lad with a smile.\n\nPetrushka could read and write and knew Paulson\'s primer, his only book,\nalmost by heart, and he was fond of quoting sayings from it that he\nthought suited the occasion, especially when he had had something to\ndrink, as to-day.\n\n\'That\'s so,\' said Nikita.\n\n\'You must be chilled through and through,\' said Petrushka.\n\n\'Yes, I am rather,\' said Nikita, and they went across the yard and the\npassage into the house.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nThe household to which Vasili Andreevich had come was one of the richest\nin the village. The family had five allotments, besides renting other\nland. They had six horses, three cows, two calves, and some twenty\nsheep. There were twenty-two members belonging to the homestead: four\nmarried sons, six grandchildren (one of whom, Petrushka, was married),\ntwo great-grandchildren, three orphans, and four daughters-in-law with\ntheir babies. It was one of the few homesteads that remained still\nundivided, but even here the dull internal work of disintegration which\nwould inevitably lead to separation had already begun, starting as usual\namong the women. Two sons were living in Moscow as water-carriers, and\none was in the army. At home now were the old man and his wife, their\nsecond son who managed the homestead, the eldest who had come from\nMoscow for the holiday, and all the women and children. Besides these\nmembers of the family there was a visitor, a neighbour who was godfather\nto one of the children.\n\nOver the table in the room hung a lamp with a shade, which brightly lit\nup the tea-things, a bottle of vodka, and some refreshments, besides\nilluminating the brick walls, which in the far corner were hung with\nicons on both sides of which were pictures. At the head of the table\nsat Vasili Andreevich in a black sheepskin coat, sucking his frozen\nmoustache and observing the room and the people around him with his\nprominent hawk-like eyes. With him sat the old, bald, white-bearded\nmaster of the house in a white homespun shirt, and next him the son\nhome from Moscow for the holiday--a man with a sturdy back and powerful\nshoulders and clad in a thin print shirt--then the second son, also\nbroad-shouldered, who acted as head of the house, and then a lean\nred-haired peasant--the neighbour.\n\nHaving had a drink of vodka and something to eat, they were about to\ntake tea, and the samovar standing on the floor beside the brick oven\nwas already humming. The children could be seen in the top bunks and on\nthe top of the oven. A woman sat on a lower bunk with a cradle beside\nher. The old housewife, her face covered with wrinkles which wrinkled\neven her lips, was waiting on Vasili Andreevich.\n\nAs Nikita entered the house she was offering her guest a small tumbler\nof thick glass which she had just filled with vodka.\n\n\'Don\'t refuse, Vasili Andreevich, you mustn\'t! Wish us a merry feast.\nDrink it, dear!\' she said.\n\nThe sight and smell of vodka, especially now when he was chilled through\nand tired out, much disturbed Nikita\'s mind. He frowned, and having\nshaken the snow off his cap and coat, stopped in front of the icons\nas if not seeing anyone, crossed himself three times, and bowed to the\nicons. Then, turning to the old master of the house and bowing first\nto him, then to all those at table, then to the women who stood by the\noven, and muttering: \'A merry holiday!\' he began taking off his outer\nthings without looking at the table.\n\n\'Why, you\'re all covered with hoar-frost, old fellow!\' said the eldest\nbrother, looking at Nikita\'s snow-covered face, eyes, and beard.\n\nNikita took off his coat, shook it again, hung it up beside the oven,\nand came up to the table. He too was offered vodka. He went through a\nmoment of painful hesitation and nearly took up the glass and emptied\nthe clear fragrant liquid down his throat, but he glanced at Vasili\nAndreevich, remembered his oath and the boots that he had sold for\ndrink, recalled the cooper, remembered his son for whom he had promised\nto buy a horse by spring, sighed, and declined it.\n\n\'I don\'t drink, thank you kindly,\' he said frowning, and sat down on a\nbench near the second window.\n\n\'How\'s that?\' asked the eldest brother.\n\n\'I just don\'t drink,\' replied Nikita without lifting his eyes but\nlooking askance at his scanty beard and moustache and getting the\nicicles out of them.\n\n\'It\'s not good for him,\' said Vasili Andreevich, munching a cracknel\nafter emptying his glass.\n\n\'Well, then, have some tea,\' said the kindly old hostess. \'You must\nbe chilled through, good soul. Why are you women dawdling so with the\nsamovar?\'\n\n\'It is ready,\' said one of the young women, and after flicking with her\napron the top of the samovar which was now boiling over, she carried it\nwith an effort to the table, raised it, and set it down with a thud.\n\nMeanwhile Vasili Andreevich was telling how he had lost his way, how\nthey had come back twice to this same village, and how they had gone\nastray and had met some drunken peasants. Their hosts were surprised,\nexplained where and why they had missed their way, said who the tipsy\npeople they had met were, and told them how they ought to go.\n\n\'A little child could find the way to Molchanovka from here. All you\nhave to do is to take the right turning from the high road. There\'s a\nbush you can see just there. But you didn\'t even get that far!\' said the\nneighbour.\n\n\'You\'d better stay the night. The women will make up beds for you,\' said\nthe old woman persuasively.\n\n\'You could go on in the morning and it would be pleasanter,\' said the\nold man, confirming what his wife had said.\n\n\'I can\'t, friend. Business!\' said Vasili Andreevich. \'Lose an hour and\nyou can\'t catch it up in a year,\' he added, remembering the grove and\nthe dealers who might snatch that deal from him. \'We shall get there,\nshan\'t we?\' he said, turning to Nikita.\n\nNikita did not answer for some time, apparently still intent on thawing\nout his beard and moustache.\n\n\'If only we don\'t go astray again,\' he replied gloomily. He was gloomy\nbecause he passionately longed for some vodka, and the only thing that\ncould assuage that longing was tea and he had not yet been offered any.\n\n\'But we have only to reach the turning and then we shan\'t go wrong. The\nroad will be through the forest the whole way,\' said Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'It\'s just as you please, Vasili Andreevich. If we\'re to go, let us go,\'\nsaid Nikita, taking the glass of tea he was offered.\n\n\'We\'ll drink our tea and be off.\'\n\nNikita said nothing but only shook his head, and carefully pouring some\ntea into his saucer began warming his hands, the fingers of which were\nalways swollen with hard work, over the steam. Then, biting off a tiny\nbit of sugar, he bowed to his hosts, said, \'Your health!\' and drew in\nthe steaming liquid.\n\n\'If somebody would see us as far as the turning,\' said Vasili\nAndreevich.\n\n\'Well, we can do that,\' said the eldest son. \'Petrushka will harness and\ngo that far with you.\'\n\n\'Well, then, put in the horse, lad, and I shall be thankful to you for\nit.\'\n\n\'Oh, what for, dear man?\' said the kindly old woman. \'We are heartily\nglad to do it.\'\n\n\'Petrushka, go and put in the mare,\' said the eldest brother.\n\n\'All right,\' replied Petrushka with a smile, and promptly snatching his\ncap down from a nail he ran away to harness.\n\nWhile the horse was being harnessed the talk returned to the point at\nwhich it had stopped when Vasili Andreevich drove up to the window. The\nold man had been complaining to his neighbour, the village elder, about\nhis third son who had not sent him anything for the holiday though he\nhad sent a French shawl to his wife.\n\n\'The young people are getting out of hand,\' said the old man.\n\n\'And how they do!\' said the neighbour. \'There\'s no managing them! They\nknow too much. There\'s Demochkin now, who broke his father\'s arm. It\'s\nall from being too clever, it seems.\'\n\nNikita listened, watched their faces, and evidently would have liked to\nshare in the conversation, but he was too busy drinking his tea and only\nnodded his head approvingly. He emptied one tumbler after another and\ngrew warmer and warmer and more and more comfortable. The talk continued\non the same subject for a long time--the harmfulness of a household\ndividing up--and it was clearly not an abstract discussion but concerned\nthe question of a separation in that house; a separation demanded by the\nsecond son who sat there morosely silent.\n\nIt was evidently a sore subject and absorbed them all, but out of\npropriety they did not discuss their private affairs before strangers.\nAt last, however, the old man could not restrain himself, and with tears\nin his eyes declared that he would not consent to a break-up of the\nfamily during his lifetime, that his house was prospering, thank God,\nbut that if they separated they would all have to go begging.\n\n\'Just like the Matveevs,\' said the neighbour. \'They used to have a\nproper house, but now they\'ve split up none of them has anything.\'\n\n\'And that is what you want to happen to us,\' said the old man, turning\nto his son.\n\nThe son made no reply and there was an awkward pause. The silence was\nbroken by Petrushka, who having harnessed the horse had returned to the\nhut a few minutes before this and had been listening all the time with a\nsmile.\n\n\'There\'s a fable about that in Paulson,\' he said. \'A father gave his\nsons a broom to break. At first they could not break it, but when they\ntook it twig by twig they broke it easily. And it\'s the same here,\' and\nhe gave a broad smile. \'I\'m ready!\' he added.\n\n\'If you\'re ready, let\'s go,\' said Vasili Andreevich. \'And as to\nseparating, don\'t you allow it, Grandfather. You got everything together\nand you\'re the master. Go to the Justice of the Peace. He\'ll say how\nthings should be done.\'\n\n\'He carries on so, carries on so,\' the old man continued in a whining\ntone. \'There\'s no doing anything with him. It\'s as if the devil\npossessed him.\'\n\nNikita having meanwhile finished his fifth tumbler of tea laid it on\nits side instead of turning it upside down, hoping to be offered a sixth\nglass. But there was no more water in the samovar, so the hostess did\nnot fill it up for him. Besides, Vasili Andreevich was putting his\nthings on, so there was nothing for it but for Nikita to get up too, put\nback into the sugar-basin the lump of sugar he had nibbled all round,\nwipe his perspiring face with the skirt of his sheepskin, and go to put\non his overcoat.\n\nHaving put it on he sighed deeply, thanked his hosts, said good-bye,\nand went out of the warm bright room into the cold dark passage, through\nwhich the wind was howling and where snow was blowing through the cracks\nof the shaking door, and from there into the yard.\n\nPetrushka stood in his sheepskin in the middle of the yard by his horse,\nrepeating some lines from Paulson\'s primer. He said with a smile:\n\n     \'Storms with mist the sky conceal,\n     Snowy circles wheeling wild.\n     Now like savage beast \'twill howl,\n     And now \'tis wailing like a child.\'\n\nNikita nodded approvingly as he arranged the reins.\n\nThe old man, seeing Vasili Andreevich off, brought a lantern into the\npassage to show him a light, but it was blown out at once. And even in\nthe yard it was evident that the snowstorm had become more violent.\n\n\'Well, this is weather!\' thought Vasili Andreevich. \'Perhaps we may not\nget there after all. But there is nothing to be done. Business! Besides,\nwe have got ready, our host\'s horse has been harnessed, and we\'ll get\nthere with God\'s help!\'\n\nTheir aged host also thought they ought not to go, but he had already\ntried to persuade them to stay and had not been listened to.\n\n\'It\'s no use asking them again. Maybe my age makes me timid. They\'ll\nget there all right, and at least we shall get to bed in good time and\nwithout any fuss,\' he thought.\n\nPetrushka did not think of danger. He knew the road and the whole\ndistrict so well, and the lines about \'snowy circles wheeling wild\'\ndescribed what was happening outside so aptly that it cheered him up.\nNikita did not wish to go at all, but he had been accustomed not to have\nhis own way and to serve others for so long that there was no one to\nhinder the departing travellers.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nVasili Andreevich went over to his sledge, found it with difficulty in\nthe darkness, climbed in and took the reins.\n\n\'Go on in front!\' he cried.\n\nPetrushka kneeling in his low sledge started his horse. Mukhorty, who\nhad been neighing for some time past, now scenting a mare ahead of him\nstarted after her, and they drove out into the street. They drove again\nthrough the outskirts of the village and along the same road, past the\nyard where the frozen linen had hung (which, however, was no longer to\nbe seen), past the same barn, which was now snowed up almost to the\nroof and from which the snow was still endlessly pouring past the same\ndismally moaning, whistling, and swaying willows, and again entered into\nthe sea of blustering snow raging from above and below. The wind was\nso strong that when it blew from the side and the travellers steered\nagainst it, it tilted the sledges and turned the horses to one side.\nPetrushka drove his good mare in front at a brisk trot and kept shouting\nlustily. Mukhorty pressed after her.\n\nAfter travelling so for about ten minutes, Petrushka turned round and\nshouted something. Neither Vasili Andreevich nor Nikita could hear\nanything because of the wind, but they guessed that they had arrived at\nthe turning. In fact Petrushka had turned to the right, and now the wind\nthat had blown from the side blew straight in their faces, and through\nthe snow they saw something dark on their right. It was the bush at the\nturning.\n\n\'Well now, God speed you!\'\n\n\'Thank you, Petrushka!\'\n\n\'Storms with mist the sky conceal!\' shouted Petrushka as he disappeared.\n\n\'There\'s a poet for you!\' muttered Vasili Andreevich, pulling at the\nreins.\n\n\'Yes, a fine lad--a true peasant,\' said Nikita.\n\nThey drove on.\n\nNikita, wrapping his coat closely about him and pressing his head down\nso close to his shoulders that his short beard covered his throat, sat\nsilently, trying not to lose the warmth he had obtained while drinking\ntea in the house. Before him he saw the straight lines of the\nshafts which constantly deceived him into thinking they were on a\nwell-travelled road, and the horse\'s swaying crupper with his knotted\ntail blown to one side, and farther ahead the high shaft-bow and the\nswaying head and neck of the horse with its waving mane. Now and then\nhe caught sight of a way-sign, so that he knew they were still on a road\nand that there was nothing for him to be concerned about.\n\nVasili Andreevich drove on, leaving it to the horse to keep to the road.\nBut Mukhorty, though he had had a breathing-space in the village, ran\nreluctantly, and seemed now and then to get off the road, so that Vasili\nAndreevich had repeatedly to correct him.\n\n\'Here\'s a stake to the right, and another, and here\'s a third,\' Vasili\nAndreevich counted, \'and here in front is the forest,\' thought he, as he\nlooked at something dark in front of him. But what had seemed to him a\nforest was only a bush. They passed the bush and drove on for another\nhundred yards but there was no fourth way-mark nor any forest.\n\n\'We must reach the forest soon,\' thought Vasili Andreevich, and animated\nby the vodka and the tea he did not stop but shook the reins, and the\ngood obedient horse responded, now ambling, now slowly trotting in the\ndirection in which he was sent, though he knew that he was not going the\nright way. Ten minutes went by, but there was still no forest.\n\n\'There now, we must be astray again,\' said Vasili Andreevich, pulling\nup.\n\nNikita silently got out of the sledge and holding his coat, which the\nwind now wrapped closely about him and now almost tore off, started to\nfeel about in the snow, going first to one side and then to the other.\nThree or four times he was completely lost to sight. At last he returned\nand took the reins from Vasili Andreevich\'s hand.\n\n\'We must go to the right,\' he said sternly and peremptorily, as he\nturned the horse.\n\n\'Well, if it\'s to the right, go to the right,\' said Vasili Andreevich,\nyielding up the reins to Nikita and thrusting his freezing hands into\nhis sleeves.\n\nNikita did not reply.\n\n\'Now then, friend, stir yourself!\' he shouted to the horse, but in spite\nof the shake of the reins Mukhorty moved only at a walk.\n\nThe snow in places was up to his knees, and the sledge moved by fits and\nstarts with his every movement.\n\nNikita took the whip that hung over the front of the sledge and struck\nhim once. The good horse, unused to the whip, sprang forward and moved\nat a trot, but immediately fell back into an amble and then to a walk.\nSo they went on for five minutes. It was dark and the snow whirled from\nabove and rose from below, so that sometimes the shaft-bow could not\nbe seen. At times the sledge seemed to stand still and the field to\nrun backwards. Suddenly the horse stopped abruptly, evidently aware\nof something close in front of him. Nikita again sprang lightly out,\nthrowing down the reins, and went ahead to see what had brought him to\na standstill, but hardly had he made a step in front of the horse before\nhis feet slipped and he went rolling down an incline.\n\n\'Whoa, whoa, whoa!\' he said to himself as he fell, and he tried to stop\nhis fall but could not, and only stopped when his feet plunged into a\nthick layer of snow that had drifted to the bottom of the hollow.\n\nThe fringe of a drift of snow that hung on the edge of the hollow,\ndisturbed by Nikita\'s fall, showered down on him and got inside his\ncollar.\n\n\'What a thing to do!\' said Nikita reproachfully, addressing the drift\nand the hollow and shaking the snow from under his collar.\n\n\'Nikita! Hey, Nikita!\' shouted Vasili Andreevich from above.\n\nBut Nikita did not reply. He was too occupied in shaking out the snow\nand searching for the whip he had dropped when rolling down the incline.\nHaving found the whip he tried to climb straight up the bank where he\nhad rolled down, but it was impossible to do so: he kept rolling down\nagain, and so he had to go along at the foot of the hollow to find a way\nup. About seven yards farther on he managed with difficulty to crawl up\nthe incline on all fours, then he followed the edge of the hollow back\nto the place where the horse should have been. He could not see either\nhorse or sledge, but as he walked against the wind he heard Vasili\nAndreevich\'s shouts and Mukhorty\'s neighing, calling him.\n\n\'I\'m coming! I\'m coming! What are you cackling for?\' he muttered.\n\nOnly when he had come up to the sledge could he make out the horse, and\nVasili Andreevich standing beside it and looking gigantic.\n\n\'Where the devil did you vanish to? We must go back, if only to\nGrishkino,\' he began reproaching Nikita.\n\n\'I\'d be glad to get back, Vasili Andreevich, but which way are we to go?\nThere is such a ravine here that if we once get in it we shan\'t get out\nagain. I got stuck so fast there myself that I could hardly get out.\'\n\n\'What shall we do, then? We can\'t stay here! We must go somewhere!\' said\nVasili Andreevich.\n\nNikita said nothing. He seated himself in the sledge with his back to\nthe wind, took off his boots, shook out the snow that had got into them,\nand taking some straw from the bottom of the sledge, carefully plugged\nwith it a hole in his left boot.\n\nVasili Andreevich remained silent, as though now leaving everything to\nNikita. Having put his boots on again, Nikita drew his feet into the\nsledge, put on his mittens and took up the reins, and directed the horse\nalong the side of the ravine. But they had not gone a hundred yards\nbefore the horse again stopped short. The ravine was in front of him\nagain.\n\nNikita again climbed out and again trudged about in the snow. He did\nthis for a considerable time and at last appeared from the opposite side\nto that from which he had started.\n\n\'Vasili Andreevich, are you alive?\' he called out.\n\n\'Here!\' replied Vasili Andreevich. \'Well, what now?\'\n\n\'I can\'t make anything out. It\'s too dark. There\'s nothing but ravines.\nWe must drive against the wind again.\'\n\nThey set off once more. Again Nikita went stumbling through the snow,\nagain he fell in, again climbed out and trudged about, and at last quite\nout of breath he sat down beside the sledge.\n\n\'Well, how now?\' asked Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'Why, I am quite worn out and the horse won\'t go.\'\n\n\'Then what\'s to be done?\'\n\n\'Why, wait a minute.\'\n\nNikita went away again but soon returned.\n\n\'Follow me!\' he said, going in front of the horse.\n\nVasili Andreevich no longer gave orders but implicitly did what Nikita\ntold him.\n\n\'Here, follow me!\' Nikita shouted, stepping quickly to the right, and\nseizing the rein he led Mukhorty down towards a snow-drift.\n\nAt first the horse held back, then he jerked forward, hoping to leap the\ndrift, but he had not the strength and sank into it up to his collar.\n\n\'Get out!\' Nikita called to Vasili Andreevich who still sat in the\nsledge, and taking hold of one shaft he moved the sledge closer to\nthe horse. \'It\'s hard, brother!\' he said to Mukhorty, \'but it can\'t be\nhelped. Make an effort! Now, now, just a little one!\' he shouted.\n\nThe horse gave a tug, then another, but failed to clear himself and\nsettled down again as if considering something.\n\n\'Now, brother, this won\'t do!\' Nikita admonished him. \'Now once more!\'\n\nAgain Nikita tugged at the shaft on his side, and Vasili Andreevich did\nthe same on the other.\n\nMukhorty lifted his head and then gave a sudden jerk.\n\n\'That\'s it! That\'s it!\' cried Nikita. \'Don\'t be afraid--you won\'t sink!\'\n\nOne plunge, another, and a third, and at last Mukhorty was out of the\nsnow-drift, and stood still, breathing heavily and shaking the snow off\nhimself. Nikita wished to lead him farther, but Vasili Andreevich, in\nhis two fur coats, was so out of breath that he could not walk farther\nand dropped into the sledge.\n\n\'Let me get my breath!\' he said, unfastening the kerchief with which he\nhad tied the collar of his fur coat at the village.\n\n\'It\'s all right here. You lie there,\' said Nikita. \'I will lead him\nalong.\' And with Vasili Andreevich in the sledge he led the horse by the\nbridle about ten paces down and then up a slight rise, and stopped.\n\nThe place where Nikita had stopped was not completely in the hollow\nwhere the snow sweeping down from the hillocks might have buried them\naltogether, but still it was partly sheltered from the wind by the\nside of the ravine. There were moments when the wind seemed to abate a\nlittle, but that did not last long and as if to make up for that respite\nthe storm swept down with tenfold vigour and tore and whirled the more\nfiercely. Such a gust struck them at the moment when Vasili Andreevich,\nhaving recovered his breath, got out of the sledge and went up to\nNikita to consult him as to what they should do. They both bent down\ninvoluntarily and waited till the violence of the squall should\nhave passed. Mukhorty too laid back his ears and shook his head\ndiscontentedly. As soon as the violence of the blast had abated a\nlittle, Nikita took off his mittens, stuck them into his belt, breathed\nonto his hands, and began to undo the straps of the shaft-bow.\n\n\'What\'s that you are doing there?\' asked Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'Unharnessing. What else is there to do? I have no strength left,\' said\nNikita as though excusing himself.\n\n\'Can\'t we drive somewhere?\'\n\n\'No, we can\'t. We shall only kill the horse. Why, the poor beast is not\nhimself now,\' said Nikita, pointing to the horse, which was standing\nsubmissively waiting for what might come, with his steep wet sides\nheaving heavily. \'We shall have to stay the night here,\' he said, as if\npreparing to spend the night at an inn, and he proceeded to unfasten the\ncollar-straps. The buckles came undone.\n\n\'But shan\'t we be frozen?\' remarked Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'Well, if we are we can\'t help it,\' said Nikita.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nAlthough Vasili Andreevich felt quite warm in his two fur coats,\nespecially after struggling in the snow-drift, a cold shiver ran down\nhis back on realizing that he must really spend the night where\nthey were. To calm himself he sat down in the sledge and got out his\ncigarettes and matches.\n\nNikita meanwhile unharnessed Mukhorty. He unstrapped the belly-band\nand the back-band, took away the reins, loosened the collar-strap, and\nremoved the shaft-bow, talking to him all the time to encourage him.\n\n\'Now come out! come out!\' he said, leading him clear of the shafts. \'Now\nwe\'ll tie you up here and I\'ll put down some straw and take off your\nbridle. When you\'ve had a bite you\'ll feel more cheerful.\'\n\nBut Mukhorty was restless and evidently not comforted by Nikita\'s\nremarks. He stepped now on one foot and now on another, and pressed\nclose against the sledge, turning his back to the wind and rubbing his\nhead on Nikita\'s sleeve. Then, as if not to pain Nikita by refusing his\noffer of the straw he put before him, he hurriedly snatched a wisp out\nof the sledge, but immediately decided that it was now no time to think\nof straw and threw it down, and the wind instantly scattered it, carried\nit away, and covered it with snow.\n\n\'Now we will set up a signal,\' said Nikita, and turning the front of the\nsledge to the wind he tied the shafts together with a strap and set them\nup on end in front of the sledge. \'There now, when the snow covers us\nup, good folk will see the shafts and dig us out,\' he said, slapping his\nmittens together and putting them on. \'That\'s what the old folk taught\nus!\'\n\nVasili Andreevich meanwhile had unfastened his coat, and holding its\nskirts up for shelter, struck one sulphur match after another on the\nsteel box. But his hands trembled, and one match after another either\ndid not kindle or was blown out by the wind just as he was lifting it to\nthe cigarette. At last a match did burn up, and its flame lit up for\na moment the fur of his coat, his hand with the gold ring on the bent\nforefinger, and the snow-sprinkled oat-straw that stuck out from under\nthe drugget. The cigarette lighted, he eagerly took a whiff or two,\ninhaled the smoke, let it out through his moustache, and would have\ninhaled again, but the wind tore off the burning tobacco and whirled it\naway as it had done the straw.\n\nBut even these few puffs had cheered him.\n\n\'If we must spend the night here, we must!\' he said with decision. \'Wait\na bit, I\'ll arrange a flag as well,\' he added, picking up the kerchief\nwhich he had thrown down in the sledge after taking it from round his\ncollar, and drawing off his gloves and standing up on the front of\nthe sledge and stretching himself to reach the strap, he tied the\nhandkerchief to it with a tight knot.\n\nThe kerchief immediately began to flutter wildly, now clinging round the\nshaft, now suddenly streaming out, stretching and flapping.\n\n\'Just see what a fine flag!\' said Vasili Andreevich, admiring his\nhandiwork and letting himself down into the sledge. \'We should be warmer\ntogether, but there\'s not room enough for two,\' he added.\n\n\'I\'ll find a place,\' said Nikita. \'But I must cover up the horse\nfirst--he sweated so, poor thing. Let go!\' he added, drawing the drugget\nfrom under Vasili Andreevich.\n\nHaving got the drugget he folded it in two, and after taking off the\nbreechband and pad, covered Mukhorty with it.\n\n\'Anyhow it will be warmer, silly!\' he said, putting back the breechband\nand the pad on the horse over the drugget. Then having finished that\nbusiness he returned to the sledge, and addressing Vasili Andreevich,\nsaid: \'You won\'t need the sackcloth, will you? And let me have some\nstraw.\'\n\nAnd having taken these things from under Vasili Andreevich, Nikita went\nbehind the sledge, dug out a hole for himself in the snow, put straw\ninto it, wrapped his coat well round him, covered himself with the\nsackcloth, and pulling his cap well down seated himself on the straw he\nhad spread, and leant against the wooden back of the sledge to shelter\nhimself from the wind and the snow.\n\nVasili Andreevich shook his head disapprovingly at what Nikita was\ndoing, as in general he disapproved of the peasant\'s stupidity and lack\nof education, and he began to settle himself down for the night.\n\nHe smoothed the remaining straw over the bottom of the sledge, putting\nmore of it under his side. Then he thrust his hands into his sleeves and\nsettled down, sheltering his head in the corner of the sledge from the\nwind in front.\n\nHe did not wish to sleep. He lay and thought: thought ever of the one\nthing that constituted the sole aim, meaning, pleasure, and pride of his\nlife--of how much money he had made and might still make, of how much\nother people he knew had made and possessed, and of how those others had\nmade and were making it, and how he, like them, might still make much\nmore. The purchase of the Goryachkin grove was a matter of immense\nimportance to him. By that one deal he hoped to make perhaps ten\nthousand rubles. He began mentally to reckon the value of the wood he\nhad inspected in autumn, and on five acres of which he had counted all\nthe trees.\n\n\'The oaks will go for sledge-runners. The undergrowth will take care of\nitself, and there\'ll still be some thirty sazheens of fire-wood left on\neach desyatin,\' said he to himself. \'That means there will be at\nleast two hundred and twenty-five rubles\' worth left on each desyatin.\nFifty-six desyatiins means fifty-six hundreds, and fifty-six hundreds,\nand fifty-six tens, and another fifty-six tens, and then fifty-six\nfives....\' He saw that it came out to more than twelve thousand\nrubles, but could not reckon it up exactly without a counting-frame.\n\'But I won\'t give ten thousand, anyhow. I\'ll give about eight thousand\nwith a deduction on account of the glades. I\'ll grease the surveyor\'s\npalm--give him a hundred rubles, or a hundred and fifty, and he\'ll\nreckon that there are some five desyatins of glade to be deducted. And\nhe\'ll let it go for eight thousand. Three thousand cash down. That\'ll\nmove him, no fear!\' he thought, and he pressed his pocket-book with his\nforearm.\n\n\'God only knows how we missed the turning. The forest ought to be there,\nand a watchman\'s hut, and dogs barking. But the damned things don\'t\nbark when they\'re wanted.\' He turned his collar down from his ear and\nlistened, but as before only the whistling of the wind could be heard,\nthe flapping and fluttering of the kerchief tied to the shafts, and the\npelting of the snow against the woodwork of the sledge. He again covered\nup his ear.\n\n\'If I had known I would have stayed the night. Well, no matter, we\'ll\nget there to-morrow. It\'s only one day lost. And the others won\'t travel\nin such weather.\' Then he remembered that on the 9th he had to receive\npayment from the butcher for his oxen. \'He meant to come himself, but\nhe won\'t find me, and my wife won\'t know how to receive the money. She\ndoesn\'t know the right way of doing things,\' he thought, recalling\nhow at their party the day before she had not known how to treat the\npolice-officer who was their guest. \'Of course she\'s only a woman! Where\ncould she have seen anything? In my father\'s time what was our house\nlike? Just a rich peasant\'s house: just an oatmill and an inn--that was\nthe whole property. But what have I done in these fifteen years? A shop,\ntwo taverns, a flour-mill, a grain-store, two farms leased out, and a\nhouse with an iron-roofed barn,\' he thought proudly. \'Not as it was in\nFather\'s time! Who is talked of in the whole district now? Brekhunov!\nAnd why? Because I stick to business. I take trouble, not like others\nwho lie abed or waste their time on foolishness while I don\'t sleep of\nnights. Blizzard or no blizzard I start out. So business gets done. They\nthink money-making is a joke. No, take pains and rack your brains! You\nget overtaken out of doors at night, like this, or keep awake night\nafter night till the thoughts whirling in your head make the pillow\nturn,\' he meditated with pride. \'They think people get on through luck.\nAfter all, the Mironovs are now millionaires. And why? Take pains and\nGod gives. If only He grants me health!\'\n\nThe thought that he might himself be a millionaire like Mironov, who\nbegan with nothing, so excited Vasili Andreevich that he felt the need\nof talking to somebody. But there was no one to talk to.... If only\nhe could have reached Goryachkin he would have talked to the landlord\nand shown him a thing or two.\n\n\'Just see how it blows! It will snow us up so deep that we shan\'t be\nable to get out in the morning!\' he thought, listening to a gust of wind\nthat blew against the front of the sledge, bending it and lashing the\nsnow against it. He raised himself and looked round. All he could see\nthrough the whirling darkness was Mukhorty\'s dark head, his back covered\nby the fluttering drugget, and his thick knotted tail; while all round,\nin front and behind, was the same fluctuating whity darkness, sometimes\nseeming to get a little lighter and sometimes growing denser still.\n\n\'A pity I listened to Nikita,\' he thought. \'We ought to have driven on.\nWe should have come out somewhere, if only back to Grishkino and stayed\nthe night at Taras\'s. As it is we must sit here all night. But what was\nI thinking about? Yes, that God gives to those who take trouble, but not\nto loafers, lie-abeds, or fools. I must have a smoke!\'\n\nHe sat down again, got out his cigarette-case, and stretched himself\nflat on his stomach, screening the matches with the skirt of his coat.\nBut the wind found its way in and put out match after match. At last\nhe got one to burn and lit a cigarette. He was very glad that he had\nmanaged to do what he wanted, and though the wind smoked more of the\ncigarette than he did, he still got two or three puffs and felt more\ncheerful. He again leant back, wrapped himself up, started reflecting\nand remembering, and suddenly and quite unexpectedly lost consciousness\nand fell asleep.\n\nSuddenly something seemed to give him a push and awoke him. Whether\nit was Mukhorty who had pulled some straw from under him, or whether\nsomething within him had startled him, at all events it woke him, and\nhis heart began to beat faster and faster so that the sledge seemed to\ntremble under him. He opened his eyes. Everything around him was just\nas before. \'It looks lighter,\' he thought. \'I expect it won\'t be long\nbefore dawn.\' But he at once remembered that it was lighter because the\nmoon had risen. He sat up and looked first at the horse. Mukhorty still\nstood with his back to the wind, shivering all over. One side of the\ndrugget, which was completely covered with snow, had been blown back,\nthe breeching had slipped down and the snow-covered head with its waving\nforelock and mane were now more visible. Vasili Andreevich leant over\nthe back of the sledge and looked behind. Nikita still sat in the same\nposition in which he had settled himself. The sacking with which he was\ncovered, and his legs, were thickly covered with snow.\n\n\'If only that peasant doesn\'t freeze to death! His clothes are so\nwretched. I may be held responsible for him. What shiftless people they\nare--such a want of education,\' thought Vasili Andreevich, and he felt\nlike taking the drugget off the horse and putting it over Nikita, but\nit would be very cold to get out and move about and, moreover, the horse\nmight freeze to death. \'Why did I bring him with me? It was all her\nstupidity!\' he thought, recalling his unloved wife, and he rolled over\ninto his old place at the front part of the sledge. \'My uncle once spent\na whole night like this,\' he reflected, \'and was all right.\' But another\ncase came at once to his mind. \'But when they dug Sebastian out he was\ndead--stiff like a frozen carcass. If I\'d only stopped the night in\nGrishkino all this would not have happened!\'\n\nAnd wrapping his coat carefully round him so that none of the warmth of\nthe fur should be wasted but should warm him all over, neck, knees, and\nfeet, he shut his eyes and tried to sleep again. But try as he would he\ncould not get drowsy, on the contrary he felt wide awake and animated.\nAgain he began counting his gains and the debts due to him, again he\nbegan bragging to himself and feeling pleased with himself and his\nposition, but all this was continually disturbed by a stealthily\napproaching fear and by the unpleasant regret that he had not remained\nin Grishkino.\n\n\'How different it would be to be lying warm on a bench!\'\n\nHe turned over several times in his attempts to get into a more\ncomfortable position more sheltered from the wind, he wrapped up his\nlegs closer, shut his eyes, and lay still. But either his legs in their\nstrong felt boots began to ache from being bent in one position, or the\nwind blew in somewhere, and after lying still for a short time he again\nbegan to recall the disturbing fact that he might now have been lying\nquietly in the warm hut at Grishkino. He again sat up, turned about,\nmuffled himself up, and settled down once more.\n\nOnce he fancied that he heard a distant cock-crow. He felt glad, turned\ndown his coat-collar and listened with strained attention, but in spite\nof all his efforts nothing could be heard but the wind whistling between\nthe shafts, the flapping of the kerchief, and the snow pelting against\nthe frame of the sledge.\n\nNikita sat just as he had done all the time, not moving and not even\nanswering Vasili Andreevich who had addressed him a couple of times.\n\'He doesn\'t care a bit--he\'s probably asleep!\' thought Vasili Andreevich\nwith vexation, looking behind the sledge at Nikita who was covered with\na thick layer of snow.\n\nVasili Andreevich got up and lay down again some twenty times. It\nseemed to him that the night would never end. \'It must be getting near\nmorning,\' he thought, getting up and looking around. \'Let\'s have a look\nat my watch. It will be cold to unbutton, but if I only know that it\'s\ngetting near morning I shall at any rate feel more cheerful. We could\nbegin harnessing.\'\n\nIn the depth of his heart Vasili Andreevich knew that it could not yet\nbe near morning, but he was growing more and more afraid, and wished\nboth to get to know and yet to deceive himself. He carefully undid the\nfastening of his sheepskin, pushed in his hand, and felt about for\na long time before he got to his waistcoat. With great difficulty he\nmanaged to draw out his silver watch with its enamelled flower design,\nand tried to make out the time. He could not see anything without a\nlight. Again he went down on his knees and elbows as he had done when he\nlighted a cigarette, got out his matches, and proceeded to strike one.\nThis time he went to work more carefully, and feeling with his fingers\nfor a match with the largest head and the greatest amount of phosphorus,\nlit it at the first try. Bringing the face of the watch under the light\nhe could hardly believe his eyes.... It was only ten minutes past\ntwelve. Almost the whole night was still before him.\n\n\'Oh, how long the night is!\' he thought, feeling a cold shudder run down\nhis back, and having fastened his fur coats again and wrapped himself\nup, he snuggled into a corner of the sledge intending to wait\npatiently. Suddenly, above the monotonous roar of the wind, he clearly\ndistinguished another new and living sound. It steadily strengthened,\nand having become quite clear diminished just as gradually. Beyond all\ndoubt it was a wolf, and he was so near that the movement of his jaws as\nhe changed his cry was brought down the wind. Vasili Andreevich turned\nback the collar of his coat and listened attentively. Mukhorty too\nstrained to listen, moving his ears, and when the wolf had ceased its\nhowling he shifted from foot to foot and gave a warning snort. After\nthis Vasili Andreevich could not fall asleep again or even calm\nhimself. The more he tried to think of his accounts, his business, his\nreputation, his worth and his wealth, the more and more was he mastered\nby fear, and regrets that he had not stayed the night at Grishkino\ndominated and mingled in all his thoughts.\n\n\'Devil take the forest! Things were all right without it, thank God. Ah,\nif we had only put up for the night!\' he said to himself. \'They say it\'s\ndrunkards that freeze,\' he thought, \'and I have had some drink.\' And\nobserving his sensations he noticed that he was beginning to shiver,\nwithout knowing whether it was from cold or from fear. He tried to wrap\nhimself up and lie down as before, but could no longer do so. He could\nnot stay in one position. He wanted to get up, to do something to master\nthe gathering fear that was rising in him and against which he felt\nhimself powerless. He again got out his cigarettes and matches, but only\nthree matches were left and they were bad ones. The phosphorus rubbed\noff them all without lighting.\n\n\'The devil take you! Damned thing! Curse you!\' he muttered, not knowing\nwhom or what he was cursing, and he flung away the crushed cigarette.\nHe was about to throw away the matchbox too, but checked the movement of\nhis hand and put the box in his pocket instead. He was seized with such\nunrest that he could no longer remain in one spot. He climbed out of the\nsledge and standing with his back to the wind began to shift his belt\nagain, fastening it lower down in the waist and tightening it.\n\n\'What\'s the use of lying and waiting for death? Better mount the horse\nand get away!\' The thought suddenly occurred to him. \'The horse will\nmove when he has someone on his back. As for him,\' he thought of\nNikita--\'it\'s all the same to him whether he lives or dies. What is his\nlife worth? He won\'t grudge his life, but I have something to live for,\nthank God.\'\n\nHe untied the horse, threw the reins over his neck and tried to mount,\nbut his coats and boots were so heavy that he failed. Then he clambered\nup in the sledge and tried to mount from there, but the sledge tilted\nunder his weight, and he failed again. At last he drew Mukhorty nearer\nto the sledge, cautiously balanced on one side of it, and managed to\nlie on his stomach across the horse\'s back. After lying like that for a\nwhile he shifted forward once and again, threw a leg over, and finally\nseated himself, supporting his feet on the loose breeching-straps. The\nshaking of the sledge awoke Nikita. He raised himself, and it seemed to\nVasili Andreevich that he said something.\n\n\'Listen to such fools as you! Am I to die like this for nothing?\'\nexclaimed Vasili Andreevich. And tucking the loose skirts of his fur\ncoat in under his knees, he turned the horse and rode away from\nthe sledge in the direction in which he thought the forest and the\nforester\'s hut must be.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nFrom the time he had covered himself with the sackcloth and seated\nhimself behind the sledge, Nikita had not stirred. Like all those who\nlive in touch with nature and have known want, he was patient and could\nwait for hours, even days, without growing restless or irritable. He\nheard his master call him, but did not answer because he did not want to\nmove or talk. Though he still felt some warmth from the tea he had drunk\nand from his energetic struggle when clambering about in the snowdrift,\nhe knew that this warmth would not last long and that he had no strength\nleft to warm himself again by moving about, for he felt as tired as a\nhorse when it stops and refuses to go further in spite of the whip, and\nits master sees that it must be fed before it can work again. The foot\nin the boot with a hole in it had already grown numb, and he could no\nlonger feel his big toe. Besides that, his whole body began to feel\ncolder and colder.\n\nThe thought that he might, and very probably would, die that night\noccurred to him, but did not seem particularly unpleasant or dreadful.\nIt did not seem particularly unpleasant, because his whole life had been\nnot a continual holiday, but on the contrary an unceasing round of\ntoil of which he was beginning to feel weary. And it did not seem\nparticularly dreadful, because besides the masters he had served here,\nlike Vasili Andreevich, he always felt himself dependent on the Chief\nMaster, who had sent him into this life, and he knew that when dying he\nwould still be in that Master\'s power and would not be ill-used by Him.\n\'It seems a pity to give up what one is used to and accustomed to. But\nthere\'s nothing to be done, I shall get used to the new things.\'\n\n\'Sins?\' he thought, and remembered his drunkenness, the money that had\ngone on drink, how he had offended his wife, his cursing, his neglect of\nchurch and of the fasts, and all the things the priest blamed him for\nat confession. \'Of course they are sins. But then, did I take them on of\nmyself? That\'s evidently how God made me. Well, and the sins? Where am I\nto escape to?\'\n\nSo at first he thought of what might happen to him that night, and\nthen did not return to such thoughts but gave himself up to whatever\nrecollections came into his head of themselves. Now he thought of\nMartha\'s arrival, of the drunkenness among the workers and his own\nrenunciation of drink, then of their present journey and of Taras\'s\nhouse and the talk about the breaking-up of the family, then of his own\nlad, and of Mukhorty now sheltered under the drugget, and then of his\nmaster who made the sledge creak as he tossed about in it. \'I expect\nyou\'re sorry yourself that you started out, dear man,\' he thought. \'It\nwould seem hard to leave a life such as his! It\'s not like the likes of\nus.\'\n\nThen all these recollections began to grow confused and got mixed in his\nhead, and he fell asleep.\n\nBut when Vasili Andreevich, getting on the horse, jerked the sledge,\nagainst the back of which Nikita was leaning, and it shifted away and\nhit him in the back with one of its runners, he awoke and had to change\nhis position whether he liked it or not. Straightening his legs with\ndifficulty and shaking the snow off them he got up, and an agonizing\ncold immediately penetrated his whole body. On making out what was\nhappening he called to Vasili Andreevich to leave him the drugget which\nthe horse no longer needed, so that he might wrap himself in it.\n\nBut Vasili Andreevich did not stop, but disappeared amid the powdery\nsnow.\n\nLeft alone Nikita considered for a moment what he should do. He felt\nthat he had not the strength to go off in search of a house. It was no\nlonger possible to sit down in his old place--it was by now all filled\nwith snow. He felt that he could not get warmer in the sledge either,\nfor there was nothing to cover himself with, and his coat and sheepskin\nno longer warmed him at all. He felt as cold as though he had nothing on\nbut a shirt. He became frightened. \'Lord, heavenly Father!\' he muttered,\nand was comforted by the consciousness that he was not alone but that\nthere was One who heard him and would not abandon him. He gave a deep\nsigh, and keeping the sackcloth over his head he got inside the sledge\nand lay down in the place where his master had been.\n\nBut he could not get warm in the sledge either. At first he shivered all\nover, then the shivering ceased and little by little he began to lose\nconsciousness. He did not know whether he was dying or falling asleep,\nbut felt equally prepared for the one as for the other.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nMeanwhile Vasili Andreevich, with his feet and the ends of the reins,\nurged the horse on in the direction in which for some reason he expected\nthe forest and forester\'s hut to be. The snow covered his eyes and the\nwind seemed intent on stopping him, but bending forward and constantly\nlapping his coat over and pushing it between himself and the cold\nharness pad which prevented him from sitting properly, he kept urging\nthe horse on. Mukhorty ambled on obediently though with difficulty, in\nthe direction in which he was driven.\n\nVasili Andreevich rode for about five minutes straight ahead, as he\nthought, seeing nothing but the horse\'s head and the white waste, and\nhearing only the whistle of the wind about the horse\'s ears and his coat\ncollar.\n\nSuddenly a dark patch showed up in front of him. His heart beat with\njoy, and he rode towards the object, already seeing in imagination the\nwalls of village houses. But the dark patch was not stationary, it\nkept moving; and it was not a village but some tall stalks of wormwood\nsticking up through the snow on the boundary between two fields, and\ndesperately tossing about under the pressure of the wind which beat\nit all to one side and whistled through it. The sight of that wormwood\ntormented by the pitiless wind made Vasili Andreevich shudder, he knew\nnot why, and he hurriedly began urging the horse on, not noticing that\nwhen riding up to the wormwood he had quite changed his direction and\nwas now heading the opposite way, though still imagining that he was\nriding towards where the hut should be. But the horse kept making\ntowards the right, and Vasili Andreevich kept guiding it to the left.\n\nAgain something dark appeared in front of him. Again he rejoiced,\nconvinced that now it was certainly a village. But once more it was the\nsame boundary line overgrown with wormwood, once more the same wormwood\ndesperately tossed by the wind and carrying unreasoning terror to his\nheart. But its being the same wormwood was not all, for beside it\nthere was a horse\'s track partly snowed over. Vasili Andreevich stopped,\nstooped down and looked carefully. It was a horse-track only partially\ncovered with snow, and could be none but his own horse\'s hoofprints. He\nhad evidently gone round in a small circle. \'I shall perish like that!\'\nhe thought, and not to give way to his terror he urged on the horse\nstill more, peering into the snowy darkness in which he saw only\nflitting and fitful points of light. Once he thought he heard the\nbarking of dogs or the howling of wolves, but the sounds were so faint\nand indistinct that he did not know whether he heard them or merely\nimagined them, and he stopped and began to listen intently.\n\nSuddenly some terrible, deafening cry resounded near his ears, and\neverything shivered and shook under him. He seized Mukhorty\'s neck,\nbut that too was shaking all over and the terrible cry grew still more\nfrightful. For some seconds Vasili Andreevich could not collect himself\nor understand what was happening. It was only that Mukhorty, whether\nto encourage himself or to call for help, had neighed loudly and\nresonantly. \'Ugh, you wretch! How you frightened me, damn you!\' thought\nVasili Andreevich. But even when he understood the cause of his terror\nhe could not shake it off.\n\n\'I must calm myself and think things over,\' he said to himself, but yet\nhe could not stop, and continued to urge the horse on, without noticing\nthat he was now going with the wind instead of against it. His body,\nespecially between his legs where it touched the pad of the harness and\nwas not covered by his overcoats, was getting painfully cold, especially\nwhen the horse walked slowly. His legs and arms trembled and his\nbreathing came fast. He saw himself perishing amid this dreadful snowy\nwaste, and could see no means of escape.\n\nSuddenly the horse under him tumbled into something and, sinking into\na snow-drift, began to plunge and fell on his side. Vasili Andreevich\njumped off, and in so doing dragged to one side the breechband on which\nhis foot was resting, and twisted round the pad to which he held as he\ndismounted. As soon as he had jumped off, the horse struggled to his\nfeet, plunged forward, gave one leap and another, neighed again, and\ndragging the drugget and the breechband after him, disappeared, leaving\nVasili Andreevich alone on the snow-drift.\n\nThe latter pressed on after the horse, but the snow lay so deep and\nhis coats were so heavy that, sinking above his knees at each step, he\nstopped breathless after taking not more than twenty steps. \'The copse,\nthe oxen, the lease-hold, the shop, the tavern, the house with the\niron-roofed barn, and my heir,\' thought he. \'How can I leave all that?\nWhat does this mean? It cannot be!\' These thoughts flashed through his\nmind. Then he thought of the wormwood tossed by the wind, which he had\ntwice ridden past, and he was seized with such terror that he did not\nbelieve in the reality of what was happening to him. \'Can this be a\ndream?\' he thought, and tried to wake up but could not. It was real snow\nthat lashed his face and covered him and chilled his right hand from\nwhich he had lost the glove, and this was a real desert in which he was\nnow left alone like that wormwood, awaiting an inevitable, speedy, and\nmeaningless death.\n\n\'Queen of Heaven! Holy Father Nicholas, teacher of temperance!\' he\nthought, recalling the service of the day before and the holy icon with\nits black face and gilt frame, and the tapers which he sold to be set\nbefore that icon and which were almost immediately brought back to him\nscarcely burnt at all, and which he put away in the store-chest. He\nbegan to pray to that same Nicholas the Wonder-Worker to save him,\npromising him a thanksgiving service and some candles. But he clearly\nand indubitably realized that the icon, its frame, the candles,\nthe priest, and the thanksgiving service, though very important and\nnecessary in church, could do nothing for him here, and that there was\nand could be no connexion between those candles and services and his\npresent disastrous plight. \'I must not despair,\' he thought. \'I must\nfollow the horse\'s track before it is snowed under. He will lead me out,\nor I may even catch him. Only I must not hurry, or I shall stick fast\nand be more lost than ever.\'\n\nBut in spite of his resolution to go quietly, he rushed forward and\neven ran, continually falling, getting up and falling again. The horse\'s\ntrack was already hardly visible in places where the snow did not lie\ndeep. \'I am lost!\' thought Vasili Andreevich. \'I shall lose the track\nand not catch the horse.\' But at that moment he saw something black. It\nwas Mukhorty, and not only Mukhorty, but the sledge with the shafts\nand the kerchief. Mukhorty, with the sacking and the breechband twisted\nround to one side, was standing not in his former place but nearer to\nthe shafts, shaking his head which the reins he was stepping on drew\ndownwards. It turned out that Vasili Andreevich had sunk in the same\nravine Nikita had previously fallen into, and that Mukhorty had been\nbringing him back to the sledge and he had got off his back no more than\nfifty paces from where the sledge was.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nHaving stumbled back to the sledge Vasili Andreevich caught hold of it\nand for a long time stood motionless, trying to calm himself and recover\nhis breath. Nikita was not in his former place, but something, already\ncovered with snow, was lying in the sledge and Vasili Andreevich\nconcluded that this was Nikita. His terror had now quite left him, and\nif he felt any fear it was lest the dreadful terror should return that\nhe had experienced when on the horse and especially when he was left\nalone in the snow-drift. At any cost he had to avoid that terror, and\nto keep it away he must do something--occupy himself with something. And\nthe first thing he did was to turn his back to the wind and open his fur\ncoat. Then, as soon as he recovered his breath a little, he shook the\nsnow out of his boots and out of his left-hand glove (the right-hand\nglove was hopelessly lost and by this time probably lying somewhere\nunder a dozen inches of snow); then as was his custom when going out of\nhis shop to buy grain from the peasants, he pulled his girdle low down\nand tightened it and prepared for action. The first thing that occurred\nto him was to free Mukhorty\'s leg from the rein. Having done that, and\ntethered him to the iron cramp at the front of the sledge where he\nhad been before, he was going round the horse\'s quarters to put the\nbreechband and pad straight and cover him with the cloth, but at that\nmoment he noticed that something was moving in the sledge and Nikita\'s\nhead rose up out of the snow that covered it. Nikita, who was half\nfrozen, rose with great difficulty and sat up, moving his hand before\nhis nose in a strange manner just as if he were driving away flies. He\nwaved his hand and said something, and seemed to Vasili Andreevich to be\ncalling him. Vasili Andreevich left the cloth unadjusted and went up to\nthe sledge.\n\n\'What is it?\' he asked. \'What are you saying?\'\n\n\'I\'m dy... ing, that\'s what,\' said Nikita brokenly and with\ndifficulty. \'Give what is owing to me to my lad, or to my wife, no\nmatter.\'\n\n\'Why, are you really frozen?\' asked Vasili Andreevich.\n\n\'I feel it\'s my death. Forgive me for Christ\'s sake...\' said Nikita\nin a tearful voice, continuing to wave his hand before his face as if\ndriving away flies.\n\nVasili Andreevich stood silent and motionless for half a minute. Then\nsuddenly, with the same resolution with which he used to strike hands\nwhen making a good purchase, he took a step back and turning up his\nsleeves began raking the snow off Nikita and out of the sledge. Having\ndone this he hurriedly undid his girdle, opened out his fur coat, and\nhaving pushed Nikita down, lay down on top of him, covering him not\nonly with his fur coat but with the whole of his body, which glowed\nwith warmth. After pushing the skirts of his coat between Nikita and\nthe sides of the sledge, and holding down its hem with his knees, Vasili\nAndreevich lay like that face down, with his head pressed against the\nfront of the sledge. Here he no longer heard the horse\'s movements or\nthe whistling of the wind, but only Nikita\'s breathing. At first and for\na long time Nikita lay motionless, then he sighed deeply and moved.\n\n\'There, and you say you are dying! Lie still and get warm, that\'s our\nway...\' began Vasili Andreevich.\n\nBut to his great surprise he could say no more, for tears came to his\neyes and his lower jaw began to quiver rapidly. He stopped speaking\nand only gulped down the risings in his throat. \'Seems I was badly\nfrightened and have gone quite weak,\' he thought. But this weakness was\nnot only unpleasant, but gave him a peculiar joy such as he had never\nfelt before.\n\n\'That\'s our way!\' he said to himself, experiencing a strange and solemn\ntenderness. He lay like that for a long time, wiping his eyes on the fur\nof his coat and tucking under his knee the right skirt, which the wind\nkept turning up.\n\nBut he longed so passionately to tell somebody of his joyful condition\nthat he said: \'Nikita!\'\n\n\'It\'s comfortable, warm!\' came a voice from beneath.\n\n\'There, you see, friend, I was going to perish. And you would have been\nfrozen, and I should have...\'\n\nBut again his jaws began to quiver and his eyes to fill with tears, and\nhe could say no more.\n\n\'Well, never mind,\' he thought. \'I know about myself what I know.\'\n\nHe remained silent and lay like that for a long time.\n\nNikita kept him warm from below and his fur coats from above. Only his\nhands, with which he kept his coat-skirts down round Nikita\'s sides, and\nhis legs which the wind kept uncovering, began to freeze, especially his\nright hand which had no glove. But he did not think of his legs or of\nhis hands but only of how to warm the peasant who was lying under him.\nHe looked out several times at Mukhorty and could see that his back was\nuncovered and the drugget and breeching lying on the snow, and that he\nought to get up and cover him, but he could not bring himself to leave\nNikita and disturb even for a moment the joyous condition he was in. He\nno longer felt any kind of terror.\n\n\'No fear, we shan\'t lose him this time!\' he said to himself, referring\nto his getting the peasant warm with the same boastfulness with which he\nspoke of his buying and selling.\n\nVasili Andreevich lay in that way for one hour, another, and a third,\nbut he was unconscious of the passage of time. At first impressions\nof the snow-storm, the sledge-shafts, and the horse with the shaft-bow\nshaking before his eyes, kept passing through his mind, then he\nremembered Nikita lying under him, then recollections of the festival,\nhis wife, the police-officer, and the box of candles, began to mingle\nwith these; then again Nikita, this time lying under that box, then the\npeasants, customers and traders, and the white walls of his house with\nits iron roof with Nikita lying underneath, presented themselves to\nhis imagination. Afterwards all these impressions blended into one\nnothingness. As the colours of the rainbow unite into one white light,\nso all these different impressions mingled into one, and he fell asleep.\n\nFor a long time he slept without dreaming, but just before dawn the\nvisions recommenced. It seemed to him that he was standing by the box of\ntapers and that Tikhon\'s wife was asking for a five kopek taper for the\nChurch fete. He wished to take one out and give it to her, but his hands\nwould not lift, being held tight in his pockets. He wanted to walk round\nthe box but his feet would not move and his new clean goloshes had grown\nto the stone floor, and he could neither lift them nor get his feet out\nof the goloshes. Then the taper-box was no longer a box but a bed, and\nsuddenly Vasili Andreevich saw himself lying in his bed at home. He was\nlying in his bed and could not get up. Yet it was necessary for him to\nget up because Ivan Matveich, the police-officer, would soon call for\nhim and he had to go with him--either to bargain for the forest or to\nput Mukhorty\'s breeching straight.\n\nHe asked his wife: \'Nikolaevna, hasn\'t he come yet?\' \'No, he hasn\'t,\'\nshe replied. He heard someone drive up to the front steps. \'It must be\nhim.\' \'No, he\'s gone past.\' \'Nikolaevna! I say, Nikolaevna, isn\'t he\nhere yet?\' \'No.\' He was still lying on his bed and could not get up, but\nwas always waiting. And this waiting was uncanny and yet joyful. Then\nsuddenly his joy was completed. He whom he was expecting came; not Ivan\nMatveich the police-officer, but someone else--yet it was he whom he had\nbeen waiting for. He came and called him; and it was he who had called\nhim and told him to lie down on Nikita. And Vasili Andreevich was glad\nthat that one had come for him.\n\n\'I\'m coming!\' he cried joyfully, and that cry awoke him, but woke him up\nnot at all the same person he had been when he fell asleep. He tried to\nget up but could not, tried to move his arm and could not, to move his\nleg and also could not, to turn his head and could not. He was surprised\nbut not at all disturbed by this. He understood that this was death, and\nwas not at all disturbed by that either.\n\nHe remembered that Nikita was lying under him and that he had got warm\nand was alive, and it seemed to him that he was Nikita and Nikita was\nhe, and that his life was not in himself but in Nikita. He strained his\nears and heard Nikita breathing and even slightly snoring. \'Nikita is\nalive, so I too am alive!\' he said to himself triumphantly.\n\nAnd he remembered his money, his shop, his house, the buying and\nselling, and Mironov\'s millions, and it was hard for him to understand\nwhy that man, called Vasili Brekhunov, had troubled himself with all\nthose things with which he had been troubled.\n\n\'Well, it was because he did not know what the real thing was,\' he\nthought, concerning that Vasili Brekhunov. \'He did not know, but now I\nknow and know for sure. Now I know!\' And again he heard the voice of\nthe one who had called him before. \'I\'m coming! Coming!\' he responded\ngladly, and his whole being was filled with joyful emotion. He felt\nhimself free and that nothing could hold him back any longer.\n\nAfter that Vasili Andreevich neither saw, heard, nor felt anything more\nin this world.\n\nAll around the snow still eddied. The same whirlwinds of snow circled\nabout, covering the dead Vasili Andreevich\'s fur coat, the shivering\nMukhorty, the sledge, now scarcely to be seen, and Nikita lying at the\nbottom of it, kept warm beneath his dead master.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nNikita awoke before daybreak. He was aroused by the cold that had begun\nto creep down his back. He had dreamt that he was coming from the mill\nwith a load of his master\'s flour and when crossing the stream had\nmissed the bridge and let the cart get stuck. And he saw that he had\ncrawled under the cart and was trying to lift it by arching his back.\nBut strange to say the cart did not move, it stuck to his back and he\ncould neither lift it nor get out from under it. It was crushing the\nwhole of his loins. And how cold it felt! Evidently he must crawl out.\n\'Have done!\' he exclaimed to whoever was pressing the cart down on him.\n\'Take out the sacks!\' But the cart pressed down colder and colder,\nand then he heard a strange knocking, awoke completely, and remembered\neverything. The cold cart was his dead and frozen master lying upon him.\nAnd the knock was produced by Mukhorty, who had twice struck the sledge\nwith his hoof.\n\n\'Andreevich! Eh, Andreevich!\' Nikita called cautiously, beginning to\nrealize the truth, and straightening his back. But Vasili Andreevich did\nnot answer and his stomach and legs were stiff and cold and heavy like\niron weights.\n\n\'He must have died! May the Kingdom of Heaven be his!\' thought Nikita.\n\nHe turned his head, dug with his hand through the snow about him and\nopened his eyes. It was daylight; the wind was whistling as before\nbetween the shafts, and the snow was falling in the same way, except\nthat it was no longer driving against the frame of the sledge but\nsilently covered both sledge and horse deeper and deeper, and neither\nthe horse\'s movements nor his breathing were any longer to be heard.\n\n\'He must have frozen too,\' thought Nikita of Mukhorty, and indeed those\nhoof knocks against the sledge, which had awakened Nikita, were the last\nefforts the already numbed Mukhorty had made to keep on his feet before\ndying.\n\n\'O Lord God, it seems Thou art calling me too!\' said Nikita. \'Thy Holy\nWill be done. But it\'s uncanny.... Still, a man can\'t die twice and\nmust die once. If only it would come soon!\'\n\nAnd he again drew in his head, closed his eyes, and became unconscious,\nfully convinced that now he was certainly and finally dying.\n\n\nIt was not till noon that day that peasants dug Vasili Andreevich and\nNikita out of the snow with their shovels, not more than seventy yards\nfrom the road and less than half a mile from the village.\n\nThe snow had hidden the sledge, but the shafts and the kerchief tied to\nthem were still visible. Mukhorty, buried up to his belly in snow, with\nthe breeching and drugget hanging down, stood all white, his dead head\npressed against his frozen throat: icicles hung from his nostrils, his\neyes were covered with hoar-frost as though filled with tears, and he\nhad grown so thin in that one night that he was nothing but skin and\nbone.\n\nVasili Andreevich was stiff as a frozen carcass, and when they rolled\nhim off Nikita his legs remained apart and his arms stretched out as\nthey had been. His bulging hawk eyes were frozen, and his open mouth\nunder his clipped moustache was full of snow. But Nikita though chilled\nthrough was still alive. When he had been brought to, he felt sure\nthat he was already dead and that what was taking place with him was\nno longer happening in this world but in the next. When he heard the\npeasants shouting as they dug him out and rolled the frozen body of\nVasili Andreevich from off him, he was at first surprised that in the\nother world peasants should be shouting in the same old way and had the\nsame kind of body, and then when he realized that he was still in this\nworld he was sorry rather than glad, especially when he found that the\ntoes on both his feet were frozen.\n\nNikita lay in hospital for two months. They cut off three of his toes,\nbut the others recovered so that he was still able to work and went on\nliving for another twenty years, first as a farm-labourer, then in his\nold age as a watchman. He died at home as he had wished, only this year,\nunder the icons with a lighted taper in his hands. Before he died he\nasked his wife\'s forgiveness and forgave her for the cooper. He also\ntook leave of his son and grandchildren, and died sincerely glad that\nhe was relieving his son and daughter-in-law of the burden of having to\nfeed him, and that he was now really passing from this life of which\nhe was weary into that other life which every year and every hour grew\nclearer and more desirable to him. Whether he is better or worse off\nthere where he awoke after his death, whether he was disappointed or\nfound there what he expected, we shall all soon learn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
