It is Tolstoy\'s desire that his books shall not be\ncopyrighted, and as we share this view, all =Free Age Press=\ntranslations and editions (with one, as yet unavoidable exception), are\nand will be issued free of copyright and may be reprinted by anyone. We\nhave already commenced to collect all Tolstoy\'s essays into more\npermanent cloth-bound volumes.\n\nSuggestions, inquiries, offers of help and co-operation will be\ngratefully welcomed.

(Luke\xc2\xa0xviii. 25.)\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nAfter having passed the greater part of my life in the country, I came\nat length, in the year 1881, to reside in Moscow, where I was\nimmediately struck with the extreme state of pauperism in that city.\nThough well acquainted with the privations of the poor in rural\ndistricts, I had not the faintest conception of their actual condition\nin towns.\n\nIn Moscow it is impossible to pass a street without meeting beggars of a\npeculiar kind, quite unlike those in the country, who go about there, as\nthe saying is, "with a bag and the name of Christ."\n\nThe Moscow beggars neither carry a bag nor ask for alms. In most cases\nwhen they meet you, they try to catch your eye, and then act according\nto the expression of your face.\n\nI know of one such, a bankrupt gentleman. He is an old man who advances\nslowly, limping painfully with each leg. When he meets you, he limps,\nand makes a bow. If you stop, he takes off his cap, ornamented with a\ncockade, bows again, and begs. If you do not stop, he pretends to be\nonly lame, and continues limping along.\n\nThat is a specimen of a genuine Moscow beggar, an experienced one.\n\nAt first I did not know why such mendicants did not ask openly; but\nafterwards I learned why, without understanding the reason.\n\nOne day I saw a policeman push a ragged peasant swollen with dropsy,\ninto a cab. I asked what he had been doing, and the policeman replied,--\n\n"Begging."\n\n"Is begging, then, forbidden?"\n\n"So it seems," he answered. As the man was being driven away, I took\nanother cab, and followed. I wished to find out whether begging was\nreally forbidden, and if so, why? I could not at all understand how it\nwas possible to forbid one man asking something from another; and,\nmoreover, I had my doubts whether it could be illegal in a city where it\nflourished to such an extent.\n\nI entered the police-station where the pauper had been taken, and asked\nan official armed with sword and pistol, and seated at a table, what he\nhad been arrested for.\n\nThe man looked up at me sharply, and said, "What business is that of\nyours?"\n\nHowever, feeling the necessity of some explanation, he added, "The\nauthorities order such fellows to be arrested, so I suppose it is\nnecessary."\n\nI went away. The policeman who had brought the man was sitting in the\nwindow of the ante-room, studying his note-book. I said to him,--\n\n"Is it really true that poor people are not allowed to ask for alms in\nChrist\'s name?"\n\nThe man started, as if waking up from a sleep, stared at me, then\nrelapsed again into a state of stolid indifference, and, reseating\nhimself on the window-sill, said,--\n\n"The authorities require it, so you see it is necessary."\n\nAs he became again absorbed in his note-book, I went down the steps\ntowards my cab.\n\n"Well! have they locked him up?" asked the cabman. He had evidently\nbecome interested in the matter.\n\n"They have," I answered. He shook his head.\n\n"Is begging forbidden in Moscow, then?" I asked.\n\n"I can\'t tell you," he said.\n\n"But how can a man be locked up," I said, "for begging in the name of\nChrist?"\n\n"Nowadays things have changed, and you see it is forbidden," he\nanswered.\n\nSince then, I have often seen policemen taking paupers to the\npolice-station and thence to the work-house. Indeed, I once met a whole\ncrowd of these poor creatures, about thirty, escorted before and behind\nby policemen. I asked what they had been doing.\n\n"Begging," was the reply.\n\nIt appears that, according to law, begging is forbidden in Moscow,\nnotwithstanding the great number of beggars one meets there in every\nstreet, notwithstanding the rows of them near the churches during\nservice-time, and especially at funerals. But why are some caught and\nlocked up, while others are let alone? This I have not been able to find\nout. Either there are lawful and unlawful beggars amongst them, or else\nthere are so many that it is impossible to catch them all; or, perhaps,\nthough some are taken up, others fill their places.\n\nThere is a great variety of such beggars in Moscow. There are those who\nlive by begging. There are also entirely honest destitute people who\nhave somehow chanced to reach Moscow and are really in extreme need.\n\nAmongst the latter are men and women evidently from the country. I have\noften met these. Some of them, who had fallen ill and afterwards\nrecovered and left the hospital, could now find no means, either of\nfeeding themselves, or of getting away from Moscow; some of them,\nbesides, had taken to drink (this was probably the case with the man\nwith dropsy whom I met); some were in good health, but had been burned\nout of house and home, or else were very old, or were widowed or\ndeserted women with children; and some others had sound health, and were\nquite capable of working.\n\nThese robust people especially interested me,--the more so, because,\nsince my arrival in Moscow, I had contracted the habit of going to the\nSparrow Hills for the sake of exercise, and working there with two\npeasants who sawed wood. These men were exactly like the beggars whom I\noften met in the streets. One, called Peter, was an ex-soldier from\nKaluga; the other, Simon, was from Vlad\xc3\xadmir. They possessed nothing save\nthe clothes on their backs: and they earned, by working very hard, from\nforty to forty-five kopeks (8d. to 9d.) a day; out of this they both put\na little aside,--the Kaluga soldier, to buy a fur coat; the Vlad\xc3\xadmir\npeasant, to get money enough to return to his home in the country.\n\nMeeting in the streets similar men, I was therefore particularly\ninterested in them, and could not understand why some begged whilst\nothers worked.\n\nWhenever I met a beggar of this description, I used to ask him how it\nwas that he had come to such a state. Once I met a strong,\nhealthy-looking peasant who asked alms. I questioned him as to who he\nwas, and whence he had come.\n\nHe told me he had come from Kaluga, in search of work. He had at first\nfound some, such as sawing old timber into fire-wood; but after he and\nhis companion had finished that job, though they had continually looked\nfor it, they had not found any more work, his mate had left him, and he\nhimself had passed a fortnight in the utmost need, and having sold all\nhe had to get food, now had not enough even to buy the necessary tools\nfor sawing.\n\nI gave him money to get a saw, and told him where to go for work. I had\npreviously arranged with Peter and Simon that they should accept a new\nfellow-worker, and find him a mate.\n\n"Be sure you come! There is plenty of work to be done," I said on\nparting.\n\n"You can reckon on me," he answered. "Do you think there is any pleasure\nin knocking about, begging, if I can work?"\n\nThe man solemnly promised that he would come; and he seemed honest, and\nreally meaning to work.\n\nNext day, on coming to my friends, Peter and Simon, I asked them whether\nthe man had arrived. They said he had not; and, indeed, he never came at\nall. In this way I was frequently deceived.\n\nI have also been deceived by those who said that they only wanted a\nlittle money to buy a ticket to return home, and whom I met in the\nstreets again a few days later. Many of them I came to know well, and\nthey knew me; though occasionally having forgotten me, they would repeat\nthe same false tale; but sometimes they would turn away on recognizing\nme.\n\nIn this way I discovered, that, even in this class of men, there are\nmany rogues.\n\nStill, these poor rogues were also very much to be pitied: they were all\nragged and hungry; they were of the sort who die of cold in the streets,\nor hang themselves to escape life, as the papers frequently tell us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nWhen I talked to my town friends about this pauperism which surrounded\nthem, they always replied, "Oh! you have seen nothing yet! You should go\nto the Khitrof Market, and visit the lodging-houses there, if you want\nto see the genuine \'Golden Company.\'"\n\nOne jovial friend of mine added, that the number of these paupers had so\nincreased, that they already formed not a "Golden Company," but a\n"Golden Regiment."\n\nMy witty friend was right; but he would have been yet nearer the truth\nhad he said that these men formed, in Moscow, not a company, nor a\nregiment, but a whole army,--an army, I should judge, of about fifty\nthousand.\n\nThe regular townspeople, when they spoke to me about the pauperism of\nthe city, always seemed to feel a certain pleasure or pride in being\nable to give me such precise information.\n\nI remember I noticed, when visiting London, that the citizens there\nseemed also to find a certain satisfaction in telling me about London\ndestitution, as though it were something to be proud of.\n\nHowever, wishing to inspect this poverty about which I had heard so\nmuch, I had turned my steps very often towards the Khitrof Market,--but\non each occasion I felt a sensation of pain and shame. "Why should you\ngo to look at the suffering of human beings whom you cannot help?" said\none voice within me. "If you live here, and see all that is pleasant in\ntown life, go and see also what is wretched," replied another.\n\nAnd so, one cold, windy day in December, two years ago (1883), I went to\nthe Khitrof Market, the centre of the town pauperism.\n\nIt was on a week-day, about four in the afternoon. While still a good\ndistance off I noticed greater and greater numbers of men in strange\nclothes,--evidently not originally meant for them,--and in yet stranger\nfoot-wear; men of a peculiar unhealthy complexion, and all apparently\nshowing a remarkable indifference to everything that surrounded them.\n\nMen in the strangest, most incongruous costumes sauntered along,\nevidently without the least thought as to how they might look in the\neyes of others. They were all going in the same direction. Without\nasking the way, which was unknown to me, I followed them, and came to\nthe Khitrof Market.\n\nThere I found women likewise in ragged capes, rough cloaks, jackets,\nboots, and goloshes. Perfectly free and easy in their manner,\nnotwithstanding the grotesque monstrosity of their attire, these women,\nold and young, were sitting, bargaining, strolling about, and abusing\none another.\n\nMarket-time having evidently passed, there were not many people there;\nand as most of them were going up-hill, through the market-place, and\nall in the same direction, I followed them.\n\nThe farther I went, the greater became the stream of people flowing into\nthe one road. Having passed the market, and gone up the street, I found\nthat I was following two women, one old, the other young. Both were\nclothed in some grey ragged stuff. They were talking, as they walked,\nabout some kind of business.\n\nEvery expression was unfailingly accompanied by some obscene word.\nNeither was drunk, but each absorbed with her own affairs; and the\npassing men, and those about them, paid not the slightest attention to\ntheir language, which sounded so strange to me. It appeared to be the\ngenerally accepted manner of speech in those parts. On the left we\npassed some private night-lodging-houses, and some of the crowd entered\nthese; others continued to ascend the hill towards a large corner house.\nThe majority of the people walking along with me went into this house.\nBefore it, people all of the same sort were standing and sitting, on the\nsidewalk and in the snow.\n\nAt the right of the entrance were women; at the left, men. I passed by\nthe men: I passed by the women (there were several hundreds in all), and\nstopped where the crowd ceased.\n\nThis building was the "Liapin free night-lodging-house" ("doss-house").\nThe crowd was composed of night-lodgers, waiting to be let in. At five\no\'clock in the evening this house is opened and the crowd admitted.\nHither came almost all the people whom I followed.\n\nI remained standing where the file of men ended. Those nearest stared at\nme till I had to look at them. The remnants of garments covering their\nbodies were very various; but the one expression of the eyes of all\nalike seemed to be, "Why are you, a man from another world, stopping\nhere with us? Who are you? Are you a self-satisfied man of wealth,\ndesiring to be gladdened by the sight of our need, to divert yourself in\nyour idleness, and to mock at us? or are you that which does not and can\nnot exist,--a man who pities us?"\n\nOn all their faces the same question was written. Each would look at me,\nmeet my eyes, and turn away again.\n\nI wanted to speak to some of them, but for a long time I could not\nsummon up courage. However, eventually our mutual exchange of glances\nintroduced us to each other; and we felt that, however widely separated\nmight be our social positions in life, we were still fellow-men, and so\nwe ceased to be afraid of one another.\n\nNext to me stood a peasant with a swollen face and red beard, in a\nragged jacket, with worn-out goloshes on his naked feet, though there\nwere eight degrees of frost.[1] For the third or fourth time our eyes\nmet; and I felt so drawn to him that I was no longer ashamed to address\nhim (to have refrained from doing so would have been the only real\nshame), and I asked him where he came from.\n\n  [1] R\xc3\xa9aumur.\n\nHe answered eagerly, while a crowd began to collect round us, that he\nhad come from Smolensk in search of work, to be able to buy bread and\npay his taxes.\n\n"There is no work to be had nowadays," he said: "the soldiers have got\nhold of it all. So here am I knocking about; and God is my witness, I\nhave not had any thing to eat for two days."\n\nHe said this shyly, with an attempt at a smile. A seller[2] of warm\ndrinks, an old soldier, was standing near. I called him, and made him\npour out a glass. The peasant took the warm vessel in his hands, and,\nbefore drinking, warmed them against the glass, trying not to lose any\nof the precious heat; and whilst doing this he related to me his story.\n\n  [2] A sbiten-seller: _sbiten_ is a hot drink made of herbs or spices\n  and molasses\n\nThe adventures of these people, or at least the stories which they tell,\nare almost always the same: He had had a little work; then it had\nceased: and here, in the night-lodging-house, his purse, containing his\nmoney and passport, had been stolen from him. Now he could not leave\nMoscow.\n\nHe told me that during the day he warmed himself in public-houses,\neating any stale crust of bread which might be given him. His night\'s\nlodging here in Liapin\'s house cost him nothing.\n\nHe was only waiting for the round of the police-sergeant to lock him up\nfor being without his passport, when he would be sent on foot, with a\nparty of men similarly situated, to the place of his birth.\n\n"They say the inspection will take place on Thursday, when I shall be\ntaken up; so I must try and keep on until then." (The prison and his\ncompulsory journey appeared to him as the "promised land.") While he was\nspeaking, two or three men in the crowd said they were also in exactly\nthe same situation.\n\nA thin, pale youth, with a long nose, only a shirt upon his back, and\nthat torn about the shoulders, and a tattered cap on his head, edged his\nway to me through the crowd. He was shivering violently all the time,\nbut tried, as he caught my eye, to smile scornfully at the peasant\'s\nconversation, thinking thus to show his superiority.\n\nI offered him some drink.\n\nHe warmed his hands on the tumbler as the other had done; but just as he\nbegan to speak, he was shouldered aside by a big, black, hook-nosed,\nbare-headed fellow, in a thin shirt and waistcoat, who also asked for\nsome drink.\n\nThen a tall old man, with a thin beard, in an overcoat fastened round\nthe waist with a cord, and in bark shoes, had some. He was drunk.\n\nThen came a little man, with a swollen face and wet eyes, in a coarse\nbrown jacket, with his knees protruding through his torn trousers and\nknocking against each other with cold. He shivered so that he could not\nhold the glass, and spilled the contents over his clothes: the others\nbegan to abuse him, but he only grinned miserably, and shivered.\n\nAfter him came an ugly, deformed man in rags, and with bare feet. Then\nan individual of the officer type; another belonging to the church\nclass; then a strange-looking being without a nose,--all of them hungry,\ncold, suppliant, and humble,--crowded round me, and stretched out their\nhands for the glass; but the drink was exhausted. Then one man asked for\nmoney: I gave him some. A second and a third followed, till the whole\ncrowd pressed on me. In the general confusion the gatekeeper of the\nneighbouring house shouted to the crowd to clear the pavement before his\nhouse, and the people submissively obeyed.\n\nSome of them undertook to control the tumult, and took me under their\nprotection. They attempted to drag me out of the crush. But the crowd\nthat formerly had lined the pavement in a long file, had now become\ncondensed about me. Every one looked at me and begged; and it seemed as\nif each face were more pitiful, harassed, and degraded than the other. I\ndistributed all the money I had,--only about twenty rubles,--and entered\nthe lodging-house with the crowd. The house was an enormous one, and\nconsisted of four parts. In the upper storeys were the men\'s rooms; on\nthe ground-floor the women\'s. I went first into the women\'s\ndormitory,--a large room, filled with beds resembling the berths in a\nthird-class railway-carriage. They were arranged in two tiers, one above\nthe other.\n\nStrange-looking women in ragged dresses, without jackets, old and young,\nkept coming in and occupying places, some below, others climbing above.\nSome of the elder ones crossed themselves, pronouncing the name of the\nfounder of the refuge. Some laughed and swore.\n\nI went up-stairs. There, in a similar way, the men had taken their\nplaces. Amongst them I recognized one of those to whom I had given\nmoney. On seeing him I suddenly felt horribly ashamed, and made haste to\nleave.\n\nWith a sense of having committed some crime, I returned home. There I\nentered along the carpeted steps into the rug-covered hall, and, having\ntaken off my fur coat, sat down to a meal of five courses, served by two\nfootmen in livery, with white ties and white gloves. A scene of the past\ncame suddenly before me. Thirty years ago I saw a man\'s head cut off\nunder the guillotine in Paris before a crowd of thousands of spectators.\nI was aware that the man had been a great criminal: I was acquainted\nwith all the arguments in justification of capital punishment for such\noffences. I saw this execution carried out deliberately: but at the\nmoment that the head and body were severed from each other by the keen\nblade, I gasped, and realized in every fibre of my being, that all the\narguments which I had hitherto heard in favour of capital punishment\nwere wickedly false; that, no matter how many might agree that it was a\nlawful act, it was literally murder; whatever other title men might give\nit, they thus had virtually committed murder, that worst of all crimes:\nand there was I, both by my silence and my non-interference, an aider,\nan abetter, and participator in the sin.\n\nSimilar convictions were again forced upon me when I now beheld the\nmisery, cold, hunger, and humiliation of thousands of my fellow-men. I\nrealized not only with my brain, but in every pulse of my soul, that,\nwhilst there were thousands of such sufferers in Moscow, I, with tens of\nthousands of others, daily filled myself to repletion with luxurious\ndainties of every description, took the tenderest care of my horses, and\nclothed my very floors with velvet carpets!\n\nWhatever the wise and learned of the world might say about it, however\nunalterable the course of life might seem to be, the same evil was\ncontinually being enacted, and I, by my own personal habits of luxury,\nwas a promoter of that evil.\n\nThe difference between the two cases was only this: that in the first,\nall I could have done would have been to shout out to the murderers\nstanding near the guillotine, who were accomplishing the deed, that they\nwere committing a murder, and by every means to try to hinder\nthem,--while, of course, knowing that my interference would be in vain.\nWhereas, in this second case, I might have given away, not only the\ndrink and the small sum of money I had with me, but also the coat from\noff my shoulders, and all that I possessed at home. Yet I had not done\nso, and therefore felt, and feel, and can never cease to feel, that I\nmyself am a partaker in a crime which is continually being committed, so\nlong as I have superfluous food whilst others have none, so long as I\nhave two coats whilst there exists one man without any.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nOn the same evening that I returned from Liapin\'s house, I imparted my\nimpressions to a friend: and he, a resident of the town, began to\nexplain to me, not without a certain satisfaction, that this was the\nmost natural state of things in a town; that it was only owing to my\nprovincialism that I found anything remarkable in it; and that it had\nalways been, and always would be so, such being one of the inevitable\nconditions of civilization. In London it was yet worse, etc., etc.,\ntherefore there could be nothing wrong about it, and there was nothing\nto be disturbed or troubled about.\n\nI began to argue with my friend, but with such warmth and so angrily,\nthat my wife rushed in from the adjoining room to ask what had happened.\nIt appeared that, without being aware of it, I had shouted out in an\nagonized voice, gesticulating wildly, "We should not go on living in\nthis way! we must not live so! we have no right!" I was rebuked for my\nunnecessary excitement; I was told that I could not talk quietly upon\nany question, that I was irritable; and it was pointed out to me that\nthe existence of such misery as I had witnessed was in no way a reason\nfor embittering the life of my home-circle.\n\nI felt that this was perfectly just, and held my tongue; but in the\ndepth of my soul I knew that I was right, and I could not quiet my\nconscience.\n\nThe town life, which had previously seemed alien and strange to me, now\nbecame so hateful that all the indulgencies of a luxurious existence, in\nwhich I had formerly delighted, began to torment me.\n\nHowever much I tried to find some kind of excuse for my mode of life, I\ncould not contemplate without irritation either my own or other people\'s\ndrawing-rooms, nor a clean, richly served dinner-table, nor a carriage\nwith well-fed coachman and horses, nor the shops, theatres, and\nentertainments. I could not help seeing, in contrast to all this, those\nhungry, shivering, and degraded inhabitants of the night-lodging-house.\nI could never free myself from the thought that these conditions were\ninseparable--that the one proceeded from the other. I remember that the\nsense of culpability which I had felt from the first moment never left\nme; but with this feeling another soon mingled, which lessened the\nfirst.\n\nWhen I talked to my intimate friends and acquaintances about my\nimpressions in Liapin\'s house, they all answered in the same way, and\nexpressed besides their appreciation of my kindness and\ntender-heartedness, and gave me to understand that the sight had\nimpressed me so because I, Leo Tolstoy, was kind-hearted and good. And I\nwillingly allowed myself to believe this.\n\nThe natural consequence of this was, that the first keen sense of\nself-reproach and shame became blunted, and was replaced by a sense of\nsatisfaction at my own virtue, and a desire to make it known to others.\n"It is, in truth," I said to myself, "probably not my connection with a\nluxurious life which is at fault, but the unavoidable circumstances of\nexistence. Therefore a change in my particular life would not alter the\nevil I had seen."\n\nIn changing my own life, I thought, I should only render myself and\nthose nearest and dearest to me miserable, whilst the other misery would\nremain; therefore my object should be, not to alter my own way of\nliving, as I had at first imagined, but to try as much as was in my\npower to _ameliorate_ the position of those unfortunate ones who had\nexcited my compassion. The whole matter, I reasoned, lies in the fact\nthat I, being an extremely kind and good man, wish to do good to my\nfellow-men.\n\nSo I began to arrange a plan of philanthropic activity in which I might\nexhibit all my virtues. I must, however, remark here, that, while\nplanning this charitable effort, in the depth of my heart I felt that I\nwas not doing the right thing; but, as too often happens, reason and\nimagination stifled the voice of conscience.\n\nAbout this time the census was being taken, and this seemed to me a good\nopportunity for instituting that charitable organization in which I\nwanted to shine.\n\nI was acquainted with many philanthropic institutions and societies\nalready existing in Moscow, but all their activity seemed to me both\ninsignificant and wrongly directed in comparison with what I myself\nwished to do.\n\nThis was what I invented to excite sympathy amongst the rich for the\npoor: I began to collect money, and to enlist men who wished to help in\nthe work, and who would, in company with the census officers, visit all\nthe nests of pauperism, entering into relations with the poor, finding\nout the details of their needs, aiding them with money and work, sending\nthem out of Moscow, placing their children in schools, and their old men\nand women in homes and houses of refuge.\n\nI thought, moreover, that from those who undertook this work a permanent\nsociety could be formed, which, by dividing between its members the\nvarious districts of Moscow, could take care that new cases of want and\nmisery should be averted, and so by degrees pauperism might be stifled\nat its very beginning, not so much by cure, as by prevention.\n\nAlready I saw in the future the entire disappearance of begging and\npoverty, I having been the means of its accomplishment. Then we who were\nrich could go on living in all our luxury as before, dwelling in fine\nhouses, eating dinners of five courses, driving in our carriages to\ntheatres and entertainments, no longer being harassed by such sights as\nI had witnessed at Liapin\'s house.\n\nHaving invented this plan, I wrote an article about it; and, before even\ngiving it to the printers, I went to those acquaintances from whom I\nhoped to obtain co-operation, and expounded to all whom I visited that\nday (chiefly the rich) the ideas I afterwards published in my article.\n\nI proposed to profit by the census in order to study the state of\npauperism in Moscow, and to help exterminate it by personal effort and\nmoney, after which we might all with a quiet conscience enjoy our usual\npleasures. Everyone listened to me attentively and seriously; but, in\nevery case, I remarked that the moment my hearers came to understand\nwhat I was driving at, they seemed to become uncomfortable and somewhat\nembarrassed. It was principally, I feel sure, on my own account; because\nthey considered all that I said to be folly. It seemed as though some\noutside motive compelled my listeners to agree for the moment with my\nfoolishness.--"Oh, yes! Certainly. It would be delightful," they said:\n"of course it is impossible not to sympathize with you. Your idea is\nsplendid. I myself have had the same; but ... people here are so\nindifferent, that it is hardly reasonable to expect a great success.\nHowever, as far as I am concerned, I am, of course, ready to share in\nthe enterprise."\n\nSimilar answers I received from all. They consented, as it appeared to\nme, not because they were persuaded by my arguments, nor yet in\ncompliance with their own desire, but because of some exterior reason\nwhich rendered it impossible for them to refuse.\n\nI remarked this partly because none of those who promised me their help\nin the form of money, defined the sum they meant to give; so that I had\nto name the amount by asking, "May I count upon you for twenty-five, or\none hundred, or two hundred, or three hundred, rubles?" And not one of\nthem paid the money. I draw attention to this fact, because, when people\nare going to pay for what they are anxious to have, they are generally\nin haste to give it. If it is to secure a box to see Sarah Bernhardt,\nthe money is immediately produced; here, however, of all who agreed to\ngive, and expressed their sympathy, not one produced the amount, but\nmerely silently acquiesced in the sum I happened to name.\n\nIn the last house I visited that day there was a large party. The\nmistress of the house had for some years been employed in works of\ncharity. Several carriages were waiting at the door. Footmen in\nexpensive liveries were seated in the hall. In the spacious\ndrawing-room, ladies, old and young, wearing rich dresses and ornaments,\nwere talking to some young men, and dressing up small dolls, intended\nfor a lottery in aid of the poor.\n\nThe sight of this drawing-room and of the people assembled there struck\nme very painfully. For not only was their property worth several million\nrubles; not only would the interest on the capital spent here on\ndresses, laces, bronzes, jewels, carriages, horses, liveries, footmen,\nexceed a hundred times the value of these ladies\' work,--but even the\nexpenses caused by this very party of ladies and gentlemen, the gloves,\nthe linen, candles, tea, sugar, cakes, all this represented a sum a\nhundred times greater than the value of the work done.\n\nI saw all this, and therefore might have understood that here, at all\nevents, I should not find sympathy with my plan, but I had come in order\nto give a proposal, and, however painful it was, I said what I wished to\nsay, repeating almost the words of my article.\n\nOne lady present offered me some money, adding that, owing to her\nsensibilities, she did not feel strong enough to visit the poor herself,\nbut that she would give help in this form. How much money, and when she\nwould give it, she did not say. Another lady and a young man offered\ntheir services in visiting the poor, but I did not profit by their\noffer. The principal person I addressed told me that it would be\nimpossible to do much, because the means were not forthcoming. The means\nwere scarce, because all the rich men in Moscow who were known and could\nbe counted upon had already given all it was possible to get from them,\ntheir charities had already been rewarded with titles, medals, and other\ndistinctions,--which was the only effectual way to ensure success in the\ncollection of money; and to obtain new honors from the authorities was\nvery difficult.\n\nWhen I returned home I went to bed, not only with a presentiment that\nnothing would result from my idea, but also with the shameful\nconsciousness of having been doing something vile and contemptible the\nwhole day. However, I did not desist.\n\nFirst, the work had been begun, and false shame prevented my giving it\nup; second, not only the success of the enterprise itself, but even my\npart in it, afforded me the possibility of continuing to live in my\nusual way; whereas the failure of this enterprise would have put me\nunder the constraint of giving up my present mode of life and of seeking\nanother. Of this, I was unconsciously afraid; and therefore I refused to\nlisten to my inner voice, and continued what I had begun.\n\nHaving sent my article to be printed, I read a proof-copy at a\ncensus-meeting in the town hall, hesitatingly, and blushing till my\ncheeks burned again. I felt very uncomfortable, and I saw that all my\nhearers were equally uncomfortable.\n\nOn my question, whether the managers of the census would accept my\nproposal that they should remain at their posts in order to form a link\nbetween society and those in need, an awkward silence ensued.\n\nThen two of those present made speeches, which seemed to mend the\nawkwardness of my suggestions. Sympathy for me was expressed along with\ntheir general approbation, but they pointed out the impracticability of\nmy scheme. Everyone immediately seemed more at ease; but afterwards,\nstill wishing to succeed, I asked each district manager separately,\nwhether during the census he was willing to investigate the needs of the\npoor and afterwards remain at his post in order to form this link\nbetween the poor and the rich, all were again confounded; it seemed as\nthough their looks said, "Why, we have listened to your silly\nproposition out of personal regard for you; but here you come with it\nagain!" This was the expression of their faces, but in words they told\nme that they consented; and two of them, separately, but as though they\nhad agreed together, said in the same words, "We regard it as our moral\nduty to do so." The same impression was produced by my words upon the\nstudents who had volunteered to act as clerks during the census, when I\ntold them that they might accomplish a charitable work besides their\nscientific pursuits.\n\nWhen we talked the matter over I noticed that they were shy of looking\nme straight in the face, as one often hesitates to look into the face of\na good-natured man who is talking nonsense. The same impression was\nproduced upon the editor of the paper when I handed my article to him;\nalso upon my son, my wife, and various other people. Every one seemed\nembarrassed, but all found it necessary to approve of the idea itself;\nand all, immediately after this approbation, began to express their\ndoubts as to the success of the plan, and, for some reason or other, all\nwithout exception took to condemning the indifference and coldness of\nsociety and of the world, though they evidently excluded themselves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nBy my request I was appointed to make the census of the section of\nKhamovnitchesky police district, near the Smolensky Market in the\nPrototchni Lane between the Shore Drive and Nicolsky Lane. In this\ndistrict are the houses known under the name of Rzhanoff House or\nRzhanoff Fortress. In bygone times these houses belonged to the merchant\nRzhanoff, and are now the property of the merchants Zeemin. I had long\nbefore heard that this was considered the lowest circle of poverty and\nvice, which was the reason why I asked the officers of the census to\nassign this district to me.\n\nMy desire was gratified.\n\nHaving received the appointment from the Town Council, I went alone, a\nfew days before the census, to inspect my district. With the help of a\nplan I soon found the Rzhanoff Houses,--approached by a street which\nterminated on the left-hand side of Nicolsky Lane--a gloomy building\nwithout any apparent entrance. From the aspect of this house I guessed\nit was the one I was in search of. Descending the street, I came across\nsome boys, from ten to fourteen years old, in short coats, who were\nsliding down the frozen gutter, some on their feet, others upon a single\nskate.\n\nThe boys were ragged, and, like all town boys, sharp and bold. I stopped\nto look at them. An old woman in torn clothes, with hanging yellow\ncheeks, came round the corner. She was going up-hill to Smolensky\nMarket, gasping painfully at every step, like a horse out of wind; and\nwhen abreast of me, stopped with hoarse, choking breath. In any other\nplace, this old woman would have asked alms, but here she only began to\ntalk.\n\n"Just look at them!" she said, pointing to the sliding boys; "always at\nmischief! They will become the same Rzhanoff good-for-nothings as their\nfathers." One boy, in an overcoat and cap without a peak, overhearing\nher words, stopped. "You shut up!" he shouted. "You\'re only an old\nRzhanoff goat yourself!"\n\nI asked the boy if he lived here. "Yes, and so does she. She stole some\nboots," he called out, and, pushing himself off, slid on.\n\nThe old woman began a torrent of abuse, interrupted by coughs. During\nthe squabble an old white-haired man, all in rags, came down the middle\nof the street, brandishing his arms, and carrying in one hand a bundle\nof small rusk rings. He seemed to have just fortified himself with a\nglass of liquor. He had evidently heard the old woman\'s abuse and took\nher side.\n\n"I\'ll give it you, you little devils!" he shouted, pretending to rush\nafter them; and, passing behind me, he stepped on the pavement. If you\nsaw this old man in the Artat, a fashionable street, you would be struck\nwith his air of decrepitude, feebleness, and poverty. Here he appeared\nas a merry workman returning from his day\'s labor.\n\nI followed him. He turned round the corner to the left into Prototchni, an\nalley, passed the front of the house and the gate, and disappeared through\nthe door of an inn. Into this alley opened the doors of the latter,\na public-house, and several small eating-houses. It was the Rzhanoff\nHouses. Every thing was gray, dirty, and foul-smelling,--buildings,\nlodgings, courts, and people. Most of those I met here were in tattered\nclothes, half naked. Some were passing along, others were running from\none door to another. Two were bargaining about some rags. I went round\nthe whole building, down another lane and a court, and, having returned,\nstopped at the archway of the Rzhanoff Houses.\n\nI wanted to go in and see what was going on inside, but the idea made me\nfeel painfully awkward. If they asked me what I had come for, what\nshould I say?\n\nHowever after a little hesitation I went in. The moment I entered the\ncourt I was conscious of a most revolting stench. The court was\ndreadfully dirty. I turned round the corner, and at the same instant\nheard steps running along the boards of the gallery and down the stairs.\n\nFirst a gaunt-looking woman, with tucked-up sleeves, a faded pink dress,\nand shoes on her stockingless feet, rushed out; after her, a\nrough-haired man in a red shirt, and extremely wide trousers, like a\npetticoat, and goloshes on his feet. The man caught her under the\nstairs: "You sha\'n\'t escape me," he said, laughing.\n\n"Just listen to the squint-eyed devil!" began the woman, who was\nevidently not averse to his attentions; but, having caught sight of me,\nshe exclaimed angrily, "Who are you looking for?" As I did not want\nanyone in particular, I felt somewhat confused, and went away.\n\nThis little incident, though by no means remarkable in itself, suddenly\nshowed me the work I was about to undertake in an entirely new light,\nespecially after what I had seen on the other side of the\ncourtyard,--the scolding woman, the light-hearted old man, and the\nsliding boys. I had meditated doing good to these people by the help of\nthe rich men of Moscow. I now realized, for the first time, that all\nthese poor unfortunates, whom I had been wishing to help, had, besides\nthe time they spent suffering from cold and hunger in waiting to get a\nlodging, several hours daily to get through, and that they must somehow\nfill up the rest of the twenty-four hours of every day,--a whole life,\nof which I had never thought before. I realized now, for the first time,\nthat all these people, besides the mere effort to find food and shelter\nfrom the cold, must live through the rest of every day of their life as\nother people have to do, must get angry at times, and be dull, and try\nto appear light-hearted, and be sad or merry. Now, for the first time\n(however strange the confession may sound), I was fully aware that the\ntask which I was undertaking could not simply consist in feeding and\nclothing a thousand people (just as one might feed a thousand head of\nsheep, and drive them into shelter), but must develop some more\nessential help. When I considered that each one of these individuals was\njust another man like myself, possessing also a past history, with the\nsame passions, temptations, and errors, the same thoughts, the same\nquestions to be answered, then suddenly the work before me appeared\nstupendous and I felt my own utter helplessness;--but it had begun and I\nwas resolved to go on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nOn the appointed day, the students who were to assist me started early\nin the morning; while I, the philanthropist, only joined them at twelve\no\'clock. I could not come earlier, as I did not get up till ten, after\nwhich I had to take some coffee, and then smoke for the sake of my\ndigestion. Twelve o\'clock, then, found me at the door of the Rzhanoff\nHouses. A policeman showed me a public-house to which the census-clerks\nreferred all those who wished to enquire for them. I entered, and found\nit very dirty and unsavoury. Here, right in front of me, was a counter;\nto the left a small room, furnished with tables covered with soiled\nnapkins; to the right a large room on pillars, containing similar little\ntables placed in the windows and along the walls; with men here and\nthere having tea, some very ragged, others well dressed, apparently\nworkmen or small shopkeepers. There were also several women. In spite of\nthe dirt, it was easy to see, by the business air of the man in charge,\nand the ready, obliging manners of the waiters, that the eating-house\nwas driving a good trade. I had no sooner entered than one of the\nwaiters was already preparing to assist me in getting off my overcoat,\nanxious to take my orders, and showing that evidently the people here\nwere in the habit of doing their work quickly and readily.\n\nMy enquiry for the census-clerks was answered by a call for "V\xc3\xa1nya" from\na little man dressed in foreign fashion, who was arranging something in\na cupboard behind the counter. This was the proprietor of the\npublic-house, a peasant from Kaluga, Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch by name, who also\nrented half of the other houses, sub-letting the rooms to lodgers. In\nanswer to his call, a thin, sallow-faced, hook-nosed lad, about eighteen\nyears old, came forward hastily. The landlord said, "Take this gentleman\nto the clerks: they have gone to the main body of the building over the\nwell."\n\nThe lad put down his napkin, pulled on a coat over his white shirt and\ntrousers, picked up a large cap with a peak, and then, with quick, short\nsteps, led the way by a back-door through the buildings. At the entrance\nof a greasy, malodorous kitchen, we met an old woman who was carefully\ncarrying some putrid tripe in a rag. We descended into a court, built up\nall round with wooden buildings on stone foundations. The smell was most\noffensive, and seemed to be concentrated in a privy to which numbers of\npeople were constantly resorting. This privy was really only the place\nwhich custom accepted as a privy. One could not avoid noticing this\nplace as one passed through the courtyard. One suffered in entering the\nacrid atmosphere of the bad smells issuing from it.\n\nThe boy, taking care not to soil his white trousers, led me cautiously\nacross frozen and unfrozen filth, and approached one of the buildings.\nThe people crossing the yard and galleries all stopped to gaze at me. It\nwas evident that a cleanly-dressed man was an unusual sight in the\nplace.\n\nThe boy asked a woman whom we met, whether she had seen where the census\nofficials had entered, and three people at once answered his question:\nsome said that they were over the well; others said that they had been\nthere, but had now gone to Nikita Ivanovitch\'s.\n\nAn old man in the middle of the court, who had only a shirt on, said\nthat they were at No.\xc2\xa030. The boy concluded that this information was\nthe most probable and led me to No.\xc2\xa030, into the basement, where\ndarkness prevailed and a bad smell, different from that which filled the\ncourt.\n\nWe continued to descend along a dark passage. As we were traversing it a\ndoor was suddenly opened, out of which came a drunken old man in a\nshirt, evidently not of the peasant class. A shrieking washerwoman with\ntucked-up sleeves and soapy arms was pushing him out of the room.\n"V\xc3\xa1nya" (my guide) shoved him aside, saying, "It won\'t do to kick up\nsuch a row here--and you an officer too!"\n\nWhen we arrived at No.\xc2\xa030, V\xc3\xa1nya pulled the door, which opened with the\nsound of a wet slap; and we felt a gush of soapy steam and an odor of\nbad food and tobacco, and entered in complete darkness. The windows were\non the other side; and we were in a crooked corridor, that went right\nand left, with doors leading at different angles into rooms separated\nfrom it by a partition of unevenly laid boards, roughly whitewashed.\n\nIn a dark room to the left we could see a woman washing at a trough.\nAnother old woman was looking out of a door at the right. Near an open\ndoor was a hairy, red-skinned peasant in bark shoes, sitting on a couch.\nHis hands rested upon his knees; and he was swinging his feet and\nlooking sadly at his shoes.\n\nAt the end of the passage a small door led into the room where the\ncensus officers had assembled. This was the room of the landlady of the\nwhole of No.\xc2\xa030, who rented it from Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch and sub-let to\nordinary or night lodgers.\n\nIn this tiny room a student sat under an image glittering with gilt\npaper, and, with the air of a magistrate, was putting questions to a man\ndressed in shirt and vest. This last was a friend of the landlady\'s, who\nwas answering the questions in her stead. The landlady herself,--an old\nwoman,--and two inquisitive lodgers, were also present.\n\nWhen I entered, the room was quite filled up. I pushed through to the\ntable, shook hands with the student, and he went on extracting his\ninformation, while I studied the inhabitants, and put questions to them\nfor my own ends.\n\nIt appeared, however, I could find no one here upon whom to bestow my\nbenevolence. The landlady of the rooms, notwithstanding their\nwretchedness and filth (which especially struck me in comparison with\nthe mansion in which I lived), was well off, even from the point of view\nof town poverty; and compared with country destitution, with which I was\nwell acquainted, she lived luxuriously. She had a feather-bed, a quilted\nblanket, a samov\xc3\xa1r, a fur cloak, a cupboard, with dishes, plates, etc.\nThe landlady\'s friend had the same well-to-do appearance, and boasted\neven a watch and chain. The lodgers were poor, but among them there was\nno one requiring immediate help.\n\nThree only applied for aid,--the woman washing linen, who said she had\nbeen abandoned by her husband; an old widowed woman, without means of\nlivelihood; and the peasant in the bark shoes, who told me he had not\nhad anything to eat that day. But, upon gathering more precise\ninformation, it became evident that all these people were not in extreme\nwant, and that, before one could really help, it would be necessary to\nmake their more intimate acquaintance.\n\nWhen I offered the washerwoman to place her children in a "home," she\nbecame confused, thought over it some time, then thanked me much, but\nevidently did not desire it; she would rather have had some money. Her\neldest daughter helped her in the washing, and the second acted as nurse\nto the little boy.\n\nThe old woman asked to be put into a refuge; but, examining her corner,\nI saw she was not in extreme distress. She had a box containing some\nproperty and a teapot, two cups, and old bon-bon boxes with tea and\nsugar. She knitted stockings and gloves, and received a monthly\nallowance from a lady benefactress.\n\nThe peasant was evidently more desirous of wetting his throat after his\nlast day\'s drunkenness than of food, and anything given him would have\ngone to the public-house. In these rooms, therefore, there was no one\nwhom I could have rendered in any respect happier by helping them with\nmoney.\n\nThere were only paupers there,--and paupers, it seemed, of a\nquestionable kind.\n\nI put down the names of the old woman, the laundress, and the peasant,\nand settled in my mind that it would be necessary to do something for\nthem, but that first I would help those other _especially_ unfortunate\nones whom I expected to come across in this house. I made up my mind\nthat some system was necessary in distributing the aid which we had to\ngive: first, we must find the most needy, and then come to such as\nthese.\n\nBut in the next lodging, and in the next again, I found only similar\ncases, which would have to be looked into more closely before being\nhelped. Of those whom pecuniary aid alone would have rendered happy, I\nfound none.\n\nHowever ashamed I feel in confessing it, I began to experience a certain\ndisappointment at not finding in these houses anything resembling what I\nhad expected. I thought to find very exceptional people; but, when I had\ngone over all the lodgings, I became convinced that their inhabitants\nwere in no way extremely peculiar, but much like those amongst whom I\nlived.\n\nAs with us, so also with them, there were some more or less good and\nothers more or less bad: there were some more or less happy and others\nmore or less unhappy. Those who were unhappy amongst them would have\nbeen equally wretched with us, their misery being within themselves,--a\nmisery not to be mended by any kind of bank-note.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe inhabitants of these houses belonged to the lowest population of the\ntown, which in Moscow amounts to perhaps more than a hundred thousand.\nIn this house, there were representative men of all kinds,--petty\nemployers and journeymen, shoemakers, brushmakers, joiners, hackney\ncoachmen, jobbers carrying on business on their own account,\nwasherwomen, second-hand dealers, money-lenders, day-laborers, and\nothers without any definite occupation; and here also lodged beggars and\nunfortunate women.\n\nMany who were like the people I had seen waiting at Liapin\'s house lived\nhere, mixed up with the working-people. But those whom I saw then were\nin a most wretched condition, having eaten and drunk all they had, and,\nturned out of the public-house, were waiting, as for heavenly manna,\ncold and hungry, to be admitted into the free night-lodging-house,--and\nlonging day by day to be taken to prison, in order to be sent back to\ntheir homes. Here I saw the same men among a greater number of\nworking-people, at a time when by some means or other they had got a few\nfarthings to pay for their night\'s lodging, and perhaps a ruble or two\nfor food and drink.\n\nHowever strange it may sound, I had no such feelings here as I\nexperienced in Liapin\'s house; on the contrary, during my first\nvisiting-round, I and the students had a sensation which was rather\nagreeable than otherwise. Why do I say "almost agreeable?" It is not\ntrue. The sensation called forth by the companionship of these\nmen--strange as it may seem--was simply a very agreeable one.\n\nThe first impression was, that the majority of the lodgers here were\nworking people, and very kindly disposed. We found most of them at\nwork,--the washerwomen at their tubs, the joiners by their benches, the\nbootmakers at their lasts. The tiny rooms were full of people, and the\nwork was going on cheerfully and with energy. There was a smell of\nperspiration among the workmen, of leather at the bootmaker\'s, of chips\nin the carpenter\'s shop. We often heard songs, and saw bare, sinewy arms\nworking briskly and skilfully.\n\nEverywhere we were received kindly and cheerfully. Nearly everywhere our\nintrusion into the daily life of these people excited no desire in them\nto show us their importance, or to rate us soundly, which happens when\nsuch visits are paid to the lodgings of well-to-do people. On the\ncontrary, all our questions were answered simply, without any particular\nimportance being attached to them,--served, indeed, only as an excuse\nfor merriment and for jokes about how they were to be enrolled on the\nlist, how such a one was as good as two, and how two others ought to be\nreckoned as one.\n\nMany we found at dinner or at tea; and each time, in answer to our\ngreeting, "Bread and salt," or, "Tea and sugar," they said, "You are\nwelcome"; and some even made room for us to sit down. Instead of the\nplace being the resort of an ever-shifting population, such as we\nexpected to find, it turned out that in this house were many rooms which\nhad been tenanted by the same people for long periods.\n\nOne carpenter, with his workmen, and a bootmaker, with his journeymen,\nhad been living here for ten years. The bootmaker\'s shop was very dirty\nand quite choked up, but all his men were working very cheerily. I tried\nto talk with one of the workmen, wishing to sound him about the miseries\nof his lot, what he owed to the master, and so forth; but he did not\nunderstand me, and spoke of his master and of his life from a very\nfavourable point of view.\n\nIn one lodging, there lived an old man with his old wife. They dealt in\napples. Their room was warm, clean, and filled with their belongings.\nThe floor was covered with straw-matting which they got from the apple\nstores. There were chests, a cupboard, a samov\xc3\xa1r, and crockery. In the\ncorner were many holy images, before which two lamps were burning: on\nthe wall hung fur cloaks wrapped up in a sheet. The old woman with\nwrinkled face, kind and talkative, was apparently quite delighted with\nher quiet, respectable life.\n\nIv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, the owner of the inn and of the lodgings, came out and\nwalked with us. He joked kindly with many of the lodgers, calling them\nall by their names, and giving us short sketches of their characters.\nThey were as other men, did not consider themselves unhappy, but\nbelieved they were like everyone else, as in reality they were. We were\nprepared to see only dreadful things, and we met instead objects not\nonly not repulsive, but estimable. There were so many of these, compared\nwith the ragged, ruined, unoccupied people we met now and then among\nthem, that the latter did not in the least destroy the general\nimpression. To the students it did not appear so remarkable as it did to\nme. They were merely performing an act useful to science, as they\nthought; and, in passing, made casual observations: but I was a\nbenefactor; my object in going there was to help the unhappy, ruined,\ndepraved men and women whom I had expected to meet in this house.\nSuddenly, instead of unhappy, ruined, depraved beings, I found the\nmajority to be workingmen: quiet, satisfied, cheerful, kind, and very\ngood.\n\nI was still more strongly impressed when I found that in these lodgings\nthe crying want I wished to relieve had already been relieved before I\ncame. But by whom? By these same unhappy, depraved beings whom I was\nprepared to save! And this help was given in a way not open to me.\n\nIn one cellar lay a lonely old man suffering from typhus-fever. He had\nno connections in the world; yet a woman,--a widow with a little\ngirl,--quite a stranger to him, but living in the corner next to him,\nnursed him, gave him tea, and bought him medicine with her own money.\n\nIn another lodging lay a woman in puerperal fever. A woman of the town\nwas nursing her child, and had prepared a sucking-bottle for him, and\nhad not gone out to ply her sad trade for two days.\n\nAn orphan girl was taken into the family of a tailor, who had three\nchildren of his own. Thus, there remained only such miserable unoccupied\nmen as retired officials, clerks, men-servants out of situations,\nbeggars, tipsy people, prostitutes, children, whom it was not possible\nto help all at once by means of money, but whose cases it was necessary\nto consider carefully before assisting them. I had been seeking for men\nsuffering immediately from want of means, whom one might be able to help\nby sharing one\'s superfluities with them. I had not found them. All whom\nI had seen, it would have been very difficult to assist materially\nwithout devoting time and care to their cases.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThese unfortunate necessitous ones ranged themselves in my mind under\nthree heads: First, those who had lost former advantageous positions,\nand who were waiting to return to them (such men belonged to the lowest\nas well as to the highest classes of society); Secondly, women of the\ntown, who are very numerous in these houses; and Thirdly, children.\n\nThe majority of those I found, and noted down, were men who had lost\nformer places, and were desirous of returning to them, chiefly of the\nbetter class, and government officials. In almost all the lodgings we\nentered with the landlord, we were told, "Here we need not trouble to\nfill up the card ourselves: the man here is able to do it, provided he\nis not tipsy."\n\nThus summoned by Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, there would appear, from some dark\ncorner, the once rich nobleman or official, mostly drunk, and always\nhalf-dressed. If he were not drunk, he willingly undertook the task: he\nkept nodding his head with a sense of importance, knitted his brows,\ninserted now and then learned terms in his remarks, and carefully\nholding in his dirty, trembling hands the neat pink card, looked round\nat his fellow-lodgers with pride and contempt, as if he were now, by the\nsuperiority of his education, triumphing over those who had been\ncontinually humbling him.\n\nHe was evidently pleased to have intercourse with the world which used\npink cards, with a world of which he himself had once been a member.\n\nTo my questions about his life, this kind of man not only replied\nwillingly, but with enthusiasm,--beginning to tell a story, fixed in his\nmind like a prayer, about all kinds of misfortunes which had happened to\nhim, and chiefly about his former position, in which, considering his\neducation, he ought to have remained.\n\nMany such people are scattered about in all the tenements of the\nRzhanoff Houses. One lodging-house was tenanted exclusively by them,\nwomen and men. As we approached them, Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch said, "Now, here\'s\nwhere the nobility live."\n\nThe lodging was full. Almost all the lodgers--about forty persons--were\nat home. In the whole house, there were no faces so ruined and\ndegraded-looking as these,--if old, flabby; if young, pale and haggard.\n\nI talked with several of them. Almost always the same story was told,\ndiffering only in degree of development. One and all had been once rich,\nor had still a rich father or brother or uncle; or either his father or\nhis unfortunate self had held a high office. Then came some misfortune\ncaused by envious enemies, or his own imprudent kindness, or some\nout-of-the-way occurrence; and, having lost everything, he was obliged\nto descend to these strange and hateful surroundings, among lice and\nrags, in company with drunkards and loose characters, feeding upon bread\nand liver, and subsisting by beggary.\n\nAll the thoughts, desires, and recollections of these men are turned\ntoward the past. The present appears to them as something unnatural,\nhideous, and unworthy of attention. It does not exist for them. They\nhave only recollections of the past, and expectations of the future\nwhich may be realized at any moment, and for the attainment of which but\nvery little is needed; but, unfortunately, this little is out of their\nreach; it cannot be got anywhere: and so one has wasted one year,\nanother five, and a third thirty years.\n\nOne needs only to be dressed respectably in order to call on a\nwell-known person who is kindly disposed toward him; another requires\nonly to be dressed, have his debts paid, and go to some town or other; a\nthird wants to take his effects out of pawn, and get a small sum to\ncarry on a law-suit, which must be decided in his favour, and then all\nwill be well again. All say that they have need of some external\ncircumstance in order to regain that position which they think natural\nand happy.\n\nIf I had not been blinded by my pride in being a benefactor, I should\nhave needed only to look a little closer into their faces, young and\nold, which were generally weak, sensual, but kind, in order to\nunderstand that their misfortunes could not be met by external means;\nthat they could be happy in no position while their present conception\nof life remained the same; that they were by no means peculiar people in\npeculiarly unhappy circumstances, but that they were like all other men,\nourselves included.\n\nI remember well how my intercourse with men of this class was\nparticularly trying to me. I now understand why it was so. In them I saw\nmy own self as in a mirror. If I had considered carefully my own life\nand the lives of people of my own class, I should have seen that between\nus and these unfortunate men there existed no essential difference.\n\nThose who live around me in expensive suites of apartments and houses of\ntheir own in the best streets of the city, eating something better than\nliver or herring with their bread, are none the less unhappy. They also\nare discontented with their lot, regret the past, and desire a happier\nfuture, precisely as did the wretched tenants of the Rzhanoff Houses.\nBoth wished to be worked less and to be worked for more, the difference\nbetween them being only in degrees of idleness.\n\nUnfortunately, I did not see this at first, nor did I understand that\nsuch people needed to be relieved, not by my charity, but from their own\nfalse views of the world; and that to change a man\'s estimate of life he\nmust be given one more accurate than his own, which, unhappily, not\npossessing myself, I could not communicate to others.\n\nThese men were unhappy not because, to use an illustration, they were\nwithout nourishing food, but because their stomachs were spoiled; and\nthey required, not nourishment, but a tonic. I did not see that in order\nto help them, it was not necessary to give them food but to teach them\nhow to eat. Though I am anticipating, I must say that of all these\npeople whose names I put down I did not in reality help one,\nnotwithstanding that everything some of them had desired was done to\nrelieve them. Of these I became acquainted with three men in particular.\nAll three, after many failures and much assistance, are now in the same\nposition they were in three years ago.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nThe second class of unfortunates, whom I hoped afterwards to be able to\nhelp, were women of the town. These women were very numerous in the\nRzhanoff Houses; and they were of every kind, from young girls still\nbearing some likeness to women, to old and fearful-looking creatures\nwithout a vestige of humanity. The hope of helping these women, whom I\nhad not at first in view, was aroused by the following circumstances.\n\nWhen we had finished half of our tour, we had already acquired a\nsomewhat mechanical method. On entering a new lodging we at once asked\nfor the landlord. One of us sat down, clearing a space to write; and the\nother went from one to another, questioning each man and woman in the\nroom, and reporting the information obtained to him who was writing.\n\nOn our entering one of the basement lodgings, the student went to look\nfor the landlord; and I began to question all who were in the place.\nThis place was divided thus: In the middle of the room, which was four\nyards square, there stood a stove. From the stove four partitions or\nscreens radiated, making a similar number of small compartments. In the\nfirst of these, which had two doors in it opposite each other, and four\npallets, were an old man and a woman. Next to this was a rather long but\nnarrow room, in which was the landlord, a young, pale, good-looking man\ndressed in a gray woollen coat. To the left of the first division was a\nthird small room where a man was sleeping, seemingly tipsy, and a woman\nin a pink dressing-gown. The fourth compartment was behind a partition,\naccess to it being through the landlord\'s room.\n\nThe student entered the latter, while I remained in the first,\nquestioning the old man and the woman. The former had been a compositor,\nbut now had no means of livelihood whatever.\n\nThe woman was a cook\'s wife.\n\nI went into the third compartment, and asked the woman in the\ndressing-gown about the man who was asleep.\n\nShe answered that he was a visitor.\n\nI asked her who she was.\n\nShe replied that she was a peasant girl from the county of Moscow.\n\n"What is your occupation?" She laughed, and made no answer.\n\n"What do you do for your living?" I repeated, thinking she had not\nunderstood the question.\n\n"I sit in the inn," she said.\n\nI did not understand her, and asked again,--\n\n"What are your means of living?"\n\nShe gave me no answer, but continued to giggle. In the fourth room,\nwhere we had not yet been, I heard the voices of women also giggling.\n\nThe landlord came out of his room, and approached us. He had evidently\nheard my questions and the woman\'s answers. He glanced sternly at her,\nand, turning to me, said, "She is a prostitute"; and it was evident that\nhe was pleased that he knew this word,--which is the one used in\nofficial circles,--and at having pronounced it correctly. And having\nsaid this with a respectful smile of satisfaction towards me, he turned\nto the woman. As he did so, the expression of his face changed. In a\npeculiarly contemptuous manner, and with rapid utterance as one would\nspeak to a dog, he said, without looking at her, "Don\'t be a fool!\ninstead of saying you sit in the inn, speak plainly, and say you are a\nprostitute.--She does not even yet know her proper name," he said,\nturning to me.\n\nThis manner of speaking shocked me.\n\n"It is not for us to shame her," I said. "If we were all living\naccording to God\'s commandment, there would be no such persons."\n\n"There are such doings," said the landlord, with an artificial smile.\n\n"Therefore we must pity them, and not reproach them. Is it their fault?"\n\nI do not remember exactly what I said. I remember only that I was\ndisgusted by the disdainful tone of this young landlord, in a lodging\nfilled with females whom he termed prostitutes; and I pitied the woman,\nand expressed both feelings.\n\nNo sooner had I said this, than I heard from the small compartment where\nthe giggling had been, the noise of creaking bed-boards; and over the\npartition, which did not reach to the ceiling, appeared the dishevelled\ncurly head of a female with small swollen eyes, and a shining red face;\na second, and then a third, head followed. They were evidently standing\non their beds; and all three were stretching their necks and holding\ntheir breath, and looking silently at me with strained attention.\n\nA painful silence followed.\n\nThe student, who had been smiling before this happened, now became\ngrave; the landlord became confused, and cast down his eyes; and the\nwomen continued to look at me in expectation.\n\nI felt more disconcerted than all the rest. I had certainly not expected\nthat a casual word would produce such an effect. It was like the field\nof battle covered with dead bones seen by the prophet Ezekiel, on which,\ntrembling from contact with the spirit, the dead bones began to move. I\nhad casually uttered a word of love and pity, which produced upon all\nsuch an effect that it seemed as if they had been only waiting for it,\nto cease to be corpses, and to become alive again.\n\nThey continued to look at me, as if wondering what would come next, as\nif waiting for me to say those words and do those acts by which these\ndry bones would begin to come together,--be covered with flesh and\nreceive life.\n\nBut I felt, alas! that I had no such words or deeds to give, or to\ncontinue as I had begun. In the depth of my soul I felt that I had told\na lie, that I myself was like them, that I had nothing more to say; and\nI began to write down on the card the names and the occupations of all\nthe lodgers there.\n\nThis occurrence led me into a new kind of error. I began to think that\nthese unhappy creatures also could be helped. This, in my self\ndeception, it seemed to me would be very easily done. I said to myself,\n"Now we shall put down the names of these women too; and afterwards,\nwhen we (though it never occurred to me to ask who were the _we_) have\nwritten everything down, we can occupy ourselves with their affairs." I\nimagined that _we_, the very persons who, during many generations, have\nbeen leading such women into such a condition, and still continue to do\nso, could one fine morning wake up and remedy it all. And yet, if I\ncould have recollected my conversation with the lost woman who was\nnursing the baby for the sick mother, I should have understood the folly\nof such an idea.\n\nWhen we first saw this woman nursing the child, we thought that it was\nhers; but upon our asking her what she was, she answered us plainly that\nshe was a wench. She did not say "prostitute." It was left for the\nproprietor of the lodgings to make use of that terrible word.\n\nThe supposition that she had a child gave me the idea of helping her out\nof her present position.\n\n"Is this child yours?" I asked.\n\n"No: it is that woman\'s there."\n\n"Why do you nurse him?"\n\n"She asked me to. She is dying."\n\nThough my surmise turned out to be wrong, I continued to speak with her\nin the same spirit. I began to question her as to who she was, and how\nshe came to be in such a position. She told me her story willingly, and\nvery plainly. She belonged to the artisan class of Moscow, the daughter\nof a factory workman. She was left an orphan, and adopted by her aunt,\nfrom whose house she began to visit the inns. The aunt was now dead.\n\nWhen I asked her whether she wished to change her course of life, my\nquestion did not even interest her. How can a supposition about\nsomething quite impossible awaken an interest in any one? She smiled and\nsaid,--\n\n"Who would take me with a yellow ticket?"[3]\n\n  [3] The police certificate of registration as a prostitute.--Ed.\n\n"But," said I, "if it were possible to find you a situation as a cook or\nsomething else?" I said this because she looked like a strong woman,\nwith a kind, dull, round face, not unlike many cooks I had seen.\n\nEvidently my words did not please her. She repeated, "Cook! but I do not\nunderstand how to bake bread."\n\nShe spoke jestingly; but, by the expression of her face, I saw that she\nwas unwilling; that she even considered the position and rank of a cook\nbeneath her.\n\nThis woman, who, in the most simple manner, like the widow in the\ngospel, had sacrificed all that she had for a sick person, at the same\ntime, like other women of the same profession, considered the position\nof a workman or workwoman low and despicable. She had been educated to\nlive without work,--a life which all her friends considered quite\nnatural. This was her misfortune. And by this she came into her present\nposition, and is kept in it. This brought her to the inns. Who of us men\nand women will cure her of this false view of life? Are there among us\nany men convinced that a laborious life is more respectable than an idle\none, and who are living according to this conviction, and who make this\nthe test of their esteem and respect?\n\nIf I had thought about it I should have understood that neither I nor\nanybody else I know, was able to cure a person of this disease.\n\nI should have understood that those wondering and awakened faces that\nlooked over the partition expressed merely astonishment at the pity\nshown to them, but no wish to reform their lives. They did not see the\nimmorality. They knew that they were despised and condemned, but the\nreason for this they could not understand. They had lived in this manner\nfrom their infancy among women like themselves, who, they know very\nwell, have always existed, do exist, and are necessary to society, that\nthere are officials deputed by government to see that they conform to\nregulations.\n\nBesides, they know that they have power over men, and subdue them, and\noften influence them more than any other women. They see that their\nposition in society, notwithstanding the fact that they are always\nblamed, is recognised by men as well as by women and by the government;\nand therefore they cannot even understand of what they have to repent,\nand wherein they should reform.\n\nDuring one of our tours the student told me that in one of the lodgings\nthere was a woman who sends out her daughter, thirteen years old, to\nwalk the streets. Wishing to save this little girl I went on purpose to\ntheir lodging.\n\nMother and daughter were living in great poverty. The mother, a small,\ndark-complexioned prostitute of forty years of age, was not simply ugly,\nbut disagreeably ugly. The daughter was also bad-looking. To all my\nindirect questions about their mode of life, the mother replied curtly,\nwith a look of suspicion and animosity, apparently feeling that I was an\nenemy with bad intentions: the daughter said nothing without looking\nfirst at the mother, in whom she evidently had entire confidence.\n\nThey did not awaken pity in my heart, but rather disgust. Still I\ndecided that it was necessary to save the daughter, to awaken an\ninterest in ladies who might sympathize with the miserable condition of\nthese women and might so be brought here.\n\nYet if I had thought about the antecedents of the mother, how she had\ngiven birth to her daughter, how she had fed and brought her up,\ncertainly without any outside help, and with great sacrifices to\nherself; if I had thought of the view of life which had formed itself in\nher mind,--I should have understood, that, in the mother\'s conduct,\nthere was nothing at all bad or immoral, seeing she had been doing for\nher daughter all she could; i.e., what she considered best for herself.\n\nIt was possible to take this girl away from her mother by force; but to\nconvince her that she was doing wrong in selling her daughter was not\npossible. It would first be necessary to save this woman--this\nmother--from a condition of life approved by every one, and according to\nwhich a woman may live without marrying and without working, serving\nexclusively as a gratification to the passions. If I had thought about\nthis, I should have understood that the majority of those ladies whom I\nwished to send here for saving this girl were not only themselves\navoiding family duties, and leading idle and sensuous lives, but were\nconsciously educating their daughters for this very same mode of\nexistence. One mother leads her daughter to the inn, and another to\ncourt and to balls. Both the views of the world held by both mothers are\nthe same; viz., that a woman must gratify the passions of men, and for\nthat she must be fed, dressed, and taken care of.\n\nHow, then, are our ladies to reform this woman and her daughter?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nStill more strange were my dealings with the children. In my _r\xc3\xb4le_ as\nbenefactor I paid attention to the children too, wishing to save\ninnocent beings from going to ruin in this den; and I wrote down their\nnames in order to attend to them myself _afterwards_.\n\nAmong these children my attention was particularly drawn to Serozha, a\nboy twelve years old. I sincerely pitied this clever, intelligent lad,\nwho had been living with a bootmaker, and who was left without any place\nof refuge when his master was put into prison. I wished to do something\nfor him.\n\nI will now give the result of my benevolence in his case, because this\nboy\'s story will show my false position as a benefactor better than\nanything else.\n\nI took the boy into my house, and lodged him in the kitchen. Could I\npossibly bring a lousy boy out of a den of depravity to my children? I\nconsidered that I had been very kind in having put him where he was,\namongst my servants. I thought myself a great benefactor for having\ngiven him some of my old clothes and fed him; though it was properly my\ncook who did it, not I. The boy remained in my house about a week.\n\nDuring this week I saw him twice, and, passing him, spoke some words to\nhim, and, when out walking, called on a bootmaker whom I knew and\nproposed the boy as an apprentice. A peasant who was on a visit at my\nhouse invited him to go to his village and work in a family. The boy\nrefused to accept it and disappeared within a week.\n\nI went to Rzhanoff\'s house to enquire after him. He had returned there;\nbut when I called, he was not at home. He had already been two days in a\nmenagerie in Presnem Ponds, where he hired himself for 6d. a day to\nappear in a procession of savages in costume, leading an elephant. There\nwas some public show on at the time.\n\nI went to see him again, but he was so ungrateful, he evidently avoided\nme. Had I reflected upon the life of this boy and on my own, I should\nhave understood that the boy had been spoiled by the fact of his having\ntasted the sweets of a merry and idle life, and that he had lost the\nhabit of working. And I, in order to confer on him a benefit and reform\nhim, took him into my own house. And what did he see there? He saw my\nchildren, some older than he, some younger, and some of the same age,\nwho not only never did anything for themselves, but gave as much work to\nothers as they could. They dirtied and spoiled everything about them,\nsurfeited themselves with all sorts of dainties, broke the china, upset\nand threw to the dogs food which would have been a treat to him. If I\ntook him out of a den and brought him to a respectable place, he could\nnot but assimilate the views of life which existed there; and, according\nto these views, he understood that in a respectable position one must\nlive without working, eat and drink well, and lead a merry life.\n\nTrue, he did not know that my children had much labour in learning the\nexceptions in Latin and Greek grammars; nor would he have been able to\nunderstand the object of such work. But one cannot help seeing that even\nhad he understood it the influence upon him of the example of my\nchildren would have been still stronger. He would have then understood\nthat they were being educated in such a way, that, not working now, they\nmight afterwards also work as little as possible, and enjoy the good\nthings of life by virtue of their diplomas.\n\nBut what he did understand of it made him go, not to the peasant to take\ncare of cattle and feed on potatoes and kvas,[4] but to the menagerie in\nthe costume of a savage to lead an elephant for 6d. a day. I ought to\nhave understood how foolish it was of one who was educating his own\nchildren in complete idleness and luxury to try to reform other men and\ntheir children, and save them from going to ruin and idleness in what I\ncalled the _dens_ in Rzhanoff\'s house; where, however, three-fourths of\nthe men were working for themselves and for others. But then I\nunderstood nothing of all this.\n\n  [4] An unfermented home-made liquor used by Russian peasants.--Ed.\n\nIn Rzhanoff\'s house there were a great many children in the most\nmiserable condition. There were children of prostitutes, orphans, and\nchildren carried about the streets by beggars. They were all very\nwretched. But my experience with Serozha showed me that so long as I\ncontinued living the life I did I was not able to help them.\n\nWhile the boy was living with us I remember I took pains to hide from\nhim our way of life, particularly that of my children. I felt that all\nmy endeavours to lead him to a good and laborious life were frustrated\nby my example and that of my children. It is very easy to take away a\nchild from a prostitute or a beggar. It is very easy, when one has\nmoney, to wash him, dress him in new clothes, feed him well, and even\nteach him different accomplishments; but to teach him how to earn his\nliving, is, for us who have not been earning ours but doing just the\ncontrary, not only difficult but quite impossible, because by our\nexample and by the very improvements of his mode of life effected by us\nwithout any cost on our part, we teach him the very opposite.\n\nYou may take a puppy, pet him, feed him, teach him to carry things after\nyou, and be pleased with looking at him: but it is not enough to feed a\nman, dress him, and teach him Greek; you must teach him how to live;\ni.e., how to take less from others and give them more in return: and yet\nthrough our own mode of life we cannot help teaching him the very\nopposite whether we take him into our house or put him into a home to\nbring up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nI have never since experienced such a feeling of compassion towards men\nand of aversion towards myself, as I felt in Liapin\'s house. I was now\nfilled with the desire to carry out the scheme I had already begun and\nto do good to the men whom I had met.\n\nAnd, strange to say, though it might seem that to do good and to give\nmoney to those in want of it was a good deed, and ought to dispose men\nto universal love, it turned out quite the reverse; calling up in me\nbitter feelings and disposition to censure them. Even during our first\ntour a scene occurred similar to that in Liapin\'s house; but it failed\nto produce again the same effect and created a very different\nimpression.\n\nIt began with my finding in one of the lodgings a miserable person who\nrequired immediate help,--a woman who had not eaten food for two days.\n\nIt happened thus: In one very large and almost empty night-lodging, I\nasked an old woman whether there were any poor people who had nothing to\neat. She hesitated a moment and then named two; then suddenly, as if\nrecollecting herself, she said, "Yes, there lies one of them," pointing\nto a pallet. "This one," she added, "indeed, has nothing to eat."\n\n"You don\'t say so! Who is she?"\n\n"She has been a lost woman; but as nobody takes her now, she can\'t earn\nanything. The landlady has had pity on her, but now she wants to turn\nher out.--Agafia! I say, Agafia!" cried the old woman.\n\nWe went a little nearer, and saw something rise from the pallet. This\nwas a grey-haired, dishevelled woman, thin as a skeleton, in a dirty,\ntorn chemise, and with peculiarly glittering, immovable eyes. She looked\nfixedly beyond us, tried to snatch up her jacket behind her in order to\ncover her bony chest, and growled out like a dog, "What? what?"\n\nI asked her how she managed to live. For some time she was unable to see\nthe drift of my words and said, "I don\'t know myself; they are going to\nturn me out."\n\nI asked again; and oh, how ashamed of myself I feel! my hand can\nscarcely write it! I asked her whether it was true that she was\nstarving. She replied in the same feverish, excited manner, "I had\nnothing to eat yesterday; I have had nothing to eat to-day."\n\nThe miserable aspect of this woman impressed me deeply, but quite\ndifferently from those in Liapin\'s house: there, out of pity for them, I\nfelt embarrassed and ashamed of myself; but here, I rejoiced that I had\nat last found what I had been looking for,--a hungry being.\n\nI gave her a ruble and I remember how glad I felt that the others had\nseen it.\n\nThe old woman forthwith asked me also for money. It was so pleasant to\nme to give that I handed her some also, without thinking whether it was\nnecessary or not. She accompanied me to the door, and those who were in\nthe corridor heard how she thanked me. Probably my questions about the\npoor provoked expectations, for some of the inmates began to follow us\nwherever we went.\n\nAmong those that begged, there were evidently drunkards, who gave me a\nmost disagreeable impression; but having once given to the old woman I\nthought I had no right to refuse them, and I began to give away more.\nThis only increased the number of applicants, and there was a stir\nthroughout the whole lodging-house.\n\nOn the stairs and in the galleries, people appeared dogging my steps.\nWhen I came out of the yard, a boy ran quickly down the stairs, pushing\nthrough the people. He did not notice me and said hurriedly,--\n\n"He gave a ruble to Agafia!"\n\nHaving reached the ground, he, too, joined the crowd that was following\nme. I came out into the street. All sorts of people crowded round\nbegging for money. Having given away all I had in coppers, I entered a\nshop and asked the proprietor to give me change for ten rubles.\n\nHere occurred a scene similar to that which took place in Liapin\'s\nhouse. A dreadful confusion ensued. Old women, seedy gentlefolk,\npeasants, children, all crowded about the shop, stretching out their\nhands; I gave, and asked some of them about their position and means,\nand entered all in my note-book. The shopkeeper, having turned up the\nfur collar of his great-coat, was sitting like a statue, glancing now\nand then at the crowd, and again staring beyond it. He apparently felt\nlike everyone else, that all this was very foolish, but he dared not say\nso.\n\nIn Liapin\'s house the misery and humiliation of the people had\noverwhelmed me; and I felt myself to blame for it, and also the desire\nand the possibility of becoming a better man. But though the scene here\nwas similar, it produced quite a different effect. In the first place, I\nfelt angry with many of those who assailed me, and then anxious as to\nwhat the shopmen and the dvorniks might think of me. I returned home\nthat day with a weight on my mind. I knew that what I had done was\nfoolish and inconsistent; but, as usual when my conscience was troubled,\nI talked the more about my projected plan, as if I had no doubt whatever\nas to its success.\n\nThe next day I went alone to those whom I had noted down, and who seemed\nthe most miserable, thinking they could be more easily helped than\nothers.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, I was not really able to help any of these\npeople. It turned out that to do so was more difficult than I had\nimagined: in short, I only tormented these men and helped no one.\n\nBefore the last visiting-tour I went several times to Rzhanoff\'s house,\nand each time the same thing occurred: I was assailed by a crowd of men\nand women in the midst of whom I utterly lost my presence of mind.\n\nI felt the impossibility of doing anything because there were so many of\nthem; besides, each of them, taken separately, did not awaken any\nsympathy in me. I felt that every one lied, or at least prevaricated,\nand regarded me only as a purse out of which money could be drawn. It\noften seemed to me that the very money extorted from me did not improve\ntheir position but only made it worse.\n\nThe oftener I went to these houses, the closer the intercourse which I\nhad with the inmates, the more apparent became the impossibility of\ndoing anything; but notwithstanding this, I did not give up my plan\nuntil after the last night tour with the census-takers.\n\nI feel more ashamed of this visit than of any other. Formerly I had gone\nalone, but now twenty of us went together. At seven o\'clock all who\nwished to take part in this last tour began to assemble in my house.\nThey were almost all strangers to me. Some students, an officer, and two\nof my fashionable acquaintances, who, after having repeated the usual\nphrase, "C\'est tr\xc3\xa8s int\xc3\xa9ressant!" asked me to put them into the number\nof the census-takers.\n\nThese fashionable friends of mine had dressed themselves in\nshooting-jackets and tall travelling boots, which they thought more\nsuited to the visit than their ordinary clothes. They carried with them\npeculiar pocket-books and extraordinary-looking pencils. They were in\nthat agitated state of mind which one experiences just before going to a\nhunt, or to a duel, or into a battle. The falseness and foolishness of\nour enterprise was now more apparent to me in looking at them; but were\nwe not all in the same ridiculous position?\n\nBefore starting we had a conference, somewhat like a council of war, as\nto what we should begin with, how to divide ourselves, and so on. This\nconference was just like all other official councils, meetings, and\ncommittees: each spoke, not because he had anything to say, or to ask,\nbut because every one tried to find something to say in order not to be\nbehind the rest. But during the conversation no one alluded to the acts\nof benevolence to which I had so many times referred; and however much\nashamed I felt, I found it was needful to remind them that we must carry\nout our charitable intentions by writing down, during the visiting-tour,\nthe names of all whom we should find in a destitute condition.\n\nI had always felt ashamed to speak about these matters; but here, in the\nmidst of our hurried preparations for the expedition, I could scarcely\nutter a word about them. All listened to me and seemed touched, all\nagreed with me in words; but it was evident that each of them knew that\nit was folly, and that it would lead to nothing, and so they began at\nonce to talk about other subjects, and continued doing so until it was\ntime for us to start.\n\nWe came to the dark tavern, aroused the waiters, and began to sort out\npapers. When we were told that the people, having heard about this\nvisiting-tour, had begun to leave their lodgings, we asked the landlord\nto shut the gate, and we ourselves went to the yard to persuade those to\nremain who wanted to escape, assuring them that no one would ask to see\ntheir passports.\n\nI remember the strange and painful impression produced upon me by these\nfrightened night-lodgers. Ragged and half-dressed, they all appeared\ntall by the light of the lantern in the dark court-yard. Frightened and\nhorrible in their terror, they stood in a small knot round the\npestilential out-house, listening to our persuasions, but not believing\nus; and, evidently, like hunted animals, prepared to do anything to\nescape from us.\n\nGentlemen of all kinds, town and country policemen, public coroner and\njudges, had, all their lives, been hunting them in towns and villages,\non the roads and in the streets, in the taverns and in the\nlodging-houses, and suddenly these gentlemen had come at night and shut\nthe gate, only, forsooth, in order to count them! They found this as\ndifficult to believe as it would be for hares to believe that the dogs\nhad come out not to catch but to count them.\n\nBut the gates were shut, and the frightened night-lodgers returned to\ntheir places; and we, having separated into groups, began our visit.\nWith me were my fashionable acquaintances and two students. V\xc3\xa1nya, with\na lantern, went before us in a great-coat and white trousers, and we\nfollowed. We entered lodgings well known to me. The place was familiar,\nsome of the persons also; but the majority were new to me, and the\nspectacle was also a new and dreadful one,--still more dreadful than\nthat which I had seen at Liapin\'s house. All the lodgings were filled,\nall the pallets occupied, and not only by one, but often by two persons.\nThe sight was dreadful, because of the closeness with which these people\nwere huddled together, and because of the indiscriminate commingling of\nmen and women. Such of the latter as were not dead-drunk were sleeping\nwith men. Many women with children slept with strange men on narrow\nbeds.\n\nThe spectacle was dreadful, owing to the misery, dirt, raggedness, and\nterror of these people; and chiefly because there were so many of them.\nOne lodging, then another, then a third, a tenth, a twentieth, and so\non, without end. And everywhere the same fearful stench, the same\nsuffocating exhalation, the same confusion of sexes, men and women,\ndrunk, or in a state of insensibility; the same terror, submissiveness,\nand guilt stamped on all faces, so that I felt deeply ashamed and\ngrieved, as I had before at Liapin\'s. At last I understood that what I\nwas about to do was disgusting, foolish, and therefore impossible; so I\nleft off writing down their names and questioning them, knowing now that\nnothing would come of it.\n\nI felt deeply hurt.\n\nAt Liapin\'s I had been like a man who sees a horrible wound on the body\nof another. He feels sorry for the man, ashamed of not having relieved\nhim before, yet he can still hope to help the sufferer; but now I was\nlike a doctor who comes with his own medicines to the patient, uncovers\nhis wound only to mangle it, and to confess to himself that all he has\ndone has been done in vain, and that his remedy is ineffectual.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nThis visit gave the last blow to my self-deception. It became very\nevident to me that my aim was not only foolish, but even productive of\nevil. Yet, though I knew this, it seemed my duty to continue the project\na little longer: first, because of the article I had written and by my\nvisits I had raised the expectations of the poor; secondly, because what\nI had said and written had awakened the sympathy of some benefactors,\nmany of whom had promised to assist me personally and with money. And I\nwas expecting to be applied to by both, and hoped to satisfy them as\nwell as I was able.\n\nAs regards the applications made to me by those who were in need, the\nfollowing details may be given: I received more than a hundred letters,\nwhich came exclusively from the "rich poor," if I may so express myself.\nSome of them I visited, and some I left unanswered. In no instance did I\nsucceed in doing any good. All the applications made to me were from\npersons who were once in a privileged position (I call such persons\nprivileged who receive more from others than they give in return), had\nlost that position, and were desirous of regaining it. One wanted two\nhundred rubles in order to keep his business from going to ruin, and to\nenable him to finish the education of his children; another wanted to\nhave a photographic establishment; a third wanted money to pay his\ndebts, and take his best clothes out of pawn; a fourth was in need of a\npiano, in order to perfect himself and to earn money to support his\nfamily by giving lessons. The majority did not name any particular sum\nof money: they simply asked for help; but when I began to investigate\nwhat was necessary, it turned out that their wants increased in\nproportion to the help offered, and nothing satisfactorily resulted. I\nrepeat again, the fault may have been in my want of understanding; but\nin any case I helped no one, notwithstanding the fact that I made every\neffort to do so.\n\nAs for the philanthropists who were to co-operate with me, something\nvery strange and quite unexpected occurred: of all who promised to\nassist with money, and even stated the amount they would give, not one\ncontributed anything for distribution among the poor.\n\nThe promises of pecuniary assistance amounted to about three thousand\nrubles; but of all these people, not one recollected his agreement, or\ngave me a single kopek. The students alone gave the money which they\nreceived as payment for visiting, about twelve rubles; so that my\nscheme, which was to have collected tens of thousands of rubles from the\nrich, and to have saved hundreds and thousands of people from misery and\nvice, ended in my distributing at random some few rubles offered by the\nstudents, with twenty-five more sent me by the town-council for my\nlabour as manager, which I positively did not know what to do with.\n\nSo ended the affair.\n\nThen, before leaving Moscow for the country, on the Sunday before the\nCarnival, I went to the Rzhanoff house in the morning in order to\ndistribute the thirty-seven rubles among the poor. I visited all whom I\nknew in the lodgings, but found only one invalid, to whom I gave\nsomething,--five rubles, I think. There was nobody else to give to. Of\ncourse, many began to beg; but, as I did not know them, I made up my\nmind to take the advice of Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, the tavern-keeper, respecting\nthe distribution of the remaining thirty-two rubles.\n\nIt was the first day of the carnival. Everybody was smartly dressed, all\nhad had food, and many were drunk. In the yard near the corner of the\nhouse stood an old-clothes man, dressed in a ragged peasant\'s coat and\nbark shoes. He was still hale and hearty. Sorting his purchases, he was\nputting them into different heaps,--leather, iron, and other\nthings,--and was singing a merry song at the top of his voice.\n\nI began to talk with him. He was seventy years of age; had no relatives;\nearned his living by dealing in old clothes, and not only did not\ncomplain, but said he had enough to eat, drink, and to spare. I asked\nhim who in the place were particularly in want. He became cross, and\nsaid plainly that there was no one in want but drunkards and idlers; but\non learning my object in asking, he begged me five kopeks for drink, and\nran to the tavern for it.\n\nI also went to the tavern to see Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, to ask him to\ndistribute the money for me. It was full; gayly-dressed tipsy\nprostitutes were walking to and fro; all the tables were occupied; many\npeople were already drunk; and in the small room someone was playing a\nharmonium, and two people were dancing. Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, out of respect\nfor me, ordered them to leave off, and sat down next me at a vacant\ntable. I asked him, as he knew his lodgers well, to point out those most\nin want, as I was intrusted with a little money for distribution, and\nwished him to direct me. The kind-hearted man (he died a year after)\ngave me his attention for a time in order to oblige me, although he had\nto wait on his customers. He began to think it over, and was evidently\npuzzled. One old waiter had overheard us, and took his part in the\nconference.\n\nThey began to go over his lodgers, some of whom were known to me, but\nthey could not agree. "Paramonovna," suggested the waiter.\n\n"Well; yes, she does go hungry sometimes; but she drinks."\n\n"What difference does that make?"\n\n"Well, Spiridon Ivanovitch, he has children; that\'s the man for you."\n\nBut Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch had doubts about Spiridon too.\n\n"Akulina, but she has a pension. Ah, but there is the blind man!"\n\nTo him I myself objected: I had just seen him. This was an old man of\neighty years of age, without any relatives. One could scarcely imagine\nany condition to be worse; and yet I had just seen him lying drunk on a\nfeather bed, cursing at his comparatively young mistress in the most\nfilthy language.\n\nThey then named a one-armed boy and his mother. I saw that Iv\xc3\xa1n\nFedotitch was in great difficulty owing to his conscientiousness, for he\nknew that every thing given away by me would be spent at his tavern. But\nas I had to get rid of my thirty-two rubles, I insisted, and we managed\nsomehow or other to distribute the money. Those who received it were\nmostly well-dressed, and we had not far to go to find them: they were\nall in the tavern. The one-armed boy came in top-boots and a red shirt\nand waistcoat.\n\nThus ended all my benevolent enterprises; and I left for the country\nvexed with everyone, as it always happens when one does something\nfoolish and harmful. Nothing came of it all, except the train of\nthoughts and feelings which it called forth in me, which not only did\nnot cease, but doubly agitated my mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nWhat did it all mean?\n\nI had lived in the country and had entered into relations with the\ncountry-poor. It is not out of false modesty, but that I may state the\ntruth, which is necessary in order to understand the run of all my\nthoughts and feelings, that I must say that in the country I had done\nperhaps but little for the poor, the help which had been required of me\nwas so small; but even the little I had done had been useful, and had\nformed round me an atmosphere of love and sympathy with my\nfellow-creatures, in the midst of whom it might yet be possible for me\nto quiet the gnawing of my conscience as to the unlawfulness of my life\nof luxury.\n\nOn going to the city I had hoped for the same happy relations with the\npoor, but here things were upon quite another footing. In the city,\npoverty was at once less truthful, more exacting, and more bitter, than\nin the country. It was chiefly because there was so much more of it\naccumulated together, that it produced upon me a most harrowing\nimpression. What I experienced at Liapin\'s house made my own luxurious\nlife seem monstrously evil. I could not doubt the sincerity and strength\nof this conviction; yet, notwithstanding this, I was quite incapable of\ncarrying out a revolution which demanded an entire change in my mode of\nlife: I was frightened at the prospect, and so I resorted to\ncompromises. I accepted what I was told by everyone, and what has been\nsaid by everybody since the world began,--that riches and luxury are in\nthemselves no evil, that they are given by God, and that whilst\ncontinuing to live luxuriously it is possible to help those in need. I\nbelieved this and wanted to do so. And I wrote an article in which I\ncalled upon all rich people to help. These all admitted themselves\nmorally obliged to agree with me, but evidently did not wish to do or\ngive anything for the poor, or could not do so.\n\nI then began visiting, and discovered what I had in no way expected to\nsee. On the one hand, I saw in these dens (as I had at first called\nthem) men whom it was impossible for me to help, because they were\nworking-men, accustomed to labour and privation, and therefore having a\nmuch firmer hold on life than I had. On the other hand, I saw miserable\nmen whom I could not aid because they were just such as I was myself.\nThe majority of the poor whom I saw were wretched, merely because they\nhad lost the capacity, desire, and habit of earning their bread; in\nother words, their misery consisted in the fact that they were just like\nmyself. Whereas, of poor people to whom it was possible to give\nimmediate assistance--those suffering from illness, cold, and hunger,--I\nfound none, except the starving Agafia; and I became persuaded that,\nbeing so far removed from the life of those whom I wished to succour, it\nwas almost impossible to find such need as I sought, because all real\nneed was attended to by those amongst whom these unhappy creatures\nlived: and my principal conviction now was, that, with money, I could\nnever reform that life of misery which these people led.\n\nI was persuaded of this: yet a feeling of shame to leave off all I had\nbegun, and self-deception as to my own virtues, made me continue my plan\nfor some time longer till it died a natural death; thus, only with great\ndifficulty and the help of Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, I managed to distribute in\nthe tavern at Rzhanoff\'s house the thirty-seven rubles which I\nconsidered were not my own.\n\nOf course I might have continued this style of thing and have\ntransformed it into a kind of charity; and, by importuning those who\npromised to give me money, I might have obtained and distributed more,\nthus comforting myself with the idea of my own excellence: but I became\nconvinced on the one hand that we rich people do not wish,--and are also\nunable,--to distribute to the poor a portion of our superfluities (we\nhave so many wants ourselves), and that money should not be given to any\none if we really wish to do good, instead of merely distributing it at\nrandom as I had done in the Rzhanoff tavern. So I dropped the affair\nentirely and in despair quitted Moscow for my own village.\n\nI intended on returning home to write a pamphlet on my experience, and\nto state why my project had not succeeded. I wanted to justify myself\nfrom the imputations which resulted from my article on the census; I\nwanted also to denounce society and its heartless indifference; and I\ndesired to point out the causes of this town misery, and the necessity\nfor endeavouring to remedy it, as well as the means which I thought were\nrequisite for this purpose. I began even then to write, and fancied I\nhad many very important facts to communicate. But in vain did I rack my\nbrain: I could not manage it, notwithstanding the super-abundance of\nmaterial at my command, because of the irritation under which I wrote,\nand because I had not yet learned by experience what was necessary to\ngrasp the question rightly; still more because I had not become fully\nconscious of the cause of it all,--a very simple cause, deep-rooted in\nmyself. So the pamphlet was not finished at the commencement of the\npresent year (1884-1885).\n\nIn the matter of moral law we witness a strange phenomenon to which men\npay too little attention. If I speak to an unlearned man about geology,\nastronomy, history, natural philosophy, or mathematics, he receives the\ninformation as quite new to him, and never says to me, "There is nothing\nnew in what you tell me; every one knows it, and I have known it for a\nlong time." But tell a man one of the highest moral truths in the\nsimplest manner, in such a way as it has never been before formulated,\nand every ordinary man, particularly one who does not take any interest\nin moral questions, and, above all, one who dislikes them, is sure to\nsay, "Who does not know that? It has been always known and expressed."\nAnd he really believes this. Only those who can appreciate moral truths\nknow how to value their elucidation and simplification by a long and\nlaborious process, or can prize the transition from a proposition or\ndesire at first vaguely understood to a firm and determined expression\ncalling for a corresponding change of conduct.\n\nWe are all accustomed to consider moral doctrine to be a very insipid\nand dull affair in which there can be nothing new or interesting;\nwhereas, in reality, human life, with all its complicated and varied\nactions which seem to have no connection with morals,--political\nactivity, activity in the sciences, in the arts, and in commerce,--has\nno other object than to elucidate moral truths more and more, and to\nconfirm, simplify, and make them accessible to all.\n\nI recollect once while walking in a street in Moscow I saw a man come\nout and examine the flag-stones attentively; then, choosing one of them,\nhe sat down by it and began to scrape and rub it vigorously.\n\n"What is he doing with the pavement?" I wondered; and, having come up\nclose to him, I discovered he was a young man from a butcher\'s shop, and\nwas sharpening his knife on the flag-stone. He was not thinking about\nthe stones when examining them, and still less while doing his work; he\nwas merely sharpening his knife. It was necessary for him to do so in\norder to cut the meat, but to me it seemed that he was doing something\nto the pavement.\n\nIn the same way mankind seems to be occupied with commerce, treaties,\nwars, sciences, arts; and yet for them one thing only is important, and\nthey do only that,--they are elucidating those moral laws by which they\nlive.\n\nMoral laws are already in existence, and mankind has been and is merely\nre-discovering them: this elucidation appears to be unimportant and\nimperceptible to one who has no need of moral law, and who does not\ndesire to live by it. Yet this is not only the chief but is the sole\nbusiness of all men. The elucidation is imperceptible in the same way as\nthe difference between a sharp knife and a blunt one is imperceptible. A\nknife remains a knife; and one who has not to cut anything with it will\nnot notice its edge: but for one who understands that all his life\ndepends more or less upon whether his knife is blunt or sharp, every\nimprovement in sharpening it is important; and such a man knows that\nthere must be no limit to this improvement, and that the knife is only\nreally a knife when it is sharp, and when it cuts what it has to cut.\n\nThe conviction of this truth flashed upon me when I began to write my\npamphlet. Previously it seemed to me that I knew everything about my\nsubject, that I had a thorough understanding of everything connected\nwith those questions which had been awakened in me by the impressions\nmade in Liapin\'s house and during the census; but when I tried to sum\nthem up, and to put them on paper, it turned out that the knife would\nnot cut, and had to be sharpened: so it is only now after three years\nthat I feel my knife is sharp enough for me to cut out what I want. It\nis not that I have learned new things: my thoughts are still the same;\nbut they were blunt formerly; they kept diverging in every direction;\nthere was no edge to them; nor was anything brought, as it is now, to\none central point, to one most simple and plain conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nI recollect that during the whole time of my unsuccessful endeavours to\nhelp the unfortunate inhabitants of Moscow, I felt I was like a man\ntrying to help others out of a bog, who was all the time stuck fast in\nit himself. Every effort made me feel the instability of the ground upon\nwhich I was standing. I felt that I myself was in this bog, but the\nacknowledgement did not help me to look more closely under my feet to\nfind out the nature of the ground on which I stood: I kept looking for\nsome external means to remedy the evil.\n\nI felt my life was a bad one, and that people ought not to live so; yet\nI did not come to the most natural and obvious conclusion: that I must\nfirst reform my own mode of life before I could have any conception of\nhow to reform others. And so I began at the wrong end, as it were. I was\nliving in town, and wished to improve the lives of the men there; but I\nsoon became convinced that I had no power to do so; and then I began to\nponder over the _nature_ of town life and town misery.\n\nI said to myself over and over again, "What is this town life and town\nmisery? And why, while living in town, am I unable to help the town\npoor?" The only reply I found was, that I was powerless to do anything\nfor them, First, because there were too many collected together in one\nplace; Secondly, because none of them were at all like those in the\ncountry. And again I asked myself, "Why are there so many here, and in\nwhat do they differ from the country poor?"\n\nTo both these questions the answer was the same. The poor are numerous\nin towns because all who have nothing to subsist on in the country are\ncollected there round the rich; and their peculiarity is due to the fact\nthat they have all come into the towns from the country to get a living.\n(If there are any town poor born there, whose fathers and grandfathers\nwere town born, these in their turn originally came there to get a\nliving.) But what are we to understand by the expression, "getting a\nliving in town"? There is something strange in the expression; it sounds\nlike a joke when we reflect on its meaning. How is it that from the\ncountry,--i.e., from places where there are woods, meadows, corn and\ncattle, where the earth yields the treasures of fertility--men come\naway, to get a living in a place where there are none of these\nadvantages, but only stones and dust? What then, do the words, "getting\na living in town," mean?\n\nSuch a phrase is constantly used, both by the employed and their\nemployers, as if it were quite clear and intelligible. I remember now\nall the hundreds and thousands of town people living well or ill with\nwhom I had spoken about their object in coming here; and all of them,\nwithout exception, told me they had quitted their villages "to get a\nliving"; that "Moscow neither sows nor reaps, yet lives in wealth"; that\nin Moscow there is abundance of everything; and that, therefore, in\nMoscow one may get the money which is needed in the country for corn,\ncottages, horses, and the other essentials of life.\n\nBut, in fact, the country is the source of all wealth; there, only, are\nreal riches,--corn, woods, horses, and everything necessary. Why go to\ntowns, then, to get what is to be had in the country? And why should\npeople carry away from the country into the towns the things that are\nnecessary for country people,--flour, oats, horses, and cattle?\n\nHundreds of times I have spoken thus with peasants who live in towns;\nand from my talks with them, and from my own observations, it became\nclear to me that the accumulation of country people in our cities is\npartly _necessary_, because they could not otherwise earn their\nlivelihood, and partly voluntary, because they are attracted by the\ntemptations of a town life.\n\nIt is true that the circumstances of a peasant are such, that, in order\nto satisfy the pecuniary demands made on him in his village, he cannot\ndo otherwise than sell that corn and cattle which he knows very well\nwill be necessary for himself; and he is compelled, whether he will or\nnot, to go to town to earn back what was his own. But it is also true\nthat he is attracted to town by the charms of a comparatively easy way\nof getting money, and by the luxury of life there; and, under the\npretext of earning his living, he goes there in order to have easier\nwork and better food, to drink tea three times a day, to dress himself\nsmartly, and even to get drunk and lead a dissolute life.\n\nThe cause is a simple one; for property passing from the hands of the\nagriculturalists into those of non-agriculturalists accumulates in\ntowns. Observe towards autumn how much wealth is gathered together in\nthe villages. Then come the demands of taxes, rents, recruiting; then\nthe temptations of vodka, marriages, feasts, peddlers, and all sorts of\nother snares; so that in one way or other, this property, all in its\nvarious forms (sheep, calves, cows, horses, pigs, poultry, eggs, butter,\nhemp, flax, rye, oats, buckwheat, peas, hemp-seed, and flax-seed),\npasses into the hands of strangers, and is taken first to provincial\ntowns, and thence to the capitals. A villager is compelled to dispose of\nall these things in order to satisfy the demands made upon him and the\ntemptations offered him; and, having thus parted with his goods, he is\nleft in want, and must follow where his wealth has been taken; and there\nhe tries to earn back the money which is necessary for his most urgent\nneeds at home; and so, being partly carried away by these temptations,\nhe himself, along with others, makes use of the accumulated wealth.\n\nEverywhere throughout Russia, and, I think, not only in Russia but all\nover the world, the same thing happens. The wealth of the country people\nwho produce it passes into the hands of tradespeople, landowners,\ngovernment officials, manufacturers. The men who receive this wealth\nwant to enjoy it, and to enjoy it fully they must be in town.\n\nIn the country, in the first place, it is difficult for the rich to\ngratify all their desires, owing to the inhabitants being scattered: you\ndo not find there the shops, banks, restaurants, theatres, and various\nkinds of public amusements.\n\nSecondly, another of the chief pleasures procured by wealth,--vanity,\nthe desire to astonish, to make a display before others,--cannot be\ngratified in the country for the same reason: its inhabitants being too\nscattered. There is no one in the country to appreciate luxury; there is\nno one to astonish. There you may have what you like to embellish your\ndwelling,--pictures, bronze statues, all sorts of carriages, and fine\ntoilets,--but there is nobody to look at them or to envy you. The\npeasants do not understand the value of all this, and cannot make head\nor tail of it. Thirdly, luxury in the country is even disagreeable to a\nman who has a conscience, and is an anxiety to a timid person. One feels\nuneasy or ashamed at taking a milk bath, or in feeding puppies with\nmilk, when there are children close by needing it; one feels the same in\nbuilding pavilions and gardens among a people who live in cottages\ncovered with stable litter, and who have no wood to burn.\n\nThere is no one in the village to prevent the stupid, uneducated\npeasants from spoiling our comforts.\n\nTherefore, rich people gather together in towns, and settle near those\nwho, in similar positions, have similar desires. In towns, the enjoyment\nof luxuries is carefully protected by a numerous police. The principal\ninhabitants of towns are government officials, round whom all the rich\npeople, master-workmen, and artisans have settled. There, a rich man has\nonly to think about a thing, and he can get it. It is also more\nagreeable for him to live there, because he can gratify his vanity;\nthere are people with whom he may try to compete in luxury, whom he may\nastonish or eclipse. But it is especially pleasant for a wealthy man to\nlive in town, because, where his country life was uncomfortable, and\neven somewhat incongruous because of his luxury, in town, on the\ncontrary, it would be uncomfortable for him _not_ to live splendidly, as\nhis equals in wealth do. What seemed out of place there, appears\nindispensable here.\n\nRich people collect together in towns, and, under the protection of the\nauthorities, enjoy peacefully all that has been brought there by the\nvillagers. A countryman often cannot help going to town, where a\nceaseless round of feasting is going on, where what has been procured\nfrom the peasants is being spent. He comes into the town to feed on\nthose crumbs which fall from the tables of the rich; and partly by\nobserving the careless, luxurious, and generally approved mode of living\nof these men, he begins to desire to order his own affairs in such a\nmanner that he, too, may be able to work less and avail himself more of\nthe labour of others. At last he decides to settle down in the\nneighbourhood of the wealthy, trying by every means in his power to get\nback from them what is necessary for him, and submitting to all the\nconditions which the rich enforce. These country people assist in\ngratifying all the fancies of the wealthy: they serve them in public\nbaths, in taverns, as coachmen, and as prostitutes. They manufacture\ncarriages, make toys and dresses, and little by little learn from their\nwealthy neighbours how to live like them, not by real labour, but by all\nsorts of tricks, squeezing out from others the money they have\ncollected,--and so they become depraved, and are ruined.\n\nIt is then this same population, depraved by the wealth of towns, which\nforms that city misery which I wished to relieve, but could not.\n\nIndeed, if one only reflects on the condition of these country folk\ncoming to town to earn money to buy bread or to pay taxes, and who see\neverywhere thousands of rubles squandered foolishly, and hundreds very\neasily earned while they have to earn their pence by the hardest of\nlabour, one cannot but be astonished that there are still many such\npeople at work, and that they do not all have recourse to a more easy\nway of getting money,--trading, begging, vice, cheating, and even\nrobbery.\n\nIt is only we who join in the ceaseless orgie going on in the towns who\ncan get so accustomed to our own mode of life that it seems quite\nnatural to us that one fine gentleman should occupy five large rooms\nheated with sufficient firewood to enable twenty families to warm their\nhomes and cook their food with. To drive a short distance, we employ two\nthoroughbreds and two men; we cover our inlaid floors with carpets, and\nspend five or ten thousand rubles on a ball, or even twenty-five for a\nChristmas-tree, and so on. Yet a man who needs ten rubles to buy bread\nfor his family, or from whom his last sheep has been taken to meet a tax\nof seven rubles which he cannot save by the hardest of labour, cannot\nget accustomed to all this which we imagine must seem quite natural to\nthe poor. There are even people _na\xc3\xafve_ enough to say that the poor are\nthankful to us because we feed them by living so luxuriously!\n\nBut poor people do not lose their reasoning powers because they are\npoor: they reason quite in the same manner as we do. When we have heard\nthat some one has lost a fortune at cards, or squandered ten or twenty\nthousand rubles, the first thought that comes into our minds is: "How\nstupid and bad this man must be to have parted with such a large sum\nwithout any equivalent; and how well _I_ could have employed this money\nfor some building I have long wanted to get done, or for the improvement\nof my estate," and so on.\n\nThe poor reason in the same way on seeing how foolishly we waste our\nwealth; all the more forcibly, because this money is needed, not to\nsatisfy their _whims_, but for the chief necessaries of life, of which\nthey are in want. We are greatly mistaken in thinking that the poor,\nwhile able to reason thus, still look on unconcernedly at the luxury\naround them.\n\nThey have never acknowledged, and never will, that it is right for one\nman to be always idling, and for another to be continually working. At\nfirst they are astonished and offended; then, looking closer into the\nquestion, they see that this state of things is acknowledged to be\nlegal, and they themselves try to get rid of work, and to take part in\nthe feasting. Some succeed in so doing, and acquire similar wanton\nhabits; others, little by little, approach such a condition; others\nbreak down before they reach their object, and, having lost the habit of\nworking, fill the night-houses and the haunts of vice.\n\nThe year before last we took from the village a young peasant to be our\nbutler\'s assistant. He could not agree with the footman, and was sent\naway; he entered the service of a merchant, pleased his masters, and now\nwears a watch and chain, and has smart boots.\n\nIn his place we took another peasant, a married man. He turned out a\ndrunkard, and lost money. We took a third: he began to drink, and,\nhaving drunk all he had, was for a long time in distress in a\nnight-lodging-house. Our old cook took to drinking in the town, and fell\nill. Last year a footman who used formerly to have fits of drunkenness,\nbut who, while living in the village kept himself from it for five\nyears, came to live in Moscow without his wife (who used to keep him in\norder), began again to drink, and ruined himself. A young boy of our\nvillage is living as butler\'s assistant at my brother\'s. His\ngrandfather, a blind old man, came to me while I was living in the\ncountry, and asked me to persuade this grandson to send ten rubles for\ntaxes, because, unless this were done, the cow would have to be sold.\n\n"He keeps telling me that he has to dress himself respectably," said the\nold man. "He got himself long boots, and that ought to be enough; but I\nactually believe he would like to buy a watch!"\n\nIn these words the grandfather expressed what he felt was the utmost\ndegree of extravagance. And this was really so; for the old man could\nnot afford a drop of oil for his food during the whole of Lent, and his\nwood was spoilt because he had not the ruble and a quarter necessary for\ncutting it up. But the old man\'s irony turned out to be reality. His\ngrandson came to me dressed in a fine black overcoat, and in long boots\nfor which he had paid eight rubles. Recently he had got ten rubles from\nmy brother, and spent them on his boots. And my children, who have known\nthe boy from his infancy, told me that he really considers it necessary\nto buy a watch. He is a very good boy, but he considers that he will be\nlaughed at for not having one.\n\nThis year a housemaid, eighteen years of age, formed an intimacy with\nthe coachman, and was sent away. Our old nurse, to whom I related the\ncase, reminded me of a girl whom I had quite forgotten. Ten years ago,\nduring a short stay in Moscow, she formed an intimacy with a footman.\nShe also was sent away, and drifted at last into a house of ill-fame,\nand died in a hospital before she was twenty years of age.\n\nWe have only to look around us to become alarmed by the infection which\n(to say nothing of manufactories and workshops existing only to gratify\nour luxury) we directly, by our luxurious town life, spread among those\nvery people whom we desire afterwards to help.\n\nThus, having got at the root of that town misery which I was not able to\nalleviate, I saw that its first cause is in our taking from the\nvillagers their necessaries and carrying them to town. The second cause\nis, that in those towns we avail ourselves of what we have gathered from\nthe country, and, by our foolish luxury, tempt and deprave the peasants\nwho follow us there in order to get back something of what we have taken\nfrom them in the country.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nFrom another point of view than the one stated, I also came to the same\nconclusion. Recollecting my connection with the town-poor during this\nperiod, I saw that one cause which prevented me from helping them was\ntheir insincerity and falseness. They all considered me, not as an\nindividual but merely as a means to an end. I felt I could not become\nintimate with them; I thought I did not perhaps understand how to do so;\nbut without truthfulness, no help was possible. How can one help a man\nwho does not tell all his circumstances? Formerly I accused the poor of\nthis (it is so natural to accuse others), but one word spoken by a\nremarkable man, Sutaief, who was then on a visit at my house, cleared up\nthe difficulty, and showed me wherein lay the cause of my failure.\n\nI remember that even then what he said made a deep impression on me; but\nI did not understand its full meaning until afterwards. It happened that\nwhile in the full ardour of my self-deception I was at my sister\'s\nhouse, Sutaief being also there; and my sister was questioning me about\nmy work.\n\nI was relating it to her; and, as is always the case when one does not\nfully believe in one\'s own enterprises, I related with great enthusiasm,\nardour, and at full length, all I had been doing, and all the possible\nresults. I was telling her how we should keep our eyes open to what went\non in Moscow; how we should take care of orphans and old people; how we\nshould afford means for impoverished villagers to return to their homes,\nand pave the way to reform the depraved. I explained, that, if we\nsucceeded in our undertaking, there would not be in Moscow a single poor\nman who could not find help.\n\nMy sister sympathized with me; and while speaking, I kept looking now\nand then at Sutaief; knowing his Christian life, and the importance\nattached by him to works of charity, I expected sympathy from him, and I\nspoke so that he might understand me; for, though I was addressing my\nsister, yet my conversation was really more directed to him.\n\nHe sat immovable, dressed in his black-tanned-sheepskin coat, which he,\nlike other peasants, wore in-doors as well as out. It seemed that he was\nnot listening to us, but was thinking about something else. His small\neyes gave no responding gleam, but seemed to be turned inwards. Having\nspoken out to my own satisfaction, I turned to him and asked him what he\nthought about it.\n\n"The whole thing is worthless," he replied.\n\n"Why?"\n\n"The plan is an empty one, and no good will come of it," he repeated\nwith conviction.\n\n"But why will nothing come of it? Why is it a useless business, if we\nhelp thousands, or even hundreds, of unhappy ones? Is it a bad thing,\naccording to the gospel, to clothe the naked, or to feed the hungry?"\n\n"I know, I know; but what you are doing is not that. Is it possible to\nhelp thus? You are walking in the street; somebody asks you for a few\nkopeks; you give them to him. Is that charity? Do him some spiritual\ngood; teach him. What you give him merely says, \'Leave me alone.\'"\n\n"No; but that is not what we were speaking of: we wish to become\nacquainted with the wants, and then to help by money and by deeds. We\nwill try to find for the poor people some work to do."\n\n"That would be no way of helping them."\n\n"How then? must they be left to die of starvation and cold?"\n\n"Why left to die? How many are there of them?"\n\n"How many?" said I, thinking that he took the matter so lightly from not\nknowing the great number of these men; "you are not aware, I dare say,\nthat there are in Moscow about twenty thousand cold and hungry. And\nthen, think of those in St. Petersburg and other towns!"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n"Twenty thousand! And how many households are there in Russia alone?\nWould they amount to a million?"\n\n"Well; but what of that?"\n\n"What of that?" said he, with animation, and his eyes sparkled. "Let us\nunite them with ourselves; I am not rich myself, but will at once take\ntwo of them. Here is a fellow you settled in your kitchen; I asked him\nto go with me, but he refused. If there were ten times as many, we\nshould take them all into our families. You one, I another. We shall\nwork together; he will see how I work; he will learn how to live, and we\nshall eat out of one bowl, at one table; and they will hear a good word\nfrom me, and from you also. That is charity; but all this plan of yours\nis no good."\n\nThese plain words made an impression upon me. I could not help\nrecognizing that they were true. But it seemed to me then, that,\nnotwithstanding the justice of what he said, my proposed plan might\nperhaps be useful also.\n\nBut the longer I was occupied with this affair; and the closer my\nintercourse with the poor, the oftener I recollected these words and the\ngreater meaning I found in them.\n\nI, indeed, go in an expensive fur coat, or drive in my own carriage to a\nman who is in want of boots: he sees my house which costs two hundred\nrubles a month, or he notices that I give away, without thinking, five\nrubles, only because of a caprice; he is then aware that if I give away\nrubles in such a manner, it is because I have accumulated so many that I\nhave a lot to spare which I am not only never in the habit of giving to\nany one, but which I have taken away from others without compunction.\nWhat can he see in me but one of those persons who have become possessed\nof something which should belong to him? And what other feelings can he\nhave towards me than the desire to get back as many as possible of these\nrubles which were taken by me from him and from others?\n\nI should like to become intimate with him, and complain that he is not\nsincere. But I am afraid to sit down upon his bed for fear of lice or\nsome infectious disease; I am also afraid to let him come into my room;\nand when he comes to me half-dressed, he has to wait, if fortunate, in\nthe entrance-hall, but oftener in the cold porch. And then I say that it\nis all his fault that I cannot become intimate with him, and that he is\nnot sincere.\n\nLet the most hard-hearted man sit down to dine upon five courses among\nhungry people who have little or nothing to eat except dry bread, and no\none could have the heart to eat while these hungry people are around him\nlicking their lips.\n\nTherefore, before one can eat well when living among half-starved men,\nthe first thing necessary is to hide ourselves from them, and to eat so\nthat they may not see us. This is the very thing we do in the first\nplace.\n\nI looked into our own mode of life without prejudice, and became aware\nthat it was not by chance that closer intercourse with the poor is\ndifficult for us, but that we ourselves are intentionally ordering our\nlives in such a way as to make this intercourse impossible. And not only\nthis; but, on looking at our lives, or at the lives of rich people from\nwithout, I saw that all that is considered as the _happiness_ of these\nlives consists in being separated as much as possible from the poor, or\nis in some way or other connected with this desired separation.\n\nIn fact, the entire aim of our lives, beginning with food, dress,\ndwelling and cleanliness, and ending with our education, consists in\nplacing a gulf between us and them. And we spend nine-tenths of our\nwealth to erect impassable barriers in order to establish this\ndistinction and separation.\n\nThe first thing a man who has grown rich does is to leave off eating\nwith others out of one bowl. He arranges plates for himself and his\nfamily, and separates himself from the kitchen and the servants. He\nfeeds his servants well so that their mouths may not water, and he dines\nalone. But eating alone is dull. He invents whatever he can to improve\nhis food, embellish his table; and the very manner of taking food, as at\ndinner-parties, becomes a matter of vanity and pride. His manner of\neating his food is a means of separating himself from other people. For\na rich man it is out of the question to invite a poor person to his\ntable. One must know how to hand a lady to table, how to bow, how to\nsit, to eat, to use a finger-bowl, all of which the rich alone know how\nto do.\n\nThe same holds good with dress.\n\nIf a rich man wore ordinary dress,--a jacket, a fur coat, felt shoes,\nleather boots, an undercoat, trousers, a shirt,--he would require very\nlittle to cover his body and protect it from cold; and, having two fur\ncoats, he could not help giving one away to somebody who had none. But\nthe wealthy man begins with wearing clothes which consist of many\nseparate parts, of use only on particular occasions, and therefore of no\nuse to a poor man. The man of fashion must have evening dress-coats,\nwaistcoats, frock-coats, patent-leather shoes; his wife must have\nbodices, and dresses which, according to fashion, are made of many\nparts, high-heeled shoes, hunting and travelling jackets, and so on. All\nthese articles can be useful only to people in a condition far removed\nfrom poverty.\n\nAnd thus dressing also becomes a means of isolation. Fashions make their\nappearance, and are among the chief things which separate the rich man\nfrom the poor one.\n\nThe same thing shows itself more plainly still in our dwellings. In\norder that one person may occupy ten rooms we must manage so that he may\nnot be seen by the people who are living by tens in one room.\n\nThe richer a man is, the more difficult it is to get at him; the more\nfootmen there are between him and people not rich, the more impossible\nit is for him to receive a poor guest, to let him walk on his carpets\nand sit on his satin-covered chairs.\n\nThe same thing happens in travelling. A peasant who drives in a cart or\non a carrier\'s sledge must be very hard-hearted if he refuses to give a\npedestrian a lift; he has enough room, and can do it. But the richer the\ncarriage is, the more impossible it is to put any one in it besides the\nowner. Some of the most elegant carriages are so narrow as to be termed\n"_egotists_."\n\nThe same thing applies to all the modes of living expressed by the word\n"cleanliness." Cleanliness! Who does not know human beings, especially\nwomen, who make a great virtue of cleanliness? Who does not know the\nvarious phrases of this cleanliness, which have no limit whatever when\nit is procured by the labour of others? Who among self-made men has not\nexperienced in his own person the pains with which he carefully\naccustomed himself to this cleanliness, which illustrates the saying,\n"White hands are fond of another\'s labour"?\n\nTo-day cleanliness consists in changing one\'s shirt daily; to-morrow it\nwill be changed twice a day. At first, one has to wash one\'s hands and\nneck every day, then one will have to wash one\'s feet every day, and\nafterwards it will be the whole body, and in peculiar methods. A clean\ntable-cloth serves for two days, then it is changed every day, and\nafterwards two table-cloths a day are used. To-day the footman is\nrequired to have clean hands; to-morrow he must wear gloves, and clean\ngloves, and he must hand the letters on a clean tray.\n\nThere are no limits to this cleanliness, which is of no other use to\nanyone except to separate us, and to make our intercourse with others\nimpossible while the cleanliness is obtained through the labour of\nothers.\n\nNot only so, but when I had deeply reflected upon this, I came to the\nconclusion that what we term education is a similar thing. Language\ncannot deceive: it gives the right name to everything. The common people\ncall education fashionable dress, smart conversation, white hands, and a\ncertain degree of cleanliness. Of such a man they say, when\ndistinguishing him from others, that he is an educated man.\n\nIn a little higher circle men denote by education the same things, but\nadd playing on the piano, the knowledge of French, good Russian\nspelling, and still greater cleanliness.\n\nIn the still higher circle education consists of all this, with the\naddition of English, and a diploma from a high educational\nestablishment, and a still greater degree of cleanliness. But in all\nthese shades, education is in substance quite the same.\n\nIt consists in those forms and various kinds of information which\nseparate a man from his fellow-creatures. Its object is the same as that\nof cleanliness: to separate us from the crowd, in order that they,\nhungry and cold, may not see how we feast. But it is impossible to hide\nourselves, and our efforts are seen through.\n\nThus I became aware that the reason why it was impossible for us rich\nmen to help the town poor was nothing more or less than the\nimpossibility of our having closer intercourse with them, and that this\nbarrier we ourselves create by our whole life and by all the uses we\nmake of our wealth. I became persuaded that between us rich men and the\npoor there stood, erected by ourselves, a barrier of cleanliness and\neducation which arose out of our wealth; and that, in order to be able\nto help them, we have first to break down this barrier and to render\npossible the realization of the means suggested by Sutaief: to take the\npoor into our respective homes. And so, as I have already said at the\nbeginning of this chapter, I came to the same conclusion from a\ndifferent point of view from that to which the train of thought about\ntown misery had led me; viz., the cause of it all lay in our wealth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nI began again to analyze the matter from a third and purely personal\npoint of view. Among the phenomena which particularly impressed me\nduring my benevolent activity, there was one,--a very strange\none,--which I could not understand for a long time.\n\nWhenever I happened, in the street or at home, to give a poor person a\ntrifling sum without entering into conversation with him, I saw on his\nface, or imagined I saw, an expression of pleasure and gratitude, and I\nmyself experienced an agreeable feeling at this form of charity. I saw\nthat I had done what was expected of me. But when I stopped and began to\nquestion the man about his past and present life, entering more or less\ninto particulars, I felt it was impossible to give him 3 or 20 kopeks;\nand I always began to finger the money in my purse, and, not knowing how\nmuch to give, I always gave more under these circumstances; but,\nnevertheless, I saw that the poor man went away from me dissatisfied.\nWhen I entered into still closer intercourse with him, my doubts as to\nhow much I should give increased; and, no matter what I gave, the\nrecipient seemed more and more gloomy and dissatisfied.\n\nAs a general rule, it always happens that if, upon nearer acquaintance\nwith the poor man I gave him three rubles or even more, I always saw\ngloominess, dissatisfaction, even anger depicted on his face; and\nsometimes, after having received from me ten rubles, he has left me\nwithout even thanking me, as if I had offended him.\n\nIn such cases I was always uncomfortable and ashamed, and felt myself\nguilty. When I watched the poor person during weeks, months, or years,\nhelped him, expressed my views, and became intimate with him, then our\nintercourse became a torment, and I saw that the man despised me. And I\nfelt that he was right in doing so. When in the street a beggar asks me,\nalong with other passers-by, for three kopeks, and I give it him, then,\nin his estimation, I am a kind and good man who gives "one of the\nthreads which go to make the shirt of a naked one": he expects nothing\nmore than a thread, and, if I give it, he sincerely blesses me.\n\nBut if I stop and speak to him as man to man, show him that I wish to be\nmore than a mere passer-by, and, if, as it often happened, he shed tears\nin relating his misfortune, then he sees in me not merely a chance\nhelper, but that which I wish him to see,--a kind man. If I am a kind\nman, my kindness cannot stop at twenty kopeks, or at ten rubles, or ten\nthousand. One cannot be a slightly kind man. Let us suppose that I give\nhim much; that I put him straight, dress him, and set him on his legs so\nthat he can help himself; but, from some reason or other, either from an\naccident or his own weakness, he again loses the great-coat and clothing\nand money I gave him, he is again hungry and cold, and he again comes to\nme, why should I refuse him assistance? For if the cause of my\nbenevolent activity was merely the attainment of some definite, material\nobject, such as giving him so many rubles or a certain great-coat, then,\nhaving given them I could be easy in my mind; but the cause of my\nactivity was not this: the cause of it was my desire to be a kind\nman--i.e., to see myself in everybody else. Everyone understands\nkindness in this way, and not otherwise.\n\nTherefore if such a man should spend in drink all you gave him twenty\ntimes over, and be again hungry and cold, then, if you are a benevolent\nman, you cannot help giving him more money, you can never leave off\ndoing so while you have more than he has; but if you draw back, you show\nthat all you did before was done not because you are benevolent, but\nbecause you wish to appear so to others and to him. And it was because I\nhad to back out of such cases, and to cease to give, and thus to disown\nthe good, that I felt a painful sense of shame.\n\nWhat was this feeling, then?\n\nI had experienced it in Liapin\'s house and in the country, and when I\nhappened to give money or anything else to the poor, and in my\nadventures among the town people. One case which occurred lately\nreminded me of it forcibly, and led me to discover its cause.\n\nIt happened in the country. I wanted twenty kopeks to give to a pilgrim.\nI sent my son to borrow it from somebody. He brought it to the man, and\ntold me that he had borrowed it from the cook. Some days after, other\npilgrims came, and I was again in need of twenty kopeks. I had a ruble.\nI recollected what I owed the cook, went into the kitchen, hoping that\nhe would have some more coppers. I said,--\n\n"I owe you twenty kopeks: here is a ruble."\n\nI had not yet done speaking when the cook called to his wife from the\nadjoining room: "Parasha, take it," he said.\n\nThinking she had understood what I wanted, I gave her the ruble. I must\ntell you that the cook had been living at our house about a week, and I\nhad seen his wife, but had never spoken to her. I merely wished to tell\nher to give me the change, when she briskly bowed herself over my hand\nand was about to kiss it, evidently thinking I was giving her the ruble.\nI stammered out something and left the kitchen. I felt ashamed,\npainfully ashamed, as I had not felt for a long time. I actually\ntrembled, and felt that I was making a wry face; and, groaning with\nshame, I ran away from the kitchen.\n\nThis feeling, which I fancied I had not deserved, and which came over me\nquite unexpectedly, impressed me particularly, because it was so long\nsince I had felt anything like it and also because I fancied that I, an\nold man, had been living in a way I had no reason to be ashamed of.\n\nThis surprised me greatly. I related the case to my family, to my\nacquaintances, and they all agreed that they also would have felt the\nsame. And I began to reflect: Why is it that I felt so?\n\nThe answer came from a case which had formerly occurred to me in Moscow.\nI reflected upon this case, and I understood the shame which I felt\nconcerning the incident with the cook\'s wife, and all the sensations of\nshame I had experienced during my charitable activity in Moscow, and\nwhich I always feel when I happen to give anything beyond trifling alms\nto beggars and pilgrims, which I am accustomed to give, and which I\nconsider not as charity, but as politeness and good breeding. If a man\nasks you for a light, you must light a match if you have it. If a man\nbegs for three or twenty kopeks, or a few rubles, you must give if you\nhave them. It is a question of politeness, not of charity.\n\nThe following is the case I referred to. I have already spoken about the\ntwo peasants with whom I sawed wood three years ago. One Saturday\nevening, in the twilight, I was walking with them back to town. They\nwere going to their master to receive their wages. On crossing the\nDragomilor bridge we met an old man. He begged, and I gave him twenty\nkopeks. I gave, thinking what a good impression my alms would make upon\nSimon, with whom I had been speaking on religious questions.\n\nSimon, the peasant from Vlad\xc3\xadmir, who had a wife and two children in\nMoscow, also stopped, turned up the lappet of his kaftan, and took out\nhis purse; and, after having looked over his money, he picked out a\nthree-kopek piece, gave it to the old man, and asked for two kopeks\nback. The old man showed him in his hand two three-kopek pieces and a\nsingle kopek. Simon looked at it, was about to take one kopek, but,\nchanging his mind, took off his cap, crossed himself, and went away,\nleaving the old man the three-kopek piece.\n\nI was acquainted with all Simon\'s pecuniary circumstances. He had\nneither house nor other property. When he gave the old man the three\nkopeks, he possessed six rubles and fifty kopeks, which he had been\nsaving up, and this was all the capital he had.\n\nMy property amounted to about six hundred thousand rubles. I had a wife\nand children, so also had Simon. He was younger than I, and had not so\nmany children; but his children were young, and two of mine were\ngrown-up men, old enough to work, so that our circumstances,\nindependently of our property, were alike, though even in this respect I\nwas better off than he.\n\nHe gave three kopeks, I gave twenty. What was, then, the difference in\nour gifts? What should I have given in order to do as he had done? He\nhad six hundred kopeks; out of these he gave one, and then another two.\nI had six hundred thousand rubles. In order to give as much as Simon\ngave, I ought to have given three thousand rubles, and asked the man to\ngive me back two thousand; and, in the event of his not having change,\nto leave him these two also, cross myself, and go away calmly,\nconversing about how people live in the manufactories, and what is the\nprice of liver in the Smolensk market.\n\nI thought about it at the time, but it was long before I was able to\ndraw from this case the conclusion which inevitably follows from it.\nThis conclusion appears to be so uncommon and strange, notwithstanding\nits mathematical accuracy, that it requires time to get accustomed to\nit. One is inclined to think there is some mistake, but there is none.\nIt is only the terrible darkness of prejudice in which we live.\n\nThis conclusion, when I arrived at it and recognized its inevitableness,\nexplained to me the nature of my feelings of shame in the presence of\nthe cook\'s wife, and before all the poor to whom I gave and still give\nmoney. Indeed, what is that money which I give to the poor, and which\nthe cook\'s wife thought I was giving her? In the majority of cases it\nforms such a minute part of my income that it cannot be expressed in a\nfraction comprehensible to Simon or to a cook\'s wife,--it is in most\ncases a millionth part or thereabout. I give so little that my gift is\nnot, and cannot be, a sacrifice to me: it is only a something with which\nI amuse myself when and how it pleases me. And this was indeed how my\ncook\'s wife had understood me. If I gave a stranger in the street a\nruble or twenty kopeks, why should I not give her also a ruble? To her,\nsuch a distribution of money is the same thing as a gentleman throwing\ngingerbread nuts into a crowd. It is the amusement of people who possess\nmuch "fool\'s money." I was ashamed, because the mistake of the cook\'s\nwife showed me plainly what ideas she and all poor people must have of\nme. "He is throwing away \'fool\'s money\'"; that is, money not earned by\nhim.\n\nAnd, indeed, what is my money, and how did I come by it? One part of it\nI collected in the shape of rent for my land, which I had inherited from\nmy father. The peasant sold his last sheep or cow in order to pay it.\n\nAnother part of my money I received from the books I had written. If my\nbooks are harmful, and yet sell, they can only do so by some seductive\nattraction, and the money which I receive for them is badly earned\nmoney; but if my books are useful, the thing is still worse. I do not\ngive them to people, but say, "Give me so many rubles, and I will sell\nthem to you."\n\nAs in the former case a peasant sells his last sheep, here a poor\nstudent or a teacher does it: each poor person who buys denies himself\nsome necessary thing in order to give me this money. And now that I have\ngathered much of such money what am I to do with it? I take it to town,\ngive it to the poor only when they satisfy all my fancies and come to\ntown to clean pavements, lamps, or boots, to work for me in the\nfactories, and so on. And with this money I draw from them all I can. I\ntry to give them as little as I can and take from them as much as\npossible.\n\nNow, quite unexpectedly, I begin to share all this said money with these\nsame poor persons for nothing; but not with everyone, only as fancy\nprompts me. And why should not every poor man expect that his turn might\ncome to-day to be one of those with whom I amuse myself by giving them\nmy "fool\'s money"?\n\nSo everyone regards me as the cook\'s wife did. And I had gone about with\nthe notion that this was charity,--this taking away thousands with one\nhand, and with the other throwing kopeks to those I select!\n\nNo wonder I was ashamed. But before I can begin to do good I must leave\noff the evil and put myself in a position in which I should cease to\ncause it. But all my course of life is evil. If I were to give away a\nhundred thousand, I should not yet have put myself in a condition in\nwhich I could do good, because I have still five hundred thousand left.\n\nIt is only when I possess nothing at all that I shall be able to do a\nlittle good; such as, for instance, the poor prostitute did who nursed a\nsick woman and her child for three days. Yet this seemed to me to be but\nso little! And _I_ ventured to think of doing good! One thing only was\ntrue, which I at first felt on seeing the hungry and cold people outside\nLiapin\'s house,--that _I_ was guilty of that; and that to live as I did\nwas impossible, utterly impossible. What shall we do then? If somebody\nstill needs an answer to this question, I will, by God\'s permission,\ngive one, in detail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nIt was hard for me to own this; but when I had got so far I was\nterrified at the delusion in which I had been living. I had been head\nover ears in the mud myself, and yet I had been trying to drag others\nout of it.\n\nWhat is it that I really want? I want to do good; I want to contrive so\nthat no human beings shall be hungry and cold, and that men may live as\nit is proper for them to live. I desire this; and I see that in\nconsequence of all sorts of violence, extortions, and various expedients\nin which I too take part, the working people are deprived of the\nnecessary things, and the non-working community, to whom I also belong,\nmonopolize the labour of others. I see that this use of other people\'s\nlabour is distributed thus: That the more cunning and complicated the\ndevices employed by the man himself (or by those from whom he has\ninherited his property), the more largely he employs the labours of\nother people, and the less he works himself.\n\nFirst come the millionaires; then the wealthy bankers, merchants,\nland-owners, government officials; then the smaller bankers, merchants,\ngovernment officials and land-owners, to whom I belong too; then\nshopmen, publicans, usurers, police sergeants and inspectors, teachers,\nsacristans, clerks; then, again, house-porters, footmen, coachmen,\nwater-carters, cabmen, pedlers; and then, last of all, the workmen,\nfactory hands and peasants, the number of this class in proportion to\nthe former being as ten to one.\n\nI see that the lives of nine-tenths of the working people essentially\nrequire exertion and labour, like every other natural mode of living;\nbut that, in consequence of the devices by which the necessaries of life\nare taken away from these people, their lives become every year more\ndifficult, and more beset with privations; and our lives, the lives of\nthe non-labouring community, owing to the co-operation of sciences and\narts which have this very end in view, become every year more sumptuous,\nmore attractive and secure.\n\nI see that in our days the life of a labouring man, and especially the\nlives of the old people, women, and children of the working-classes, are\nquite worn away by increased labour out of proportion to their\nnourishment, and that even the very first necessaries of life are not\nsecured for them. I see that side by side with these the lives of the\nnon-labouring class, to which I belong, are each year more and more\nfilled up with superfluities and luxury, and are becoming continually\nmore secure. The lives of the wealthy have reached that degree of\nsecurity of which in olden times men only dreamed in fairy-tales, to the\ncondition of the owner of the magic purse with the "inexhaustible\nruble"; to a state where a man not only is entirely free from the law of\nlabour for the sustenance of his life, but has the possibility of\nenjoying all the goods of this life without working, and of bequeathing\nto his children, or to anyone he chooses, this purse with the\n"inexhaustible ruble."\n\nI see that the results of the labour of men pass over more than ever\nfrom the masses of labourers to those of the non-labourers; that the\npyramid of the social structure is, as it were, being rebuilt, so that\nthe stones of the foundation pass to the top, and the rapidity of this\npassage increases in a kind of geometric progression.\n\nI see that there is going on something like what would take place in an\nant-hill if the society of ants should lose the sense of the general\nlaw, and some of them were to take the results of labour out of the\nfoundations and carry them to the top of the hill, making the foundation\nnarrower and narrower and thus enlarging the top, and so by that means\ncause their fellows to pass also from the foundation to the top.\n\nI see that instead of the ideal of a laborious life, men have created\nthe ideal of the purse with the "inexhaustible ruble." The rich, I among\ntheir number, arrange this ruble for themselves by various devices; and\nin order to enjoy it we locate ourselves in towns, in a place where\nnothing is produced but everything is swallowed up.\n\nThe poor labouring man, swindled so that the rich may have this magic\nruble, follows them to town; and there he also has recourse to tricks,\neither arranging matters so that he may work little and enjoy much (thus\nmaking the condition of other workingmen still more heavy), or, not\nhaving attained this state, he ruins himself and drifts into the\ncontinually and rapidly increasing number of cold and hungry tenants of\ndoss-houses.\n\nI belong to the class of those men who by means of these various devices\ntake away from the working people the necessaries of life, and who thus,\nas it were, create for themselves the inexhaustible fairy ruble which\ntempts in turn these unfortunate ones.\n\nI wish to help men; and therefore it is clear that first of all I ought\non the one side to cease to plunder them as I am doing now, and on the\nother to leave off tempting them. But by means of most complicated,\ncunning, and wicked contrivances practised for centuries, I have made\nmyself the owner of this ruble; that is, have got into a condition\nwhere, never doing anything myself, I can compel hundreds and thousands\nof people to work for me, and I am really availing myself of this\nprivileged monopoly notwithstanding that all the time I imagine I pity\nthese men and wish to help them.\n\nI sit on the neck of a man, and having quite crushed him down compel him\nto carry me and will not alight from off his shoulders, though I assure\nmyself and others that I am very sorry for him and wish to ease his\ncondition by every means in my power--except by getting off his back.\n\nSurely this is plain. If I wish to help the poor, that is, to make the\npoor cease to be poor, I ought not to create the poor. Yet I give money\ncapriciously to those who have gone astray, and take away tens of rubles\nfrom men who have not yet become bad, thereby making them poor and at\nthe same time depraved.\n\nThis is very clear; but it was exceedingly difficult for me to\nunderstand at first, without some modification or reserve which would\njustify my position. However as soon as I come to see my own error, all\nthat formerly appeared strange, complicated, clouded, and inexplicable,\nbecame quite simple and intelligible; but the important matter was, that\nthe direction of my life indicated by this explanation, became at once,\nsimple, clear, and agreeable, instead of being, as formerly, intricate,\nincomprehensible, and painful.\n\nWho am I, I thought, that desire to better men\'s condition? I say I\ndesire this, and yet I do not get up till noon, after having played\ncards in a brilliantly lighted saloon all night,--I, an enfeebled and\neffeminate man requiring the help and services of hundreds of people, I\ncome to help them! to help these men who rise at five, sleep on boards,\nfeed on cabbage and bread, understand how to plough, to reap, to put a\nhandle to an axe, to hew, to harness horses, to sew; men who, by their\nstrength and perseverance and skill and self-restraint are a hundred\ntimes stronger than I who come to help them.\n\nWhat _could_ I experience in my intercourse with these people but shame?\nThe weakest of them, a drunkard, an inhabitant of Rzhanoff\'s house, he\nwhom they call "the sluggard," is a hundred times more laborious than I;\nhis balance, so to say,--in other words the relation between what he\ntakes from men and what he gives to them,--is a thousand times more to\nhis credit than mine when I count what I receive from others and what I\ngive them in return. And such men I go to assist!\n\nI go to help the poor. But of the two who is the poorer? No one is\npoorer than myself. I am a weak, good-for-nothing parasite who can only\nexist under very peculiar conditions, can live only when thousands of\npeople labour to support this life which is not useful to anyone. And I,\nthis very caterpillar which eats up the leaves of a tree, I wish to help\nthe growth and the health of the tree and to cure it!\n\nAll my life is spent thus: I eat, talk, and listen; then I eat, write,\nor read, which are only talking and listening in another form; I eat\nagain, and play; then eat, talk, and listen, and finally eat and go to\nsleep: and thus every day is spent; I neither do anything else nor\nunderstand how to do it. And in order that I may enjoy this life it is\nnecessary that from morning till night house-porters, dvorniks, cooks\n(male and female), footmen, coachmen, and laundresses, should work; to\nsay nothing of the manual labour necessary so that the coachmen, cooks,\nfootmen, and others may have the instruments and articles by which and\nupon which they work for me,--axes, casks, brushes, dishes, furniture,\nglasses, shoe-black, kerosene, hay, wood, and food. All these men and\nwomen work hard all the day and every day in order that I may talk, eat,\nand sleep. And I, this useless man, imagined I was able to benefit the\nvery people who were serving me! That I did not benefit any one and that\nI was ashamed of myself, is not so strange as the fact that such a\nfoolish idea ever came into my mind.\n\nThe woman who nursed the sick old man helped him; the peasant\'s wife,\nwho cut a slice of her bread earned by herself, from the very sowing of\nthe corn that made it, helped the hungry one; Simon, who gave three\nkopeks which he had earned, assisted the pilgrim, because these three\nkopeks really represented his labour; but I had served nobody, worked\nfor no one, and knew very well that my money did not represent my\nlabour.\n\nAnd so I felt that in money, or in money\'s worth, and in the possession\nof it, there was something wrong and evil; that the money itself, and\nthe fact of my having it, was one of the chief causes of those evils\nwhich I had seen before me; and I asked myself, What is money?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nMoney! Then what is money?\n\nIt is answered, money represents labour. I meet educated people who even\nassert that money represents labour performed by those who possess it. I\nconfess that I myself formerly shared this opinion, although I did not\nvery clearly understand it. But now it became necessary for me to learn\nthoroughly what money is.\n\nIn order to do so, I addressed myself to science. Science says that\nmoney in itself is neither unjust nor pernicious; that money is the\nnatural result of the conditions of social life, and is indispensable,\nfirst, for convenience of exchange; secondly, as a measure of value;\nthirdly, for saving; and fourthly, for payments.\n\nThe fact that when I have in my pocket three rubles to spare, which I am\nnot in need of, I have only to whistle and in every civilized town I can\nobtain a hundred people ready for these three rubles to do the worst,\nmost disgusting, and humiliating act I require, it is said, comes not\nfrom money, but from the very complicated conditions of the economical\nlife of nations!\n\nThe dominion of one man over others does not come from money, but from\nthe circumstance that a workingman does not receive the full value of\nhis labour; and the fact that he does not get the full value of his\nlabour depends upon the nature of capital, rent, and wages, and upon\ncomplicated connections between the distribution and consumption of\nwealth.\n\nIn plain language, it means that people who have money may twist round\ntheir finger those who have none. But science says that this is an\nillusion; that in every kind of production three factors take\npart,--land, savings of labour (capital), and labour, and that the\ndominion of the few over the many proceeds from the various connections\nbetween these factors of production, because the two first factors, land\nand capital, are not in the hands of working people; and from this fact\nand from the various combinations which result from it this domination\nproceeds.\n\nWhence comes the great power of money, which strikes us all with a sense\nof its injustice and cruelty? Why is one man, by the means of money, to\nhave dominion over others? Science says, "It comes from the division of\nthe factors of production, and from the consequent combinations which\noppress the worker."\n\nThis answer has always appeared to me to be strange, not only because it\nleaves one part of the question unnoticed (namely, the significance of\nmoney), but also because of the division of the factors of production,\nwhich to an unprejudiced man will always appear artificial and out of\ntouch with reality. Science asserts that in every production three\nagents come into operation,--land, capital and labour; and along with\nthis division it is understood that property (or its value in money) is\nnaturally divided among those who possess one of these agents; thus,\nrent (the value of the ground) belongs to the land-owner; interest\nbelongs to the capitalist; and wages to the worker.\n\nIs this really so?\n\nFirst, is it true that in every production only three agencies operate?\nNow, while I am writing proceeds the production of hay around me. Of\nwhat is this production composed? I am told of the land which produces\nthe grass; of capital (scythes, rakes, pitch-forks, carts which are\nnecessary for the housing of the hay); and of labour. But I see that\nthis is not true. Besides the land, there is the sun and rain; and, in\naddition, social order, which has been keeping these meadows from any\ndamage which might be caused by letting stray cattle graze upon them,\nthe skill of workmen, their knowledge of language, and many other\nagencies of production,--which, for some unknown reason, are not taken\ninto consideration by political economy.\n\nThe power of the sun is as necessary as the land, even more. I may\nmention the instances when men (in a town, for example), assume the\nright to keep out the sun from others by means of walls or trees. Why,\nthen, is the sun not included among the factors of production?\n\nRain is another means as necessary as the ground itself. The air too. I\ncan imagine men without water and pure air because other men had assumed\nto themselves the right to monopolise these essential necessaries of\nall. Public security is likewise a necessary element. Food and dress for\nworkmen are similar factors in production; this is even recognized by\nsome economists. Education, the knowledge of language which creates the\npossibility to apply work, is likewise an agent. I could fill a volume\nby enumerating such combinations, not mentioned by science.\n\nWhy, then, are three only to be chosen, and laid as a foundation for the\nscience of political economy? Sunshine and water equally with the earth\nare factors in production, so with the food and clothes of the workers,\nand the transmission of knowledge. All may be taken as distinct factors\nin production. Simply because the right of men to enjoy the rays of the\nsun, rain, food, language, and audience, are challenged only on rare\noccasions; but the use of land and of the instruments of labour are\nconstantly challenged in society.\n\nThis is the true foundation; and the division of the factors of\nproduction into three, is quite arbitrary, and is not involved in the\nnature of things. But it may perhaps be urged that this division is so\nsuitable to man, that wherever economic relationships are formed these\nthree factors appear at once and alone.\n\nLet us see whether this is really so.\n\nFirst of all, I look at what is around me,--at Russian colonists, of\nwhom millions have for ages existed. They come to a land, settle\nthemselves on it, and begin to work; and it does not enter the mind of\nany of them that a man who does not use the land can have any claim to\nit,--and the land does not assert any rights of its own. On the\ncontrary, the colonists conscientiously recognize the communism of the\nland and the right of every one of them to plough and to mow wherever he\nlikes.\n\nFor cultivation, for gardening, for building houses, the colonists\nobtain various implements of labour: nor does it enter the mind of any\nof them that these instruments of labour may be allowed to bring profit\nin themselves, and the capital does not assert any rights of its own. On\nthe contrary, the colonists consciously recognize among themselves that\nall interest for tools, or borrowed corn or capital, is unjust.\n\nThey work upon a free land, labour with their own tools, or with those\nborrowed without interest, each for himself, or all together, for common\nbusiness; and in such a community, it is impossible to prove either the\nexistence of rent, interest accruing from capital, or remuneration for\nlabour.\n\nIn referring to such a community I am not indulging my fancy but\ndescribing what has always taken place, not only among Russian\ncolonists, but everywhere, as long as human nature is not sinned\nagainst.\n\nI am describing what appears to everyone to be natural and rational. Men\nsettle on land, and each member undertakes the business which suits him,\nand, having procured the necessary tools, does his own work.\n\nIf these men find it more convenient to work together, they form a\nworkmen\'s association. But neither in separate households, nor in\nassociations, will separate agents of production appear till men\nartificially and forcibly divide them. There will be simply labour and\nthe necessary conditions of labour,--the sun which warms all, the air\nwhich they breathe, water which they drink, land on which they labour,\nclothes on the body, food in the stomach, stakes, shovels, ploughs,\nmachines with which they work. And it is evident that neither the rays\nof the sun, nor the clothes on the body, nor the stakes, nor the spade,\nnor the plough, with which each man works, nor the machines with which\nthey labour in the workmen\'s association, can belong to anyone else than\nthose who enjoy the rays of the sun, breathe the air, drink the water,\neat the bread, clothe their bodies, and labour with the spade or with\nthe machines, because all these are necessary only for those who use\nthem. And when men act thus, we see they act rationally.\n\nTherefore, observing all the economic conditions created among men, I do\nnot see that division into three is natural. I see, on the contrary,\nthat it is neither natural nor rational.\n\nBut perhaps the setting apart of these three does not occur in primitive\nsocieties, only when the population increases and cultivation begins to\ndevelop it is unavoidable. And we cannot but recognise the fact that\nthis division has occurred in European society.\n\nLet us see whether it is really so.\n\nWe are told that in European society this division of agencies has been;\nthat is, that one man possesses land, another accomplished the\ninstruments of labour, and the third is without land and instruments.\n\nWe have grown so accustomed to this assertion that we are no longer\nstruck by the strangeness of it. But in this assertion lies an inner\ncontradiction. The conception of a labouring man, includes the land on\nwhich he lives and the tools with which he works. If he did not live on\nthe land and had no tools he would not be a labourer. A workman deprived\nof land and tools never existed and never can exist. There cannot be a\nbootmaker without a house for his work built on land, without water,\nair, and tools to work with.\n\nIf the peasant has no land, horse, water or scythe; if the bootmaker is\nwithout a house, water, or awl, then that means that some one has driven\nhim from the ground, or taken it from him, and has cheated him out of\nhis scythe, cart, horse, or awl; but it does not in any way mean that\nthere can be country labourers without scythes or bootmakers without\ntools.\n\nAs you cannot think of a fisherman on dry land without fishing\nimplements, unless you imagine him driven away from the water by some\none who has taken his fishing implements from him; so also you cannot\npicture a workman without land on which to live, and without tools for\nhis trade, unless somebody has driven him from the former, or robbed him\nof the latter.\n\nThere may be men who are hunted from one place to another, and who,\nhaving been robbed, are compelled perforce to work for another man and\nmake things necessary for themselves, but this does not mean that such\nis the nature of production. It means only that in such case, the\nnatural conditions of production are violated.\n\nBut if we are to consider as factors of production all of which a\nworkman may be deprived by force, why not count among these the claim on\nthe person of a slave? Why not count claims on the rain and the rays of\nthe sun?\n\nOne man might build a wall and so keep the sun from his neighbour;\nanother might come who would turn the course of a river through his own\npond and so contaminate its water; or claim a fellow-being as his own\nproperty. But none of these claims, although enforced by violence, can\nbe recognised as a basis. It is therefore as wrong to accept the\nartificial rights to land and tools as separate factors in production,\nas to recognise as such the invented rights to use sunshine, air, water,\nor the person of another.\n\nThere may be men who claim the land and the tools of a workman, as there\nwere men who claimed the persons of others, and as there may be men who\nassert their rights to the exclusive use of the rays of the sun, or of\nwater and air. There may be men who drive away a workman from place to\nplace, taking from him by force the products of his labour as they are\nproduced, and the very instruments of its production, who compel him to\nwork, not for himself, but for his master, as in the factories;--all\nthis is possible; but the conception of a workman without land and tools\nis still an impossibility, as much as that a man can willingly become\nthe property of another, notwithstanding men have claimed other men for\nmany generations.\n\nAnd as the claim of property in the person of another cannot deprive a\nslave of his innate right to seek his own welfare and not that of his\nmaster; so, too, the claim to the exclusive possession of land and the\ntools of others cannot deprive the labourer of his inherent rights as a\nman to live on the land and to work with his own tools, or with communal\ntools, as he thinks most useful for himself.\n\nAll that science can say in examining the present economic question, is\nthis: that in Europe certain claims to the land and the tools of workmen\nare made, in consequence of which, for some of these workmen (but by no\nmeans for all of them), the proper conditions of production are\nviolated, so that they are deprived of land and implements of labour and\ncompelled to work with the tools of others. But it is certainly not\nestablished that this accidental violation of the law of production is\nthe fundamental law itself.\n\nIn saying that this separate consideration of the factors is the\nfundamental law of production, the economist is doing the very thing a\nzo\xc3\xb6logist would do, if on seeing a great many siskins with their wings\ncut, and kept in little cages, he should assert that this was the\nessential condition of the life of birds, and that their life is\ncomposed of such conditions.\n\nHowever many siskins there may be, kept in paste-board houses, with\ntheir wings cut, a zo\xc3\xb6logist cannot say that these, and a tiny pail of\nwater running up rails, are the conditions of the birds\' lives. And\nhowever great the number of workpeople there may be, driven from place\nto place, and deprived of their productions as well as their tools, the\nnatural right of man to live on the land, and to work with his own\ntools, is essential to him, and so it will remain forever.\n\nOf course there are some who lay claim to the land and to the tools of\nworkmen, just as in former ages there were some who laid claim to the\npersons of others; but there can be no real division of men into lords\nand slaves--as they wanted to establish in the ancient world--any more\nthan there can be any real division in the agents of production (land\nand capital, etc.), as the economists are trying to establish.\n\nThese unlawful claims on the liberty of other men, science calls "the\nnatural conditions of production." Instead of taking its fundamental\nprinciples from the natural properties of human societies, science took\nthem from a special case; and desiring to justify this case, it\nrecognized the right of some men to the land on which other men earn\ntheir living, and to the tools with which others again work; in other\nwords, it recognized as a right something which had never existed, and\ncannot exist, and which is in itself a contradiction, because the claim\nof the man to the land on which he does not labour, is in essence\nnothing else than the right to use the land which he does not use; the\nclaim on the tools of others is nothing else than the assumption of a\nright to work with implements with which a man does not work.\n\nScience, by dividing the factors of production, declares that the\nnatural condition of a workman--that is, of a man in the true sense of\nthe word--is the unnatural condition in which he lives at present, just\nas in ancient times, by the division of men into citizens and slaves, it\nwas asserted that the unnatural condition of slavery was the natural\ncondition of life.\n\nThis very division, which science has accepted only for the purpose of\njustifying the existing injustice, and the recognition of this division\nas the foundation of all its inquiries, is responsible for the fact that\nscience vainly tries to explain existing phenomena and, denying the\nclearest and plainest answers to the questions that arise, gives answers\nwhich have absolutely no meaning in them.\n\nThe question of economic science is this: What is the cause of the fact\nthat some men, by means of money, acquire an imaginary right to land and\ncapital, and may make slaves of those who have no money? The answer\nwhich presents itself to common sense is, that it is the result of\nmoney, the nature of which is to enslave men.\n\nBut economic science denies this, and says: This arises, not from the\nnature of money, but from the fact that some men have land and capital,\nand others have neither.\n\nWe ask: Why do persons who possess land and capital oppress those who\npossess neither? And we are answered: Because they possess land and\ncapital.\n\nBut this is just what we are inquiring about. Is not deprivation of land\nand tools enforced slavery? And the answer is like saying, "A remedy is\nnarcotic because its effects are narcotic." Life does not cease to put\nthis essential question, and even science herself notices and tries to\nanswer it, but does not succeed, because, starting from her own\nfundamental principles, she only turns herself round in a vicious\ncircle.\n\nIn order to give itself a satisfactory answer to the question, science\nmust first of all deny that wrong division of the agents of production,\nand cease to acknowledge the result of the phenomena as being their\ncause; and she must seek, first the more obvious, and then the remoter,\ncauses of those phenomena which constitute the matter questioned.\n\nScience must answer the question, Why are some men deprived of land and\ntools while others possess both? or, Why is it that lands and tools are\ntaken from the people who labour on the land and work with the tools?\n\nAnd as soon as economic science puts this question to herself she will\nget new ideas which will transform all the previous ideas of sham\nscience,--which has been moving in an unalterable circle of\npropositions,--that the miserable condition of the workers proceeds from\nthe fact that they are miserable.\n\nTo simple-minded persons it must seem unquestionable that the obvious\nreason of the oppression of some men by others is money. But science,\ndenying this, says that money is only a medium of exchange, which has no\nconnection with slavery of men.\n\nLet us see whether it is so or not.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nWhat is the origin of money? What are the conditions under which nations\nalways have money, and under what circumstances need nations not use\nmoney?\n\nThere are small tribes in Africa, and one in Australia, who live as the\nSknepies and the Drevlyans lived in olden times. These tribes lived by\nbreeding cattle and cultivating gardens. We become acquainted with them\nat the dawn of history, and history begins by recording the fact that\nsome invaders appear on the scene. And invaders always do the same\nthing: they take away from the aborigines everything they can\ntake,--cattle, corn, and cloth; they even make prisoners, male and\nfemale, and carry them away.\n\nIn a few years the invaders appear again, but the people have not yet\ngot over the consequences of their first misfortunes, and there is\nscarcely anything to take from them; so the invaders invent new and\nbetter means of making use of their victims.\n\nThese methods are very simple, and present themselves naturally to the\nmind of all men. The _first_ is personal slavery. There is a drawback to\nthis, because the invaders must take over the entire control and\nadministration of the tribe, and feed all the slaves; hence, naturally,\nthere appears the _second_. The people are left on their own land, but\nthis becomes the recognized property of the invaders, who portion it out\namong the leading military men, by whose means the labour of the tribe\nis utilized and transferred to the conquerors.\n\nBut this, too, has its drawback. It is inconvenient to have to oversee\nall the production of the conquered people, and thus the _third_ means\nis introduced, as primitive as the two former; this is, the levying of a\ncertain obligatory tax to be paid by the conquered at stated periods.\n\nThe object of conquest is to take from the conquered the greatest\npossible amount of the product of their labour. It is evident, that, in\norder to do this, the conquerors must take the articles which are the\nmost valuable to the conquered, and which at the same time are not\ncumbersome, and are convenient for keeping,--skins of animals, and gold.\n\nSo the conquerors lay upon the family or the tribe a tax in these skins\nor gold, to be paid at fixed times; and thus, by means of this tribute,\nthey utilize the labour of the conquered people in the most convenient\nway.\n\nWhen the skins and the gold have been taken from the original owners,\nthey are compelled to sell all they have amongst themselves to obtain\nmore gold and skins for their masters; that is, they have to sell their\nproperty and their labour.\n\nSo it was in ancient times, in the Middle Ages, and so it occurs now. In\nthe ancient world, where the subjugation of one people by another was\nfrequent, personal slavery was the most widespread method of\nsubjugation, and the centre of gravity in this compulsion, owing to the\nnon-recognition of the equality of men. In the Middle Ages,\nfeudalism--land-ownership and the servitude connected with it--partly\ntakes the place of personal slavery, and the centre of compulsion is\ntransferred from persons to land. In modern times, since the discovery\nof America, the development of commerce, and the influx of gold (which\nis accepted as a universal medium of exchange), the money tribute has\nbecome, with the increase of state power, the chief instrument for\nenslaving men, and upon this all economic relations are now based.\n\nIn "The Literary Miscellany" there is an article by Professor Yanjoul in\nwhich he describes the recent history of the Fiji Islands. If I were\ntrying to find the most pointed illustration of how in our day the\ncompulsory money payment became the chief instrument in enslaving some\nmen by others, I could not imagine anything more striking and convincing\nthan this trustworthy history,--history based upon documents of facts\nwhich are of recent occurrence.\n\nIn the South-Sea Islands, in Polynesia, lives a race called the Fiji.\nThe group on which they live, says Professor Yanjoul, is composed of\nsmall islands, which altogether comprise about forty thousand square\nmiles. Only half of these islands are inhabited, by a hundred and fifty\nthousand natives and fifteen hundred white men. The natives were\nreclaimed from savagery a long time ago, and were distinguished among\nthe other natives of Polynesia by their intellectual capacities. They\nappear to be capable of labour and development, which they proved by the\nfact that within a short period they became good workmen and cattle\nbreeders.\n\nThe inhabitants were well-to-do, but in the year 1859 the condition of\ntheir state became desperate: the nation and its representative, Kakabo,\nwere in need of money. This money, forty-five thousand dollars, was\nwanted as compensation or indemnification demanded of them by the United\nStates of America for violence said to have been done by Fijis to some\ncitizens of the American Republic.\n\nTo collect this, the Americans sent a squadron, which unexpectedly\nseized some of the best islands under the pretext of guaranty, and\nthreatened to bombard and ruin the towns if the indemnification were not\npaid over on a certain date to the representatives of America.\n\nThe Americans were among the first colonists who came to the Fiji\nIslands with the missionaries. They chose and (under one pretext or\nanother) took possession of the best pieces of land on the islands, and\nestablished there cotton and coffee plantations. They hired whole crowds\nof natives, binding them by contracts unknown to this half-civilized\nrace, or they acted through special contractors and dealers of human\nmerchandise.\n\nMisunderstandings between these master planters and the natives, whom\nthey considered almost as slaves, were unavoidable, and it was some of\nthese quarrels which served as a pretext for the American\nindemnification.\n\nNotwithstanding their prosperity the Fijis had preserved almost up to\nthat time the forms of the so-called natural economy which existed in\nEurope during the Middle Ages: money was scarcely in circulation among\nthem, and their trade was almost exclusively on the barter basis,--one\nmerchandise being exchanged for another, and the few social taxes and\nthose of the state being paid in rural products. What could the Fijis\nand their King Kakabo do, when the Americans demanded forty-five\nthousand dollars under terrible threats in the event of nonpayment? To\nthe Fijis the very figures seemed inconceivable, to say nothing of the\nmoney itself, which they had never seen in such large quantities. After\ndeliberating with other chiefs, Kakabo made up his mind to apply to the\nQueen of England, at first merely asking her to take the islands under\nher protection, but afterwards requesting definite annexation.\n\nBut the English regarded this request cautiously, and were in no hurry\nto assist the half-savage monarch out of his difficulty. Instead of\ngiving a direct answer, they sent special commissioners to make\ninquiries about the Fiji Islands in 1860, in order to be able to decide\nwhether it was worth while to annex them to the British Possessions, and\nto lay out money to satisfy the American claims.\n\nMeanwhile the American Government continued to insist upon payment, and\nas a pledge held in their _de facto_ dominion some of the best parts,\nand, having looked closely into the national wealth, raised their former\nclaim to ninety thousand dollars, threatening to increase it still more\nif Kakabo did not pay at once.\n\nBeing thus pushed on every side, and knowing nothing of European means\nof credit accommodation, the poor king, acting on the advice of European\ncolonists, began to try to raise money in Melbourne among the merchants,\ncost what it might, if even he should be obliged to yield his kingdom\ninto private hands.\n\nSo in consequence of his application a commercial society was formed in\nMelbourne. This joint-stock company, which took the name of the\n"Polynesian Company," formed a treaty with the chiefs of the\nFiji-Islanders on the most advantageous terms. It took over the debt to\nthe American Government, pledging itself to pay it by several\ninstalments; and for this the company received, according to the first\ntreaty, one, and then two hundred thousand acres of the best land,\nselected by itself; perpetual immunity from all taxes and dues for all\nits factories, operations, and colonies, and the exclusive right for a\nlong period to establish banks in the Fiji Islands, with the privilege\nof issuing unlimited notes.\n\nThis treaty was definitely concluded in the year 1868, and there has\nappeared in the Fiji Islands, side by side with the local government, of\nwhich Kakabo is the head, another powerful authority,--a commercial\norganization, with large estates over all the islands, exercising a\npowerful influence upon the government.\n\nUp to this time the wants of the government of Kakabo had been satisfied\nwith a payment in local products, and a small custom tax on goods\nimported. But with the conclusion of the treaty and the formation of the\ninfluential "Polynesian Company," the king\'s financial circumstances had\nchanged.\n\nA considerable part of the best land in his dominion having passed into\nthe hands of the company, his income from the land had therefore\ndiminished; on the other hand the income from the custom taxes also\ndiminished, because the company had obtained for itself the right to\nimport and export all kinds of goods free of duties.\n\nThe natives--ninety-nine per cent. of the population--had never paid\nmuch in custom duties, as they bought scarcely any of the European\nproductions except some stuffs and hardware; and now, from the freeing\nof custom duties of many well-to-do Europeans along with the Polynesian\nCompany, the income of King Kakabo was reduced to _nil_, and he was\nobliged to take steps to resuscitate it if possible.\n\nHe began to consult his white friends as to the best way to remedy the\ntrouble, and they advised him to create the first direct tax in the\ncountry; and, in order, I suppose, to have less trouble about it, to\nmake it in money. The tax was established in the form of a general\npoll-tax, amounting to one pound for every man, and to four shillings\nfor every woman, throughout the islands.\n\nAs I have already said, there still exists on the Fiji Islands a natural\neconomy and a trade by barter. Very few natives possess money. Their\nwealth consists chiefly of raw products and cattle; whilst the new tax\nrequired the possession of considerable sums of money at fixed times.\n\nUp to that date a native had not been accustomed to any individual\nburden in the interests of his government, except personal obligations;\nall the taxes which had to be paid, were paid by the community or\nvillage to which he belonged, and from the common fields from which he\nreceived his principal income.\n\nOne alternative was left to him,--to try to raise money from the\nEuropean colonists; that is, to address himself either to the merchant\nor to the planter.\n\nTo the first he was obliged to sell his productions on the merchant\'s\nown terms (because the tax-collector required money at a certain fixed\ndate), or even to raise money by the sale of his expected harvest, which\nenabled the merchant to take iniquitous interest. Or he had to address\nhimself to the planter, and sell him his labour; that is, to become his\nworkman: but the wages on the Fiji Islands were very low (owing, I\nsuppose, to the exceptionally great supply of labour); not exceeding a\nshilling a week for a grown-up man, or two pounds twelve shillings a\nyear; and therefore, merely to be able to get the money necessary to pay\nhis own tax, to say nothing of his family, a Fiji had to leave his\nhouse, his family, and his own land, often to go far away to another\nisland, and enslave himself to the planter for at least half a year;\neven then there was the payment for his family, which he must provide by\nsome other means.\n\nWe can understand the result of such a state of affairs. From his\nhundred and fifty thousand subjects, Kakabo collected only six thousand\npounds; and so there began a forcible extortion of taxes, unknown till\nthen, and a whole series of coercive measures.\n\nThe local administration, formerly incorruptible, soon made common cause\nwith the European planters, who began to have their own way with the\ncountry. For nonpayment of the taxes the Fijis were summoned to the\ncourt, and sentenced not only to pay the expenses but also to\nimprisonment for not less than six months. The prison really meant the\nplantations of the first white man who chose to pay the tax-money and\nthe legal expenses of the offender. Thus the white settlers received\ncheap labour to any amount.\n\nAt first this compulsory labour was fixed for not longer than half a\nyear; but afterwards the bribed judges found it possible to pass\nsentence for eighteen months, and even then to renew the sentence.\n\nVery quickly, in the course of a few years, the picture of the social\ncondition of the inhabitants of Fiji was quite changed.\n\nWhole districts, formerly flourishing, lost half of their population,\nand were greatly impoverished. All the male population, except the old\nand infirm, worked far away from their homes for European planters, to\nget money necessary for the taxes, or in consequence of the law court.\nThe women on the Fiji Islands had scarcely ever worked in the fields, so\nthat in the absence of the men, all the local farming was neglected and\nwent to ruin. And in the course of a few years, half the population of\nFiji had become the slaves of the colonists.\n\nTo relieve their position the Fiji-Islanders again appealed to England.\nA new petition was got up, subscribed by many eminent persons and\nchiefs, praying to be annexed to England; and this was handed to the\nBritish consul. Meanwhile, England, thanks to her scientific\nexpeditions, had time not only to investigate the affairs of the\nislands, but even to survey them, and duly to appreciate the natural\nriches of this fine corner of the globe.\n\nOwing to all these circumstances, the negotiations this time were\ncrowned with full success; and in 1874, to the great dissatisfaction of\nthe American planters, England officially took possession of the Fiji\nIslands, and added them to its colonies. Kakabo died, his heirs had a\nsmall pension assigned to them, and the administration of the islands\nwas intrusted to Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales.\nIn the first year of its annexation the Fiji-Islanders had no\nself-government, but were under the direction of Sir Hercules Robinson,\nwho appointed an administrator.\n\nTaking the islands into their hands, the English Government had to\nundertake the difficult task of gratifying various expectations raised\nby them. The natives, of course, first of all expected the abolition of\nthe hated poll-tax; one part of the white colonists (the Americans)\nlooked with suspicion upon the British rule; and another part (those of\nEnglish origin) expected all kinds of confirmations of their power over\nthe natives,--permission to enclose the land, and so on. The English\nGovernment, however, proved itself equal to the task; and its first act\nwas to abolish for ever the poll-tax, which had created the slavery of\nthe natives in the interest of a few colonists.\n\nBut here Sir Hercules Robinson had at once to face a difficult dilemma.\nIt was necessary to abolish the poll-tax, which had made the Fijis seek\nthe help of the English Government; but, at the same time, according to\nEnglish colonial policy, the colonies had to support themselves; they\nhad to find their own means for covering the expenses of the government.\nWith the abolition of the poll-tax, all the incomes of the Fijis (from\ncustom duties) did not amount to more than six thousand pounds, while\nthe government expenses required at least seventy thousand a year.\n\nHaving abolished the money tax, Sir Hercules Robinson now thought of a\nlabour tax; but this did not yield the sum necessary to feed him and his\nassistants. Matters did not mend until a new governor had been\nappointed,--Gordon,--who, to get out of the inhabitants the money\nnecessary to keep him and his officials, resolved not to demand money\nuntil it had come sufficiently into general circulation on the islands,\nbut to take from the natives their products, and to sell them himself.\n\nThis tragical episode in the lives of the Fijis is the clearest and best\nproof of the nature and true meaning of money in our time.\n\nIn this illustration every essential is represented. The first\nfundamental condition of slavery,--the guns, threats, murders, and\nplunder,--and lastly, money, the means of subjugation which has\nsupplanted all the others. That which in an historical sketch of\neconomical development, has to be investigated during centuries, we have\nhere, where all the forms of monetary violence have fully developed\nthemselves, concentrated in a space of ten years.\n\nThe drama begins thus: the American Government sends ships with loaded\nguns to the shores of the islands, whose inhabitants they want to\nenslave. The pretext of this threat is monetary; but the beginning of\nthe tragedy is the levelling of guns against all the inhabitants,--women,\nchildren, old people, and men,--though innocent of any crime.\n"Your money or your life,"--forty-five thousand dollars, then\nninety thousand or slaughter. But the ninety thousand are not to be had.\nSo now begins the second act: it is the postponement of a measure which\nwould be bloody, terrible, and concentrated in a short period; and the\nsubstitution of a suffering less perceptible, which can be laid upon\nall, and will last longer. And the natives, with their representative,\nseek to substitute for the massacre a slavery of money. They borrow\nmoney, and the method at once begins to operate like a disciplined army.\nIn five years the thing is done,--the men have not only lost their right\nto utilize their own land and their property, but also their\nliberty,--they have become slaves.\n\nHere begins act three. The situation is too painful, and the unfortunate\nones are told they may change their master and become the slaves of\nanother. Of freedom from the slavery brought about by the means of money\nthere is not one thought. And the people call for another master, to\nwhom they give themselves up, asking him to improve their condition. The\nEnglish come, see that dominion over these islanders will give them the\npossibility of feeding their already too greatly multiplied parasites,\nand take possession of the islands and their inhabitants.\n\nBut it does not take them in the form of personal slaves, it does not\ntake even the land, nor distribute it among its assistants. These old\nways are not necessary now: only one thing is necessary,--taxes which\nmust be large enough on the one hand to prevent the workingmen from\nfreeing themselves from virtual slavery, and on the other hand, to feed\nluxuriously a great number of parasites. The inhabitants must pay\nseventy thousand pounds sterling annually,--that is the fundamental\ncondition upon which England consents to free the Fijis from the\nAmerican despotism, and this is just what was wanting for the final\nenslaving of the inhabitants. But it turns out that the Fiji-Islanders\ncannot under any circumstances pay these seventy thousand pounds in\ntheir present state. The claim is too great.\n\nThe English temporarily modify it, and take a part of it out in natural\nproducts in order that in time, when money has come into circulation,\nthey may receive the full sum. They do not behave like the former\ncompany, whose conduct we may liken to the first coming of savage\ninvaders into an uncivilized land, when they want only to take as much\nas possible and then decamp; but England behaves like a more\nclear-sighted enslaver; she does not kill at one blow the goose with the\ngolden eggs, but feeds her in order that she may continue to lay them.\nEngland at first relaxes the reins for her own interest that she may\nhold them tight forever afterwards, and so has brought the\nFiji-Islanders into that state of permanent monetary thraldom in which\nall civilized European people now exist, and from which their chance of\nescape is not apparent.\n\nThis phenomenon repeats itself in America, in China, in Central Asia;\nand it is the same in the history of the conquest of all nations.\n\nMoney is an inoffensive means of exchange when it is not collected while\nloaded guns are directed from the sea-shore against the defenceless\ninhabitants. As soon as it is taken by the force of guns, the same thing\nmust inevitably take place which occurred on the Fiji Islands, and has\nalways and everywhere repeated itself.\n\nMen who consider it their lawful right to utilize the labour of others,\nwill achieve their ends by the means of a forcible demand of a sum of\nmoney which will compel the oppressed to become the slaves of the\noppressors.\n\nMoreover, that will happen which occurred between the English and the\nFijis,--the extortioners will always, in their demand for money, rather\nexceed the limit to which the amount of the sum required must rise, so\nthat the enslaving may be earlier. They will respect this limit only\nwhile they have moral sense and sufficient money for themselves: they\nwill overstep it when they lose their moral sense or even do not require\nfunds.\n\nAs for governments, they will always exceed this limit,--first, because\nfor a government there exists no moral sense of justice; and secondly,\nbecause, as everyone knows, every government is always in the greatest\nwant of money, through wars and the necessity of giving gratuities to\ntheir allies. All governments are insolvent, and involuntarily follow a\nmaxim expressed by a Russian statesman of the eighteenth century,--that\nthe peasant must be sheared of his wool lest it grow too long. All\ngovernments are hopelessly in debt, and this debt on an average (not\ntaking in consideration its occasional diminution in England and\nAmerica) is growing at a terrible rate. So also grow the budgets; that\nis, the necessity of struggling with other extortioners, and of giving\npresents to those who assist in extortion, and because of that grows the\nland rent.\n\nWages do not increase, not because of the law of rent, but because\ntaxes, collected with violence, exist, with the object of taking away\nfrom men their superfluities, so that they may be compelled to sell\ntheir labour to satisfy them,--utilizing their labour being the aim of\nraising the taxes.\n\nAnd their labour can only be utilized when, on a general average, the\ntaxes required are more than the labourers are able to give without\ndepriving themselves of all means of subsistence. The increase of wages\nwould put an end to the possibility of slavery; and therefore, as long\nas violence exists, wages can never be increased. The simple and plain\nmode of action of some men towards others, political economists term\n_the iron law_; the instrument by which such action is performed, they\ncall a medium of exchange; and money is this inoffensive medium of\nexchange necessary for men in their transactions with each other.\n\nWhy is it, then, that, whenever there is no violent demand for money\ntaxes, money in its true signification has never existed, and never can\nexist; but, as among the Fiji-Islanders, the Phoenicians, the Kirghis,\nand generally among men who do not pay taxes, such as the Africans,\nthere is either a direct exchange of produce, sheep, hides, skins, or\naccidental standards of value, such as shells?\n\nA definite kind of money, whatever it may be, always becomes not a means\nof exchange, but a means of ransoming from violence; and it begins to\ncirculate among men only when a definite standard is compulsorily\nrequired from all.\n\nIt is only then that everybody wants it equally, and only then does it\nreceive any value.\n\nAnd further, it is not the thing that is most convenient for exchange\nthat receives exchange value, but that which is required by the\ngovernment. If gold is demanded, gold becomes valuable: if knuckle-bones\nwere demanded, they, too, would become valuable. If it were not so, why,\nthen, has the issue of this means of exchange always been the\nprerogative of the government? The Fiji-Islanders, for instance, have\narranged among themselves their own means of exchange; well, then, let\nthem be free to exchange what and how they like, and you, men possessing\npower, or the means of violence, do not interfere with this exchange.\nBut instead of this you coin money, and do not allow anyone else to coin\nit; or, as is the case with us, you merely print some notes, engraving\nupon them the heads of the tsars, sign them with a particular signature,\nand threaten to punish every falsification of them. Then you distribute\nthis money to your assistants, and, under the name of duties and taxes,\nyou require everybody to give you such money or such notes with such\nsignatures, and so many of them, that a workman must give away all his\nlabour in order to get these notes or coins; and then you want to\nconvince us that this money is necessary for us as a means of exchange!\n\nHere are all men free, and none oppresses the others or keeps them in\nslavery; but money appears in society and immediately an iron law\nexists, in consequence of which rent increases and wages diminish to the\nminimum.\n\nThat half (nay, more than half) of the Russian peasants, in order to pay\ndirect and indirect taxes, voluntarily sell themselves as slaves to the\nland-owners or to manufacturers, does not at all signify (which is\nobvious); for the violent collection of the poll-taxes and indirect and\nland taxes, which have to be paid in money to the government and to its\nassistants (the landowners), _compels_ the workman to be a slave to\nthose who own money; but it means that this money, as a means of\nexchange, and an iron law, exist.\n\nBefore the serfs were free, I could compel Iv\xc3\xa1n to do any work; and if\nhe refused to do it, I could send him to the police-sergeant, and the\nlatter would give him the rod till he submitted. But if I compelled Iv\xc3\xa1n\nto overwork himself, and did not give him either land or food, the\nmatter would go up to the authorities, and I should have to answer for\nit.\n\nBut now that men are free, I can compel Iv\xc3\xa1n and Peter and Sidor to do\nevery kind of work; and if they refuse I give them no money to pay\ntaxes, and then they will be flogged till they submit: besides this, I\nmay also make a German, a Frenchman, a Chinaman, and an Indian, work for\nme by that means, so that, if they do not submit, I shall not give them\nmoney to hire land, or to buy bread, because they have neither land nor\nbread. And if I make them overwork themselves, or kill them with excess\nof labour, nobody will say a word to me about it; and, moreover, if I\nhave read books on political economy I shall be quite sure that all men\nare free and that money does not create slavery!\n\nOur peasants have long known that with a ruble one can hurt more than\nwith a stick. It is only political economists who cannot see it.\n\nTo say that money does not create bondage, is the same as to have\nasserted, fifty years ago, that serfdom did not create slavery.\nPolitical economists say that money is an inoffensive medium of\nexchange, notwithstanding the fact that its possession enables one man\nto enslave another. Why, then, was it not said half a century ago that\nservitude was, in itself, an inoffensive medium of reciprocal services,\nnotwithstanding the fact that no man could lawfully enslave another?\nSome give their manual labour, and the work of others consists in taking\ncare of the physical and intellectual welfare of the slaves, and in\nsuperintending their efforts.\n\nAnd, I fancy, some really did say this.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nIf the object of this sham pseudo-science of Political Economy had not\nbeen the same as that of all other legal sciences,--the justification of\ncoercion,--it could not have avoided noticing the strange phenomena that\nthe distribution of wealth, the deprivation of some men of land and\ncapital, and the enslavery of some men to others, depend upon money, and\nthat it is only by means of money that some men utilize the labour of\nothers,--in other words, enslave them.\n\nI repeat that a man who has money may buy up and monopolise all the corn\nand kill others by starvation, completely oppressing them, as it has\nfrequently happened before our own eyes on a very large scale.\n\nIt would seem then that we ought to examine the connection of these\noccurrences with money; but Political Science, with full assurance,\nasserts that money has no connection whatever with the matter.\n\nThis science says, "Money is as much an article of merchandise as\nanything else which contains the value of its production, only with this\ndifference,--that this article of merchandise is chosen as the more\nconvenient medium of exchange for establishing values, for saving, and\nfor making payments. One man has made boots, another has grown wheat,\nthe third has bred sheep; and now, in order to exchange more\nconveniently, they put money into circulation, which represents the\nequivalent of labour; and by this medium they exchange the soles of\nboots for a loin of mutton, or ten pounds of flour."\n\nStudents of this sham science are very fond of picturing to themselves\nsuch a state of affairs; but there has never been such a condition in\nthe world. This idea about society is like the fancy about the\nprimitive, prehistoric, perfect human state which the philosophers\ncherished; but such a state never existed.\n\nIn all human societies where money has been used there has also been the\noppression by the strong and the armed of the weak and the defenceless;\nand wherever there was oppression, there the standard of value, money,\nwhatever it consisted of, cattle or hides, skin or metals, must have\nunavoidably lost its significance as a medium of exchange, and received\nthe meaning of a ransom from violence.\n\nThere is no doubt that money does possess the inoffensive properties\nwhich science enumerates; but it would have these properties only in a\nsociety in which there was no violence,--in an ideal state. But in such\na society money would not be found as a general measure of value. In\nsuch a community, at the advent of violence, money would immediately\nlose its significance.\n\nIn all societies known to us where money is used it receives the\nsignificance of a medium of exchange only because it serves as a means\nof violence. And its chief object is to act thus,--not as a mere medium.\nWhere violence exists, money cannot be a true medium of exchange,\nbecause it is not a measure of value,--because, as soon as one man may\ntake away from another the products of his labour, all measures of value\nare directly violated. If horses and cows, bred by one man, and\nviolently taken away by others, were brought to a market, it is plain\nthat the value of other horses and cows there, when brought into\ncompetition with stolen animals, would no longer correspond with the\nlabour of breeding them. And the value of everything else would also\nchange with this change, and so money could not determine values.\n\nBesides, if one man may acquire by force a cow or a horse or a house, he\nmay by the same force acquire money itself, and with this money acquire\nall kinds of produce. If, then, money itself is acquired by violence,\nand spent to purchase products, money entirely loses its quality as a\nmedium of exchange.\n\nThe oppressor who takes money and gives it for the products of labour\ndoes not exchange anything, but obtains from labour all that he wants.\n\nBut let us suppose that such an imaginary and impossible state of\nsociety really existed, in which money is in circulation, without the\nexercise of general violence,--silver or gold serving as a measure of\nvalue and as a medium of exchange. All the savings in such a society are\nexpressed by money. There appears in this society an oppressor in the\nshape of a conqueror. Let us suppose that this oppressor claims the\ncows, horses, clothes, and the houses of the inhabitants; but, as it is\nnot convenient for him to take possession of all this, he naturally\nthinks of taking that which represents among these men all kinds of\nvalues and is exchanged for everything,--money. And at once in this\ncommunity, money receives, for the oppressor and his assistants, another\nsignification, and its character as a medium of exchange therefore\nimmediately ceases.\n\nThe measure of the values will always depend on the pleasure of the\noppressor. The articles most necessary to him, and for which he gives\nmore money, are considered greater value, and _vice versa_; so that, in\na community exposed to violence, money at once receives its chief\nmeaning,--it becomes a means of violence and a ransom from violence, and\nit retains, among the oppressed, its significance as a medium of\nexchange only so far as that is convenient to the oppressor.\n\nLet us picture the whole affair in a circle, thus:--The serfs supply\ntheir landlord with linen, poultry, sheep, and daily labour. The\nlandlord substitutes money for these goods, and fixes the value of the\nvarious articles sent in. Those who have no linen, corn, cattle, or\nmanual labour to offer, may bring a definite sum of money.\n\nIt is obvious, that, in the society of the peasants of this landlord,\nthe price of the various articles will always depend upon the landlord\'s\npleasure. The landlord uses the articles collected among his peasants,\nand some of these articles are more necessary for him than others: he\nfixes the prices for them accordingly, more or less. It is clear that\nthe mere will and requirements of the landlord must regulate the prices\nof these articles among the payers. If he is in want of corn, he will\nset a high price for a fixed quantity of it, and a low price for linen,\ncattle, or work; and therefore those who have no corn will sell their\nlabour, linen, and cattle to others, in order to buy corn to give it to\nthe landlord.\n\nIf the landlord chooses to substitute money for all his claims, then the\nvalue of things will again depend, not upon the value of labour, but\nfirst upon the sum of money which the landlord requires, and secondly\nupon the articles produced by the peasants, which are more necessary to\nthe landlord, and for which he allows a higher price.\n\nThe money-claim made by the landlord on the peasants ceases to influence\nthe prices of the articles only when the peasants of this landlord live\nseparately from other people and have no connection with any one; and\nsecondly, when the landlord employs money, not in purchasing things in\nhis own village, but elsewhere. Only under these two conditions would\nthe prices of things, though changed nominally, remain relatively the\nsame, and money would become a measure of value and a medium of\nexchange.\n\nBut if the peasants have any business connections with the inhabitants\nsurrounding them, the prices of their produce, as sold to their\nneighbours, would depend on the sum required from them by their\nlandlord. (If less money is required from their neighbours than from\nthemselves, then their products would be sold cheaper than the products\nof their neighbours, and _vice versa_.) Again, the landlord\'s\nmoney-demand would cease to influence the prices of the articles, only\nwhen the sums collected by the landlord were not spent in buying the\nproducts of his own peasants. But if he spends the money in purchasing\nfrom them, it is plain that the prices of various articles will\nconstantly vary among them according as the landlord buys more of one\nthing than another.\n\nSuppose one landlord has fixed a very high poll-tax, and his neighbour a\nvery low one: it is clear that on the estate of the first landlord every\nthing will be cheaper than on the estate of the second, and that the\nprices on either estate will depend only upon the increase and decrease\nof the poll-taxes. This is one effect of violence on value.\n\nAnother, rising out of the first, consists in relative values. Suppose\none landlord is fond of horses, and pays a high price for them; another\nis fond of towels, and offers a high figure for them. It is obvious that\non the estate of either of these two landlords, the horses and the\ntowels will be dear, and the prices of these articles will be out of\nproportion to those of cows or of corn. If to-morrow the collector of\ntowels dies, and his heirs are fond of poultry, then it is obvious that\nthe price of towels will fall and that of poultry will rise.\n\nWherever in society there is the mastery of one man over another, there\nthe meaning of money as the measure of value at once yields to the will\nof the oppressor, and its meaning as a medium of exchange of the\nproducts of labour is replaced by another,--that of the most convenient\nmeans of utilizing other people\'s labour.\n\nThe oppressor wants money neither as a medium of exchange,--for he takes\nwhatever he wants without exchange,--nor as a measure of value,--for he\nhimself determines the value of everything,--but only for the\nconvenience it affords of exercising violence; and this convenience\nconsists in the fact that money may be stored up, and is the most\nconvenient means of holding in slavery the majority of mankind.\n\nIt is not convenient to carry away all the cattle in order always to\nhave horses, cows, and sheep whenever wanted, because they must be fed;\nthe same holds good with corn, for it may be spoiled; the same with\nslaves; sometimes a man may require thousands of workmen, and sometimes\nnone. Money demanded from those who have not got it makes it possible to\nget rid of all these inconveniences and to have everything that is\nrequired; and this is why the oppressor wants money. Besides which, he\nwants money so that his right to utilize another man\'s labour may not be\nconfined to certain men but may be extended to all men who require the\nmoney.\n\nWhen there was no money in circulation each landlord could utilize the\nlabour of his own serfs only; but when they agreed to demand from the\npeasants money which they had not, they were enabled to appropriate\nwithout distinction the labour of all men on every estate.\n\nThus the oppressor finds it more convenient to press all his claims on\nlabour in the shape of money, and for this sole object is it desired. To\nthe victim from whom it is taken away money cannot be of use, either for\nthe purpose of exchange (seeing he exchanges without money, as all\nnations have exchanged who had no government); nor for a measure of\nvalue, because this is fixed without him; nor for the purpose of saving,\nbecause the man whose productions are taken away cannot save; neither\nfor payments, because an oppressed man always has more to pay than to\nreceive; and if he does receive anything, the payment is made, not in\nmoney, but in articles of merchandise in either case; whether the\nworkman takes his goods from his master\'s shop to remunerate his labour,\nor whether he buys the necessaries of life with his earnings in other\nshops, the money is required from him, and he is told by his oppressors\nthat if he does not pay it they will refuse to give him land or bread,\nor will take away his cow or his horse, or condemn him to work, or put\nhim in prison. He can only free himself from all this by selling the\nproducts of his toil, his own labour, or that of his children.\n\nHe will have to sell this according to the prices established, not by a\nregular exchange, but by the authority which demands money of him.\n\nUnder the conditions of the influence of tribute and taxes on\nprices,--which everywhere and always repeat themselves, as much with the\nland-owners in a narrow circle, as with the state on a larger scale (in\nwhich the causes of the modification of prices are as obvious to us, as\nthe motion of the hands and feet of puppets is obvious to those who look\nbehind the curtain and see who are the wire-pullers):--under these\ncircumstances, to say that money is a medium of exchange and a measure\nof value, is at least astonishing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nAll slavery is based solely on the fact that one man can deprive another\nof his life, and by threatening to do so can compel him to do his will.\nWe may see for certain that whenever one man is enslaved by another,\nwhen, against his own will and by the will of another, he does certain\nactions contrary to his inclination, the cause, if traced to its source,\nis nothing more nor less than a result of this threat. If a man gives to\nothers all his labour, has not enough to eat, has to send his little\nchildren from home to work hard, leaves the land, and devotes all his\nlife to a hated and unnecessary task, which happens before our own eyes\nin the world (which we term civilized because we ourselves live in it),\nthen we may certainly say that he does so only because not to do so\nwould be equivalent to loss of life.\n\nTherefore in our civilized world, where the majority of the people,\namidst terrible privations, perform hated labours unnecessary to\nthemselves, the greater number of men are in a slavery based on the\nthreat of being deprived of their existence. Of what, then, does this\nslavery consist? Wherein lies this power of threat?\n\nIn olden times the means of subjugation and the threat to kill were\nplain and obvious to all: the primitive means of enslaving men then\nconsisted in a direct threat to kill with the sword.\n\nAn armed man said to an unarmed, "I can kill thee, as thou hast seen I\nhave done to thy brother, but I do not want to do it: I will spare\nthee,--first, because it is not agreeable for me to kill thee; secondly,\nbecause, as well for me as for thee, it will be more convenient that\nthou shouldst labour for me than that I should kill thee. Therefore do\nall I order thee to do, but know that, if thou refusest, I will take thy\nlife."\n\nSo the unarmed man submitted to the armed one and did everything he was\nordered to do. The unarmed man laboured, the armed threatened. This was\nthat personal slavery which appeared first among all nations, and which\nstill exists among primitive races.\n\nThis means of enslaving always begins the work; but when life becomes\nmore complicated it undergoes a change. With the complication of life\nsuch a method presents great inconveniences to the oppressor. Before he\ncan appropriate the labour of the weaker he must feed and clothe them\nand keep them at work, and so their number remains small; and, besides,\nthis compels the slave-holder to remain continually with the slaves,\ndriving them to work by the threat of murdering them. And thus another\nmeans of subjugation is developed.\n\nFive thousand years ago (according to the Bible) this novel, convenient,\nand clever means of oppression was discovered by Joseph the Beautiful.\n\nIt is similar to that employed now in the menageries for taming restive\nhorses and wild beasts.\n\nIt is hunger!\n\nThis contrivance is thus described in the Bible (Genesis\xc2\xa0xli., 48-57):--\n\n    And he (Joseph) gathered up all the food of the seven years, which\n    were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the\n    food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in\n    the same.\n\n    And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he\n    left numbering; for it was without number.\n\n    And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt,\n    were ended.\n\n    And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had\n    said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt,\n    there was bread.\n\n    And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to\n    Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto\n    Joseph; what he said to you, do.\n\n    And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened\n    all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine\n    waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\n\n    And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; even\n    because that the famine was so sore in all lands.\n\nJoseph, making use of the primitive means of enslaving men by the threat\nof the sword, gathered corn during the years of plenty in expectation of\nyears of famine which generally follow years of plenty,--men know all\nthis without the dreams of Pharaoh,--and then by the pangs of hunger he\nmade all the Egyptians and the inhabitants of the surrounding countries\nslaves to Pharaoh more securely and conveniently. And when the people\nbegan to be famished, he arranged matters so as to keep them in his\npower _forever_.\n\n    (Genesis\xc2\xa0xlvii., 13-26.) And there was no bread in all the land; for\n    the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land\n    of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.\n\n    And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of\n    Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:\n    and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh\'s house.\n\n    And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of\n    Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:\n    for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. And\n    Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle,\n    if money fail. And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph\n    gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for\n    the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with\n    bread for all their cattle for that year.\n\n    When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and\n    said unto him, We will not hide it from my Lord, how that our money\n    is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought\n    left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:\n    Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy\n    us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto\n    Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that\n    the land be not desolate. And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt\n    for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the\n    famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh\'s. And as for\n    the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of\n    Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n\n    Only the lands of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a\n    portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which\n    Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.\n\n    Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day\n    and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall\n    sow the land. And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye\n    shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your\n    own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your\n    households, and for food for your little ones.\n\n    And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the\n    sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh\'s servants.\n\n    And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that\n    Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests\n    only, which became not Pharaoh\'s.\n\nFormerly, in order to appropriate labour, Pharaoh had to use violence\ntowards them; but now, when the stores and the land belonged to Pharaoh,\nhe had only to keep these stores by force, and hunger compelled the men\nto labour for him.\n\nAll the land now belonged to Pharaoh, and he had all the stores (which\nwere taken away from the people); and therefore, instead of driving them\nto work individually by the sword, he had only to keep food from them\nand they were enslaved, not by the sword, but by hunger.\n\nIn a year of scarcity, all men may be starved to death at Pharaoh\'s\nwill; and in a year of plenty, all may be killed who, from casual\nmisfortunes, have no stores of corn.\n\nThus comes into operation the second means of enslaving, not directly\nwith the sword,--that is, by the strong man driving the weak one to\nlabour under threat of killing him,--but by the strong one having taken\naway from the weak the stores of corn which, keeping by the sword, he\ncompels the weak to work for.\n\nJoseph said to the hungry men, "I could starve you to death, because I\nhave the corn; but I will spare your lives, but only under the condition\nthat you do all I order you for the food which I will give you." For the\nfirst means of enslaving, the oppressor only needs soldiers to ride to\nand fro among the inhabitants, and make them fulfil the requirements of\ntheir master under threat of death. And thus the oppressor has only to\npay his soldiers. But with the second means, besides the soldiers, the\noppressor must have different assistants for keeping and protecting the\nland and stores from the starving people.\n\nThese are the Josephs and their stewards and distributors. And the\noppressor has to reward them, and to give Joseph a dress of brocade, a\ngold ring, and servants, and corn and silver to his brothers and\nrelatives. Besides this, from the very nature of the second means, not\nonly the stewards and their relations, but all who have stores of corn\nbecome participators in this violence, just as by the first means, based\nupon immediate force, every one who has arms becomes a partner in\ntyranny, so by this means, based upon hunger, every one who has stores\nof provision shares in it, and has power over those who have no stores.\n\nThe advantage of this method over the former consists, first and\nchiefly, in the fact that the oppressor need no longer compel the\nworkmen to do his will by force, for they themselves come to him and\nsell themselves to him; secondly, in the circumstance that fewer men\nescape from his violence. The drawback is, that he has to employ a\ngreater number of men. For the oppressed the advantage of it consists in\nthe fact that they are no longer exposed to rough violence but are left\nto themselves; and can always hope to pass from being the oppressed to\nbecoming oppressors in their turn, which by fortunate circumstances they\nsometimes really do. The drawback for them is, that they can never\nescape from participating in the oppression of others.\n\nThis new means of enslaving generally comes into operation together with\nthe old one; and the oppressor lessens the one and increases the other\naccording to his desires. But this does not fully satisfy the man who\nwishes to take away as much as possible of the products of the labour of\nas many working-people as he can find, and to enslave as many men as\npossible; and, therefore, a third means of oppression is evolved.\n\nThis is the slavery of taxation, and, like the second, it is based upon\nhunger; but to the means of subduing men by depriving them of bread is\nadded the deprivation of other necessaries.\n\nThe oppressor requires from the slaves so much of the money he himself\nhas coined, that, in order to obtain it, the slaves are compelled to\nsell not only stores of corn in greater quantity than the fifth part\nwhich was fixed by Joseph, but the first necessaries of life as\nwell,--meat, skins, wool, clothes, firewood, even their buildings; and\ntherefore the oppressor always keeps his slaves in his power, not only\nby hunger, but by thirst, cold and other privations.\n\nAnd thus the third means of slavery comes into operation, a monetary,\ntributary one, consisting in the oppressor saying to the oppressed, "I\ncan do with each of you just what I like; I can kill and destroy you by\ntaking away the land by which you earn your living; I can, with this\nmoney which you must give me, buy all the corn upon which you feed, and\nsell it to strangers, and at any time annihilate you by starvation; I\ncan take from you all that you have,--your cattle, your houses, your\nclothes; but it is neither convenient nor agreeable for me to do so, and\ntherefore I let you alone, to work as you please; only give me so much\nof the money which I demand of you, either as a poll-tax, or according\nto your land or the quantity of your food and drink, or your clothes or\nyour houses. Give me this money, and do what you like among yourselves,\nbut know that I shall neither protect nor maintain widows nor orphans\nnor invalids nor old people, nor such as have been burned out: I shall\nonly protect the regular circulation of this money. This right will\nalways be mine, to protect only those who regularly give me the fixed\nnumber of these pieces of money: as to how or where you get it, I shall\nnot in the least trouble myself." And so the oppressor distributes these\npieces of money as an acknowledgement that his demand has been complied\nwith.\n\nThe second method of enslaving consisted in this, that, having taken\naway the fifth part of the harvest, and collected stores of corn,\nPharaoh, besides the personal slavery by the sword, received, by his\nassistants, the possibility of dominion over the working-people during\nthe time of famine, and over some of them during misfortunes which\nhappen to them.\n\nThe third method consists in this: Pharaoh requires from the\nworking-people more money than the value of the fifth part of corn which\nhe took from them; he and his assistants get a new means of dominion\nover the working-class, not merely during the famine and their casual\nmisfortunes, but permanently.\n\nBy the second method, men retain some stores of corn which help them to\nbear indifferent harvests and casual misfortunes without going into\nslavery; but by the third, when there are more demands, the stores, not\nof corn only but of all other necessaries of life are taken away from\nthem, and at the first misfortune a workman, having neither stores of\ncorn nor any other stores which he might exchange for corn, falls into\nslavery to those who have money.\n\nTo set the first in motion an oppressor need have only soldiers, and\nshare the booty with them; for the second, besides the protectors of the\nland and the stores, he must have collectors and clerks for the\ndistribution of the corn; for the third, besides the soldiers for\nkeeping the land and his property, he must have collectors of taxes,\nassessors of direct taxation, supervisors, custom-house clerks, managers\nof money, and coiners of it.\n\nThe organization of the third method is much more complicated than that\nof the second. By the second, the getting in of corn may be leased out,\nas was done in olden times and is still the custom in Turkey; but by\nputting taxes on men there is need of a complicated administration,\nwhich has to ensure the right levying of the taxes. And therefore by the\nthird method the oppressor has to share the plunder with a still greater\nnumber of men than by the second; besides, according to the very nature\nof the thing, all the men of the same or of the foreign country who\npossess money become sharers with the oppressed.\n\nThe advantage of the third method over the first and second consists\nchiefly in the following fact: that by it there is no need to wait for a\nyear of scarcity, as in the time of Joseph, but years of famine are\nestablished forever, and (whilst by the second method the part of the\nlabour which is taken away depends upon the harvest, and cannot be\naugmented _ad libitum_, because if there is no corn, there is nothing to\ntake) by the new _monetary_ method the requirement can be brought to any\ndesired limit, for the demand for money can always be satisfied, because\nthe debtor, to satisfy it, must sell his cattle, clothes, or houses. The\nchief advantage to the oppressor of this method is that he can take away\nthe greatest quantity of labour in the most convenient way; for a\nmoney-tax, like a screw, may easily and conveniently be turned to the\nutmost limit, and golden eggs be obtained though the bird that lays them\nis all but dead.\n\nAnother of its advantages for the oppressor is that its violence reaches\nall those also who, by possessing no land, formerly escaped from it by\ngiving only a part of their labour for corn; whereas now, besides that\npart which they give for corn, they must now give another part for\ntaxes. A drawback for the oppressor is that he has to share the plunder\nwith a still greater number of men, not only with his direct assistants,\nbut also with all those men of his own country, and even of foreign\ncountries, who may have the money which is demanded from the slaves.\n\nIts advantage for the oppressed is only that he is allowed greater\nindependence than under the second method; he may live where he chooses,\ndo what he likes; he may sow or not sow; he has to give no account of\nhis labour; and if he has money, he may consider himself entirely free,\nand constantly hope, though only for a time, to obtain not only an\nindependent position, but even to become an oppressor himself, when he\nhas money to spare.\n\nThe drawback for the oppressed is, that on a general average their\nsituation becomes much worse, and they are deprived of the greater part\nof the products of their labour, because the number of those who utilize\ntheir labour has increased, and therefore the burden of keeping them\nfalls upon a smaller number of men.\n\nThis third method of enslaving men is also very old, and comes into\noperation with the former two without entirely excluding them.\n\nThese three methods of enslaving men have always been in operation.\n\nThey may all be compared to screws which secure the board laid on the\nwork-people which presses them down. The fundamental, or middle screw,\nwithout which the other screws could not hold, which is first screwed\nup, and which is never slackened, is the screw of personal slavery, the\nenslaving of some men by others under threat of slaughter; the second,\nwhich is screwed up after the first, is that of enslaving men by taking\naway the land and stores of provisions from them, such alienation being\nmaintained by the threat to murder; and the third screw is slavery\nenforced by the requirement of certain money taxes; and this demand is\nalso maintained under threat of murder.\n\nThese three screws are made fast, and it is only when one of them is\ntightened more that the others are slackened. For the complete\nenslavement of the workman, all three are necessary; and in our society,\nall three are in operation together. The first method of personal\nslavery under threat of murder by the sword has never been abolished,\nand never will be so long as there is any oppression, because every kind\nof oppression is based on this alone.\n\nWe are all quite sure that personal slavery is abolished in our\ncivilized world; that the last remnant of it has been annihilated in\nAmerica and in Russia, and that it is only among the barbarians that\nreal slavery exists, and that with us it is no longer in being. We\nforget only one small circumstance,--those hundreds of millions of\nstanding troops without which no state exists, and with the abolition of\nwhich all the economical organization of each state would inevitably\nfall to pieces. Yet what are these millions of soldiers but the personal\nslaves of those who rule them? Are not these men compelled to do the\nwill of their commanders under the threat of torture and death,--a\nthreat often carried out? the difference consisting only in the fact\nthat the submission of these slaves is not called slavery, but\ndiscipline, and that slaves are slaves from their birth, but soldiers\nonly during a more or less short period of their so-called "service."\n\nPersonal slavery, therefore, is not only not abolished in our civilized\nworld, but, under the system of conscription, it has of late years been\nconfirmed; and it has remained as it has always existed, only slightly\nchanged from its original form. And it cannot but exist, because, so\nlong as there is the enslaving of one man by another there will be this\npersonal slavery too, this slavery which, under the threat of the sword,\nmaintains serfdom, land-ownership, and taxes.\n\nIt may be that this slavery of troops is useful, as it is said, for the\ndefence and the glory of the country; but this kind of utility is more\nthan doubtful, because we see how often in the case of unsuccessful wars\nit serves only for the subjugation and shame of the country. But of the\nexpediency of this slavery for maintaining that of the land and taxes\nthere is no question.\n\nIf Irish or Russian peasants were to take possession of the land of the\nproprietors, troops would be sent to dispossess them. If you build a\ndistillery or a brewery and do not pay excise, then soldiers will be\nsent to shut it up. Refuse to pay taxes, and the same thing will happen\nto you.\n\nThe second screw is the method of enslaving men by taking away from them\ntheir land and their stores of provisions. This method has also always\nbeen in existence wherever men are oppressed; and, whatever changes it\nmay undergo, it is everywhere in operation.\n\nSometimes all the land belongs to the sovereign, as in Turkey, and there\none-tenth is given to the state treasury. Sometimes a part of the land\nbelongs to the sovereign, and taxes are raised on it. Sometimes all the\nland belongs to a few people and is let out for labour, as in England.\nSometimes more or less large portions of land belong to the land-owners,\nas in Russia, Germany, and France. But wherever there is enslaving there\nexists also the appropriation of the land by the oppressor, and this\nscrew is slackened or tightened only according to the condition of the\nother screws.\n\nThus, in Russia, when personal slavery was extended to the majority of\nthe working-people there was no need of land-slavery; but the screw of\npersonal slavery was slackened in Russia only when the screws of land\nand tax slavery were tightened. Only when the government had\nappropriated the land and divided it among private individuals, and had\ninstituted money payments and taxation, did it give the peasants\npersonal freedom.\n\nIn England, for instance, land-slavery is pre-eminently in operation,\nand the question about the nationalizing of the land consists only in\nthe screw of taxation being tightened in order that the screw of land\nappropriation may be slackened.\n\nThe third method of enslaving men, by taxes, has also been in operation\nfor ages; and in our days, with the extension of uniform standards of\nmoney and the strengthening of state powers it has become an especially\npowerful influence.\n\nThis method is so developed in our days that it tends to be a substitute\nfor the second method of enslaving,--the land monopoly.\n\nIt is obvious from the state of the political economy of all Europe,\nthat it is by the tightening of this screw that the screw of land\nslavery is slackened.\n\nIn our own lifetime we have witnessed in Russia two transformations of\nslavery. When the serfs were liberated, and their landlords retained the\nright to the greater part of the soil, the landlords were afraid they\nwould lose their power; but experience has shown that having let go the\nwhole chain of personal slavery, they had only to seize another,--that\nof the land. A peasant was short of corn; he had not enough to live on.\nThe landlord had land and stores of corn: and therefore the peasant\nstill remained the same slave.\n\nAnother transformation was caused by the government screw of taxation\nbeing pressed home. The majority of working-people, having no stores,\nwere obliged to sell themselves to their landlords and to the factories.\nThis new form of oppression held the people still tighter, so that\nnine-tenths of the Russian working-people are still working for their\nlandlords and in the factories to pay these taxes. This is so obvious,\nthat, if the government were to remit taxation for one year only, all\nlabour would be stopped in the fields of the landlords, and in the\nfactories. Nine-tenths of the Russian people hire themselves out during\nand before the collection of taxes.\n\nAll these three methods have never ceased to operate, and are still in\noperation, but people are inclined to ignore them or to invent new\nexcuses for them. And, what is most remarkable of all is, that the very\nmeans on which everything is based, that screw which is screwed up\ntighter than all others, which holds everything at the moment in\nquestion, is not noticed so long as it holds. When in the ancient world\nthe entire economical order was upheld by personal slavery, the greatest\nintellects did not notice it. To Plato, as well as to Xenophon, and\nAristotle, and to the Romans, it seemed that it could not be otherwise,\nand that slavery was an unavoidable and natural result of wars, without\nwhich the existence of mankind was inconceivable. Similarly, in the\nMiddle Ages, and till recently, people did not apprehend the meaning of\nland-ownership, on which depended the entire economical organization of\ntheir time.\n\nSo also, at present, no one sees or wants to see, that in our time the\nslavery of the majority of the people depends on taxes collected by the\ngovernment from its own land slaves, taxes collected _by administration\nand the troops_,--by the very same troops which are maintained by these\ntaxes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nNo wonder that the slaves themselves, who have always been enslaved, do\nnot understand their own position, and that this condition in which they\nhave always lived is considered by them to be natural to human life, and\nthat they hail as a relief any change in their form of slavery; no\nwonder that their owners sometimes quite sincerely think they are, in a\nmeasure, freeing the slaves by slacking one screw, though they are\ncompelled to do so by the over-tension of another.\n\nBoth become accustomed to their state; and the slaves, never having\nknown what freedom is, merely seek an alleviation, or only the change of\ntheir condition; the other, the owners, wishing to mask their injustice,\ntry to assign a particular meaning to those new forms of slavery which\nthey enforce in place of the older ones. But it is wonderful how the\nmajority of the critics of the economic conditions of the life of the\npeople fail to see that which forms the basis of the entire economic\nconditions of a people.\n\nOne would think the duty of a true science would be to try to ascertain\nthe connection of the phenomena and general cause of a series of\noccurrences. But the majority of the representatives of modern Political\nEconomy are doing just the reverse of this: they carefully hide the\nconnection and meaning of the phenomena, and avoid answering the most\nsimple and essential questions.\n\nModern Political Economy, like an idle, lazy cart-horse, goes well only\ndown-hill, when it has no collar-work; but as soon as it has anything to\ndraw, it at once refuses, pretending it has to go somewhere aside after\nits own business. When any grave, essential question is put to Political\nEconomy, scientific discussions are started about some other matter\nhaving only in view to divert attention from this subject.\n\nYou ask, "How are we to account for a fact so unnatural, monstrous,\nunreasonable, and not useless only, but harmful, that some men can eat\nor work only according to the will of other men?"\n\nYou are gravely answered, "Because some men must arrange the labour and\nfeeding of others, such is the law of production."\n\nYou ask, "What is this property-right which allows some men to\nappropriate to themselves the land, food, and instruments of labour\nbelonging to others?" You are again gravely answered, "This right is\nbased upon the protection of labour,"--that is, the protection of some\nmen\'s labour is effected by taking possession of the labour of other\nmen.\n\nYou ask, "What is that money which is everywhere coined and stamped by\nthe governments, by the authorities, and which is so exorbitantly\ndemanded from the working-people, and which in the shape of national\ndebts is levied upon the future generations of workingmen? Further, has\nnot this money, demanded from the people in the shape of taxes which are\nraised to the utmost pitch, has not this money any influence on the\neconomic relationships of men,--between the payers and the receivers?"\nAnd you are answered in all seriousness, "Money is an article of\nmerchandise like sugar, or chintz; and it differs from other articles\nonly in the fact that it is more convenient for exchange."\n\nAs for the influence of taxes on the economic conditions of a people, it\nis a different question altogether: the laws of production, exchange,\nand distribution of wealth, are one thing, but taxation is quite\nanother. You ask whether it has any influence on the economic conditions\nof a people that the government can arbitrarily raise or lower prices,\nand, having increased the taxes, can make slaves of all who have no\nland? The pompous answer is, "The laws of production, exchange, and\ndistribution of wealth constitute one science,--Political Economy; and\ntaxes, and, generally speaking, State Economy, come under another\nhead,--the Law of Finance."\n\nYou ask finally, "Is no influence exercised on economic conditions by\nthe circumstance that all the people are in bondage to the government,\nand that this government can arbitrarily ruin them all, can take away\nall the products of their labour, and even carry the men themselves away\nfrom their work into military slavery?" You are answered, "This is\naltogether a different question, belonging to the State Law."\n\nThe majority of the representatives of science discuss quite seriously\nthe laws of the economic life of a people, while all the functions and\nactivities of this life are dependent on the will of the oppressor.\nWhilst they recognize the influence of the oppressor as a natural\ncondition of a nation\'s life, they do just what a critic of the economic\nconditions of the life of the personal slaves of different masters would\ndo, were he to omit to consider the influence exercised on the life of\nthese slaves by the will of that master who compels them to work on this\nor that thing and drives them from one place to another according to his\npleasure, who feeds them or neglects to do so, who kills them or leaves\nthem alive.\n\nA noxious superstition has been long in existence and still survives,--a\nsuperstition which has done more harm to men than the most terrible\nreligious superstitions.\n\nAnd so-called science supports this superstition with all its power, and\nwith the utmost zeal. This superstition exactly resembles religious\nsuperstitions. It consists in affirming that, besides the duties of man\nto man, there are still more important duties towards an imaginary\nbeing,--which the theologians call God, and the political scientists the\nState.\n\nThe religious superstition consists in affirming that sacrifices, even\nof human lives, must be offered to this imaginary being, and that they\ncan and ought to be enforced by every means, even by violence. The\npolitical superstition consists in the belief that, besides the duties\nof man to man, there are still more important duties to an imaginary\nbeing, the State; and the offerings,--often of human lives,--brought to\nthis imaginary being are also essential, and can and ought to be\nenforced by every means, even by violence.\n\nThis superstition it is, formerly encouraged by the priests of different\nreligions, which is now sustained by so-called science.\n\nMen are thrown into slavery, into the most terrible slavery, worse than\nhas ever before existed; but Political Science tries to persuade men\nthat it is necessary and unavoidable.\n\nThe state must exist for the welfare of the people, and it must do its\nduty, to rule and protect them from their enemies. For this purpose the\nstate needs money and troops. Money must be subscribed by all the\ncitizens of the state. And hence all the relations of men must be\nconsidered in the light of the existence of the state.\n\n"I want to help my father by my labour," says a common unlearned man. "I\nwant also to marry; but instead, I am taken and sent to Kazan, to be a\nsoldier for six years. I leave the military service, I want to plough\nthe ground to earn food and drink for my family; but I am not allowed to\nplough for a hundred versts around me unless I pay money, which I have\nnot got, and pay it to those men who do not know how to plough, and who\ndemand for the land so much money that I must give them all my labour to\nprocure it: however, I still manage to save something, and wish to give\nthis to my children; but a police official comes and takes from me all I\nhad saved, for taxes: I can earn a little more, and again I am deprived\nof it. My entire economic activity is at the mercy of state demands; and\nit seems to me that my position and that of my brethren, will certainly\nimprove if we are liberated from the demands of the state."\n\nBut he is told, "Such reasoning is the result of your ignorance. Study\nthe laws of production, exchange, and distribution of wealth, and do not\nmix up economical questions with those of the state. The phenomena which\nyou point to are no restraints on your freedom; they are the necessary\nsacrifices which you, along with others, must make for your own freedom\nand welfare."\n\n"But my son has been taken away from me," says again a common man; "and\nthey threaten to take away all my sons as soon as they are grown up:\nthey took him away by force, and drove him to face the enemy\'s guns in\nsome country which we have never heard of, and for an object which we\ncannot understand.\n\n"And as for the land which they will not allow us to plough, and for\nwant of which we are starving, it belongs to a man who got possession of\nit by force, and whom we have never seen, and whose usefulness we cannot\neven understand. And the taxes, to collect which the police official has\nby force taken my cow from my children, will, so far as I know, go to\nthis same man who took my cow away, and to various members of the\ncommittees and of departments which I do not know of, and in the utility\nof which I do not believe. How is it, then, that all these acts of\nviolence secure my liberty, and all this evil procures good?"\n\nYou may compel a man to be a slave and to do that which he considers to\nbe evil for himself, but you cannot compel him to think, that, in\nsuffering violence, he is free, and that the obvious evil which he\nendures constitutes his good. This appears impossible. Yet by the help\nof science this very thing has been done in our time.\n\nThe state, that is, the armed oppressors, decide what they want from\nthose whom they oppress (as in the case of England and the\nFiji-Islanders): they decide how much labour they want from their\nslaves,--they decide how many assistants they will need in collecting\nthe fruits of this labour; they organize their assistants in the shape\nof soldiers, land-owners, and collectors of taxes. And the slaves give\ntheir labour, and, at the same time, believe that they give it, not\nbecause their masters demand it, but for the sake of their own freedom\nand welfare; and that this service and these bloody sacrifices to the\ndivinity called the State are necessary, and that, except this service\nto their Deity, they are free. They believe this because the same had\nbeen formerly said in the name of religion by the priests, and is now\nsaid in the name of so-called science, by learned men.\n\nBut one need only cease to believe what is said by these other men who\ncall themselves priests or learned men, for the absurdity of such an\nassertion to become obvious.\n\nThe men who oppress others assure them that this oppression is necessary\nfor the state,--and the state is necessary for the freedom and welfare\nof men; so that it appears that the oppressors oppress men for the sake\nof their freedom, and do them evil for the sake of good.\n\nBut men are furnished with reason so that they may understand wherein\nconsists their own good, and do it willingly.\n\nAs for the acts, the goodness of which is not intelligible to men, and\nto which they are compelled by force, these cannot be for their good,\nbecause a reasoning being can consider as good only the thing which\nappears so to his reason. If men are driven to evil through passion or\nfolly, all that those who are not so driven can do is to persuade the\nothers into what constitutes their real good. You may try to persuade\nmen that their welfare will be greater when they are all soldiers, are\ndeprived of land, and have given their entire labour away for taxes; but\nuntil all men consider this condition to be welfare, and undertake it\nwillingly, one cannot call such a state of things the common welfare of\nmen.\n\nThe sole criterion of a good conception is its willing acceptance by\nmen. And the lives of men abound with such acts. Ten workmen buy tools\nin common, in order to work together with them, and in so doing they are\nundoubtedly benefitting themselves; but we cannot suppose that if these\nten workmen were to compel an eleventh, by force, to join in their\nassociation, they would insist that their common welfare will be the\nsame for him.\n\nSo with gentlemen who agree to give a subscription dinner at a pound a\nhead to a mutual friend; no one can assert that such a dinner will\nbenefit a man who, against his will, has been obliged to pay a sovereign\nfor it. And so with peasants who decide, for their common convenience,\nto dig a pond. To those who consider the existence of a pond more\nvaluable than the labour spent on it, digging it will be a common good.\nBut to the one who considers the pond of less value than a day\'s\nharvesting in which he is behind-hand, digging it will appear evil. The\nsame holds good with roads, churches, and museums, and with all various\nsocial and state affairs.\n\nAll such work may be good for those who consider it good, and who\ntherefore freely and willingly perform it,--the dinner which the\ngentlemen give, the pond which the peasants dig. But work to which men\nmust be driven by force ceases to be a common good precisely by the fact\nof such violence.\n\nAll this is so plain and simple, that, if men had not been so long\ndeceived, there would be no need to explain it.\n\nSuppose we live in a village where all the inhabitants have agreed to\nbuild a road over a swamp which is a danger to them. We agree together,\nand each house promises to give so much money or wood or days of labour.\nWe agree to this because the making of the road is more advantageous to\nus than what we exchange for it; but among us there are some for whom it\nis more advantageous to do without a road than to spend money on it, or\nwho at all events think so. Can compelling these men to labour make it\nof advantage to them? Obviously not; because those who considered that\ntheir choosing to join in making the way would have been\ndisadvantageous, will consider it _a fortiori_ still more\ndisadvantageous when they are _compelled_ to do so. Suppose, even, that\nwe all, without exception, were agreed, and promised so much money or\nlabour from each house, but that it happened that some of those who had\npromised did not give what they agreed, their circumstances having\nmeanwhile changed, so that it was more advantageous for such now to be\nwithout the road than to spend money on it; or that they have simply\nchanged their mind about it; or even calculate that others will make the\nroad without them and that they will then use it. Can coercing these men\nto join in the labour make them consider that the sacrifices are\nenforced for their own good?\n\nObviously not; because, if these men have not fulfilled what they\npromised, owing to a change in circumstances, so that now the sacrifices\nfor the sake of the road outbalance their gain by it, the compulsory\nsacrifices of such would be only a worse evil. But if those who refuse\nto join in building the road intend to utilize the labour of the others,\nthen in this case also coercing them into making a sacrifice would be\nonly a punishment on a supposition, and their object, which nobody can\nprove, will be punished before it is made apparent; but in neither case\ncan coercing them to join in a work which they do not desire be good for\nthem.\n\nIf this is so with sacrifices for a work which every one can comprehend,\nobvious, and undoubtedly useful to everyone, such as a road over a\nswamp; how still more unjust and unreasonable is it to coerce millions\nof men into making sacrifices for objects which are incomprehensible,\nimperceptible, and often undoubtedly harmful, such as military service\nand taxation.\n\nBut, according to science, what appears to every one to be an evil is a\ncommon good: it appears that there are men, a small minority, who alone\nknow of what the common good consists, and, notwithstanding the fact\nthat all other men consider this good to be an evil, this minority can\ncompel the others to do whatever they may consider to be for the common\ngood. And it is this belief which constitutes the chief superstition and\nthe chief deceit and hinders the progress of mankind towards the True\nand the Good.\n\nTo nurse this superstitious deceit has been the object of political\nsciences in general, and of so-called "Political Economy" in particular.\n\nMany are making use of its aims in order to hide from men the state of\noppression and slavery in which they now are.\n\nThe way they set about doing so is by starting the theory that the\nviolence connected with the economy of social slavery is a natural and\nunavoidable evil; and men thereby are deceived and turn their eyes from\nthe real causes of their misfortunes.\n\nSlavery has long been abolished. It has been abolished in Rome as well\nas in America, and in Russia; but only the word has been abolished,--not\nthe evil.\n\nSlavery is the violent freeing of some men from the labour necessary for\nsatisfying their wants, which transfers this labour to others; and\nwherever there is a man who does not work, not because others willingly\nand lovingly work for him, but because he has the possibility, while not\nworking himself, to make others work for him, there slavery exists.\n\nWherever there are, as in all European societies, men who utilize the\nlabour of thousands of others by coercion, and consider such to be their\nright, and others who submit to this coercion considering it to be their\nduty,--there you have slavery in its most dreadful proportions.\n\nSlavery exists. In what, then, does it consist? Slavery consists of that\nof which it has always consisted, and without which it cannot exist at\nall,--in the coercion of a weak and unarmed man by a strong and armed\nman.\n\nSlavery in its three fundamental modes of operation,--personal violence,\nthe military, land-taxes,--maintained by the military, and direct and\nindirect taxes put upon all the inhabitants, is still in operation now\nas it has been before.\n\nWe do not see it because each of these three forms of slavery has\nreceived a new justification, which hides its meaning from us.\n\nThe personal violence of armed over unarmed men has been justified as\nthe defence of one\'s country from imaginary enemies,--while in its\nessence it has the one old meaning, the submission of the conquered to\nthe oppressors.\n\nThe violent seizure of the labourers\' land has been justified as the\nrecompense for services rendered to an imaginary common welfare, and\nconfirmed by the right of heritage; but in reality it is the same\ndispossession of men from their land and enslaving them which was\nperformed by the troops.\n\nAnd the last, the monetary violence by means of taxes, the strongest and\nmost effective in our days, has received a most wonderful justification.\n\nDispossessing men of their liberty and their goods is said to be done\nfor the sake of the common liberty and of the common welfare. But in\nfact it is the same slavery, only an impersonal one.\n\nWherever violence becomes law, there is slavery.\n\nWhether violence finds its expression in the circumstance that princes\nwith their courtiers come, kill, and burn down villages; whether\nslave-owners take labour or money for the land from their slaves, and\nenforce payment by means of armed men, or by putting taxes on others,\nand riding armed to and fro in the villages; or whether a Home\nDepartment collects money through governors or police sergeants,--in one\nword, as long as violence is maintained by the bayonet,--there will be\nno distribution of wealth, but it will be accumulated among the\noppressors.\n\nAs a striking illustration of the truth of this assertion the project of\nHenry George to nationalize the land may serve us. Henry George proposes\nto declare all land the property of the state, and to substitute a\nland-rent for all taxes, direct and indirect. That is, everyone who\nutilizes the land would have to pay to the state the value of its rent.\n\nWhat would be the result? The land would belong to the state,--English\nland to England, American land to America, and so on; that is, there\nwould be slavery, determined by the quantity of cultivated land. It\nmight be that the condition of some labourers would improve; but while a\nforcible demand for rent remained, the slavery would remain too. The\ncultivator, after a bad harvest, being unable to pay the rent exacted of\nhim by force, would be obliged to enslave himself to any one who\nhappened to have the money in order not to lose everything and to retain\nthe land.\n\nIf a pail leaks, there must be a hole. Looking at the pail, we might\nimagine the water runs from many holes; but no matter how we might try\nto stop the imaginary holes from without, the water would not cease\nrunning. In order to put a stop to the leakage we must find the place\nfrom which water runs, and stop it from the inside.\n\nThe same holds good with the proposed means of stopping the irregular\ndistribution of wealth,--the holes through which the wealth runs away\nfrom the people.\n\nIt is said, _Organize workmen\'s corporations, make capital social\nproperty, make land social property_. All this is only mere stopping\nfrom the outside those holes from which we fancy the water runs. In\norder to stop the wealth going from the hands of the workers to those of\nthe non-workers, it is necessary to try to find from the inside the hole\nthrough which this leakage takes place. And this hole is the violence of\narmed men towards unarmed men, the violence of troops, by means of which\nmen are carried away from their labour, and the land, and the products\nof labour, taken from them.\n\nSo long as there is one armed man, whoever he may be, with the\nacknowledged right to kill another man, so long will there also exist an\nunjust distribution of wealth,--in other words, slavery.\n\nI was led into the error that I can help others by the fact that I\nimagined my money was as good as Semion\'s. But it was not so.\n\nThe general opinion is that money represents wealth; that wealth is the\nresult of work and therefore that money represents work. This opinion is\nas just as the opinion asserting that every form of state is the result\nof a contract (contrat social).\n\nAll men like to believe that money is only a means of exchange of\nlabour. I have made boots, you have made bread, he has fed sheep; now,\nin order to exchange our wares the more conveniently, we introduce\nmoney, which represents the corresponding share of labour, and through\nit we exchange leather soles for a mutton brisket and ten pounds of\nflour.\n\nBy means of money we exchange our products and this money, belonging to\neach of us, represents our labour. This is perfectly true, but true only\nwhile in the community, where this exchange takes place, violence of one\nman towards another did not appear, violence not only over another man\'s\nlabour, as happens in war and in slavery, but not even violence applied\nto defend the products of labour of one man against another. This could\nbe only in a community whose members entirely fulfil the Christian\nlaw,--in a community where one gets what he demands and where one is not\nrequested to return what he gets. But as soon as violence in any form is\napplied in the community, the meaning of money for its owner at once\nloses its significance as a representative of labour, and acquires the\nsignificance of a right, based not on labour, but on violence.\n\nAs soon as there is war and one man has taken away something from\nanother, then money cannot always represent labour; the money received\nby the soldier for the booty he has sold, as well as the money got by\nhis superior, is by no means the produce of their work and has quite a\ndifferent meaning from the money received for the labour resulting in\nboots. When there are slave-owners and slaves, as have been always in\nthe world, then one cannot assert that money represents labour. The\nwomen have woven a quantity of linen, have sold it and received money;\nthe serfs have woven some linen for their master, and the master has\nsold it and received money. The one and the other money are the same;\nbut one is the product of labour and the other is the product of\nviolence. Likewise, if somebody,--say my father,--made me a present of\nmoney and he, when giving it to me, knew, and I knew and everybody knew,\nthat no one can take this money away from me, that if anybody tried to\ntake it, or even merely failed to return it at the date promised, then\nthe authorities would defend me and by force compel the man to return me\nthis money,--then again it is evident that by no means can this money be\ncalled a representative of labour, like the money which Semion got for\ncutting wood.\n\nThus in a community, where by some kind of violence somebody\'s money is\ntaken possession of, or the ownership of somebody\'s money defended\nagainst others--there money cannot always represent labour. It\nrepresents in such a community sometimes labour, sometimes violence.\n\nSo it would be if only one fact of violence of one man over another\nappeared in the midst of perfectly free relations; but now, when the\naccumulated money has passed through centuries of most various forms of\nviolence, when these acts of violence continue under other forms; when\nmoney itself by its accumulation creates violence,--which is recognized\nby everybody,--when the direct products of labour constitute only a\nsmall part of money made up of all sorts of violence,--to assert now\nthat money represents the work of its owner is an obvious error, or an\nopen lie. One may say it ought to be so, one may say it is desirable\nthat it should be so, but by no means can any one say that it is so.\n\nMoney represents labour. Yes; money represents labour, but whose labour?\nIn our society it is only in the rarest cases that money represents the\nwork of its owner. Almost always it represents the labour of other\nmen,--the past or future labours of men. It is the representative of a\nclaim on the labour of other men by force of violence.\n\nMoney, in its most exact and at the same time its simplest definition,\nrepresents conventional signs, which bestow the right,--or rather the\npossibility,--to use the work of other men. In its ideal meaning, money\nought to give this right or possibility only when it serves itself as a\nrepresentative of labour, and as such, money could exist in a society\ndevoid of any kind of violence. But as soon as violence takes place in a\nsociety, i.e., the possibility of the utilizing of the labour of others\nby the idler,--then this possibility of using the labour of others,\nwithout defining persons over which this violence is committed, is also\nexercised in money.\n\nThe landowner taxed his serfs by a contribution in kind, making them\nbring a certain quantity of linen, corn, cattle, or a corresponding\namount of money. One household delivered the cattle, but the linens were\nreplaced by money. The landowner accepts the money in a certain\nquantity, only because he knows that for this money he can get the same\npieces of linen (generally he takes a little more money to be sure that\nhe will receive for it the same quantity of linen), and this money\nevidently offers for the landowner lien on other men\'s labour.\n\nThe peasant gives money as a security against persons unknown but\nnumerous, who would undertake to work out so much linen for this money.\nThose who will undertake to work the linen will do it because they did\nnot succeed in feeding the sheep, and for these they must pay in money;\nand the peasant who will get the money for the sheep will take it, only\nbecause he must pay for the corn, which was a failure that year. The\nsame goes on in the State and all over the world.\n\nA man sells the produce of his past, present or future labour, sometimes\nhis food-stuff, not mostly because money is a convenient exchange for\nhim,--he would exchange without money,--but because he is required by\nmeans of violence to give money, as a security on his work.\n\nWhen Pharaoh has demanded the labour of his slaves, then the slaves have\ngiven him all their labour, but they could give only the past and\npresent labour, and could not give that of the future. But with the\nspread of money tokens and their result of "credit" it becomes possible\nto give also one\'s future work for money.\n\nMoney, with the existence of violence in society, offers the means for a\nnew form of impersonal slavery, which replaces the personal one. A\nslave-owner claims a right to the work of Peter, Iv\xc3\xa1n, Sidor. But\nwherever money is required from everybody, the owner of money acquires a\nclaim on the labour of all those unknown people who are in need of\nmoney. Money removes the painful side of slavery, by which the owner\nknows about his right on Iv\xc3\xa1n, at the same time it removes all those\nhuman relations between the owner and the slave, which softened down the\nburden of personal slavery.\n\nI will not dwell on the theory that perhaps such a state is necessary\nfor the development of mankind, for its progress and so forth--I will\nnot dispute it. I only strive to make clear to myself the conception of\nmoney and to discover the general misconception I have made in accepting\nmoney, as a representative of labour. I became convinced by experience\nthat money is not a representative of labour, but in the great majority\nof cases is a representative of violence, or of specially complex\nartifices founded on violence.\n\nMoney in our time has already altogether lost the desirable significance\nof being the representative of labour; such significance it may have in\nexceptional cases, but as a rule it has become the right or the\npossibility of using the labour of others.\n\nThis spreading of money, of credit and different conventional signs,\nmore and more confirm this meaning of money. Money is the possibility or\nthe right to use the labours of others.\n\nMoney is a new form of slavery differing from the old form of slavery\nonly by its impersonality, by the freedom it gives from all human\nrelations to the slave.\n\nMoney is money, a value always equal to itself, and which is always\nconsidered quite correct and lawful, and the use of which is not\nconsidered immoral, as slavery was.\n\nIn my young days a game of lotto was introduced in the clubs. All\neagerly played the game and, as was said, many lost their fortunes,\nruined their families, lost money entrusted to them, and government\nfunds, and finally shot themselves, so that the game was forbidden and\nis still forbidden.\n\nI remember I have met old, hardened card players who told me that this\ngame was especially fascinating, because one did not know whom one was\nto beat, as is the case in other games; the attendant does not even\nserve one with money, but with counters, everybody loses a small stake\nand does not betray grief. It is the same in roulette, which is rightly\nforbidden everywhere.\n\nSo it is with money. I have a magical, everlasting ruble; I cut off\ncoupons and live apart from all the affairs of the world. Whom do I\nharm? I am the most quiet and kind-hearted man. But this is only a game\nof lotto or roulette where I do not see the man, who shoots himself\nafter having lost, and who provides for me these small coupons, which I\ncarefully cut off under the right angle from the tickets.\n\nI have done nothing, I am doing nothing, and never will do anything,\nsave cut off the coupons, and firmly believe that money represents\nlabour. This is really astounding! And people talk of lunatics! But what\nmania could be more horrible than this? An intelligent, learned, and in\nall other respects sensible man lives madly, and soothes himself by not\nacknowledging that one thing which he should acknowledge to make his\nargument reasonable, and he considers himself in the right! The coupons\nare representatives of labour! Of labour! Yes, but of whose labour? Not\nof his, who owns them, evidently, but of the one who works.\n\nMoney is the same as slavery; its aim is the same and its consequences\nare the same. Its aim is the freeing of some men from the original law,\ntruly called so by a thoughtful writer of the working-classes, from the\nnatural law of life, as we call it, from the law of personal labour for\nthe satisfaction of one\'s needs. The consequences of the slavery for the\nowner: the begetting, the invention of infinitely more and more needs\nnever to be satisfied, of effeminate wretchedness and of depravity, and\nfor the slaves,--oppression of the man, and his lowering to the level of\na beast.\n\nMoney is a new and terrible form of slavery and, like the old form of\npersonal slavery, it equally demoralises the slave and the slave-owner,\nbut it is so much worse, because it frees the slave and the slave-owner\nfrom personal human relations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nI always wonder at the often repeated words, "Yes, it is all true in\ntheory, but how is it in practice?" As though the theory were only a\ncollection of words useful for conversation, and not as though all\npractice,--that is, all activity of life--were inevitably based upon it.\n\nThere must have been an immense number of foolish theories in the world\nfor men to employ such wonderful reasoning. We know that theory is what\na man thinks about a thing, and practice is what he does. How can a man\nthink that he ought to act in one way, and then do quite the reverse? If\nthe theory of baking bread consists in this, that first of all one must\nknead the dough, then put it by to rise, anyone knowing it would be a\nfool to do the reverse. But with us it has come into fashion to say, "It\nis all very well in theory, but how would it be in practice?"\n\nIn all that has occupied me practice has unavoidably followed theory,\nnot mainly in order to justify it, but because it could not help doing\nso: if I have understood the affair upon which I have meditated I cannot\nhelp doing it in the way in which I have understood it.\n\nI wished to help the needy only because I had money to spare: and I\nshared the general superstition that money represents labour, and,\ngenerally speaking, is something lawful and good in itself. But, having\nbegun to give this money away, I saw that I was only drawing bills of\nexchange collected from poor people; that I was doing the very thing the\nold landlords used to do in compelling some of their serfs to work for\nother serfs.\n\nI saw that every use of money, whether buying anything with it, or\ngiving it away gratis, is a drawing of bills of exchange on poor people,\nor passing them to others to be drawn by them. And therefore I clearly\nunderstood the foolishness of what I was doing in helping the poor by\nexacting money from them.\n\nI saw that money in itself was not only not a good thing, but obviously\nan evil one, depriving men of their chief good, labour, and that this\nvery good I cannot give to anyone because I am myself deprived of it: I\nhave neither labour nor the happiness of utilizing my labour.\n\nIt might be asked by some, "What is there so peculiarly important in\nabstractly discussing the meaning of money?" But this argument which I\nhave opened is not merely for the sake of discussion, but in order to\nfind an answer to the vital question which had caused me so much\nsuffering, and on which my life depended, in order to discover what I\nwas to do.\n\nAs soon as I understood what wealth means, what money means, then it\nbecame clear and certain what I have to do, it became clear and certain\nwhat all others have to do,--and that they will inevitably do it, what\nall men must do. In reality I merely came to realize what I have long\nknown,--that truth which has been transmitted to men from the oldest\ntimes, by Buddha, by Isaiah, by Laotse, by Socrates, and most clearly\nand definitely by Jesus and his predecessor John the Baptist.\n\nJohn the Baptist, in answer to men\'s question "What shall we do then?"\nanswered plainly and briefly, "He that hath two coats, let him impart to\nhim that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise"\n(Luke\xc2\xa0iii., 10, 11).\n\nThe same thing, and with still greater clearness, said Jesus,--blessing\nthe poor, and uttering woes on the rich. He said that no man can serve\nGod and mammon. He forbade his disciples not only to take money, but\nalso to have two coats. He said to the rich young man that he could not\nenter into the kingdom of God because he was rich, and that it is easier\nfor a camel to go through the needle\'s eye than for a rich man to enter\nthe kingdom of God.\n\nHe said that he who would not leave every thing--his houses and children\nand his fields--in order to follow him, was not his disciple. He spoke a\nparable about a rich man who had done nothing wrong (like our own rich\npeople), but merely dressed well and ate and drank well, yet by this\nlost his own soul; and about a beggar named Lazarus, who had done\nnothing good, but who had saved his soul by his beggar\'s life.\n\nThis truth had long been known to me; but the false teaching of the\nworld had so cunningly hidden it that it became a theory in the sense\nwhich men like to attach to this word,--that is, a pure abstraction. But\nas soon as I succeeded in pulling down in my consciousness the sophistry\nof the world\'s teaching, then theory became one with practice and the\nreality of my life and the life of all men became its unavoidable\nresult.\n\nI came to understand that man, besides living for his own good, must\nwork for the good of others; and that if we were to draw our comparison\nfrom the world of animals, as some men are so fond of doing in\njustifying violence and contest by the law of the struggle for\nexistence, we must take this comparison from the lives of social animals\nlike bees; and therefore man, to say nothing of that love to his\nneighbours which is incumbent on him, is called upon to serve his\nfellows and their common object, as much by reason as by his very\nnature.\n\nI understood that this is the natural law of man, by fulfilling which he\ncan alone fulfil his calling and therefore be happy. I understood that\nthis law has been and is being violated by the fact that men (as\nrobber-bees do) free themselves from labour by violence, and utilize the\nlabour of others, using this labour not for the common purpose but for\nthe personal satisfaction of their constantly increasing lusts, and\nalso, like robber-bees, they perish thereby. I understood that the\nmisfortune of men comes from the slavery in which some men are kept by\nothers; and I understood that this slavery is brought about in our days\nby military force, violence, by the appropriation of land, and by the\nexaction of money.\n\nAnd, having understood the meaning of all these three instruments of\nmodern slavery, I could not help desiring to free myself from any share\nin it.\n\nWhen I was a landlord, possessing serfs, and came to understand the\nimmorality of such a position, I, along with other men who had\nunderstood the same thing, tried to free myself from it. And I freed\nmyself from this state thus. Finding it immoral, but not being able as\nyet to free myself wholly from it, I tried meanwhile to assert my rights\nas a serf-owner as little as possible.\n\nI cannot help doing the same now with reference to the present\nslavery--that is, I try as little as possible to assert my claims while\nI am unable to free myself from the power which gives me land-ownership,\nand from money raised by the violence of military force--and at the same\ntime by all means in my power to suggest to other men the unlawfulness\nand inhumanity of these imaginary rights.\n\nThe share in enslaving men consists, on the standpoint of a slave-owner,\nin utilizing the labour of others. (It is all the same whether the\nenslaving is based on a claim to the person of the slave or on the\npossession of land or money.) And, therefore, if a man really does not\nlike slavery and does not desire to be a partaker in it, the first thing\nwhich he must do is this: neither take men\'s labour by serving the\ngovernment, nor possess land or money.\n\nThe refusal of all the means in use for taking another\'s labour will\nunavoidably bring such a man to the necessity of lessening his wants on\nthe one hand, and, on the other, of doing himself what formerly was done\nfor him by other men. This simple and unavoidable conclusion enters into\nevery detail of my life, changes it entirely, and at once sets me free\nfrom the moral sufferings I had endured at the sight of the misery and\nwickedness of men.\n\nThe first cause was the accumulation of people in towns, and the\nabsorption there of the products of the country.\n\nAll that a man needs is not to desire to take another\'s labour by\nserving the government and possessing land and money, and then,\naccording to his strength and ability, to satisfy unaided his own wants.\nThe idea of leaving his village would never enter the mind of such a\nman, because in the country it is easier for him to satisfy his wants\npersonally, while in a town everything is the product of the labour of\nothers, all must be bought; in the country a man will always be able to\nhelp the needy, and will not experience that feeling of being useless,\nwhich I felt in the town when I wanted to help men, not with my own, but\nwith other men\'s labours.\n\nThe second cause was the estrangement between the poor and the rich. A\nman need only not desire to profit by other men\'s labour by serving the\ngovernment and possessing land and money, and he would be compelled to\nsatisfy his wants himself, and at once involuntarily that barrier would\nbe pushed down which separates him from the working-people, and he would\nbe one with the people, standing shoulder to shoulder with them, and\nseeing the possibility of helping them.\n\nThe third cause was shame, based on the consciousness of the immorality\nof possessing money with which I wanted to help others. A man need only\nnot desire to profit by another man\'s labour by serving the government\nand possessing land and money, and he will never have that superfluous\n"fool\'s money," the fact of possessing which made those who wanted money\nask me for pecuniary assistance which I was not able to satisfy, and\ncalled forth in me the consciousness of my unrighteousness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nI saw that the cause of the sufferings and depravity of men lies in the\nfact that some men are in bondage to others; and therefore I came to the\nobvious conclusion that if I want to help men I have first of all to\nleave off causing those very misfortunes which I want to remedy,--in\nother words, I must not share in the enslaving of men.\n\nI was led to the enslaving of men by the circumstance that from my\ninfancy I had been accustomed not to work, but to profit by the labour\nof others, and that I had been living in a society which is not only\naccustomed to this slavery but which justifies it by all kinds of\nsophistry, clever and foolish.\n\nI came to the following simple conclusion, that, in order to avoid\ncausing the sufferings and depravity of men, I ought to make other men\nwork for me as little as possible and to work myself as much as\npossible.\n\nIt was by this roundabout way that I arrived at the inevitable\nconclusion to which the Chinese arrived some thousand years ago, and\nwhich they express thus: "If there is one idle man, there must be\nanother who is starving."\n\nI came to this simple and natural conclusion, that if I pity the\nexhausted horse on whose back I ride the first thing for me to do if I\nreally pity him is to get off his back and walk. This answer, which\ngives such complete satisfaction to the moral sense, had always been\nbefore my eyes, as it is before the eyes of every one, but we do not all\nsee it, and look aside.\n\nIn seeking to heal our social diseases we look everywhere,--to the\ngovernmental, anti-governmental, scientific, and philanthropic\nsuperstitions,--and yet we do not see that which meets the eyes of every\none. We fill our drains with filth and require other men to clean them,\nand pretend to be very sorry for them and want to ease their work; and\nwe invent all sorts of devices except one, the simplest; namely, that we\nshould ourselves remove our slops so long as we find it necessary to\nproduce them in our rooms.\n\nFor him who really suffers from the sufferings of the other men\nsurrounding him, there exists a most clear, simple, and easy means, the\nonly one sufficient to heal this evil and to confer a sense of the\nlawfulness of one\'s life. This means is that which John the Baptist\nrecommended when he answered the question, "What shall we do then?" and\nwhich was confirmed by Christ: not to have more than one coat, and not\nto possess money,--that is, not to profit by another man\'s labour. And\nin order not to profit by another\'s labour, we must do with our own\nhands all that we can do. This is so plain and simple! But it is plain\nand simple and clear only when our wants are also plain, and when we\nourselves are still sound and not corrupted to the backbone by idleness\nand laziness.\n\nI live in a village, lie by the stove, and tell my neighbour, who is my\ndebtor, to chop wood and light the stove. It is obvious that I am lazy\nand take my neighbour away from his own work; and at last I feel ashamed\nof it; and besides, it grows dull for me to be always lying down when my\nmuscles are strong and accustomed to work,--and I go to chop the wood\nmyself.\n\nBut slavery of all kinds has been going on so long, so many artificial\nwants have grown about it, so many people with different degrees of\nfamiliarity with these wants are interwoven with one another, through so\nmany generations men have been spoiled and made effeminate, such\ncomplicated temptations and justifications of luxury and idleness have\nbeen invented by men, that for one who stands on the top of the pyramid\nof idle men, it is not at all so easy to understand his sin as it is for\nthe peasant who compels his neighbour to light his stove.\n\nMen who stand at the top find it most difficult to understand what is\nrequired of them. From the height of the structure of lies on which they\nstand they become giddy when they look at that spot on the earth to\nwhich they must descend in order to begin to live, not righteously, but\nonly not quite inhumanly; and that is why this plain and clear truth\nappears to these men so strange.\n\nA man who employs ten servants in livery, coachmen and cooks, who has\npictures and pianos, must certainly regard as strange and even\nridiculous the simple preliminary duty of, I do not say a good man, but\nof every man who is not an animal, to hew that wood with which his food\nis cooked and by which he is warmed; to clean those boots in which he\ncarelessly stepped into the mud; to bring that water with which he keeps\nhimself clean; and to carry away those slops in which he has washed\nhimself.\n\nBut besides the estrangement of men from the truth, there is another\ncause which hinders them from seeing the duty of doing the most simple\nand natural physical work; that is the complication and intermingling of\nthe conditions in which a rich man lives.\n\nThis morning I entered the corridor in which the stoves are heated. A\npeasant was heating the stove which warmed my son\'s room. I entered his\nbedroom: he was asleep, and it was eleven o\'clock in the morning. The\nexcuse was, "To-day is a holiday; no lessons." A stout lad of eighteen\nyears of age, having over-eaten himself the previous night, is sleeping\nuntil eleven o\'clock; and a peasant of his own age, who had already that\nmorning done a quantity of work, was now lighting the tenth stove. "It\nwould be better, perhaps, if the peasant did not light the stove to warm\nthis stout, lazy fellow!" thought I; but I remembered at once that this\nstove also warmed the room of our housekeeper, a woman of forty years of\nage, who had been working the night before till three o\'clock in the\nmorning to prepare everything for the supper which my son ate; and then\nshe put away the dishes, and, notwithstanding this, got up at seven. She\ncannot heat the stove herself: she has no time for that. The peasant is\nheating the stove for her, too. And under her name my lazy fellow was\nbeing warmed.\n\nTrue, the advantages are all interwoven; but without much consideration\nthe conscience of each will say, On whose side is the labour, and on\nwhose the idleness? But not only does conscience tell this, the\naccount-book also tells it: the more money one spends, the more people\nwork for us. The less one spends, the more one works one\'s self. "My\nluxurious life gives means of living to others. Where should my old\nfootman go, if I were to discharge him?" "What! every one must do\neverything for himself? Make his coat as well as hew his wood? And how\nabout division of labour? And industry and social undertakings?" And,\nlast of all, come the most horrible of words,--civilization, science,\nart!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nLast March I was returning home late in the evening. On turning into a\nbye-lane I perceived on the snow in a distant field some black shadows.\nI should not have noticed this but for the policeman who stood at the\nend of the lane and cried in the direction of the shadows, "Vasili, why\ndon\'t you come along?"\n\n"She won\'t move," answered a voice; and thereupon the shadows came\ntowards the policeman. I stopped and asked him,--\n\n"What is the matter?"\n\nHe said, "We have got some girls from Rzhanoff\'s house, and are taking\nthem to the police-station; and one of them lags behind, and won\'t come\nalong."\n\nA night-watchman in sheepskin coat appeared now driving on a girl who\nslouched along while he prodded her from behind. I, the watchman and the\npoliceman, were wearing winter coats: she alone had none, having only\nher gown on. In the dark I could distinguish only a brown dress and a\nkerchief round her head and neck. She was short, like most starvelings,\nand had a broad, clumsy figure.\n\n"We aren\'t going to stay here all night for you, you hag! Get on, or\nI\'ll give it you!" shouted the policeman. He was evidently fatigued and\ntired of her. She walked some paces and stopped again.\n\nThe old watchman, a good-natured man (I knew him), pulled her by the\nhand. "I\'ll wake you up! come along!" said he, pretending to be angry.\nShe staggered, and began to speak with a croaking hoarse voice, "Let me\nbe; don\'t you push. I\'ll get on myself."\n\n"You\'ll be frozen to death," he returned.\n\n"A girl like me won\'t be frozen: I\'ve lots of hot blood."\n\nShe meant it as a joke, but her words sounded like a curse. By a lamp,\nwhich stood not far from the gate of my house, she stopped again, leaned\nback against the paling, and began to seek for something among her\npetticoats with awkward, frozen hands. They again shouted to her; but\nshe only muttered and continued searching. She held in one hand a\ncrumpled cigarette and matches in the other. I remained behind her: I\nwas ashamed to pass by or to stay and look at her. But I made up my mind\nand came up to her. She leaned with her shoulder against the paling and\nvainly tried to light a match on it.\n\nI looked narrowly at her face. She was indeed a starveling and appeared\nto me to be a woman of about thirty. Her complexion was dirty; her eyes\nsmall, dim, and bleared with drinking; she had a squat nose; her lips\nwere wry and slavering, with downcast angles; from under her kerchief\nfell a tuft of dry hair. Her figure was long and flat; her arms and legs\nshort.\n\nI stopped in front of her. She looked at me and grinned as if she knew\nall that I was thinking about. I felt that I ought to say something to\nher. I wanted to show her that I pitied her.\n\n"Have you parents?" I asked. She laughed hoarsely, then suddenly\nstopped, and, lifting her brows, began to look at me steadfastly.\n\n"Have you parents?" I repeated.\n\nShe smiled with a grimace which seemed to say, "What a question for him\nto put!"\n\n"I have a mother," she said at last; "but what\'s that to you?"\n\n"And how old are you?"\n\n"I am over fifteen," she said, at once answering a question she was\naccustomed to hear.\n\n"Come, come! go on; we shall all be frozen for you, the deuce take you!"\nshouted the policeman; and she edged off from the paling and staggered\nalong the lane to the police-station: and I turned to the gate and\nentered my house, and asked whether my daughters were at home. I was\ntold that they had been to an evening party, had enjoyed themselves\nmuch, and now were asleep.\n\nThe next morning I was about to go to the police-station to enquire what\nhad become of this unhappy girl. I was ready to start early enough, when\none of those unfortunate men called, who from weakness have dropped out\nof the gentlemanly line of life to which they have been accustomed, and\nwho rise and fall by turns. I had been acquainted with him three years.\nDuring this time he had several times sold every thing he had,--even his\nclothes; and, having just done so again, he passed his nights\ntemporarily in Rzhanoff\'s house, and his days at my lodgings. He met me\nas I was going out, and, without listening to me, began at once to\nrelate what had happened at Rzhanoff\'s house the night before.\n\nHe began to relate it, yet had not got through one-half when, all of a\nsudden, he, an old man, who had gone through much in his life, began to\nsob, and, ceasing to speak, turned his face away from me. This was what\nhe related. I ascertained the truth of his story on the spot, where I\nlearned some new particulars, which I shall relate too.\n\nA washerwoman thirty years of age, fair, quiet, good-looking, but\ndelicate, passed her nights in the same lodging-house, the ground-floor\nof No.\xc2\xa032 where my friend slept among various shifting night-lodgers,\nmen and women, who for five kopeks slept with each other.\n\nThe landlady at this lodging was the mistress of a boatman. In summer\nher lover kept a boat; and in winter they earned their living by letting\nlodgings to night-lodgers at three kopeks without a pillow, and at five\nkopeks with one.\n\nThe washerwoman had been living here some months, and was a quiet woman;\nbut lately they began to object to her because she coughed, and\nprevented the other lodgers from sleeping. An old woman in particular,\neighty years old, half silly, and a permanent inmate of this lodging,\nbegan to dislike the washerwoman and kept annoying her because she\ndisturbed her sleep; for all night she coughed like a sheep.\n\nThe washerwoman said nothing. She owed for rent, and felt herself\nguilty, and was therefore compelled to endure. She began to work less\nand less, for her strength failed her; and that was why she was unable\nto pay her rent. She had not been to work at all the whole of the last\nweek; and she had been making the lives of all, and particularly of the\nold woman, miserable by her cough.\n\nFour days ago the landlady gave her notice to leave. She already owed\nsixty kopeks, and could not pay them, and there was no hope of doing so;\nand other lodgers complained of her cough.\n\nWhen the landlady gave the washerwoman notice, and told her she must go\naway if she did not pay the rent, the old woman was glad, and pushed her\nout into the yard. The washerwoman went away, but came back again in an\nhour, and the landlady had not the heart to send her away again....\nDuring the second and the third day the landlady left her there. "Where\nshall I go?" she kept saying. On the third day the landlady\'s lover, a\nMoscow man, who knew all the rules and regulations, went for a\npoliceman. The policeman, with a sword and a pistol slung on a red cord,\ncame into the lodging and quietly and politely turned the washerwoman\nout into the street.\n\nIt was a bright, sunny, but frosty day in March. The melting snow ran\ndown in streams, the house-porters were breaking the ice. The hackney\nsledges bumped on the ice-glazed snow, and creaked over the stones. The\nwasherwoman went up the hill on the sunny side, got to the church, and\nsat down in the sun at the church-porch. But when the sun began to go\ndown behind the houses and the pools of water began to be covered with a\nthin sheet of ice, the washerwoman felt chilly and terrified. She got up\nand slowly walked on.... Where? Home,--to the only house in which she\nhad been living lately.\n\nWhile she was walking there, several times resting herself, it began to\nget dark. She approached the gate, turned into it, her foot slipped, she\ngave a shriek, and fell down.\n\nOne man passed by, then another. "She must be drunk," they thought.\nAnother man passed, and stumbled up against her, and said to the\nhouse-porter, "Some tipsy woman is lying at the gate. I very nearly\nbroke my neck over her. Won\'t you take her away?"\n\nThe house-porter came. The washerwoman was dead. This was what my friend\nrelated to me.\n\nThe reader will perhaps fancy I have picked out particular cases in the\nprostitute of fifteen years of age and the story of this washerwoman;\nbut let him not think so: this really happened in one and the same\nnight. I do not exactly remember the date, only it was in March, 1884.\n\nHaving heard my friend\'s story I went to the police-station, intending\nfrom there to go to Rzhanoff\'s house to learn all the particulars of the\nwasherwoman\'s story.\n\nThe weather was fine and sunny; and again under the ice of the previous\nnight, in the shade, you could see the water running; and in the sun, in\nthe square, everything was melting fast. The trees of the garden\nappeared blue from over the river; the sparrows that were reddish in\nwinter, and unnoticed then, now attracted people\'s attention by their\nmerriness; men also tried to be merry, but they all had too many cares.\nThe bells of the churches sounded; and blending with them were heard\nsounds of shooting from the barracks,--the hiss of the rifle balls, and\nthe crack when they struck the target.\n\nI entered the police-station. There some armed men--policemen--led me to\ntheir chief. He, also armed with a sword, sabre, and pistol, was busy\ngiving some orders about a ragged, trembling old man who was standing\nbefore him, and from weakness could not clearly answer what was asked of\nhim. Having done with the old man, he turned to me. I inquired about the\nprostitute of last night. He first listened to me attentively, then he\nsmiled, not only because I did not know why they were taken to the\npolice-station, but more particularly at my astonishment at her youth.\n"Goodness! there are some of twelve, thirteen, and fourteen years of age\noften," said he, in a lively tone.\n\nTo my question about the girl of yesterday, he told me that she had\nprobably been already sent to the committee (if I understood him right).\nTo my question where such women passed the night, he gave a vague\nanswer. The one about whom I spoke he did not remember. There were so\nmany of them every day.\n\nAt Rzhanoff\'s house, in No.\xc2\xa032, I already found the sacristan reading\nprayers over the dead washerwoman. She had been brought in and laid on\nher former pallet; and the lodgers, all starvelings themselves,\ncontributed money for the prayers, the coffin, and the shroud; the old\nwoman had dressed her, and laid her out. The clerk was reading something\nin the dark; a woman in a cloak stood holding a wax taper; and with a\nsimilar wax taper stood a man (a gentleman, it is fair to state), in a\nnice great-coat, trimmed with an astrachan collar, in bright goloshes,\nand with a starched shirt. That was her brother. He had been hunted up.\n\nI passed by the dead woman to the landlady\'s room in order to ask her\nall the particulars. She was afraid of my questions,--afraid probably of\nbeing charged with something; but by and by she grew talkative and told\nme all. On passing by again, I looked at the dead body. All the dead are\nbeautiful; but this one was particularly beautiful and touching in her\ncoffin, with her clear, pale face, with closed, prominent eyes, sunken\ncheeks, and fair, soft hair over her high forehead; her face looked\nweary, but kind, and not sad at all, but rather astonished. And indeed,\nif the living do not see, the dead may well be astonished.\n\nOn the day I wrote this there was a great ball in Moscow. On the same\nnight I left home after eight o\'clock. I live in a locality surrounded\nby factories; and I left home after the factory whistle had sounded, and\nwhen, after a week of incessant work, the people were freed for their\nholiday. Factory-men passed by me, and I by them, all turning their\nsteps to the public-houses and inns. Many were already tipsy: many were\nwith women.\n\nEvery morning at five I hear each of the whistles, which means that the\nlabour of women, children, and old people has begun. At eight o\'clock\nanother whistle,--this means half an hour\'s rest; at twelve the third\nwhistle,--this means an hour for dinner. At eight o\'clock the fourth\nwhistle, indicating cessation from work. By a strange coincidence, all\nthe three factories in my neighbourhood produce only the articles\nnecessary for balls.\n\nIn one factory,--the one nearest to me,--they make nothing but\nstockings; in the other opposite, silk stuffs; in the third, perfumes\nand pomades.\n\nOne may, on hearing these whistles, attach to them no other meaning than\nthat of the indication of time. "There, the whistle has sounded: it is\ntime to go out for a walk."\n\nBut one may associate with them also the meaning they have in\nreality,--that at the first whistle at five o\'clock in the morning, men\nand women, who have slept side by side in a damp cellar, get up in the\ndark, and hurry away into the noisy building to take their part in a\nwork of which they see neither cessation nor utility for themselves, and\nwork often so in the heat, in suffocating exhalations, with very rare\nintervals of rest, for one, two, or three, or even twelve or more hours.\nThey fall asleep, and get up again, and again do this work, meaningless\nfor themselves, to which they are goaded only by want. So it goes on\nfrom one week to another, interrupted only by holidays.\n\nAnd now I see these working-people freed for one of these holidays. They\ngo out into the street: everywhere there are inns, public-houses, and\ngay women. And they, in a drunken state, pull each other by the arms,\nand carry along with them girls like the one whom I saw conducted to the\npolice-station: they hire hackney-coaches, and ride and walk from one\ninn to another, and abuse each other, and totter about, and say they\nknow not what.\n\nFormerly when I saw the factory people knocking about in this way I used\nto turn aside with disgust, and almost reproached them; but since I hear\nthese daily whistles, and know what they mean, I am only astonished that\nall these men do not come into the condition of the utter beggars with\nwhom Moscow is filled, and the women into the position of the girl whom\nI had met near my house.\n\nThus I walked on, looking at these men, observing how they went about\nthe streets, till eleven o\'clock. Then their movements became quieter:\nthere remained here and there a few tipsy people, and I met some men and\nwomen who were being conducted to the police-station. And now, from\nevery side, carriages appeared, all going in one direction. On the\ncoach-box sat a coachman, sometimes in a sheepskin coat, and a\nfootman,--a dandy with a cockade. Well-fed horses, covered with cloth,\ntrotted at the rate of fifteen miles an hour. In the carriages sat\nladies wrapped in shawls, taking great care not to spoil their flowers\nand their toilets. All, beginning with the harness on the horses, the\ncarriages, indiarubber wheels, the cloth of the coachman\'s coat, down to\nthe stockings, shoes, flowers, velvet, gloves, scents,--all these\narticles have been made by those men, some of whom fell asleep on their\nown pallets in their mean rooms, some in night-houses with prostitutes,\nand others in the police-station.\n\nThe ball-goers drive past these men, in and with things made by them;\nand it does not even enter into their minds that there could possibly be\nany connection between the ball they are going to, and these tipsy\npeople to whom their coachmen shout out so angrily. With easy minds and\nassurance that they are doing nothing wrong, but something very good,\nthey enjoy themselves at the ball.\n\nEnjoy themselves!\n\nFrom eleven o\'clock in the evening till six in the morning, in the very\ndepth of the night; while with empty stomachs men are lying in\nnight-lodgings, or dying as the washer-woman had done!\n\nThe enjoyment of the ball consists in women and girls uncovering their\nbosoms, putting on artificial protuberances at the back, and altogether\ngetting themselves up as no girl and no woman who is not yet depraved\nwould, on any account, appear before men; and in this half-naked\ncondition, with uncovered bosoms, and arms bare up to the shoulders,\nwith dresses puffed behind and tight round the hips, in the brightest\nlight, women and girls, whose first virtue has always been modesty,\nappear among strange men, who are also dressed in indecently\ntight-fitting clothes, embrace each other, and pivot round and round to\nthe sound of exciting music. Old women, often also half naked like the\nyounger ones, are sitting looking on, and eating and drinking: the old\nmen do the same. No wonder it is done at night when everyone else is\nsleeping, so that no one may see it!\n\nBut it is not done at night in order to hide it; there is nothing indeed\nto hide; all is very nice and good; and by this enjoyment, in which is\nswallowed up the painful labour of thousands, not only is nobody harmed,\nbut by this very thing poor people are fed!\n\nThe ball goes on very merrily, may be, but how did it come to do so?\nWhen we see in society or among ourselves one who has not eaten, or is\ncold, we are ashamed to enjoy ourselves, and cannot begin to be merry\nuntil he is fed, to say nothing of the fact that we cannot even imagine\nthat there are people who can enjoy themselves by means of anything\nwhich produces the sufferings of others.\n\nWe are disgusted with and do not understand the enjoyment of brutal boys\nwho have squeezed a dog\'s tail into a piece of split wood. How is it,\nthen, that in our enjoyment we become blind, and do not see the cleft in\nwhich we have pinched those men who suffer for our enjoyment.\n\nWe know that each woman at this ball whose dress costs a hundred and\nfifty rubles was not born at the ball, but has lived in the country, has\nseen peasants, is acquainted with a nurse and maid whose fathers and\nbrothers are poor, for whom the earning of a hundred and fifty rubles to\nbuild a cottage with is the end and aim of a long, laborious life. She\nknows all this; how can she, then, enjoy herself, knowing that on her\nhalf-naked body she is wearing the cottage which is the dream of her\nhousemaid\'s brother?\n\nBut let us suppose she has not thought about this: still she cannot help\nknowing that velvet and silk, sweetmeats and flowers, and laces and\ndresses, do not grow of themselves, but are made by men. One would think\nshe could not help knowing that men make all these things, and under\nwhat circumstances, and why. She cannot help knowing that her\ndressmaker, whom she scolded to-day, made this dress not at all out of\nlove to her, therefore she cannot help knowing that all these\nthings--her laces, flowers, and velvet--were made from sheer want.\n\nBut perhaps she is so blinded that she does not think of this. Well,\nbut, at all events, she could not help knowing that five people, old,\nrespectable, often delicate men and women, have not slept all night, and\nhave been busy on her account. She saw their tired, gloomy faces. This,\nalso, she could not help knowing,--that on this night there were\ntwenty-eight degrees of frost, and that her coachman--an old man--was\nsitting in this frost all night on his coach-box.\n\nBut I know that they do not really see this. If from the hypnotic\ninfluence of the ball these young women and girls fail to see all this,\nwe cannot judge them. Poor things! They consider all to be good which is\npronounced so by their elders. How do these elders explain their\ncruelty? They, indeed, always answer in the same way: "I compel no one;\nwhat I have, I have bought; footmen, chambermaids, coachman, I hire.\nThere is no harm in engaging and in buying. I compel none; I hire; what\nwrong is there in that?"\n\nSome days ago I called on a friend. Passing through the first room I\nwondered at seeing two women at a table, for I knew my acquaintance was\na bachelor. A skinny yellow, old-looking woman, about thirty, with a\nkerchief thrown over her shoulders, was briskly doing something over the\ntable with her hands, jerking nervously, as if in a fit. Opposite to her\nsat a young girl, who was also doing something and jerking in the same\nway. They both seemed to be suffering from St. Vitus\'s dance. I came\nnearer and looked closer to see what they were about.\n\nThey glanced up at me and then continued their work as attentively as\nbefore.\n\nBefore them were spread tobacco and cigarettes. They were making\ncigarettes. The woman rubbed the tobacco fine between the palms of her\nhands, caught it up by a machine, put on the tubes, and threw them to\nthe girl. The girl folded the papers, put them over the cigarette, threw\nit aside, and took up another.\n\nAll this was performed with such speed, with such dexterity, that it was\nimpossible to describe it. I expressed my wonder at their quickness. "I\nhave been at this business fourteen years," said the woman.\n\n"Is it hard work?"\n\n"Yes: my chest aches, and the air is choky with tobacco."\n\nBut it was not necessary for her to have said so: you need only have\nlooked at her or at the girl. The latter had been at this business three\nyears; but anyone not seeing her at this work would have said that she\nhad a strong constitution which was already beginning to be broken.\n\nMy acquaintance, a kind-hearted man of liberal views, hired these women\nto make him cigarettes at two rubles and a half (5s.) a thousand. He has\nmoney, and he pays it away for this work: what harm is there in it?\n\nMy acquaintance gets up at twelve. His evenings, from six to two, he\nspends at cards or at the piano; he eats and drinks well; other people\ndo all the work for him. He has devised for himself a new\npleasure,--smoking. I can remember when he began to smoke. Here are a\nwoman and a girl who can scarcely earn their living by transforming\nthemselves into machines, and who pass all their lives in breathing\ntobacco, thus ruining their lives. He has money which he has not earned,\nand he prefers playing at cards to making cigarettes for himself. He\ngives these women money only on condition that they continue to live as\nmiserably as they lived before in making cigarettes for him.\n\nI am fond of cleanliness; and I give money on condition that the\nwasherwoman washes my shirts, which I change twice a day; and the\nwashing of these shirts having taxed the utmost strength of the\nwasherwoman, she has died.\n\nWhat is wrong in this?\n\nMen who buy and hire will continue doing so whether I do or do not; they\nwill force other people to make velvets and dainties, and will buy them\nwhether I do or do not; so also they will hire people to make cigarettes\nand to wash shirts. Why should I, then, deprive myself of velvets,\nsweetmeats, cigarettes, and clean shirts, when their production is\nalready set in going. Often,--almost constantly I hear this reasoning.\n\nThis is the very reasoning which a crowd, maddened with the passion of\ndestruction, will employ. It is the same reasoning which leads a pack of\ndogs, when one of their number runs against another and knocks it down,\nthe rest attack it and tear it to pieces. Others have already begun,\nhave done a little mischief; why shouldn\'t I, too, do the same? What can\nit possibly signify if I wear a dirty shirt and make my cigarettes\nmyself? could that help any one? men ask who desire to justify\nthemselves.\n\nHad we not wandered so far from truth one would be ashamed to answer\nthis question; but we are so entangled that such a question seems\nnatural to us, and, therefore, though I feel ashamed, I must answer it.\n\nWhat difference would it be if I should wear my shirt a week instead of\na day, and make my cigarettes myself, or leave off smoking altogether?\n\nThe difference would be this,--that a certain washerwoman, and a certain\ncigarette-maker, would exert themselves less, and what I gave formerly\nfor the washing of my shirt, and for the making of my cigarettes, I may\ngive now to that or to another woman; and working-people who are tired\nby their work, instead of overworking themselves, will be able to rest\nand to have tea. But I have heard objections to this, so ashamed are the\nrich and luxurious to understand their position.\n\nThey reply, "If I should wear dirty linen, leave off smoking, and give\nthis money away to the poor, then this money would be all the same taken\naway from them, and my drop will not help to swell the sea."\n\nI am still more ashamed to answer such a reply, but at the same time I\nmust do so. If I came among savages who gave me chops which I thought\ndelicious, but the next day I learned (perhaps saw myself) that these\ndelicious chops were made of a human prisoner who had been slain in\norder to make them; and if I think it bad to eat men, however delicious\nthe cutlets may be, and however general the custom to eat men among the\npersons with whom I live, and however small the utility of my refusal to\neat them may be,--to the prisoners who have been prepared for food,--I\nshall not and cannot eat them.\n\nIt may be that I shall eat human flesh when urged by hunger; but I shall\nnot make a feast of it, and shall not take part in feasts with human\nflesh, and shall not seek such feasts, nor be proud of my partaking of\nthem.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nBut what is to be done, then? We did not do it, did we? And if not we,\nwho did?\n\nWe say, "It is not we who have done all this; it has been done of\nitself"; as children say when they break anything, that "it broke\nitself." We say that, as towns are already in existence, we, who are\nliving there, must feed men by buying their labour. But that is not\ntrue. It need only be observed how we live in the country, and how we\nfeed people there.\n\nWinter is over: Easter is coming. In the town the same orgies of the\nrich go on,--on the boulevards, in gardens, in the parks, on the river;\nmusic, theatres, riding, illuminations, fire-works. But in the country\nit is still better,--the air is purer; the trees, the meadows, the\nflowers, are fresher. We must go where all is budding and blooming. And\nnow we, the majority of rich people, who live by other men\'s labour, go\ninto the country to breathe the purer air, to look at the meadows and\nwoods. Here in the country among humble villagers who feed on bread and\nonions, work eighteen hours every day, and have neither sufficient sleep\nnor clothes, rich people take up their abode. No one tempts these\npeople: here are no factories, and no idle hands, of which there are so\nmany in town, whom we may imagine we feed by giving them work to do.\nHere people never can do their own work in time during the summer; and\nnot only are there no idle hands, but much property is lost for want of\nhands; and an immense number of men, children, and old people, and women\nwith child, overwork themselves.\n\nHow, then, do rich people order their lives here in the country? Thus:\nif there happens to be an old mansion, built in the time of the serfs,\nthen this house is renovated and re-decorated: if there is not, one is\nbuilt of two or three stories. The rooms, which are from twelve to\ntwenty and more in number, are all about sixteen feet high. The floors\nare inlaid; in the windows are put whole panes of glass, costly carpets\non the floors; expensive furniture is procured,--a sideboard, for\ninstance, costing from twenty to sixty pounds. Near the mansion, roads\nare made; flower-beds are laid out; there are croquet-lawns,\ngiant-strides, reflecting globes, conservatories, and hot-houses, and\nalways luxurious stables. All is painted in colours, prepared with the\nvery oil which the old people and children lack for their porridge. If a\nrich man can afford it he buys such a house for himself; if he cannot he\nhires one: but however poor and however liberal a man of our circle may\nbe, he always takes up his abode in the country in such a house, for\nbuilding and keeping which it is necessary to take away dozens of\nworking-people who have not enough time to do their own business in the\nfield to earn their living.\n\nHere we cannot say that factories are already in existence and will\ncontinue so whether we make use of their work or no; we cannot say that\nwe are feeding idle hands; here we plainly establish the factories for\nmaking things necessary for us, and simply make use of the surrounding\npeople; we divert the people from work necessary for them, as for us and\nfor all, and by such system deprave some, and ruin the lives and the\nhealth of others.\n\nThere lives, let us say, in a village, an educated and respectable\nfamily of the upper class, or that of a government officer. All its\nmembers and the visitors assemble towards the middle of June, because up\nto June they had been studying and passing their examinations: they\nassemble when mowing begins, and they stay until September, until the\nharvest and sowing time. The members of the family (as almost all men of\nthis class) remain in the country from the beginning of the urgent\nwork,--hay-making,--not to the end of it, indeed, because in September\nthe sowing goes on, and the digging up of potatoes, but till labour\nbegins to slacken. During the whole time of the stay, around them and\nclose by the peasants\' summer work has been proceeding, the strain of\nwhich, however much we may have heard or read of it, however much we may\nhave looked at it, we can form no adequate idea without having\nexperienced it ourselves.\n\nThe members of the family, about ten persons have been living as they\ndid in town, if possible still worse than in town, because here in the\nvillage they are supposed to be resting (after doing nothing), and offer\nno pretence in the way of work, and no excuse for their idleness.\n\nIn the midsummer-lent, when people are forced from want to feed on\nkvas[5] and bread and onions, begins the mowing time. Gentlefolk who\nlive in the country see this labour, partly order it, partly admire it;\nenjoy the smell of the drying hay, the sound of women\'s songs, the noise\nof the scythes, and the sight of the rows of mowers, and of the women\nraking. They see this near their house as well as when they, with young\npeople and children who do nothing all the day long, drive well-fed\nhorses a distance of a few hundred yards to the bathing-place.\n\n  [5] A home-made cheap fermented drink.--Ed.\n\nThe work of mowing is one of the most important in the world. Nearly\nevery year, from want of hands and of time, the meadows remain half\nuncut and may remain so till the rains begin; so that the degree of\nintensity of the labour decides the question whether twenty or more per\ncent will be added to the stores of the world, or whether this hay will\nbe left to rot or spoil while yet uncut.\n\nAnd if there is more hay, there will be also more meat for old people\nand milk for children; thus matters stand in general; but in particular\nfor each mower here is decided the question of bread and milk for\nhimself, and for his children during the winter.\n\nEach of the working-people, male and female, knows this: even the\nchildren know that this is an important business and that one ought to\nwork with all one\'s strength, carry a jug with kvas for the father to\nthe mowing-place, and, shifting it from one hand to another, run\nbarefoot as quickly as possible, a distance of perhaps a mile and a half\nfrom the village, in order to be in time for dinner, that father may not\ngrumble. Every one knows, that, from the mowing to the harvest, there\nwill be no cessation of labour, and no time for rest. And besides\nmowing, each has some other business to do,--to plough up new land and\nharrow it; the women have the linen to make, bread to bake, and the\nwashing to do; and the peasants must drive to the mill and to market;\nthey have the official affairs of their community to attend to; they\nhave also to provide the local government officials with means of\nlocomotion, and to pass the night in the fields with the pastured\nhorses.\n\nAll, old and young and sick, work with all their strength.\n\nThe peasants work in such a way, that, when cutting the last rows, the\nmowers, some of them weak people, growing youths, and old men, are so\ntired, that, having rested a little, it is with great pain they begin\nanew; the women, often with child, work hard too.\n\nIt is a strained, incessant labour. All work to the utmost of their\nstrength, and use not only all their provisions but what they have in\nstore. During harvest-time all the peasants grow thinner although they\nnever were very stout.\n\nThere is a small company labouring in the hayfield; three peasants--one\nan old man, another his married nephew, and the third the village\ncobbler, a thin, wiry man. Their mowing this morning decides their fate\nfor the coming winter, whether they will be able to keep a cow and pay\ntheir taxes. This is their second weeks\' work. The rain hindered them\nfor a while. After the rain had left off and the water had dried up they\ndecided to make hayricks; and in order to do it quicker they decided\nthat two women must rake to each scythe. With the old man came out his\nwife, fifty years of age, worn out with labour and the bearing of eleven\nchildren; deaf, but still strong enough for work; and his daughter,\nthirteen years of age, a short but brisk and strong little girl.\n\nWith the nephew came his wife,--a tall woman, as strong as a peasant,\nand his sister in law,--a soldier\'s wife, who was with child. With the\ncobbler came his wife,--a strong working-woman, and her mother,--an old\nwoman about eighty, who for the rest of the year used to beg.\n\nThey all draw up in a line, and work from morning to evening in the\nburning sun of June. It is steaming hot and a thunder-shower is\nthreatening. Every moment of work is precious. They have not wished to\nleave off working even to fetch water or kvas. A small boy, the grandson\nof the old woman, brings them water. The old woman is evidently anxious\nonly on one point,--not to be sent away from work. She does not let the\nrake out of her hands, and moves about with great difficulty. The little\nboy, quite bent under the jug with water, heavier than himself, walks\nwith short steps on his bare feet, and carries the jug with many shifts.\nThe little girl takes on her shoulders a load of hay which is also\nheavier than herself; walks a few paces, and stops, then throws it down,\nhaving no strength to carry it farther. The old man\'s wife rakes\ntogether unceasingly, her kerchief loosened from her disordered hair;\nshe carries the hay, breathing heavily and staggering under the burden:\nthe cobbler\'s mother is only raking, but this is also beyond her\nstrength; she slowly drags her feet, in baste shoes, and looks gloomily\nbefore her, like one very ill, or at the point of death. The old man\npurposely sends her far away from the others, to rake about the ricks,\nin order that she may not attempt to compete with them; but she does not\nleave off working, but continues with the same dead gloomy face as long\nas the others.\n\nThe sun is already setting behind the wood and the ricks are not yet in\norder: there is much still to be done.\n\nAll feel that it is time to leave off working but no one says so; each\nwaiting for the other to suggest it. At last, the cobbler, realizing\nthat he has no more strength left, proposes to the old man to leave the\nricks till to-morrow, and the old man agrees to it; and at once the\nwomen go to fetch their clothes, their jugs, their pitchforks; and the\nold woman sits down where she was standing, and then lays herself down\nwith the same fixed stare on her face. But as the women go away she gets\nup groaning, and, crawling along, follows them.\n\nLet us turn to the country-house. The same evening, when from the side\nof the village were heard the rattle of the scythes of the toil-worn\nmowers who were returning from work, the sounds of the hammer against\nthe anvil, the cries of women and girls who had just had time to put\naway their rakes, and were already running to drive the cattle in,--with\nthose blend other sounds from the country-house. Rattle, rattle, goes\nthe piano; a Hungarian song is heard through the noise of the\ncroquet-balls; before the stable an open carriage is standing harnessed\nwith four fat horses, which has been hired for twenty shillings to bring\nsome guests a distance of ten miles.\n\nHorses standing by the carriage rattle their little bells. Before them\nhay has been thrown, which they are scattering with their hoofs, the\nsame hay which the peasants have been gathering with such hard labour.\nIn the yard of this mansion there is movement; a healthy, well-fed\nfellow in a pink shirt, presented to him for his service as a\nhouse-porter, is calling the coachmen and telling them to harness and\nsaddle some horses. Two peasants who live here as coachmen come out of\ntheir room, and go in an easy manner, swinging their arms, to saddle\nhorses for the ladies and gentlemen. Still nearer to the house the\nsounds of another piano are heard. It is the music-mistress,--who lives\nin the family to teach the children,--practising her Schumann. The\nsounds of one piano jangle with those of another. Quite near the house\nwalk two nurses; one is young, another old; they lead and carry children\nto bed; these children are of the same age as those who ran from the\nvillage with jugs. One nurse is English: she cannot speak Russian. She\nwas engaged to come from England, not from being distinguished by some\npeculiar qualities but simply because she does not speak Russian.\nFarther on is another person, a French woman, who is also engaged\nbecause she does not know Russian. Farther on a peasant, with two women,\nis watering flowers near the house: another is cleaning a gun for one of\nthe young gentlemen. Here two women are carrying a basket with clean\nlinen,--they have been washing for all these gentlefolks. In the house\ntwo women have scarcely time to wash the plates and dishes after the\ncompany, who have just done eating; and two peasants in evening clothes\nare running up and down the stairs, serving coffee, tea, wine,\nseltzer-water, etc. Up-stairs a table is spread. One meal has just\nended, and another will soon begin, to continue till cock-crow and often\ntill morning dawns. Some are sitting smoking, playing cards; others are\nsitting and smoking, engaged in discussing liberal ideas of reform; and\nothers, again, walk to and fro, eat, smoke, and, not knowing what to do,\nhave made up their mind to take a drive.\n\nThe household consists of fifteen persons, healthy men and women; and\nthirty persons, healthy working-people, male and female, labour for\nthem. And this takes place there, where every hour, and each little boy,\nare precious.\n\nThis will be so, also, in July, when the peasants, not having had their\nsleep out, will mow the oats at night in order that it may not be lost,\nand the women will get up before dawn in order to finish their threshing\nin time; when this old woman, who had been exhausted during the harvest,\nand the women with child, and the little children will again all\noverwork themselves, and when there is a great want of hands, horses,\ncarts, in order to house this corn upon which all men feed, of which\nmillions of bushels are necessary in Russia in order that men should not\ndie: during even such a time, the idle lives of ladies and gentlemen\nwill go on. There will be private theatricals, picnics, hunting,\ndrinking, eating, piano-playing, singing, dancing,--in fact, incessant\norgies.\n\nHere, at least, it is impossible to find any excuse from the fact that\nall this had been going on before: nothing of the kind had been in\nexistence. We ourselves carefully create such a life, taking bread and\nlabour away from the work-worn people. We live sumptuously, as if there\nwere no connection whatever between the dying washerwoman,\nchild-prostitute, women worn out by making cigarettes and all the\nintense labour around us to which their unnourished strength is\ninadequate. We do not want to see the fact that if there were not our\nidle, luxurious, depraved lives, there would not be this labour,\ndisproportioned to the strength of people, and that if there were not\nthis labour we could not go on living in the same way.\n\nIt appears to us that their sufferings are one thing and our lives\nanother, and that we, living as we do, are innocent and pure as doves.\nWe read the description of the lives of the Romans, and wonder at the\ninhumanity of a heartless Lucullus, who gorged himself with fine dishes\nand delicious wines while people were starving: we shake our heads and\nwonder at the barbarism of our grandfathers,--the serf-owners,--who\nprovided themselves with orchestras and theatres, and employed whole\nvillages to keep up their gardens. From the height of our greatness we\nwonder at their inhumanity. We read the words of Isaiah\xc2\xa0v., 8:\n\n    "Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field,\n    till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of\n    the land.\n\n    Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may\n    follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine\n    inflame them!\n\n    The harp, and the lute, the tabret, the pipe, and wine are in their\n    feasts: but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither have they\n    considered the operation of his hands.\n\n    Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it\n    were with a cart rope.\n\n    Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness\n    for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and\n    sweet for bitter!\n\n    Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their\n    own sight!\n\n    Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to\n    mingle strong drink:\n\n    Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness\n    of the righteous from him."\n\nWe read these words, and it seems to us that they have nothing to do\nwith us.\n\nWe read in the Gospel, Matthew\xc2\xa0iii., 10: "And even now is the axe laid\nunto the root of the tree: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth\ngood fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire," and we are quite sure\nthat the good tree bearing good fruit is we ourselves, and that those\nwords are said, not to us, but to some other bad men.\n\nWe read the words of Isaiah\xc2\xa0vi., 10:\n\n    "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and\n    shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their\n    ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be\n    healed. Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities\n    be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land\n    become utterly waste."\n\nWe read, and are quite assured that this wonderful thing has not\nhappened to us, but to some other people. For this very reason we do not\nsee that this has happened to us, and is taking place with us. We do not\nhear, we do not see, and do not understand with our heart.\n\nBut why has it so happened?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nHow can a man who considers himself to be,--we will not say a Christian\nor an educated and humane man,--but simply a man not entirely devoid of\nreason and of conscience,--how can he, I say, live in such a way, taking\nno part in the struggle of all mankind for life, only swallowing up the\nlabour of others struggling for existence, and by his own claims\nincreasing the labour of those who struggle and the number of those who\nperish in the struggle?\n\nSuch men abound in our so-called Christian and cultured world; and not\nonly do they abound in our world but the very ideal of the men of our\nChristian, cultured world, is to get the largest amount of\nproperty,--that is, wealth,--which secures all comforts and idleness of\nlife by freeing its possessors from the struggle for existence, and\nenabling them, as much as possible, to profit by the labour of those\nbrothers of theirs who perish in that struggle.\n\nHow could men have fallen into such astounding error?\n\nHow could they have come to such a state that they can neither see nor\nhear nor understand with their heart what is so clear, obvious, and\ncertain?\n\nOne need only think for a moment in order to be terrified at the way our\nlives contradict what we profess to believe, whether we be Christian or\nonly humane educated people. Whether it be God or a law of nature that\ngoverns the world and men, good or bad, the position of men in this\nworld, so long as we know it has always been such that naked\nmen,--without wool on their bodies, without holes in which to take\nrefuge, without food which they might find in the field like Robinson\nCrusoe on his island,--are put into a position of continual and\nincessant struggle with nature in order to cover their bodies by making\nclothes for themselves, to protect themselves by a roof over their\nheads, and to earn food in order twice or thrice a day to satisfy their\nhunger and that of their children and their parents.\n\nWherever and whenever and to whatever extent we observe the lives of\nmen, whether in Europe, America, China, or Russia; whether we take into\nconsideration all mankind or a small portion, whether in olden times in\na nomad state, or in modern times with steam-engines, steam-ploughs,\nsewing-machines, and electric light,--we shall see one and the same\nthing going on,--that men, working constantly and incessantly, are not\nable to get clothes, shelter, and food for themselves, their little\nones, and the old, and that the greatest number of men in olden times as\nwell as now, perish slowly from want of the necessaries of life and from\noverwork.\n\nWherever we may live, if we draw a circle around us of a hundred\nthousand, or a thousand or ten, or even one mile\'s circumference, and\nlook at the lives of those men who are inside our circle, we shall find\nhalf-starved children, old people male and female, pregnant women, sick\nand weak persons, working beyond their strength, who have neither food\nnor rest enough to support them, and who, for this reason, die before\ntheir time: we shall see others full-grown who are even being killed by\ndangerous and hurtful tasks.\n\nSince the world has existed we find that with great efforts, sufferings,\nand privations men have been struggling for their common wants, and have\nnot been able to overcome the difficulty.\n\nBesides, we also know that every one of us, wherever and however he may\nlive, _nolens volens_, is every day, and every hour of the day,\nabsorbing for himself a part of the labour performed by mankind.\n\nWherever and however a man lives, the roof over his head did not grow of\nitself; the firewood in his stove did not get there of itself; the water\ndid not come of itself either; and the baked bread does not fall down\nfrom the sky; his dinner, his clothes, and the covering for his feet,\nall this has been made for him, not only by men of past generations,\nlong dead, but it is being done for him now by those men of whom\nhundreds and thousands are fainting away and dying in vain efforts to\nget for themselves and for their children sufficient shelter, food, and\nclothes,--means to save themselves and their children from suffering and\na premature death.\n\nAll men are struggling with want. They are struggling so intensely that\naround them always their brethren, fathers, mothers, children, are\nperishing. Men in this world are like those on a dismantled or\nwater-logged ship with a short allowance of food; all are put by God, or\nby nature, in such a position that they must husband their food and\nunceasingly war with want.\n\nEach interruption in this work of every one of us, each absorption of\nthe labour of others which is useless for the common welfare, is\nruinous, alike for us and them.\n\nHow is it that the majority of educated people, without labouring, are\nquietly absorbing the labours of others which are necessary for their\nown lives, and are considering such an existence quite natural and\nreasonable?\n\nIf we are to free ourselves from the labour proper and natural to all\nand lay it on others, and yet not at the same time consider ourselves\ntraitors and thieves, we can do so only by two suppositions,--first,\nthat we (the men who take no part in common labour) are different beings\nfrom working-men and have a peculiar destiny to fulfil in society (like\ndrone-bees, or queen-bees, which have a different function from the\nworking-bees); or secondly, that the business which we (the men freed\nfrom the struggle for existence) are doing for other men is so useful\nfor all that it undoubtedly compensates for that harm which we do to\nothers in overburdening them.\n\nIn olden times men who lived by the labour of others asserted, first,\nthat they belonged to a different race; and secondly, that they had from\nGod a peculiar mission,--caring for the welfare of others; in other\nwords, to govern and teach them: and therefore, they assured others, and\npartly believed themselves, that the business they did was more useful\nand more important for the people than those labours by which they\nprofit. This justification was sufficient so long as the direct\ninterference of God in human affairs, and the inequality of human races,\nwas not doubted.\n\nBut with Christianity and that consciousness of the equality and unity\nof all men which proceeds from it, this justification could no longer be\nexpressed in its previous form.\n\nIt was no longer possible to assert that men are born of different kind\nand quality and have a different destiny; and the old justification,\nthough still held by some, has been little by little destroyed and has\nnow almost entirely disappeared.\n\nBut though the justification disappeared, the fact itself,--of the\nfreeing of some men from labour, and the appropriation by them of other\nmen\'s labour, remained the same for those who had the power to enforce\nit. For this existing fact new excuses have constantly been invented, in\norder that without asserting the difference of human beings, men might\nbe able with apparent justice to free themselves from personal labour.\n\nA great many justifications have been invented. However strange it may\nseem, the main object of all that has been called science, and the\nruling tendency of science, has been to seek out such excuses.\n\nThis has been the object of the theological sciences and of the science\nof law: this was the object of so-called philosophy, and this became\nlately the object of modern rationalistic science, however strange it\nappears to us, the contemporaries, who use this justification.\n\nAll the theological subtleties which aimed at proving that a certain\nchurch is the only true successor of Christ, and that, therefore, she\nalone has full and uncontrolled power over the souls and bodies of men,\nhad in view this very object.\n\nAll the legal sciences,--those of state law, penal law, civil law, and\ninternational law,--have this sole aim.\n\nThe majority of philosophical theories, especially that of Hegel, which\nreigned over the minds of men for such a long time, and maintained the\nassertion that everything which exists is reasonable, and that the state\nis a necessary form of the development of human personality, had only\nthis one object in view.\n\nComte\'s positive philosophy and its outcome, the doctrine that mankind\nis an organism; Darwin\'s doctrine of the struggle for existence,\ndirecting life and its conclusion, the theory of the diversity of human\nraces, the anthropology now so popular, biology, and sociology,--all\nhave the same aim. These sciences have become favourites, because they\nall serve for the justification of the existing fact of some men being\nable to free themselves from the human duty of labour, and to consume\nother men\'s labour.\n\nAll these theories, as is always the case, are worked out in the\nmysterious sanctums of augurs, and in vague, unintelligible expressions\nare spread abroad among the masses and adopted by them.\n\nAs in olden times the subtleties of theology, which justified violence\nin church and state, were the special property of priests; and among the\nmasses of the people, the conclusions, taken by faith, and ready made\nfor them, were circulated, that the power of kings, clergy and nobility\nwas sacred: so afterwards, the philosophical and legal subtleties of\nso-called science became the property of the priests of science; and\nthrough the masses only the ready-made conclusion, accepted by\nfaith,--that social order (the organization of society) must be such as\nit is, and cannot be otherwise,--was diffused.\n\nSo it is now. It is only in the sanctuaries of the modern sages that the\nlaws of life and the development of organisms are analyzed. Whereas in\nthe crowd, the ready-made conclusion, accepted on trust,--that division\nof labour is a law confirmed by science, and therefore it must be that\nsome starve and toil and others eternally feast, and that this very ruin\nof some and feasting of others is the undoubted law of man\'s life, to\nwhich we must submit,--is circulated.\n\nThe current justification of their idleness by all so-called educated\npeople, with their various activities, from the railway proprietor down\nto the author or artist, is this: We men who have freed ourselves from\nthe common human duty of taking part in the struggle for existence, are\nfurthering progress, and so we are of great use to all human society, of\nsuch use that we counterbalance all the harm we do the people by\nconsuming their labour.\n\nThis reasoning seems to the men of our day to be not at all like the\nreasoning by which the former non-workers justified themselves; just as\nthe reasoning of the Roman emperors and citizens, that but for them the\ncivilized world would go to ruin, seemed to them to be of quite another\norder from that of the Egyptians and Persians; and so also an exactly\nsimilar kind of reasoning seemed in turn to the knights and clergy of\nthe Middle Ages totally different from that of the Romans.\n\nBut it only _seems_. One need only reflect on the justification of our\ntime in order to ascertain that there is nothing new in it. It is only a\nlittle differently dressed up, but it is the same because it is based on\nthe same principle. Every justification of one man\'s consumption of the\nlabour of others, while producing none himself, as with Pharaoh and his\nsoothsayers, the emperors of Rome and those of the Middle Ages and their\ncitizens, knights, priests, and clergy, always consists in these two\nassertions: First, we take the labour of the masses because we are\ndifferent from others, people called by God to govern them and to teach\nthem divine truths: Secondly, those who compose the masses cannot be\njudges of the measure of labour which we take from them for the good we\ndo for them, because, as it has been said by the Pharisees, "This\nmultitude which knoweth not the law are accursed" (John\xc2\xa0vii. 49).\n\nThe people do not understand what is for their good, and therefore they\ncannot be judges of the benefits done to them. The justification of our\ntime, notwithstanding all apparent originality, consists in facts of the\nsame fundamental assertions: First, we are a different people,--we are\nan educated people,--we further progress and civilization, and by this\nfact we procure for the masses a great advantage. Secondly, the\nuneducated crowd does not understand the advantages we procure for them,\nand therefore cannot be judges of them.\n\nThe fundamental assertions are the same. We free ourselves from labour,\nappropriate the labour of others, and by this increase the burden of our\nfellows; and then assert that in compensation for this we bring them a\ngreat advantage, of which they, owing to ignorance, cannot be judges.\n\nIs it not, then, the same thing? The only difference lies in this: that\nformerly the claims on other men\'s labour were made by citizens, Roman\npriests, knights, and nobility, and now these claims are put forward by\na caste who term themselves educated.\n\nThe lie is the same, because the men who justify themselves are in the\nsame false position. The lie consists in the fact, that, before\nbeginning to reason about the advantages conferred on the workers by\npeople who have freed themselves from labour,--certain men, Pharaohs,\npriests, or we ourselves, educated people, assume this position first,\nand only afterwards manufacture a justification for it.\n\nThe very position universally serves as a basis for the justification.\nThe difference of our justification from the ancient ones consists\nmerely in the fact that it is more false and less well grounded. The old\nemperors and popes, if they themselves, and the people, believed in\ntheir divine calling, could easily explain why they were to control the\nlabour of others: they asserted that they were appointed by God himself\nfor this very thing, and from God they had a commandment to teach the\npeople divine truths revealed to them, and to govern them.\n\nBut modern, educated men, who do not labour with their hands, and who\nacknowledge the equality of all men, cannot explain why they and their\nchildren (for education is only by money; that is, by power) should be\nthose lucky persons called to an easy, idle life, out of those millions\nwho by hundreds and thousands are perishing to make it possible for them\nto be educated. Their only justification consists in this, that, just as\nthey are, instead of doing harm to the workers by freeing themselves\nfrom labour, and by swallowing up labour, they bring to the people some\nadvantages, unintelligible to them, which compensate for all the evil\nthey perpetrate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nThe theory by which men who have freed themselves from personal labour\njustify themselves, is, in its simplest and most exact form, this: "We\nmen, having freed ourselves from work, and having by violence\nappropriated the labour of others, we find ourselves better able to\nbenefit them." In other words, certain men, for doing the people a\npalpable and comprehensible harm,--utilizing their labour by violence,\nand thereby increasing the difficulty of their struggles with\nnature,--do to them an impalpable and incomprehensible good. This is a\nvery strange proposition; but the men, both of former as well of modern\ntimes, who have lived on the labour of workmen, believe it, and calm\ntheir conscience by it.\n\nLet us see in what way it is justified, in different classes of men who\nhave freed themselves from labour in our own days.\n\n"I serve men by my activity in church or state,--as king, minister,\narchbishop; I serve men by my trading or by industry; I serve men by my\nactivity in the departments of science or art. By our activities we are\nall as necessary to the people as they are to us."\n\nSo say various men of to-day who have freed themselves from labour.\n\nLet us consider _seriatim_ the principles upon which they base the\nusefulness of their activity.\n\nThere are only two indications of the usefulness of any activity of one\nman for another: (1) an exterior indication,--the acknowledgement of the\nutility of the activity by those to whom it is applied; and (2) an\ninterior indication,--the desire to be of use to others lying at the\nroot of the activity of the one who is trying to be of use.\n\nStatesmen (I include the Church dignitaries appointed by the government\nin the category of statesmen) are, it is said, of use to those whom they\ngovern. The emperor, the king, the president of a republic, the prime\nminister, the minister of justice, the minister of war, the minister of\npublic instruction, the bishop, and all under them who serve the state,\nall live free from the struggle of mankind for existence, having laid\nall the burden of this struggle on someone else, on the ground that\ntheir non-activity compensates for this.\n\nLet us apply the first indication to those for whose welfare the\nactivity of statesmen is bestowed. Do they, I ask, recognize the\nusefulness of this activity?\n\nYes, it is recognized. Most men consider statesmanship necessary to\nthem. The majority recognize the usefulness of this activity in\nprinciple; but in all its manifestations known to us, in all\n_particular_ cases known to us, the usefulness of each of the\ninstitutions and of each of the manifestations of this activity is not\nonly denied by those for whose advantage it is performed, but they\nassert that it is even pernicious and hurtful. There is no state\nfunction or social activity which is not considered by many men to be\nhurtful: there is no institution which is not considered\npernicious,--courts of justice, banks, local self-government, police,\nclergy. Every state activity, from the minister down to the policeman,\nfrom the bishop to the sexton, is considered by some men to be useful\nand by others to be pernicious. And this is the case not only in Russia\nbut throughout the world; in France as well as in America.\n\nThe activity of the republican party is considered pernicious by the\nradical party, and _vice versa_: the activity of the radical party, if\nthe power is in their hands, is considered bad by the republican and\nother parties. But not only is it a fact that the activity of statesmen\nis never considered by all men to be useful, this activity has, besides,\nthis peculiarity, that it must always be carried out by violence, and\nthat, to attain its end, murders, executions, prisons, taxes raised by\nforce, and so on, became necessary.\n\nIt appears therefore that besides the fact that the usefulness of state\nactivity is not recognized by all men, and is always denied by one\nportion of men, this usefulness has the peculiarity of vindicating\nitself always by violence.\n\nTherefore the usefulness of state activity cannot be confirmed by the\nfirst indication,--i.e., the fact that it is recognized by those men for\nwhom it is said to be performed.\n\nLet us apply the second test. Let us ask statesmen themselves, from the\nTsar down to the policeman, from the president to the secretary, from\nthe patriarch to the sexton, begging for a sincere answer, whether, in\noccupying their respective positions they have in view the good which\nthey wish to do for men or something else. In their desire to fill the\nsituation of a Tsar, a president, a minister, a police-sergeant, a\nsexton, a teacher, are they moved by the desire of being useful to men\nor for their own personal advantage? And the answer of sincere men would\nbe that their chief motive is their own personal advantage.\n\nSo it appears that one class of men, who live by the labour of some\nothers who are perishing by these labours, compensate for this\nindubitable evil by an activity which is always considered by a great\nmany men to be not only useless, but pernicious; which cannot be\naccepted voluntarily, but to which men must always be compelled, and the\naim of which is not the benefit of others but the personal advantage of\nthe men who perform it.\n\nWhat is it, then, that confirms the theory that state activity is useful\nfor humanity? Only the fact that the men who perform it firmly profess\nto believe it to be useful, and that it has been always in existence.\nBut so some not only useless, but very pernicious institutions, like\nslavery, prostitution, and wars, have always been in existence.\n\nBusiness people (merchants, manufacturers, railway proprietors, bankers,\nland-owners) believe that they do a good which compensates for the harm\nundoubtedly done by them. On what grounds do they believe this? To the\nquestion, By whom is the usefulness of their activity recognized? men in\nchurch and in state are able to point to the thousands and millions of\nworking-people who in principle recognize the usefulness of state and\nchurch activity. But to whom will bankers, distillers, manufacturers of\nvelvet, of bronzes, of looking-glasses, to say nothing of guns,--to whom\nwill they point when we ask them, Is their usefulness recognized by\npublic opinion?\n\nIf men can be found who recognize the usefulness of manufacturing\nchintzes, rails, beer, and such like things, there will be found also a\nstill greater number of men who consider the manufacture of these\narticles pernicious.\n\nAs for the merchants whose activity is confined to prices, and\nland-owners, nobody would even attempt to justify them.\n\nBesides, this activity is always associated with harm to working-people,\nand with violence, which, if less direct than that of the state, is yet\njust as cruel in its consequences. For the activities displayed in\nindustry and in trade are entirely based on taking advantage of the\nwants of working-people in every form in order to compel them to hard\nand hated labour; to buying cheap, and to selling necessaries at the\nhighest possible price and to raising the interest on money. From\nwhatever point we consider this activity we can see that the usefulness\nof business-men is not recognised by those for whom it is expended,\nneither generally nor in particular cases; and by the majority their\nactivity is considered to be directly pernicious.\n\nIf we were to apply the second test and to ask, What is the chief motive\nof the activity of business-men? we should receive a still more\ndeterminate answer than that on the activity of statesmen. If a\nstatesman says that besides a personal advantage he has in view the\ncommon benefit, we cannot help believing him, and each of us knows such\nmen. But a business-man, from the very nature of his occupations cannot\nhave in view a common advantage, and would be ridiculous in the sight of\nhis fellows if he were in his business aiming at something besides\nincreasing his wealth and keeping it.\n\nAnd, therefore, working-people do not consider the activity of\nbusiness-men of any advantage to them. Their activity is associated with\nviolence; and its object is not their good but always and only personal\nadvantage; and yet, strange to say, these business-men are so assured of\ntheir own usefulness that they boldly, for the sake of their imaginary\ngood, do an undoubted, obvious harm to workmen by extricating themselves\nfrom labour, and consuming the produce of the working-classes.\n\nScientists and artists have also freed themselves from labour by putting\nit on others, and live with a quiet conscience believing that they bring\nsufficient advantages to other men to compensate for it. On what is this\nassurance based? Let us ask them as we have done statesmen and\nbusiness-men. Is the utility of the arts and sciences recognized by all,\nor even by the majority, of working-people?\n\nWe shall receive a very sad answer. The activity of men in the State\nChurch and government offices is recognized to be useful in theory by\nalmost all, and in application by the majority of those for whom it is\nperformed. The activity of business-men is recognized only by those who\nare engaged in it or who desire to practise it. Those who bear on their\nshoulders all the labour of life and who feed and clothe the scientists\nand artists cannot recognize the usefulness of the activity of these men\nbecause they cannot even form an idea about an activity which always\nappears to workmen useless and even depraving.\n\nThus, without any exception, working-people think the same about\nuniversities, libraries, conservatories, picture and statue galleries,\nand theatres, which are built at their expense.\n\nA workman considers this activity so decidedly pernicious that he does\nnot send his children to be taught; and in order to compel people to\naccept this activity it has everywhere been found necessary to introduce\na law compelling parents to send the children to school.\n\nA workman always looks at this activity with ill-will, and only ceases\nto look at it so when he ceases to be a workman, and through gain and\nso-called education passes out of the class of working-people into the\nclass of men who live on the neck of others.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the usefulness of the activity of\nscientists and artists is not recognized and even cannot be recognized\nby any workman, these men are, all the same, compelled to make\nsacrifices for such an activity.\n\nA statesman simply sends another to the guillotine or to prison; a\nbusiness-man, utilizing the labour of someone else, takes from him his\nlast resource, leaving him the alternative of starvation or labour\ndestructive to his health and life: but a man of science or of art\nseemingly compels nobody to do anything; he merely offers the good he\nhas done to those who are willing to take it; but, to be able to make\nhis productions undesirable to the working-people, he takes away from\nthem by violence, through the statesmen, a great part of their labour\nfor the building and keeping open of academies, universities, colleges,\nschools, museums, libraries, conservatories, and for the wages for\nhimself and his fellows.\n\nBut if we were to ask the scientists and artists the object which they\nare pursuing in their activity, we should receive the most astonishing\nreplies.\n\nA statesman would answer that his aim was the common welfare; and in his\nanswer, there would be an admixture of truth confirmed by public\nopinion.\n\nIn the answer of the business-man, there would be less probability; but\nwe could admit even this also.\n\nBut the answer of the scientists and artists strikes one at once by its\nwant of proof and by its effrontery. Such men say, without bringing any\nproofs (just as priests used to do in olden times) that their activity\nis the most important of all, and that without it mankind would go to\nruin. They assert that it is so, notwithstanding the fact that nobody\nexcept themselves either understands or acknowledges their activity, and\nnotwithstanding the fact that, according to their own definition, true\nscience and true art should not have a utilitarian aim.\n\nThese men are occupied with the matter they like, without troubling\nthemselves what advantage will come out of it to men; and they are\nalways assured that they are doing the most important and the most\nnecessary thing for all mankind.\n\nSo that while a sincere statesman, acknowledging that the chief motive\nof his activity is a personal one, tries to be as useful as possible to\nthe working-people; while a business-man, acknowledging the egotism of\nhis activity, tries to give it an appearance of being one of universal\nutility,--men of science and art do not consider it necessary even to\nseem to shelter themselves under a pretence of usefulness, they deny\neven the object of usefulness, so sure are they, not only of the\nusefulness but even of the sacredness of their own business.\n\nSo it turns out that the third class of men who have freed themselves\nfrom labour and laid it on others, are occupied with things which are\ntotally incomprehensible to the working-people, and which these people\nconsider trifles and often very pernicious trifles; and are occupied\nwith these things without any consideration of their usefulness but\nmerely for the gratification of their own pleasure: it turns out that\nthese men are, from some reason or other, quite assured that their\nactivity will always produce that without which the work-people would\nnever be able to exist.\n\nMen have freed themselves from labouring for their living and have\nthrown the work upon others who perish under it: they utilize this\nlabour and assert that their occupations, which are incomprehensible to\nall other men, and which are not directed to useful aims, compensate for\nall the evil they are doing to men by freeing themselves from the\ntrouble of earning their livelihood and by swallowing up the labour of\nothers.\n\nThe statesman, to compensate for the undoubted and obvious evil which he\ndoes to man by freeing himself from the struggle with nature and by\nappropriating the labour of others, does men another obvious and\nundoubted harm by countenancing all sorts of violence.\n\nThe business-man, to compensate for the undoubted and obvious harm which\nhe does to men by using up their labour, tries to earn for himself as\nmuch wealth as possible; that is, as much of other men\'s labour as\npossible.\n\nThe man of science and art, in compensating for the same undoubted and\nobvious harm which he does to working-people, is occupied with matters\nto which he feels attracted and which are quite incomprehensible to\nwork-people, and which, according to his own assertion, in order to be\ntrue, ought not to aim at usefulness.\n\nTherefore, all these men are quite sure that their right of utilizing\nother men\'s labour is secure. Yet it seems obvious that all those men\nwho have freed themselves from the labour of earning their livelihood\nhave no justification for doing so.\n\nBut, strange to say, these men firmly believe in their own\nrighteousness, and live as they do with an easy conscience.\n\nThere must be some plausible ground, some false belief, at the bottom of\nsuch a profound error.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nIn reality, the position in which men who live by other men\'s labour are\nplaced, is based not only on a certain belief but on an entire doctrine;\nand not only on one doctrine but on three, which have grown one upon\nanother during centuries and are now fused together into an awful\ndeceit,--or humbug as the English call it,--which hides from men their\nunrighteousness.\n\nThe oldest of these, which justifies the treason of men against the\nfundamental duty of labour to earn their own living, was the\nChurch-Christian doctrine, which asserts that men by the will of God\ndiffer one from another as the sun differs from the moon and the stars,\nand as one star differs from another. Some men God has ordained to have\ndominion over all, others to have power over many, others, still, over a\nfew, and the remainder are ordained by God to obey.\n\nThis doctrine, though already shaken to its foundations, still continues\nto influence some men, so that many who do not accept it, who often even\nignore the existence of it, are, nevertheless, guided by it.\n\nThe second is what I cannot help terming the State-philosophical\ndoctrine. According to this, as fully developed by Hegel, everything\nthat exists is reasonable, and the established order of life is\nconstant, and is sustained not merely by men, but as the only possible\nform of the manifestation of the spirit, or, generally, of the life of\nmankind.\n\nThis doctrine, too, is no longer accepted by the men who direct social\nopinion, and it holds its position only by the power of inertia.\n\nThe last doctrine, which is now ruling the minds of men and on which is\nbased the justification of leading statesmen, men of business, and\nscience and art, is a scientific one, not in the evident sense of the\nword (meaning knowledge generally), but in the sense of a knowledge\npeculiar in form as well as in matter, termed _Science_. On this new\ndoctrine, the justification of man\'s idleness and the hiding from him\nhis treason against his calling, is particularly based.\n\nThis doctrine appeared in Europe contemporaneously with a large class of\nrich and idle people who served neither the church nor the state and who\nwere in want of a justification of their position.\n\nNot very long ago, before the French revolution in Europe, all\nnon-working people, in order to have a right to utilize other men\'s\nlabour, were obliged to have some definite occupation,--to serve in the\nchurch, the state, or the army.\n\nThe men who served the government, "governed the people"; those who\nserved the church, "taught the people divine truths"; and those who\nserved the army, "protected the people."\n\nOnly these three classes of men--the clergy, the statesmen, and the\nmilitary men--claimed for themselves the right of utilizing labour, and\nthey could always point out their services to the people: the remaining\nrich men who had not this justification, were despised, and, feeling\ntheir own want of right, were ashamed of their wealth and their\nidleness. But as time went on, this class of rich people, who belonged\nneither to the clergy, to the government, nor to the army, owing to the\nvices of these other three classes, increased in number and became a\npowerful party. They were in want of a justification of their position.\nAnd one was invented for them. A century had not elapsed before the men\nwho served neither the State nor the Church and took no part whatever in\ntheir affairs, received the same right to live on labour as the former\nclasses; and they not only left off being ashamed of their wealth and\nidleness but began to consider their position quite justified. And the\nnumber of such men has increased, and is still increasing in our days.\n\nThe most wonderful of all is this, that these men whose claims to be\nfreed from labour were unrecognized not long ago, now consider\nthemselves alone to be fully right and are attacking the former three\nclasses,--the servants of the Church, State, and Army,--alleging their\nexemption from labour to be unjust and often even considering their\nactivity directly pernicious. What is still more wonderful is this, that\nthe former servants of Church, State, and Army, do not now lean on the\ndivinity of their calling, nor even on the philosophy which considers\nthe state necessary for individual development, but setting aside these\nsupports which have so long maintained them, they are now seeking the\nsame supports on which the new reigning class of men, who have found a\nnovel justification, stand, and at the head of which are the men of\nScience and Art.\n\nIf a statesman now sometimes, appealing to old memories, justifies his\nposition by the fact that he was set in it by God, or by the fact that\nthe state is a form of the development of personality, he does it\nbecause he is behind the age, and he feels that nobody believes him.\n\nIn order to justify himself effectually, he ought to find now neither\ntheological nor philosophical but new and scientific supports.\n\nIt is necessary to point to the principle of nationalities, or to that\nof the development of an organism; and to gain over the ruling class, as\nin the Middle Ages it was necessary to gain over the clergy; and as at\nthe end of the last century, it was necessary to obtain the sanction of\nphilosophers, as seen in the case of Frederick the Great and Catherine\nof Russia. If now a rich man, after the old fashion, says sometimes that\nit is God\'s providence which makes him rich, or if he points to the\nimportance of a nobility for the welfare of a state, he does it because\nhe is behind the times.\n\nIn order to justify himself completely he must point to the way he\nfurthers progress by improving the modes of production, by lowering the\nprices of consumption, by establishing intercourse between nations. A\nrich man must think and speak in scientific language, and, like the\nclergy formerly, he must offer sacrifices to the ruling class: he must\npublish magazines and books, provide himself with a picture-gallery, a\nmusical society, a kindergarten or technical school. The ruling class is\nthe class of learned men and artists of a definite character. They\npossess the complete justification for having freed themselves from\nlabour; and on this justification (as in former times on the theological\njustification, and afterwards on the philosophical one) everything is\nbased: and it is these men who now give the diploma of exemption to\nother classes.\n\nThe class of men who now feel completely justified in freeing themselves\nfrom labour, is that of men of science, and particularly of\nexperimental, positive, critical, evolutional science, and of artists\nwho develop their ideas according to the same tendency.\n\nIf a learned man or an artist of the old style speaks nowadays about\nprophecy, revelation, or the manifestation of the spirit, he does so\nbecause he is behind the age, and he will not succeed in justifying\nhimself: to stand firm he must try to associate his activity with\nexperimental, positive, critical science, and he must make this science\nthe fundamental principle of his activity. Only then will the science or\nthe art with which he is occupied appear true, and he will stand on firm\nground, and then there will be no doubt as to his usefulness to mankind.\nThe justification of all who have freed themselves from labour is now\nbased upon this experimental, critical, positive science.\n\nThe theological and philosophical explanations have had their day: now\nthey timidly and bashfully introduce themselves to notice and try to\nhumour their scientific usurper, who, however, boldly knocks down and\ndestroys the remnants of the past, everywhere taking its place, and,\nassured of its own firmness, lifts aloft its head.\n\n_The theological justification_ maintained that men are\npredestined,--some to govern, others to obey; some to live sumptuously,\nothers to labour: and therefore those who believed in the revelation of\nGod could not doubt the lawfulness of the position of those men, who, by\nthe will of God, are called to govern and to be rich.\n\n_The state-philosophical justification_ used to say, "The state with all\nits institutions and differences of classes according to rights and\npossessions, is that historical form which is necessary for the right\nmanifestation of the spirit in mankind; and therefore the situation\nwhich everyone occupies in state and in society according to his rights\nand to his possessions must be such as to ensure the sound life of\nmankind."\n\n_The scientific theory_ says, "All this is nonsense and superstition:\nthe one is the fruit of the theological period of thought, and the other\nof the metaphysical period. To study the laws of the life of human\nsocieties, there is only one sure method,--that of a positive,\nexperimental, critical science. It is only sociology, based on biology,\nin its turn based on all the other positive sciences, which is able to\ngive us new laws for the life of mankind. Mankind, or human societies,\nare organisms either already perfect, or in a state of development\nsubject to the laws of the evolution of organisms. One of the first of\nthese laws is the division of labour among the portions of the organs.\nIf some men govern and others obey, some live in opulence and others in\nwant, then this is so, neither according to the will of God nor because\nthe state is the form of the manifestation of personality, but because\nin societies as in organisms a division of labour takes place which is\nnecessary for the life of the whole. Some men perform in societies the\nmuscular part of labour, and others, the mental."\n\nOn this doctrine is built the ruling excuse of the age.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nChrist teaches men in a new way, and this teaching is written down in\nthe Gospels.\n\nIt is first persecuted, and not accepted. Then the fables of the fall of\nman, and of the first angel, are invented, and these fables are believed\nto be the teaching of Christ. The fables are absurd, they have no\nfoundation whatever, but by virtue of them men are led to believe that\nthey may continue to live in an evil way, and none the less consider\nthemselves as saved by Christ. This conclusion is so agreeable to the\nmass of weak men who have no affection for moral effort, that the system\nis eagerly accepted, not only as true, but even as the Divine truth as\nrevealed by God himself. And the invention becomes the groundwork on\nwhich for centuries theologians build their theories.\n\nThen by degrees these learned men diverge by various channels into\nspecial systems of their own, and finally endeavour to overthrow each\nother\'s theories. They begin to feel there is something amiss, and cease\nto understand what they themselves are talking about. But the crowd\nstill requires them to expound its favourite instruction; and thus the\ntheologians, pretending both to understand and believe what they are\nsaying, continue to dispense it.\n\nIn process of time, however, the conclusions drawn from theological\nconceptions cease to be necessary to the masses, who, then, peeping into\nthe very sanctuaries of their augurs, discover them to be utterly void\nof those glorious and indubitable truths which the mysteries of theology\nhad seemed to be, and see instead that there is nothing there but crude\ndeception, and they marvel at their own blindness.\n\nThe same happened to philosophy, not in the sense of the wisdom of men\nlike Confucius or Epictetus, but with professional philosophy which\nhumoured the instincts of the crowd of rich and idle people. Not long\nago a moral philosophy was in fashion in the learned world, according to\nwhich it appeared that everything that is, is reasonable; that there is\nneither good nor evil; that man has not to struggle with evil, but has\nmerely to manifest the spirit of the age, some in military service, some\nin courts of justice, and some on the violin.\n\nMany and various were the expressions of human wisdom known to the men\nof the nineteenth century,--of Rousseau, Pascal, Lessing, and Spinoza;\nand all the wisdom of antiquity was expounded, but none of its systems\nlaid hold of the crowd. We cannot say that Hegel\'s success was due to\nthe harmony of his theory. We had no less harmonious theories from\nDescartes, Leibnitz, Fichte, and Schopenhauer.\n\nThere was only one reason for the fact that this doctrine became for a\nshort time the belief of the civilized world, the same reason that\ncaused the success of the theory of the fall and redemption of man; to\nwit, that the deductions of this philosophical theory humoured the weak\nside of men\'s nature. It said, "All is reasonable, all is good; nobody\nis to blame for any thing."\n\nAs at first with the church upon theological foundations, so also, with\nthe philosophy of Hegel for a base, a Babel\'s tower was built (some who\nare behind the age are still sitting upon it); and here again was a\nconfusion of tongues, men feeling that they themselves did not know of\nwhat they were talking, but were trying to conceal their ignorance and\nkeep up their prestige before the crowd; and here again the masses found\nconfirmation of their accepted teachings, and believed that whatever\nmight seem to them bewildering and contradictory is as clear as\nday-light on philosophic altitudes. In the same way, the time came when\nthis doctrine wore out and a new one replaced it. It had become useless,\nand the crowd peeped into the mysterious temples of the teachers, and\nsaw there was nothing there--nor ever had been, but obscure and\nunmeaning words. I have seen this in my own day.\n\nWhen I began life, Hegelianism was the order of the day; it was in the\nvery air you breathed; it found its expression in newspapers and\nmagazines, in lectures on history and on law, in novels, in tracts, in\nart, in sermons, in conversation. A man who did not know Hegel had no\nright to open his mouth; those who desired to learn the truth were\nstudying Hegel,--every thing pointed to him; and lo! forty years have\nelapsed and nothing is left of him; there is no remembrance of him; all\nis as though he had never existed. And the most remarkable of all is,\nthat just as false Christianity, so also Hegelianism has fallen, not\nbecause someone refuted or overthrew it; no, it is now as it was before,\nbut both have only become no longer necessary for the learned, educated\nworld.\n\nIf at the present time we speak to any man of modern culture about the\nfall of the angel, of Adam, about atonement, he does not argue or\ndeny;--he simply asks, amazed, "What angel? Adam? What for? What\natonement? What is all this to me?"\n\nSo also with Hegelianism. No one of our day will argue its theses. He\nwill only inquire, "What Spirit?" "Where did it come from?" "With what\npurpose?" "What good will it do me?" Not very long ago the sages of\nHegelianism were solemnly teaching the crowd; and the crowd,\nunderstanding nothing, blindly believed all, finding the confirmation of\nwhat suited them, and thinking that what seemed to them to be not quite\nclear or even contradictory, was clearer than day on the heights of\nphilosophy: but time went on, the theory was worn out, a new one\nappeared in its place, the former one was no longer demanded, and again\nthe crowd looked into the mysterious temples of the augurs and saw there\nwas nothing there, and that nothing had ever been there but words, very\ndark and meaningless.\n\nThis happened within my memory. These things happened, we are told,\nbecause they were ravings of the theological and metaphysical period,\nbut now we have a critical, positive science which will not deceive us,\nbecause it is based upon induction and experience; now our knowledge is\nno longer uncertain as it formerly was, and it is only by following it\nthat one can find the answer to all the questions of life.\n\nBut this is exactly what was said by the old teachers, and they\ncertainly were no fools, and we know that among them were men of immense\nintellect; and within my memory the disciples of Hegel said exactly the\nsame thing, with no less assurance and no less acknowledgment on the\nside of the crowd of so-called educated people. And such men as our\nHerzen, Stankievich, Bylinsky, were no fools either. But why, then, has\nthis wonderful thing happened, that clever men preached with the\ngreatest assurance and the crowd accepted with veneration, only\ngroundless and meaningless doctrines? The reason is only that these\ndoctrines justified men in their bad mode of living.\n\nA very commonplace English writer, whose books are now almost forgotten\nand recognized as the emptiest of all empty ones, wrote a tract upon\npopulation, in which he invented an imaginary law that the means of\nliving do not increase with the increase of population. This sham law\nthe author dressed out with the formul\xc3\xa6 of mathematics which have no\nfoundation whatever, and published it. Judged by the lightness of mind\nand the want of talent displayed in this treatise we might have supposed\nthat it would have passed unnoticed and been forgotten as all other\nwritings of the same author have been; but it turned out quite\ndifferently. The author who wrote it became at once a scientific\nauthority, and has maintained this position for nearly half a century.\nMalthus! The Malthusian theory,--the law of the increase of population\nin geometrical progression, and the increase of means of living in\narithmetical progression, and the natural and prudent means of\nrestraining the increase of population,--all these became scientific,\nundoubted truths which have never been verified, but, accepted as\naxioms, have served for further deductions.\n\nThus learned and educated men were deceived; whereas in the crowd of\nidle men there was a blind and religious trust in the great laws\ndiscovered by Malthus. How did this happen? These statements seem to be\nscientific deductions which have nothing in common with the instincts of\nthe crowd.\n\nBut they are only sacred to those who believe science to be something\nself-existent and infallible, like the Church, and not merely the\nthoughts of weak men liable to mistakes, who only for importance\' sake\ncall their own thoughts and words by a pompous word, _science_. It was\nonly necessary to draw practical conclusions from the Malthusian theory\nin order to see that it was quite a human one with very determinate\naims.\n\nThe deductions which were directly drawn from this theory were the\nfollowing: The miserable condition of working-people does not come from\nthe cruelty, egotism, and unreasonableness of rich and powerful men, but\nit exists according to an unchangeable law which does not depend upon\nman, and, if anybody is to blame, it is the starving working-people\nthemselves: why do these fools come into the world when they know that\nthey will not have enough to eat? and therefore the wealthy and powerful\nclasses are not at all to blame for any thing, and they may quietly\ncontinue to live as they have done.\n\nThis conclusion, being pleasant to the crowd of idle men, induced the\nlearned dons to overlook the incorrectness and total arbitrariness of\nthe deductions; and the crowd of educated, i.e., idle people,\ninstinctively guessing to what these deductions led, greeted the theory\nwith delight, set upon it the seal of truth, and cherished it during\nhalf a century. The reason for all this was, that these doctrines\njustified men in their bad mode of life.\n\nIs not the same cause at the bottom of the self-assurance of men of the\nnew positive, critical, experimental science, and of the reverent regard\nof the crowd to what they preach? At first it seems strange that the\ntheory of evolution (like the theory of atonement in theology, it serves\nfor the majority of men as a popular expression of the new teaching)\nshould justify men in their false lives, and it would seem that the\nscientific theory has only to do with facts, and does nothing but\nobserve facts. But it only seems so.\n\nIt had been so with theological teaching; theology seemed to be occupied\nonly with doctrines and to have nothing to do with the lives of men. It\nhad been so with philosophy, which also seemed to be occupied only with\nfacts.\n\nIt had been so with the teaching of Hegel on a large scale, and with the\ntheory of Malthus on a small one. Hegelianism seemed to be occupied\nmerely with its logical constructions and to have nothing to do with the\nlives of men; and the theory of Malthus seemed to be occupied\nexclusively with statistics.\n\nBut it only seemed so.\n\nModern science also claims to be occupied exclusively with facts: it\nstudies facts.\n\nBut what facts? Why some facts and not others?\n\nThe disciples of the modern science are very fond of saying with a\nsolemn assurance, "We study facts alone," imagining that these words\nhave some meaning.\n\nTo study facts alone is quite impossible, because the number of facts\nwhich may be objects of our study, are, in the strict sense of the word,\ncountless.\n\nBefore beginning to study facts, one must have some theory according to\nwhich the facts are studied; that is, determining which shall be\nselected from the countless number of facts. And this theory indeed\nexists and is even very definitely expressed, though many of the agents\nof modern science ignore it; that is, do not want to know it, or really\ndo not know it;--sometimes pretend not to know it.\n\nThus matters stood before with all most important beliefs.\n\nThe basis of each is always given in theory; and so-called learned men\nseek only further deductions from the various bases given to them,\nthough sometimes they ignore even these.\n\nBut a fundamental theory must always be present, and so it is also now.\nModern science selects its facts on the ground of a determinate theory,\nwhich sometimes it knows, sometimes does not wish to know, sometimes\nreally does not know; but which exists. The theory is this: Mankind is\nan undying organism, having each his special calling for the service of\nthe whole. As the cells, growing into an organism, divide among\nthemselves the labour of the struggle for existence of the whole\norganism, increase one capacity, and diminish another, and all together\nform an organ in order better to satisfy the wants of the whole\norganism; and as among social animals,--ants and bees,--the individuals\ndivide the labour among themselves (queen-bees lay eggs, drone-bees\nfecundate, working-bees labour for the life of the whole),--so also in\nmankind and in human societies there take place the same differentiation\nand integration of the parts. And therefore, in order to find the law of\nman\'s life, we must study the laws of the lives and development of\norganisms. And in these we find the following laws: That each phenomenon\nis followed by more than one consequence. The failure of uniformity. The\nlaw of uniformity and diversity; and so on.\n\nAll this seems to be very innocent, but we need only draw deductions\nfrom these observations of facts in order to see at once to what they\nare tending. These facts lead to one thing,--the acknowledgement of\nhumanity or human society as an organism, and hence to the\nacknowledgment of the division of activities in human society as\norganic, that is necessary; and as there exist in human societies many\ncruelties and vices, therefore these phenomena must not be considered as\ncruelties and vices, but must be accepted as inevitable facts confirming\na general law--i.e., that of "division of labour." Moral philosophy used\nalso to justify every cruelty and wickedness; but there it became\nphilosophical, and therefore incorrect. According to science, however,\nthe same thing turns out to be scientific, and therefore unquestionable.\n\nHow can we help accepting such a fine theory! We need only look at human\nsociety merely as something to be observed, and we may quietly devour\nthe labour of perishing men, calming ourselves with the idea that our\nactivity as a dancing-master, a lawyer, a doctor, a philosopher, an\nactor, an investigator of the theory of mediumism and of forms of atoms,\nand so on, is a functional activity of the organism of mankind and\ntherefore there can be no question whether it is just that I should\ncontinue to live doing only what is pleasant, just as there can be no\nquestion whether the division of labour between a mental and a muscular\ncell is fair or not. How can we help accepting such a nice theory which\nenables us afterwards to put our consciences into our pockets forever,\nand live a completely unbridled, animal life, feeling under our feet a\nfirm, scientific support? And it is upon this new belief that the\njustification of idleness and the cruelty of men is built.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nThis doctrine had its commencement about half a century ago. Its chief\nfounder was the French philosopher Comte. Comte, being a lover of\nsystematic theory, and at the same time a man of religious tendency, was\nimpressed by the then new physiological researches of Bichat; and he\nconceived the old idea, expressed in bygone days by Menenius Agrippa,\nthat human societies, indeed all human-kind, may be regarded as one\nwhole, An Organism, and men--as live particles of separate organs, each\nhaving his definite destination to fulfil in the service of the whole\norganism.\n\nComte was so fascinated by this idea that he founded his philosophical\ntheory on it; and this theory so captivated him that he quite forgot\nthat his point of departure was no more than a pretty comparison,\nsuitable enough in a fable, but in no way justifiable as the foundation\nof a science. As it often happens, he took his pet hypothesis for an\naxiom, and so imagined that his whole theory was based upon the most\nfirm and positive foundations.\n\nAccording to his theory it appeared that, as mankind is an organism,\ntherefore the knowledge of what man is and what his relation to the\nworld ought to be, is only possible through the knowledge of the\nproperties of this organism. And to be able to learn these properties\nman is fitted to make observations upon other lower organisms and to\ndraw deductions from their lives.\n\nTherefore, first, the true and exclusive method of science, according to\nComte, is the inductive one, and science is only science when it has\nexperiment for its basis. Secondly, the final aim and the summit of\nscience becomes the new science concerning the imaginary organism of\nMankind, or the organic being,--Mankind. This new hypothetic science is\nSociology. From this view of science it generally turns out that all\nformer knowledge was false, and that the whole history of mankind, in\nthe sense of its self-consciousness, divides itself into three, or\nrather two, periods. First, the theological and metaphysical period,\nfrom the beginning of the world to Comte. And, secondly, the modern\nperiod of true science, positive science, beginning with Comte.\n\nAll this was very well, but there was one mistake in it, which was this:\nthat all this edifice was built on the sand, on an arbitrary (and\nincorrect) assertion that mankind, collectively considered, was an\norganism.\n\nThis assertion is arbitrary because, if we are to acknowledge the\nexistence of mankind as an organism, which is beyond observation, we\nmight as well acknowledge the existence of the triple God and similar\ntheological propositions.\n\nIt was incorrect, because to the idea of mankind, that is, of men, the\ndefinition of an organism was added, whereas man lacks the essential\ncharacteristics of an organism,--a centre of sensation or consciousness.\nWe call an elephant, as well as a bacterium, organisms, only because we\nsuppose by analogy in these beings that there is unification of\nsensations, or consciousness. But human societies and mankind lack this\nessential; and therefore, however many other general character-signs we\nmay find in mankind and in an organism,--without this, the assertion\nthat man is an organism is incorrect.\n\nBut notwithstanding the arbitrariness and incorrectness of the\nfundamental proposition of Positive Philosophy, it was accepted by the\nso-called "Educated World" with great sympathy, because of that great\nfact, important for the crowd, that it afforded a justification of the\nexisting order of things by recognizing the lawfulness of the existing\ndivision of labour; that is, of violence in mankind. It is remarkable in\nthis respect that from the writings of Comte, composed of two parts,--a\nPositive Philosophy and a Positive Politics,--only the first part was\naccepted on new experimental principles by the learned world, that which\njustified the existing evil in human society. The second part, treating\nof the moral, altruistic duties, following from this recognition of\nmankind as an organism, was considered not only unimportant but even\nunscientific.\n\nHere the same thing was repeated which occurred with the two parts of\nKant\'s writings. The "Critique of Pure Reason," was accepted by science;\nbut the "Critique of Practical Reason," that part which contains the\nessence of moral doctrine, was rejected. In the teaching of Comte, that\nwas recognized to be scientific which humoured the reigning evil.\n\nBut the Positive Philosophy accepted by the crowd, based on an arbitrary\nand incorrect supposition, was by itself too ill-grounded, and therefore\ntoo unsteady, and could not be sustained by itself.\n\nAnd now, among the idle play of ideas of so-called "Men of Science,"\nthere has appeared a similarly arbitrary and incorrect assertion, not at\nall new, to the effect that all living beings (that is, organisms),\nproceed one from another; not only one organism from another, but one\norganism from many; that during a very long period, a million of years,\nfor instance, not only may a fish and a duck have proceeded from one and\nthe same forefather, but also one organism might have proceeded from\nmany separate organisms; so, for instance, out of a swarm of bees a\nsingle animal may proceed. This arbitrary and incorrect assertion was\naccepted by the learned world with still greater sympathy.\n\nThe assertion was arbitrary, because no one has ever seen how one kind\nof organism is made from others; and therefore the hypothesis about the\nOrigin of Species will always remain a mere supposition and never become\nan experimental fact.\n\nThe hypothesis was incorrect, because the solution of the problem of the\nOrigin of Species by the theory of the laws of inheritance and\naccommodation during an infinitely long period, is not a solution of the\nproblem at all, but the mere reiteration of the question in another\nform.\n\nAccording to the solution of this problem by Moses (to oppose which is\nthe object of Comte\'s theory), it appeared that the variety of the\nspecies of living beings proceeded from the will of God and his infinite\nomnipotence. According to the Theory of Evolution, it appears that the\nvariety of species of living beings proceeded from themselves in\nconsequence of the infinite variety of conditions of inheritance and\nenvironment in an infinite period of time.\n\nThe Theory of Evolution, speaking plainly, asserts only that (by chance)\nin an infinite period of time, anything you like may proceed from\nanything else you choose.\n\nThis is no answer to the question; it is simply the same question put\ndifferently: instead of Will is put Chance, and the co-efficient of the\nInfinite is transferred from Omnipotence to Time.\n\nBut this new assertion, enforced by Darwin\'s followers in an arbitrary\nand inaccurate spirit, maintained the first assertion of Comte, and\ntherefore it became the Revelation for our time, and the foundation of\nall sciences, even that of the history of philosophy and religion; and\nbesides, according to the _na\xc3\xafve_ confession of Darwin himself, the idea\nwas awakened in him by the law of Malthus; and therefore he pointed to\nthe "Struggle for Existence" not only of men but of all living beings,\nas a fundamental law of every living thing, and this was exactly what\nwas wanted by the crowd of idle people for their own justification.\n\nTwo unstable theories which could not stand on their own feet supported\neach other, and so received a show of stability. Both the theories bore\nin them a sense, precious to the crowd, that men are not to be blamed\nfor the existing evil in human societies, that the existing order is\nwhat should be; and thus the new theory was accepted by the crowd in the\nsense wanted by them, with full confidence and unprecedented enthusiasm.\n\nThus the new scientific doctrine was founded upon two arbitrary and\nincorrect propositions, accepted in the same way that dogmas of faith\nare accepted. Both in matter and form this new doctrine is remarkably\nlike the Church-Christian one. In matter, the similarity lies in the\nfact that in both doctrines alike a fantastical meaning is attached to\nreally existing things, and this artificial meaning is taken as the\nobject of our research.\n\nIn the Church-Christian doctrine, to Christ who did really exist, is\nattributed the fantastic conception of being God Himself, screened. In\nthe Positive doctrine, to the really existing fact of live men is\nattributed the fantastical attributes of an organism.\n\nIn form, the similarity of these two doctrines is remarkable, since, in\nboth cases, a theory emanating from one class of men is accepted as the\nonly and infallible truth. In the Church-Christian doctrine, the\nChurch\'s way of understanding God\'s revelation to men is regarded as the\nsacred and only true one. In the doctrine of Positivism, certain men\'s\nway of understanding science is regarded as absolutely correct and true.\n\nAs the Church-Christians regard the foundation of their church as the\nonly origin of true knowledge of God, and only out of a kind of courtesy\nadmit that former believers may also be regarded as having formed a\nchurch; so in precisely the same manner does Positive science, according\nto its own statement, place its origin in Comte: and its\nrepresentatives, also only out of courtesy, admit the existence of\nprevious science, and that only as regarding certain thinkers, as, for\ninstance, Aristotle. Both the Church and Positive science altogether\nexclude the ideas of all the rest of mankind, and regard all knowledge\noutside their own as _erroneous_. The similarity persists. Just as to\nthe support of the first advental theological dogmas of the Trinity and\nof the divinity of Christ comes the old--but newly-interpreted--dogmas\nof man\'s fall and of his redemption by the death of Christ, and out of\nthese dogmas is developed popular Church teaching: so in our time, the\nold dogma of Evolution comes in with new importance to help the\nfundamental dogma of Comte concerning the organism of mankind; and from\nthese two elements the popular scientific doctrine has been formed. As\nin one teaching, so in the other: the new dogma is necessary for the\nsupport of the old one, and becomes comprehensible only in connection\nwith it. If to a believer in the Divinity of Christ, it is not clearly\ncomprehensible why God should come down to earth, the doctrine of\natonement explains it. If it is not quite clear to a believer in the\nOrganism of Mankind why a collection of individuals may be counted as an\norganism, the dogma of Evolution is charged with the explanation. This\ndogma is needed to reconcile the contradictions and certainties of the\nfirst: mankind is an organism, and we see that it does not contain the\nchief characteristic of an organism; how must we account for it?\n\nHere the dogma of evolution comes in, and explains, Mankind is an\norganism in a state of development. If you accept this, you may then\nconsider mankind as such.\n\nAs to any man free from superstitions about the trinity and the Divinity\nof Christ, it is impossible even to understand the force and the meaning\nof the teaching of atonement, which meaning comes only through the\nacknowledgment of Christ as God Himself, so a man who is free from the\nPositive superstition cannot even understand wherein lies the interest\nof the theory of the Origin of Species and of Evolution; and this\ninterest is explained only when we learn the fundamental dogma, that\n"Mankind is an Organism." And as the subtleties of theology are only\nintelligible to those who believe in its fundamental dogmas, so also the\nsubtleties of sociology, which now occupy the minds of all adherents of\nthis recent and profound science, are intelligible only to believers.\nThe doctrine of atonement is necessary to reconcile the contradiction\nbetween the first dogma and facts. God descended on earth to save men.\nBut men are not saved. How then explain this? The dogma of atonement\nasserts "He saved those, who believed in atonement. If you believe in\natonement, you are saved."\n\nThe similarity between these two doctrines holds good yet further. Being\nfounded on dogmas accepted by faith, these doctrines neither question\nnor analyze their own principles, which, on the other hand, are used as\nstarting-points for the most extraordinary theories. The preachers of\nthese call themselves, in Theology, sanctified; in Positive knowledge,\nscientific; in both cases, infallible. And at the same time, they\nconceive the most peremptory, incredible, and unfounded assertions,\nwhich they give forth with the greatest pomp and seriousness, and which\nare with equal pomp and seriousness contradicted in all their details by\nothers who do not agree, and yet who equally recognize the fundamental\ndogmas.\n\nThe Basil the Great of scientific doctrine, Herbert Spencer, in one of\nhis first writings expresses these doctrines thus: Societies and\norganisms, says he, are alike in the following points: First, in that,\nbeing conceived as small aggregates, they imperceptibly grow in mass, so\nthat some of them become ten thousand times bigger than their originals.\n\nSecondly, in that, while in the beginning they have such simple\nstructure that they may almost be considered structureless, in their\ngrowth they develop an ever-increasing complexity of structure.\n\nThirdly, in that, though in their early undeveloped period there does\nnot exist among them any dependence of particles upon one another, these\nparticles by and by acquire a mutual dependence, which at last becomes\nso strong that the activity and the life of each part is possible only\nwith the activity and the lives of all others.\n\nFourthly, in this, that the life and the development of society is more\nindependent and longer than the life and the development of every unit\nwhich goes to form it, and which is separately born and growing and\nacting and multiplying and dying while the political body formed of such\ncontinues to live one generation after another, developing in mass, in\nperfection of structure, and in functional activity.\n\nThen follow the points of difference between organisms and societies,\nand it is demonstrated that these differences are only seeming ones, and\nthat organisms and societies are quite similar.\n\nTo an impartial man the question at once arises, What are you speaking\nabout, then? Why is mankind an organism or something similar? You say\nthat societies are similar to organisms according to these four points;\nbut even this comparison is incorrect. You take only a few\ncharacteristics of an organism, and you then apply them to human\nsocieties. You produce four points of similarity, then you take the\npoints of difference which you say are only seemingly so, and you\nconclude that human societies may be considered as organisms. But this\nis nothing else than an idle play of dialectics. On this ground we may\nconsider as an organism everything we choose. I take the first thing\nwhich comes to my mind,--a forest, as it is planted in a field and grows\nup: first beginning as a small aggregate and imperceptibly increasing in\nmass. Secondly, "In the beginning the structure of an organism is\nsimple, then the complexity increases," and so on. This is the case with\nthe forest: at first there are only birch-trees, then hazel, and so on;\nfirst all the trees grow straight, and afterwards they interlace their\nbranches. Thirdly, "The dependence of the parts increases so that the\nlife of each part depends upon the lives and activities of all the\nothers": it is exactly the same with the forest; the nut-tree keeps the\ntrunks warm (if you hew it down, the other trees will be frozen in\nwinter), the underwood keeps off wind, the seed-trees continue the\nspecies, the tall and leafy ones give shadow, and the life of each tree\ndepends upon that of the rest. Fourthly, "Separate parts may die, but\nthe whole organism continues to live." Separate trees perish, but the\nforest continues in life and growth.\n\nThe same holds good with the example so often brought by the defenders\nof the scientific doctrine. Cut off an arm,--the arm will die: we may\nsay remove a tree from the shadow and the ground of a forest, it will\ndie.\n\nAnother remarkable similarity between this scientific doctrine and the\nChurch-Christian one,--and any other theory founded upon propositions\nwhich are accepted through faith,--lies in their mutual capacity of\nbeing proof against logic.\n\nHaving demonstrated that by this theory a forest may be considered as an\norganism, you think you have proved to the followers of the theory the\nincorrectness of their definition? Not at all. Their definition of an\norganism is so loose and plastic that they can apply it to everything\nthey like.\n\nYes, they will say, you may consider the forest, too, as an organism. A\nforest is a mutual co-operation of the individuals who do not destroy\neach other; an aggregate: its parts can also pass into a closer\nrelationship, and by differentiation and integration it may become an\norganism.\n\nThen you will say, that in that case, the birds too and the insects, and\nthe herbs of this forest, which mutually co-operate and do not destroy\neach other, may be considered, with the trees, to be an organism. They\nwould agree to this, too. According to their theory, we may consider as\nan organism every collection of living beings which mutually co-operate,\nand do not destroy one another. You can establish a connection and\nco-operation between everything you like, and, according to evolution,\nyou can assert that from anything may proceed anything else you like, if\na long enough period is granted.\n\nTo those who believe in the Trinity, it is impossible to prove that it\ndoes not exist. But one can show them that their assertion is not based\non knowledge, but is an assertion of faith, and that if they assert that\nthere are three Gods, I have an equal right to assert that there are 17\xc2\xbd\nGods. One may say the same thing with yet better ground to the followers\nof Positive and Evolutional science. On the basis of this science one\ncould undertake to prove anything one liked. And the strangest thing of\nall is, that this same Positive science regards the scientific method as\na condition of true knowledge, and that it has itself defined the\nelements of the scientific method. It professes that common sense is the\nscientific method. And yet common sense itself discloses the fallacies\nof the doctrine at every step. The moment those who occupied the\nposition of saints felt there was no longer anything sacred in them,\nthat they are cursed like the Pope and our own Synod, they immediately\ncalled themselves not merely sacred, but "most sacred." The moment\nscience felt that it had given up common sense, it called itself The\nScience of Reason, The Only Really Scientific Science.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\n"Division of Labour" is the law pervading everything that exists,\ntherefore it must exist in human societies too. That may be so; but the\nquestion still remains, whether the existing division of labour in human\nsociety is the division which ought to exist. And when men consider a\ncertain division of labour unreasonable and unjust, no science whatever\ncan prove to men that what they consider unreasonable and unjust ought\nto continue.\n\nThe theological theory demonstrated that "Power is of God"; and it very\nwell may be so. But the question still remains, To whom is the power\ngiven, to Catherine the Empress, or to the rebel Pugatchof? And no\ntheological subtleties whatever can solve this difficulty. Moral\nphilosophy demonstrates that "A State is merely a form of the social\ndevelopment of the individual"; but the question still remains,--Can the\nstate of a Nero or that of a Gengis Khan be considered a form of such\ndevelopment? And no transcendentalism whatever can solve that\ndifficulty.\n\nIt is the same with Scientific Science also. Division of Labour is the\ncondition of the life of organisms and of human societies; but what have\nwe to consider in these human societies as an organic division of\nlabour? However much science studies the division of labour in the\nmolecules of a tape-worm, all the observations cannot compel men to\nacknowledge as correct a division of labour which is repudiated by their\nreason and conscience. However convincing the proofs of the division of\nlabour in the cells of investigated organisms may be, a man who has not\nyet lost his reason will say it is wrong that some should only weave\ncloth all their long life, and that this is not division of labour, but\noppression of human beings.\n\nHerbert Spencer and others affirm that as there is a whole population of\nweavers, the weaver\'s activity is in organic division of labour. In\nsaying this they use a similar line of reasoning to the theologians:\nThere is a power, therefore it is of God, whatever it may be: there are\nweavers, therefore they exist as a result of the law of division of\nlabour. There might be some sense in this if the power and the position\nof weavers were created by themselves; but we know that they are not but\nthat it is we who create them. Well, then, we ought to ascertain whether\nwe have established this power according to the will of God or of\nourselves, and whether we have called these weavers into being by virtue\nof some organic law or from some other cause.\n\nHere are men earning their living by agriculture, as it is proper for\nall men to do: one man has set up a smith\'s forge and mended his plough;\nhis neighbour comes to him and asks him to mend his plough, too, and\npromises to give labour or money in return. A second comes with a\nsimilar request; others follow; and in the society of these men a form\nof division of labour arises. Thus, one man becomes a smith.\n\nAnother man has taught his children well; his neighbour brings him his\nchildren and asks him to teach them, and thus a teacher is formed: but\nthe smith as well as the teacher become, and continue to be, a smith and\na teacher, only because they were asked, and they remain a smith and a\nteacher only as long as people require their trades. If it happens that\ntoo many smiths and teachers appear, or if their labour is no longer\nwanted, they at once, according to common sense, throw aside their trade\nand become labourers again, as it everywhere and always happens where\nthere is no cause for the violation of a right division of labour.\n\nMen who behave in such a way are directed both by their reason and their\nconscience; and therefore we who are endowed with reason and conscience,\nall agree that such a division of labour is a right one. But if it were\nto happen that smiths, having the possibility of compelling other men to\nlabour for them, were to continue to make horseshoes when there was no\nlonger a demand for them, and teachers were to wish to continue to teach\nwhen there was nobody to be taught, then, to every impartial man endowed\nwith reason and conscience, it would be obvious that this is not real\ndivision of labour but a usurpation of other men\'s labour; because such\na division could no longer be tested satisfactorily by the sole standard\nby which we may know whether it is right or not,--the demand of such\nlabour by other men, and a voluntary compensation offered for it by\nthem. But exactly such a surplus, however, is what Scientific Science\nterms "a division of labour."\n\nMen do what is not required, and they ask to be fed for it, and say it\nis just, because it is division of labour. The chief _social_ evil of a\npeople,--not with us alone,--is the countless horde of State officials.\nThe chief cause of the _economical_ misery of our days, is what is\ncalled in England "over-production" (that is, the production of an\nenormous quantity of articles, wanted by nobody, and which no one knows\nhow to get rid of). All this comes simply from the strange idea about\nthe "division of labour?"\n\nIt would be very strange to see a boot-maker who considered that men\nwere bound to feed him because, forsooth, he continued to produce boots\nwanted by no one; but what shall we say about those men in government,\nchurch, science, and art, who not only do not produce any thing tangibly\nuseful for the people but whose produce is wanted by nobody, yet who as\nboldly require to be well fed and clothed on account of "The division of\nlabour."\n\nThere may be magicians for whose activity there is a demand and to whom\nmen give casks and spirits; but we cannot even imagine the existence of\nmagicians who, while their magic is not wanted by anybody, require to be\nfed simply because they wish to practice their art. Yet in our world\nthis is the very position of the men in church and state, of the men of\nscience and art. And it all proceeds from that false conception of the\ndivision of labour, defined, not by reason and conscience, but by\ndeductions to which these scientists so unanimously resort.\n\nDivision of labour, indeed, has always existed; but it is correct only\nwhen man decides it by his reason and conscience, and not by his making\nobservations on it. And the conscience and the reason of all men solve\nthis question in the simplest and surest way. They always decide the\nquestion by recognizing the division of labour to be right only when the\nspecial activity of a man is so necessary to others, that they freely\noffer to feed him in compensation for what they ask him to do for them.\nBut when a man from his infancy up to his thirtieth year lives on the\nshoulders of other men, promising to do, when he finishes his studies,\nsomething very useful, which nobody has ever asked him for, and then for\nthe rest of his life lives in the same way, promising only to do\npresently something which nobody asks him to do, this would not be a\ntrue division of labour, but, as it really is, only the violation by a\nstrong man of the labour of others; the same appropriation of other\nmen\'s labour by a strong man, which formerly Theology called Divine\npredestination; Philosophy, Inevitable Conditions of Life; and now\nScientific Science, the Organic Division of Labour.\n\nThe entire importance of the ruling science consists in this alone. This\nscience is now the dispenser of diplomas for idleness, because in her\ntemples she alone analyzes and determines what activity in the social\norganism is parasitic and what organic. As if each man could not decide\nmuch better and more quickly, too, by consulting his own reason and\nconscience.\n\nAs formerly, both for clergy and for statesmen, there could have been no\ndoubt as to who were most necessary to other people, so now for the\nbelievers in Positive Science it seems that there can be no doubt about\nthis, that their own activity is undoubtedly an organic one: they, the\nfactors of science and art, are the cells of the brain, the most\nprecious cells of all the human organism.\n\nLet us leave them to reign, eat, drink, and be feasted, as priests and\nsophists of old have before them, so long as they do not deprave men!\n\nSince men are reasonable creatures they have discriminated good from\nevil, making use of what has been done in this direction before them by\nothers, have struggled with evil, seeking a true and better way, and\nslowly but unceasingly have advanced in this way. But always across the\nroad different deceptions stood before them, trying to assure them that\nthis struggle was not at all necessary, and that they should submit to\nthe tide of life. First the awful deceptions of the old Church; little\nby little with dreadful struggle and effort men got rid of them: but\nscarcely had they done so when in their place arose new ones--state and\nphilosophical deceptions.\n\nMen freed themselves from these too, and now a new deceit, a still worse\none, has sprung up in their path,--the scientific deception.\n\nThis new deception is exactly what the old ones were: its essence\nconsists in the substitution of an externality for reason and\nconscience, and this externality is _observation_, as in theology it was\n_revelation_.\n\nThe snare of this science consists in this, that having exposed some\nbare-faced perversions of the activity of reason and conscience, it\ndestroys men\'s confidence in both reason and conscience. Hiding their\nlie clothed in a scientific theory, scientists assure men that by\nstudying external phenomena they study undeniable facts which will\nreveal to them the law of man\'s life. Things which are the property of\nconscience and reason are now to be discovered by observation alone.\nThese men lose the conception of good and evil and thus become unable to\nunderstand those expressions and definitions of good and evil which have\nbeen worked out during the entire former existence of mankind.\n\nAll that reason and conscience say to them, all that they have said to\nthe highest representatives of men since the world has existed, all\nthis, in their slang, is "conditional and subjective." All this must be\nleft behind.\n\nIt is said that by reason one cannot apprehend the truth, because reason\nis liable to error: there is another way, unmistakable and almost\nmechanical,--one must study facts on the ground of science; that is, on\ntwo groundless suppositions, Positivism and Evolution, which are offered\nas the most undoubted truths. With mock solemnity the ruling science\nasserts that the solution of all the questions of life is only possible\nthrough studying the facts of nature, and especially those of organisms.\n\nThe credulous crowd of youth, overwhelmed by the novelty of this\nauthority,--not only not destroyed, not yet even touched by\ncritics,--rush to the study of these facts of natural sciences, to that\n"only way" which, according to the assertion of the ruling doctrine,\nalone can lead to the elucidation of all questions of life. But the\nfarther the students proceed in this study, the farther do they remove\nnot only the possibility of solving the questions of life, but even the\nvery thought of this solution. The more they grow accustomed, not so\nmuch to observe themselves, as to believe other men\'s observations on\ntheir word (to believe in cells, in protoplasm, in the fourth dimension\nof matter, and so on), the more the form hides from them the contents.\nThe more they lose the consciousness of good and evil and the capacity\nof understanding those expressions and definitions of good and evil\nwhich have been worked out in all the former career of mankind, the more\nthey appropriate to themselves that special scientific slang of\n"conditional" expressions which have no common human meaning in them.\nThe farther and farther they get into the thick forest of observations\nlighted by anything, the more they lose the capacity, not only of\nindependent thought, but even of understanding other men\'s fresh human\nideas which are not included in their Talmud. But chiefly they pass\ntheir best years in losing the habit of life, that is, of labour, and\naccustom themselves to consider their own position justified, and thus\nbecome, physically, good-for-nothing parasites, and, mentally, dislocate\ntheir brains and lose all power of thought-production.\n\nSo, their capacities more and more blunted, they acquire by degrees\nself-assurance which deprives them forever of the possibility of\nreturning to a simple, laborious life, and to any plain, clear, common,\nhuman manner of thinking.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nThe division of labour has always existed in human society, and I\ndaresay always will exist; but the question for us is, not if it has\nbeen and will still continue, but, what should guide us in providing\nthat this division may be a right one.\n\nIf we take the facts of observation for our standard, we refuse to have\nany standard at all: for every division of labour which we see among\nmen, and which may seem to us to be right, we shall consider right; and\nthis is what the ruling Scientific Science is leading us to.\n\nDivision of labour!\n\n"Some are occupied with mental and spiritual, others with muscular and\nphysical, labour."\n\nWith what an assurance men express this! They wish to think it, and so\nthat which is transparently the ancient violence, seems to them in\nreality a fair exchange of services.\n\n"Thou," or rather, "you" (because it is always the many who have to feed\nthe one),--"you feed me, dress me, do for me all this rough labour which\nI require of you, and to which you are accustomed from your infancy, and\nI will do for you that mental work to which I have already become\naccustomed. Give me bodily food, and in return I will give you the\nspiritual."\n\nThe statement seems fair; and it would really be so if such exchange of\nservices were free; if those who supply the bodily food were not obliged\nto supply it before they get the spiritual. The producer of the\nspiritual food says, "In order that I may be able to give you this food,\nyou must feed me, clothe me, and remove all filth from my house."\n\nBut the producer of bodily food must do his work without making any\nclaims of his own, and he has to give the bodily food whether he receive\nspiritual food or not. If the exchange were a free one the conditions on\nboth sides would be equal. We agree that spiritual food is as necessary\nto man as bodily. But the learned man, the artist, says, "Before we can\nbegin to serve men by giving them spiritual food, we want men to provide\nus with bodily food."\n\nBut why should not the producers of this say, "Before we begin to serve\nyou with bodily food, we want spiritual food; and until we receive it,\nwe cannot labour?"\n\nYou say, "I require the labour of a ploughman, a smith, a book-maker, a\ncarpenter, masons, and others, in order that I may prepare the spiritual\nfood I have to offer."\n\nEvery workman might say, too, "Before I go to work to prepare bodily\nfood for you, I want the fruits of the spirit. In order to have strength\nfor labouring, I require a religious teaching, the social order of\ncommon life, application of knowledge to labour, and the joys and\ncomforts which art gives. I have no time to work out for myself a\nteaching concerning the meaning of life,--give it to me. I have no time\nto think out statutes of common life which would prevent the violation\nof justice,--give me this too. I have no time to study mechanics,\nnatural philosophy, chemistry, technology; give me books with\ninformation as to how I am to improve my tools, my ways of working, my\ndwelling, its heating and lighting. I have no time to occupy myself with\npoetry, with plastic art, or music. Give me the excitements and comforts\nnecessary for life; give me the productions of the arts."\n\nYou say it would be impossible for you to do your important and\nnecessary business if you were deprived of the labour that\nworking-people do for you; and I say, a workman may declare, "It is\nimpossible for me to do my important and necessary business, not less\nimportant than yours,--to plough, to cart away refuse, and to clean\n_your_ houses,--if I am deprived of a religious guidance corresponding\nto the wants of my intellect and my conscience, of a reasonable\ngovernment which will secure my labour, of information for easing my\nlabour, and the enjoyment of art to ennoble it. All you have hitherto\noffered me in the shape of spiritual food is not only of no use to me\nwhatever, I cannot even understand to whom it could be of any use. And\nuntil I receive this nourishment, proper for me as for every man, I\ncannot produce bodily food to feed you with."\n\nWhat if the working-people should speak thus? And if they did, it would\nbe no jest but the simplest justice. If a workman said this, he would be\nfar more in the right than a man of intellectual labour; because the\nlabour produced by the workman is more urgent and more necessary than\nthat of the intellectual worker, and because a man of intellect is\nhindered by nothing from giving that spiritual food which he promised to\ngive, while the workingman is hindered in giving the bodily food by the\nfact that he himself is short of it.\n\nWhat, then, should we intellectual labourers answer, if such simple and\nlawful claims were made upon us? How should we satisfy these claims?\nShould we satisfy the religious wants of the people by the catechism of\nPhilaret, by sacred histories of Sokolof, by the literature sent out by\nmonasteries and cathedrals? Should we satisfy their demand for order by\nthe "Code of Laws," and cassation verdicts of different departments, or\nby reports of committees and commissions? And should we satisfy their\nwant of knowledge by giving them spectrum analysis, a survey of the\nMilky Way, speculative geometry, microscopic investigations,\ncontroversies concerning spiritualism and mediumism, the activity of\nacademies of science? How should we satisfy their artistic wants? By\nPushkin, Dostoyevsky, Turgenief, L. Tolstoy? By pictures of French\n_salons_, and of those of our artists who represent naked women, satin,\nvelvet, and landscapes, and pictures of domestic life; by the music of\nWagner, and that of our own musicians?\n\nAll this is of no use and cannot be of use because we, with our right to\nutilize the labour of the people and absence of all duties in\npreparation of their spiritual food, have quite lost from sight the\nsingle destination our activity should have.\n\nWe do not even know what is required by the workman; we have even\nforgotten his mode of life, his views of things, his language; we have\neven lost sight of the very working-people themselves, and we study them\nlike some ethnographical rarity or newly-discovered continent. Demanding\nfor ourselves bodily food, we have taken upon ourselves to provide the\nspiritual; but in consequence of the imaginary division of labour,\naccording to which we may not only first take our dinner and afterwards\ndo our work, but may during many generations dine luxuriously and do no\nwork,--we, in the way of compensation for our food, have prepared\nsomething which is of use, as it seems to us, for ourselves and for\nscience and art, but of no use whatever for those very people whose\nlabour we consume under the pretext of providing them in return with\nintellectual food; not only is of no use, but is quite unintelligible\nand distasteful to them.\n\nIn our blindness, we have to such a degree left out of sight the duty we\ntook upon us, that we have even forgotten for what our labour is being\ndone; and the very people whom we undertook to serve we have made an\nobject of our scientific and artistic activities. We study them and\nrepresent them for our own pleasure and amusement: but we have quite\nforgotten that it is our duty, not to study and depict, but to serve\nthem.\n\nWe have to such a degree left out of sight the duty we assumed that we\nhave not even noticed that other people do what we undertook in the\ndepartments of science and art, and that our place turns out to be\noccupied.\n\nIt appears that while we have been in controversy,--now about the\nimmaculate conception, and now about spontaneous generation; now about\nspiritualism, and now about the forms of atoms; now about pangenesis,\nnow about protoplasms, and so on,--all this while the people none the\nless required spiritual food, and the abortive outcasts of science and\nart began to provide for the people this spiritual food to the order of\nvarious speculators, who had in view exclusively their own profit and\ngain.\n\nNow, for some forty years in Europe, and ten years in Russia, millions\nof books and pictures and songs have been circulating; shows have been\nopened: and the people gaze and sing, and receive intellectual food,\nthough not from those who promised to provide it for them; and we, who\njustify our idleness by the need for that intellectual food which we\npretend to provide for the people, are sitting still, and taking no\nnotice.\n\nBut we cannot do so, because our final justification has vanished from\nunder our feet. We have taken upon ourselves a peculiar department: we\nhave a peculiar functional activity of our own. We are the brain of the\npeople. They feed us, and we have undertaken to teach them. Only for the\nsake of this have we freed ourselves from labour. What, then, have we\nbeen teaching them? They have waited years, tens of years, hundreds of\nyears. And we are still conversing among ourselves, and teaching each\nother, and amusing ourselves, and have quite forgotten them; we have so\ntotally forgotten them, that others have taken upon themselves to teach\nand amuse them, and we have not even become aware of this in our\nflippant talk about division of labour: and it is very obvious that all\nour talk about the utility we offer to the people was only a shameful\nexcuse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nThere was a time when the _Church_ guided the intellectual life of the\nmen of our world. The Church promised men happiness, and, in\ncompensation for this she freed herself from taking part in mankind\'s\ncommon struggle for life.\n\nAs soon as she did this she went away from her calling, and men turned\nfrom her. It was not the _errors_ of the Church which originally caused\nher ruin, but the fact that by the help of the secular power, in the\ntime of Constantine, her ministers violated the law of labour; and then\ntheir claim to idleness and luxury gave birth to the errors.\n\nAs soon as she obtained this power she began to care for herself, and\nnot for humanity, whom she had taken upon herself to serve. The\nministers of the Church gave themselves up to idleness and depravity.\n\n_The State_ took upon itself to guide men\'s lives. The State promised\nmen justice, peace, security, order, satisfaction of common intellectual\nand material wants; and, in compensation, men who served the State freed\nthemselves from taking part in the struggle for life. And the State\'s\nservants, as soon as they were able to utilize other men\'s labour, acted\nin the same way as the ministers of the Church.\n\nThey had not in view the people; but, from kings down to the lowest\nstate functionaries, in Rome, as well as in France, England, Russia, and\nAmerica, they gave themselves over to idleness and depravity. Now men\nhave lost their faith in the state, and anarchy is now seriously\nadvocated as an ideal. The state has lost its prestige among men, only\nbecause its ministers have claimed the right of utilizing the people\'s\nlabour for themselves.\n\n_Science and art_ have done the same, assisted by the state power which\nthey took upon themselves to sustain. They also have claimed and\nobtained for themselves the right of idleness and of utilizing other\nmen\'s labour, and also have been false to their calling. And their\nerrors, too, proceeded only from the fact that their ministers, pointing\nto a falsely conceived principle of the division of labour, claimed for\nthemselves the right to utilize the work of the people, and so lost the\nmeaning of their calling, making the aim of their activity, not the\nutility of the people, but some mysterious activity of science and art;\nand also, like their forerunners, they have given themselves over to\nidleness and depravity, though not so much to a fleshly as to an\nintellectual corruption.\n\nIt is said that science and art have done much for mankind.\n\nThat is quite true.\n\nChurch and State have given much to humanity, not because they abused\ntheir power, or because their ministers forsook the common life of men,\nand the eternal duty of labour for life--but in spite of this.\n\nThe Roman Republic was powerful, not because its citizens were able to\nlead a life of depravity, but because it could number among them men who\nwere virtuous.\n\nThis is the case with science and art.\n\nScience and art have effected much for mankind, not because their\nministers had sometimes formerly, and have always at present, the\npossibility of freeing themselves from labour, but because men of\ngenius, not utilizing these rights, have forwarded the progress of\nmankind.\n\nThe class of learned men and artists who claim, on account of a false\ndivision of labour, the right of utilizing other men\'s labour, cannot\ncontribute to the progress of true science and true art, because a lie\ncan never produce a truth.\n\nWe are so accustomed to our pampered or debilitated representatives of\nintellectual labour, that it would seem very strange if a learned man or\nan artist were to plough, or cart manure. We think that, were he to do\nso, all would go to ruin; that all his wisdom would be shaken out of\nhim, and that the great artistic images he carries in his breast would\nbe soiled by the manure: but we are so accustomed to our present\nconditions that we do not wonder at our ministers of science, that is,\nministers and teachers of truth, compelling other people to do for them\nthat which they could very well do themselves, passing half their time\neating, smoking, chattering in "liberal" gossip, reading newspapers,\nnovels, visiting theatres; we are not surprised to see our philosopher\nin an inn, in a theatre, at a ball; we do not wonder when we learn that\nthose artists who delight and ennoble our souls, pass their lives in\ndrunkenness, in playing cards, in company with loose women, or do things\nstill worse.\n\nScience and art are fine things: but just because they are fine things\nmen ought not to spoil them by associating them with depravity;--by\nfreeing themselves from man\'s duty to serve by labour his own life and\nthe lives of other men.\n\nScience and art have forwarded the progress of mankind. Yes; but not\nbecause men of science and art, under the pretext of a division of\nlabour, taught men by word, and chiefly by deed, to utilize by violence\nthe misery and sufferings of the people in order to free themselves from\nthe very first and unquestionable human duty of labouring with their\nhands in the common struggle of mankind with nature.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\n"But," you say, "it is this very division of labour, the freeing men of\nscience and of art from the necessity of earning their bread, that has\nrendered possible the extraordinary success in science which we see\nto-day.\n\n"If everybody were to plough, these enormous results would not be\nattained; you would not have those astonishing successes which have so\nenlarged man\'s power over nature; you would not have those discoveries\nin astronomy which so strike the minds of men and promote navigation;\nthere would be no steamers, railways, wonderful bridges, tunnels,\nsteam-engines, telegraphs, photographs, telephones, sewing-machines,\nphonographs, electricity, telescopes, spectroscopes, microscopes,\nchloroform, Lister bandages, carbolic acid."\n\nI will not attempt to enumerate all the things of which our century is\nproud. This enumeration, and the ecstasy of the contemplation of\nourselves and of our great deeds you can find in almost every newspaper\nand popular book. And these raptures are so often repeated, and we are\nso seldom tired of praising ourselves, that we really have come to\nbelieve, with Jules Verne, that science and art never made such progress\nas in our time. And as all this is rendered possible only by division of\nlabour, how can we avoid countenancing it?\n\nLet us suppose that the progress of our century is really striking,\nastonishing, extraordinary; let us suppose, too, that we are\nparticularly lucky in living at such an extraordinary time: but let us\ntry to ascertain the value of these successes, not by our own\nself-contentment, but by the very principle of the division of labour;\nthat is, by the intellectual labour of scientists for the advantage of\nthe people which has to compensate for the freedom of its servants from\nmanual toil.\n\nThis progress is very striking indeed; but owing to some bad luck,\nrecognized, too, by the men of science, this progress has not yet\nameliorated, but has rather deteriorated, the condition of working men.\n\nThough a working man, instead of walking, can use the railway, it is\nthis very railway which has caused his forest to be burned and has\ncarried away his bread from under his very nose, and put him into a\ncondition which is next door to slavery to the railway proprietor.\n\nIf, thanks to steam-engines and machines, a workman can buy cheap and\nbad calico, it is these very engines and machines which have deprived\nhim of his livelihood and brought him to a state of entire slavery to\nthe manufacturer.\n\nIf there are telegraphs, which he is not forbidden to use but which he\ndoes not use because he cannot afford it, still each of his productions,\nthe value of which rises, is bought up at low prices before his very\neyes by capitalists, thanks to that telegraph, before he has even become\naware that the article is in demand.\n\nIf there are telephones and telescopes, novels, operas,\npicture-galleries, and so on, the life of the workman is not at all\nimproved by any of them, because all, owing to the same unlucky chance,\nare beyond his reach.\n\nSo that, after all, these wonderful discoveries and productions of art,\nif they have not made the life of working-people worse, have by no means\nimproved it: and on this the men of science are agreed.\n\nSo that, if we apply, not our self-contemplating rapture, but the very\nstandard on which the ground of the division of labour is\ndefended,--utility to the working-world,--to the question as to the\nreality of the successes attained by the sciences and arts, we shall see\nthat we have not yet any sound reason for the self-contentment to which\nwe consign ourselves so willingly.\n\nA peasant uses the railway; a peasant\'s wife buys calico; in the cottage\na lamp, and not a pine-knot, burns; and the peasant lights his pipe with\na match,--all this is comfortable; but what right have I from this to\nsay that railways and factories have done good to the people?\n\nIf a peasant uses the railway, and buys a lamp, calico, and matches, he\ndoes it only because we cannot forbid his doing so: but we all know very\nwell that railways and factories were not built for the use of the\npeople; and why, then, should the casual comfort a workman obtains by\nchance be brought forward as a proof of the usefulness of these\ninstitutions to the people?\n\nWe all know very well that if the engineers and capitalists who build a\nrailway or a factory thought about the working-people, they thought only\nhow to make the most possible use of them. And we see they have fully\nsucceeded in doing so in Europe and America, as well as in Russia.\n\nIn every hurtful thing there is something useful. After a house has been\nburned down we can sit and warm ourselves, and light our pipes from one\nof the fire-brands; but should we therefore say that a conflagration is\nbeneficial?\n\nWhatever we do, do not let us deceive ourselves. We all know very well\nthe motives for building railways and factories, and for producing\nkerosene and matches. An engineer builds a railway for the government,\nto facilitate wars, or for the capitalists for their financial purposes.\nHe makes machines for manufacturers for his own advantage and for the\nprofit of capitalists. All that he makes or plans he does for the\npurpose of the government, the capitalists, and other rich people. His\nmost skilful inventions are either directly harmful to the people, such\nas guns, torpedoes, solitary prisons, and so on; or they are not only\nuseless but quite inaccessible to them, such as electric light,\ntelephones, and the innumerable improvements of comfort; or lastly, they\ndeprave the people and rob them of their last kopek, that is, their last\nlabour, for spirits, wine, beer, opium, tobacco, finery, and all sorts\nof trifles.\n\nBut if it happens sometimes that the inventions of men of science and\nthe works of engineers, are of use to the people, as, for instance,\nrailways, calicoes, steel, scythes, it only proves that in this world of\nours everything is mutually connected, and that out of every hurtful\nactivity there may arise an accidental good for those to whom the\nactivity was hurtful.\n\nMen of science and of art could say that their activity was useful for\nthe people, only if in their activity they have aimed at serving the\npeople, as they now aim to serve the government and capitalists.\n\nWe could have said that, only if the men of science and art made the\nwants of the people their object; but such is not the case.\n\nAll learned men are occupied with their sacred businesses, which lead to\nthe investigation of protoplasms, the spectrum analysis of stars, and so\non: but concerning investigations as to how to set an axe, or with what\nkind it is more advantageous to hew; which saw is the most handy; with\nwhat flour bread shall be made, how it may best be kneaded, how to set\nit to rise; how to heat and to build stoves; what food, drink or\ncrockery-ware it is best to use; what mushrooms may be eaten, and how\nthey may be prepared more conveniently,--science never troubles itself,\nor does so very slightly.\n\nYet all this is the business of science.\n\nI know that, according to its own definition, science must be useless;\nbut this is only an excuse, and a very impudent one.\n\nThe business of science is to serve people. We have invented telegraphs,\ntelephones, phonographs, but what improvements have we made in the life\nof the people? We have catalogued two millions of insects! but have we\ndomesticated a single animal since biblical times, when all our animals\nhad long been domesticated, and still the elk and the deer, and the\npartridge and the grouse and the wood-hen, are wild?\n\nBotanists have discovered the cells, and in the cells protoplasms and in\nprotoplasms something else, and in this something else again.\n\nThese occupations will go on for a long time and evidently never end,\nand therefore learned men have no time to do anything useful. Hence from\nthe times of the ancient Egyptians and Hebrews, when wheat and lentils\nwere already cultivated, down to the present time, not a single plant\nhas been added for the nourishment of the people except potatoes, and\nthese were not discovered by science. We have invented torpedoes and\nhouse-drains; but the spinning-wheel, weaving-looms, ploughs and\naxe-handles, flails and rakes, buckets and well-sweeps, are still the\nsame as in the time of Rurik. If some things have been improved, it is\nnot the learned who have improved them, but the unlearned.\n\nThe same is the case with art. Many people are acclaimed as great\nwriters. We have carefully analyzed their works, have written mountains\nof critiques and criticisms upon criticisms, and still more criticisms\non criticisms; we have collected pictures in galleries, and thoroughly\nstudied in detail different schools of art; and we possess symphonies\nand operas that it is with great difficulty we ourselves can listen to;\nbut what have we added to the folk-lore, legends, tales, songs for the\npeople? what pictures, what music, have we created for the people?\n\nBooks and pictures are published, and harmoniums are made for the\npeople, but we did not participate in either.\n\nWhat is most striking and obvious is the false tendency of our science\nand art, which manifests itself in those departments which, according to\ntheir own propositions, would seem to be useful to people, but which,\nowing to this tendency, appear rather pernicious than useful. An\nengineer, a surgeon, a teacher, an artist, an author, seem by their very\nprofessions to be obliged to serve the people, but what do we see? With\nthe present tendency, they can bring to the people nothing but harm. An\nengineer and a mechanic must work with capital: without capital they are\ngood for nothing.\n\nAll their training is of such a nature that, in order to make use of it,\nthey need capital and the employment of work-people on a large scale, to\nsay nothing of the fact that they themselves are accustomed to spend\nfrom fifteen hundred to a thousand rubles a year on themselves, and\ntherefore cannot go to live in a village, since no one there can give\nthem any such remuneration: from their very occupations they are not fit\nfor the service of the people.\n\nThey understand how to calculate the arch of a bridge by means of the\nhigher mathematics, how to calculate power and the transfer of power in\nan engine, and so on: but they are at a loss to meet the plain\nrequirements of common labour; they do not know how to improve the\nplough or the cart; or how to make a brook passable, taking into\nconsideration the conditions of a workman\'s life.\n\nThey know and understand nothing of all this, less even than the poorest\npeasant does. Give them workshops, and plenty of people, order engines\nfrom abroad, and then they will arrange these matters. But to find out\nhow to ease the labour of the millions of the people in their present\nconditions, they do not know, and cannot do it; and therefore, by their\nknowledge and habits and wants, they are not at all fit for this\nbusiness.\n\nA surgeon is in a still worse condition. His imaginary science is of\nsuch a nature that he understands how to cure those only who have\nnothing to do and who can utilize other men\'s labour. He requires a\ncountless number of expensive accessories, instruments, medicines,\nsanitary dwellings, food, and drains, in order that he may act\nscientifically: besides his fee he demands such expenses that, in order\nto cure one patient, he must kill with starvation hundreds of those who\nbear this expense.\n\nHe has studied under eminent persons in the capital cities, who attended\nonly to those patients whom they may take into hospitals, or who can\nafford to buy all the necessary medicines and machines, and even go at\nonce from north to south, to these or those mineral waters, as the case\nmay be.\n\nTheir science is of such a kind that every country surgeon complains\nthat there is no possibility of attending to the work-people who are so\npoor that they cannot afford sanitary accommodations, and that there are\nno hospitals, and that he cannot attend to the business alone, that he\nrequires help and assistant-surgeons.\n\nWhat does this really mean?\n\nIt means this,--that the want of the necessaries of life is the chief\ncause of people\'s misfortunes, and the source of diseases as well as of\ntheir spreading and incurability. Now science, under the banner of "the\ndivision of labour," calls its champions to help the people. Science has\nsettled satisfactorily about the rich classes, and seeks how to cure\nthose who can get everything necessary for the purpose; and it sends\npersons to cure in the same way those who have nothing to spare. But\nthere are no means; and therefore they must be raised from the people,\nwho become ill and catch diseases, and cannot be cured for want of\nmeans.\n\nThe advocates of the healing art for the people say, that, up to the\npresent time, this business has not been sufficiently developed.\n\nEvidently it is not yet developed, because if (which God forbid!) it\nwere developed among our people, and, instead of two doctors and\nmid-wives and two assistant-surgeons in the district, there should be\ntwenty sent, as they want, then there would soon be no one left to\nattend to. The scientific co-operation for the benefit of the people\nmust be of quite a different kind. And this, which ought to exist, has\nnot yet begun.\n\nIt will begin when a man of science, an engineer, or a surgeon, ceases\nto consider lawful that division of labour, or rather that taking away\nother men\'s labour, which now exists, and when he no longer considers\nthat he has the right to take,--I do not say hundreds of thousands,--but\neven a moderate sum of one thousand or five hundred rubles as\ncompensation for his services; but when such a man comes to live among\nlabouring-people in the same condition and in the same way as they, and\napplies his information in mechanics, technics or hygiene, to cure them.\n\nBut at present, scientific men, who are fed at the expense of the\nworkman, have quite forgotten the conditions of the life of these men:\nthey ignore (as they say) these conditions, and are quite seriously\noffended that their imaginary knowledge does not find application among\nthe people.\n\nThe departments of the healing art as well as of the mechanical have not\nyet been touched: the questions how best to divide the period of labour,\nhow and upon what it is best to feed, how best to dress, how to\ncounteract dampness and cold, how best to wash, to suckle, and swaddle\nchildren, and so on, and all these applied to the conditions in which\nthe workers now exist,--all these questions have not yet been faced.\n\nThe same applies to the activity of scientific teachers,--the\npedagogues. Science has arranged this business, too, in such a way, that\nteaching according to science is possible only for those who are rich;\nand the teachers, like the engineers and surgeons, are involuntarily\ndrawn towards money, and among us in Russia especially towards the\ngovernment.\n\nAnd this cannot be otherwise, because a school properly arranged (and\nthe general rule is that the more scientifically a school is arranged\nthe more expensive it is), with convertible benches, globes, maps,\nlibraries, and manuals for teachers and pupils, is just such a school to\nmaintain which it is necessary to double the taxes of the people. So\nscience wants to have it. The children are necessary for work, and the\nmore so with the poorer people. The advocates of science say, "Pedagogy\nis even now of use for the people; but let it develop, then it will be\nstill better." But if it will develop till instead of 20 schools in a\ndistrict there will be 100--all of them scientific,--and the parents\nforced to keep up these schools? Then they will be still poorer, and\nwill want the labour of their children still more urgently.\n\nWhat is to be done then?\n\nTo this they will reply, "The government will establish schools, and\nwill make education obligatory as it is in the rest of Europe." But the\nmoney will still have to be raised from the people, and labour will be\nstill harder for them, and they will have less time to spare from their\nlabour, and there will then be no obligatory education at all.\n\nThere is, again, only one escape,--for a teacher to live in the\nconditions of a workman, and to teach for that compensation which will\nbe freely offered him.\n\nSuch is the false tendency of science which deprives it of the\npossibility to fulfil its duty in serving the people. But this false\ntendency of our educated class is still more obvious in art-activity,\nwhich, for the sake of its very meaning ought to be accessible to the\npeople.\n\nScience may point to its stupid excuse that "science is acting for\nscience," and that, when fully developed it will become accessible to\nthe people; but art, if it is art indeed, ought to be accessible to all,\nespecially to those for whose sake it is created. But our art strikingly\ndenounces its factors in that they do not wish, and do not understand,\nand are not able to be of use to the people. A painter, in order to\nproduce his great works, must have a large studio, in which at least\nforty joiners or boot-makers might work, who are now freezing or\nsuffocating in wretched lodgings. But this is not all: he requires\nmodels, costumes, journeys from place to place. The Academy of Art has\nspent millions of rubles, collected from the people, for the\nencouragement of art; and the productions of this art are hung in\npalaces, and are neither intelligible to the people nor wanted by them.\n\nMusicians, in order to express their great ideas, must gather about two\nhundred men with white neckties or in special costumes, and spend\nhundreds of thousands of rubles arranging operas. But this\nart-production would never appear to the people (even if they could\nafford to use it) as anything but perplexing or dull.\n\nThe authors, writers, would seem not to need any particular\naccommodations, studios, models, orchestras, or actors; but here also it\nturns out that an author, a writer, in order to prepare his great works,\nwants travelling, palaces, cabinets, enjoyments of art, theatres,\nconcerts, mineral waters, and so on; to say nothing of all the comforts\nof his dwelling and all the comforts of his life. If he himself has not\nsaved up enough money for this purpose he is given a pension in order\nthat he may compose better. And, again, these writings, which we value\nso highly, remain for the people, rubbish, and are not at all necessary\nto them.\n\nWhat if, according to the wish of men of science and art, such producers\nof mental food should so multiply, that, in every village it would be\nnecessary to build a studio, provide an orchestra, and keep an author in\nthe conditions which men of art consider indispensable to them? I dare\nsay working-people would make a vow never to look at a picture, or\nlisten to a symphony, or read poetry and novels, in order only not to be\ncompelled to feed all these good-for-nothing parasites.\n\nAnd why should not men of art serve the people? In every cottage there\nare holy images and pictures; each peasant, each woman of the people,\nsings; many have instruments of music; and all can relate stories,\nrepeat poetry; and many of them read. How came it to pass that these two\nthings, which were as much made for one another as a key for a lock,\nwere separated, and why are they so separated that we cannot imagine how\nto re-unite them?\n\nTell a painter to paint without a studio, models, costumes, and to draw\npenny pictures, and he will say that this would be a denial of art as he\nunderstands it. Tell a musician to play on a harmonium and to teach\ncountry-women to sing songs; tell a poet to throw aside writing poems\nand novels and satires, and to compose song-books for the people, and\nstories and tales which might be intelligible to illiterate\npersons,--they will say you are cracked.\n\nBut is it not being worse than cracked when the men who have freed\nthemselves from labour because they promised to provide mental food for\nthose who have brought them up, and are feeding and clothing them, have\nafterwards so forgotten their promise that they have ceased to\nunderstand how to make food fit for the people? Yet this very forsaking\nof their promises they consider dignifies them.\n\nSuch is the case everywhere, they say. Then everywhere the case is very\nunreasonable. And it will be so while men, under the pretext of division\nof labour, promise to provide mental food for the people, but only\nswallow up the labour of the people. Men will serve the people with\nscience and art only when living among them and in the same way as the\npeople do, putting forth no claims whatever, they offer to the people\ntheir scientific and artistic services, leaving it to the free will of\nthe people to accept or refuse them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nTo say that the activities of the arts and sciences have co-operated in\nforwarding the progress of mankind, and by these activities to mean that\nwhich is now called by this name, is as to say that an awkward moving of\nthe oars, hindering the progress of a boat going down the stream, is\nforwarding the progress of the boat; while it only hinders it. The\nso-called division of labour--that is, the violation of other men\'s\nlabour which has become in our time a condition of the activity of men\nof art and science--has been, and still remains, the chief cause of the\nslowness of the progress of mankind.\n\nThe proof of it we have in the acknowledgement that the acquisitions of\nart and science are not accessible to the working-classes because of a\nwrong distribution of wealth. And the incorrectness of this distribution\ndoes not diminish in proportion to the progress of art and science, but\nrather increases. Nor is it astonishing that such is the case; because\nthe incorrect distribution of wealth proceeds solely from the theory of\nthe division of labour, preached by men of art and science for selfish\npurposes.\n\nScience, defending the division of labour as an unchangeable law, sees\nthat the distribution of wealth based upon this division is incorrect\nand pernicious, and asserts that its activity, which recognizes the\ndivision of labour, will set all right again, and lead men to happiness.\n\nIt appears, then, that some men utilize the labour of others; but if\nthey will only continue to do this for a long time, and on a still\nlarger scale, then this incorrect distribution of wealth, that is,\nutilizing of other men\'s labour, will vanish.\n\nMen are standing by an ever-increasing spring of water, and are busy\nturning it aside from thirsty men, and then they assert that it is they\nwho produce this water, and that soon there will be so much of it that\neverybody will have enough and to spare. And this water, which has been\nrunning unceasingly, and nourishing all mankind, is not only not the\nresult of the activity of those who, standing at its source, turn it\naside, but it runs and spreads itself in spite of the endeavours to stop\nit from doing so.\n\nThere has always existed a true church,--in other words, men united by\nthe highest truth accessible to them at a certain epoch,--but it has\nnever been that church which gave herself out for such; and there have\nalways been real art and science, but they were not those which call\nthemselves now by these names.\n\nMen who consider themselves to be the representatives of art and science\nin a given period of time, always imagine that they have been doing, are\ndoing, and the important fact is that they are on the point of making\nwonderful things, and that beyond them there has never been any art or\nscience. Thus it seemed to the sophists, to the scholiasts, alchemists,\ncabalists, Talmudists, and to our own scientific science and to our\nartistic art.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\n"But science! art! You repudiate science, art; that is, you repudiate\nthat by which mankind live."\n\nI am always hearing this: people choose this way to put aside my\narguments altogether without analyzing them. "He repudiates science and\nart; he wishes to turn men back again to the savage state; why, then,\nshould we listen to him, or argue with him?"\n\nBut this is unjust. Not only do I not repudiate science--human\nreasonable activity--and art,--the expression of this reasonable\nactivity,--but it is actually in the name of this reasonable activity\nand its expression that I speak what I do, in order that mankind may\navoid the savage state towards which they are rapidly moving, owing to\nthe false teaching of our time.\n\nScience and art are as necessary to men as food, drink, and\nclothes,--even still more necessary than these; but they become such,\nnot because we decide that what we call science and art are necessary,\nbut because they are truly necessary to men. Now, if I should prepare\nhay for the bodily food of men, my idea that hay is food would not make\nit to be so. I cannot say, Why do you not eat hay when it is your\nnecessary food? Food is, indeed, necessary, but perhaps what I offer is\nnot food at all.\n\nThis very thing has happened with our science and art. And to us it\nseems that when we add to a Greek word the termination _logy_, and call\nthis science, it will be science indeed; and if we call an indecency,\nlike the painting of naked women, by the Greek word "choreography," and\nterm it art, it will be art indeed.\n\nBut however much we may say this, the business which we are about, in\ncounting up the insects, and chemically analyzing the contents of the\nMilky Way, in painting water-nymphs and historical pictures, in writing\nnovels, and in composing symphonies, this, our business, will not become\nscience or art until it is willingly accepted by those for whom it is\nbeing done.\n\nTill now it has not been accepted. If some men only were allowed to\nprepare food, and all others were either forbidden to do it, or be\nrendered incapable of producing it, I daresay that the quality of the\nfood would deteriorate. If the men who had the exclusive privilege of\nproducing food were Russian peasants, then there would be no other food\nthan black bread, kvas, potatoes, and onions, which they are fond of,\nand which is agreeable to them. The same would be the case with that\nhighest human activity in art and science if their exclusive privilege\nwere appropriated by one caste, with this difference only, that in\nbodily food there cannot be too great digressions from the\nnatural;--bread as well as onions, though unsavoury food, is still\neatable:--but in mental food there may be great digressions; and some\nmen may for a very long time feed upon an unnecessary, or even hurtful\nand poisonous, mental food; they themselves may slowly kill themselves\nwith opium or with spirits, and this sort of food they may offer to the\nmasses of the people.\n\nThis very thing has happened to us. And it has happened because men of\nart and science are in privileged conditions; because art and science in\nour world are not that mental activity of all mankind, without any\nexception, who separate their best powers for the service of art and\nscience: but it is the activity of a small company of men having the\nmonopoly of these occupations, and calling themselves scientists and\nartists; and therefore they have perverted the very conceptions of art\nand science, and lost the sense of their own calling, and are merely\noccupied in amusing a small company of parasites and saving them from\nburdensome dulness.\n\nSince men have existed, they have always had science in the plainest and\nlargest sense of the word. Science, as the sum of all human information,\nhas always been in existence; and without it life is not conceivable,\nand there is no necessity whatever either to attack or to defend it.\n\nBut the fact is this, that the reason of this knowledge is so various,\nso much information of all kinds enters into it, from information how to\nobtain iron up to the knowledge about movements of the celestial bodies,\nthat man would be lost among all this varied information if he had no\nclew to help him to decide which of all these kinds of information is\nmore important, and which less.\n\nTherefore, the highest wisdom of men has always consisted in finding out\nthe clew whereby to arrange the information of men, and to decide what\nkinds of information are more, and what are less, important. This which\nhas directed all other knowledge, men have always called science in the\nstrictest sense of the word. Such science has always been, up to the\npresent time, in human societies which have left the savage state behind\nthem. Since mankind has existed teachers have appeared in every nation\nto form science in this strict sense,--the science about what it is most\nnecessary for men to know. The object of this science has always been\nthe inquiry as to what was the destiny, and therefore the true welfare,\nof each man and of all men. This science has served as a clew to\ndetermine the importance and the expression of all other sciences. Such\ninformation and art as co-operated with the science of man\'s destiny and\nwelfare were considered highest in public opinion.\n\nSuch was the science of Confucius, Buddha, Moses, Socrates, Christ,\nMohammed,--science such as it has been understood by all men save our\nown circle of so-called educated people.\n\nSuch a science has not only always occupied the first place, but it is\nthe one science which has determined the importance of other sciences.\nAnd this, not at all because so-called learned men of our time imagine\nthat it is only deceitful priests and teachers of this science who have\ngiven it such an importance, but because, as, indeed, everyone can learn\nby his own inward experience, without the science of man\'s destiny and\nwelfare, there cannot be any determining of other values, or any choice\nof art and science for man. And, therefore, there cannot be any study of\nscience, for there are _innumerable_ quantities of subjects to which\nscience may be applied. I italicize the word innumerable, as I use it in\nits exact value.\n\nWithout knowledge as to what constitutes the calling and welfare of all\nmen, all other arts and sciences become, as is really the case with us\nat present, only an idle and pernicious amusement. Mankind have been\nliving long, and they have never been living without a science relative\nto the calling and welfare of men: it is true that the science of the\nwelfare of men to a superficial observation appears to be different with\nBuddists, Brahmins, Hebrews, Christians, with the followers of Confucius\nand those of Laotse, though one need only reflect on these teachings in\norder to see their essential unity; where men have left the savage state\nbehind them, we find this science; and now of a sudden it turns out that\nmodern men have decided that this very science which has been till now\nthe guide of all human information, is the obstacle in the way of\neverything.\n\nMen build houses; one architect makes one estimate, another makes a\nsecond, and so on. The estimates are a little different, but they are\nseparately correct; and every one sees that, if each estimate is\nfulfilled, the house will be erected. Such architects are Confucius,\nBuddha, Moses, Christ. And now certain men come and assure us that the\nchief thing to come by is the absence of any estimate, and that men\nought to build anyhow according to eyesight. And this "anyhow" these men\ncall the most exact science, as the Pope terms himself the "most holy."\n\nMen deny every science, the most essential science of men\'s calling and\nwelfare; and this denial of science they call science. Since men have\nexisted, great intellects have always appeared, which, in the struggle\nwith the demands of their reason and conscience, have put to themselves\nquestions concerning the calling and welfare, not only of themselves\nindividually, but of every man. What does that Power, which created me,\nrequire from me and from each man? And what am I to do in order to\nsatisfy the craving ingrafted in me for a personal and a common welfare?\n\nThey have asked themselves, I am a whole and a part of something\nunfathomable, infinite: what are to be my relations to other parts\nsimilar to me,--to men and to the whole?\n\nAnd from the voice of conscience and from reason, and from consideration\non what men have said who lived before, and from contemporaries who have\nasked themselves the same questions, these great teachers have deduced\nteachings,--plain, clear, intelligible to all men, and always such as\ncan be put into practice.\n\nSuch men were of the first, second, third, and all magnitudes. The world\nis full of such men. All living men put to themselves the question, How\nam I to reconcile my own demands for personal life with conscience and\nreason, which demand the common good of all men? And out of this common\ntravail new forms of life are evolved slowly, but unceasingly,\nsatisfying more and more the demands of reason and conscience.\n\nAnd of a sudden a new caste of men appears, who say, All these are\nnonsense, and are to be left behind. This is the deductive way of\nthinking (though wherein lies the difference between the inductive and\nthe deductive way of thinking, nobody ever has been able to understand),\nand this is also the method of the theological and metaphysical periods.\n\nAll that men have understood by inward experience, and have related to\neach other concerning the consciousness of the law of their own life\n(functional activity, in their cant phrase); all that from the beginning\nof the world has been done in this direction by the greatest intellects\nof mankind,--all these are trifles, having no weight whatever.\n\nAccording to this new teaching, you are the cell of an organism, and the\nproblem of your reasonable activity consists in trying to ascertain your\nfunctional activity. In order to ascertain this, you must make\nobservations outside yourself.\n\nThe fact that you are a cell which thinks, suffers, speaks, and\nunderstands, and that for that very reason you can inquire of another\nsimilar speaking, suffering cell whether he or she suffers and rejoices\nin the same way as yourself, and that thus you may verify your own\nexperience; and the fact that you may make use of what the speaking\ncells, who lived and suffered before you wrote on the subject; and your\nknowledge that millions of cells agreeing with what the past cells have\nwritten, confirm your own experience, that you yourself are a living\ncell, who always, by a direct inward experience, apprehend the\ncorrectness or incorrectness of your own functional activity,--all this\nmeans nothing, we are told: it is all a false and evil method.\n\nThe true scientific method is this: If you wish to learn in what your\nfunctional activity consists, what is your destiny and welfare, and what\nthe destiny of mankind, and of the whole world, then first you must\ncease to listen to the voice and demands of your conscience and of your\nreason, which manifest themselves inwardly to you and to your\nfellow-men; you must leave off believing all that the great teachers of\nhumanity have said about their own conscience and reason, and you must\nconsider all this to be nonsense, and begin at the beginning.\n\nAnd in order to begin from the beginning, you have to observe through a\nmicroscope the movements of amoeb\xc3\xa6 and the cells of tape-worms; or,\nstill easier, you must believe everything that people with the diploma\nof infallibility may tell you about them. And observing the movements of\nthese amoeb\xc3\xa6 and cells, or reading what others have seen, you must\nascribe to these cells your own human feelings and calculations as to\nwhat they desire, what are their tendencies, their reflections and\ncalculations, their habits; and from these _observations_ (in which each\nword contains some mistake of thought or of expression), according to\nanalogy, you must deduce what is your own destiny, and what that of\nother cells similar to you.\n\nIn order to be able to understand yourself, you must study not merely\nthe tape-worm which you see, but also microscopic animalcules which you\ncannot see, and the transformation from one set of things into another,\nwhich neither you nor anybody else has ever seen, and which you\ncertainly will never see.\n\nThe same holds good with art. Wherever a true science has existed, it\nhas been expressed by art. Since men have existed they have always\nseparated out of all their activities, from their varied information,\nthe chief expression of science, the knowledge of man\'s destination and\nwelfare; and art, in the strict sense of the word, has been the\nexpression of this.\n\nSince men have existed, there have always been persons particularly\nsensitive to the teaching of man\'s welfare and destiny, who have\nexpressed in word, and upon psaltery and cymbals, their human struggle\nwith deceit which led them aside from their true destiny, and their\nsufferings in this struggle, their hopes about the victory of good,\ntheir despair about the triumph of evil, and their raptures in\nexpectation of coming welfare.\n\nSince men have existed, the true art, that which has been valued most\nhighly by men, had no other destiny than to be the expression of science\non man\'s destiny and welfare.\n\nAlways down to the present time art has served the teaching of life\n(afterwards called religion), and it has only been this art which men\nhave valued so highly.\n\nBut contemporaneously with the fact that in place of the science of\nman\'s destiny and welfare appears the science of universal\nknowledge,--since science lost its own sense and meaning, and true\nscience has been scornfully called religion,--true art, as an important\nactivity of men, has disappeared.\n\nAs long as the church existed, and taught men\'s calling and welfare, art\nserved the church, and was true; but from the moment it left the church,\nand began to serve a science which served everything it met, art lost\nits meaning, and, notwithstanding its old-fashioned claims, and a stupid\nassertion that art serves merely art itself, and nothing else, it has\nturned out to be a trade which procures luxuries for men, and\nunavoidably mixes itself with choreography, culinary art, hair-dressing,\nand cosmetics, the producers of which may call themselves artists with\nas much right as the poets, painters, and musicians of our day.\n\nLooking back, we see that during thousands of years, from among\nthousands of millions of men who have lived, there came forth a few like\nConfucius, Buddha, Solon, Socrates, Solomon, Homer, Isaiah, David. True\nartist-producers of spiritual food seem to appear seldom among men,\nnotwithstanding the fact that they appear, not from one caste only, but\nfrom among all men; and it is not without cause that mankind have always\nso highly valued them. And now it turns out that we have no longer any\nneed of all these former great factors of art and science.\n\nNow, according to the law of the division of labour, it is possible to\nmanufacture scientific and artistic factors almost mechanically; and in\nthe space of ten years we shall manufacture more great men of art and\nscience than have been born among all men from the beginning of the\nworld. Nowadays there is a trade corporation of learned men and artists,\nand by an improved way they prepare all the mental food which is wanted\nby mankind. And they have prepared so much of it, that there need no\nlonger be any remembrance of the old producers, not only of the very\nancient, but also of the more recent,--all their activity, we are told,\nwas the activity of the theological and metaphysical period: all had to\nbe destroyed, and the true, mental activity began some fifty years ago.\n\nAnd in these fifty years we have manufactured so many great men that in\na German university there are more of them than have been in the whole\nworld, and of sciences we have manufactured a great number too; for one\nneed only put to a Greek word the termination _logy_, and arrange the\nsubject according to ready-made paragraphs, and the science is created:\nwe have thus manufactured so many sciences that not only cannot one man\nknow them all, but he cannot even remember all their names,--these names\nalone would fill a large dictionary; and every day new sciences come\ninto existence.\n\nIn this respect we are like that Finnish teacher who taught the children\nof a land-owner the Finnish language instead of the French. He taught\nvery well; but there was one drawback,--that nobody, except himself,\nunderstood it. We have learned everything very well, but the pity of it\nis that nobody but ourselves understands it, and that everybody else\nconsiders it good-for-nothing nonsense.\n\nBut to this also there is an explanation: Men do not understand all the\nutility of the scientific science because they are still under the\ninfluence of the theological period of knowledge, that stupid period\nwhen all the people of the Hebrew race, as well as the Chinese and\nIndians and Greeks, understood everything spoken to them by their great\nteachers.\n\nBut whatever may be the cause, the fact is this,--that art and science\nhave always existed among mankind; and when they really existed, then\nthey were necessary and intelligible to all men.\n\nWe are busy about something which we call art and science, and it turns\nout that what we are busy about is neither necessary nor intelligible to\nmen. So that we have no right to give the name of art or science to our\ndoings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nBut it is said to me, "You only give another narrower definition of art\nand science, which science does not agree with; but even this does not\nexclude them, and notwithstanding all you say, there still remains the\nscientific and art activities of men like Galileo, Bruno, Homer, Michael\nAngelo, Beethoven, Wagner, and other learned men and artists of lesser\nmagnitude who have devoted all their lives to art and science."\n\nUsually this is said in the endeavour to establish a link, which in\nother cases they disown, to connect the activity of the former learned\nmen and artists with the modern ones, trying to forget that new\nprinciple of the division of labour by reason of which art and science\nnow occupy a privileged position.\n\nFirst of all, it is not possible to establish any such connection\nbetween the former factors and the modern ones, even as the holy life of\nthe first Christian has nothing in common with the lives of popes: thus,\nthe activity of men like Galileo, Shakespeare, Beethoven, has nothing in\ncommon with the activities of men like Tyndal, Hugo, and Wagner. As the\nHoly Fathers would have denied any connection with the Popes, so the\nancient factors of science would have denied any relationship with the\nmodern ones.\n\nSecondly, owing to that importance which art and science ascribe to\nthemselves, they have established a very clear standard by means of\nwhich we are able to determine whether they do, or do not, fulfil their\ndestiny; and we therefore decide, not without proofs, but according to\ntheir own standard, whether that activity which calls itself art and\nscience has, or has not, any right thus to call itself.\n\nThough the Egyptians or Greek priests performed mysteries known to none\nbut themselves, and said that these mysteries included all art and\nscience, I could not, on the ground of the asserted utility of these to\nthe people, ascertain the reality of their science, because this said\nscience, according to their _ipse dixit_, was a supernatural one: but\nnow we all have a very clear and plain standard, excluding everything\nsupernatural; art and science promise to fulfil the mental activity of\nmankind, for the welfare of society, or even of the whole of mankind.\nTherefore we have a right to call only such activity, art and science,\nwhich has this aim in view, and attains it. And therefore, however those\nlearned men and artists may call themselves, who excogitate the theory\nof penal laws, of state laws, and of the laws of nations, who invent new\nguns and explosive substances, who compose obscene operas and operettas,\nor similarly obscene novels, we have no right to call such activity the\nactivity of art and science, because this activity has not in view the\nwelfare of the society or of mankind, but on the contrary is directed to\nthe harm of men.\n\nIn like manner, however these learned men may call themselves, who in\ntheir simplicity are occupied during all their lives with the\ninvestigations of the microscopical animalcule and of telescopical and\nspectral phenomena; or those artists who, after having carefully\ninvestigated the monuments of old times, are busy writing historical\nnovels, making pictures, concocting symphonies and beautiful verses, all\nthese men, notwithstanding all their zeal, cannot, according to the\ndefinition of their own science, be called men of science or art, first\nbecause their activity in science for the sake of science, and of art\nfor art, has not in view man\'s welfare; and secondly, because we do not\nsee any results of these activities for the welfare of society or\nmankind.\n\nThe fact that sometimes something useful or agreeable for some men comes\nof their activities, by no means gives us any right, according to their\nown scientific definition, to consider them to be men of art and\nscience.\n\nIn like manner, however those men may call themselves who excogitate the\napplication of electricity to lighting, heating, and motion; or who\ninvent some new chemical combinations, producing dynamite or fine\ncolours; men who correctly play Beethoven\'s symphonies; who act on the\nstage, or paint portraits well, domestic pictures, landscapes, and other\npictures; who compose interesting novels, the object of which is merely\nto amuse rich people,--the activity of these men cannot be called art\nand science, because this activity is not directed, like the activity of\nthe brain in the organism, to the welfare of the whole, but is guided\nmerely by personal gain, privileges, money, which one obtains for the\ninventing and producing of so-called art. Therefore this activity cannot\npossibly be separated from other covetous, personal activity, which adds\nagreeable things to life, as the activity of innkeepers, jockeys,\nmilliners, prostitutes, and so on, because the activity of the first,\nthe second, and the last, do not come under the definition of art and\nscience, on the ground of the division of labour, which promises to\nserve for the welfare of all mankind.\n\nThe scientific definition of art and science is a correct one; but\nunluckily, the activity of modern art and science does not come under\nit. Some produce directly hurtful things, others useless things; and a\nthird party invents trifles fit only for the use of rich people. They\nmay all be very good persons, but they do not fulfil what they have\ntaken upon themselves to fulfil, according to their own definition; and\ntherefore they have as little right to call themselves men of art and\nscience as the modern clergy, who do not fulfil their duties, have right\nto consider themselves the bearers and teachers of divine truth.\n\nIt is not difficult to understand why the factors of modern art and\nscience have not fulfilled their calling, and cannot fulfil it. They do\nnot fulfil it, because they have converted their duty into a right. The\nscientific and art activities, in their true sense, are fruitful only\nwhen they ignore their rights, and know only their duties. Mankind value\nthis activity so highly, only because it is a self-denying one.\n\nIf men are really called to serve others by _mental_ labour, they will\nhave to suffer in performing this labour, because it is only by\nsuffering that spiritual fruit is produced. Selfdenying and suffering\nare the lot and portion of a thinker and an artist, because their object\nis the welfare of men. Men are wretched: they suffer and go to ruin. One\ncannot wait and lose one\'s time.\n\nA thinker and an artist will never sit on the heights of Olympus, as we\nare apt to imagine: he must suffer in company with men in order to find\nsalvation or consolation. He will suffer because he is constantly in\nanxiety and agitation; he might have found out and told what would give\nhappiness to men, might have saved them from suffering; and he has\nneither found it out nor said it, and to-morrow it may be too late--he\nmay die. And therefore suffering and self-sacrifice will always be the\nlot of the thinker and the artist.\n\nHe who is brought up in an establishment where learned men and artists\nare created (but, in reality, they create only destroyers of art and\nscience), and who obtains a diploma, and is well provided for, for life,\nwill not become a thinker or an artist, but he who would gladly abstain\nfrom thinking, and from expressing that which is ingrafted in his soul,\nbut which he dare not overlook, being drawn to it by two irresistible\npowers,--his own inward impulse and the wants of men.\n\nThinkers and artists cannot be sleek, fat men, enjoying themselves in\nself-conceit. Spiritual and mental activity and their expressions are\nreally necessary for others, and are the most difficult of men\'s\ncallings,--a cross, as it is called in the gospel.\n\nThe only one certain characteristic of the presence of a calling is this\nself-denying,--the sacrifice of one\'s self in order to manifest the\npower ingrafted in man for the benefit of others. To teach how many\ninsects there are in the world, and to observe the spots on the sun, to\nwrite novels and operas, can be done without suffering; but to teach men\ntheir welfare, which entirely consists in self denial and in serving\nothers, and to express this teaching powerfully, cannot be done without\nself-denial.\n\nThe Church existed in her purity as long as her teachers endured\npatiently and suffered; but as soon as they became fat and sleek, their\nteaching activity ended. "Formerly," say the people, "priests were of\ngold, and chalices of wood; now chalices are of gold, and priests of\nwood." It was not in vain that Jesus Christ died on a cross: it is not\nin vain that sacrifice and suffering conquer every thing.\n\nAs for our art and sciences, they are provided for: they have diplomas,\nand everybody only thinks about how to provide still better for them;\nthat is, to make it impossible for them to serve men. A true art and a\ntrue science have two unmistakable characteristics,--the first, an\ninterior one, that a minister of art or science fulfils his calling, not\nfor the sake of gain, but with self-denial; and the second, an exterior\none, that his productions are intelligible to all men, whose welfare he\nis aiming at.\n\nWhatever men may consider to be their destiny and welfare, science will\nbe the teacher of this destiny and welfare, and art the expression of\nthis teaching. The laws of Solon, of Confucius, are science; the\nteachings of Moses, of Christ, are science; the temples in Athens, the\npsalms of David, church worship, are art: but finding out the fourth\ndimension of matter, and tabulating chemical combinations, and so on,\nhave never been, and never will be, science.\n\nThe place of true science is occupied, in our time, by theology and law;\nthe place of true art is occupied by the church and state ceremonies, in\nwhich nobody believes, and which are not considered seriously by\nanybody; while that which with us is called art and science, is only the\nproduction of idle minds and feelings desirous to stimulate similarly\nidle minds and feelings, and unintelligible and dumb for the people,\nbecause they have not their welfare in view.\n\nSince we have known the lives of men, we have always and everywhere\nfound a ruling false doctrine, calling itself science, which does not\nshow men the true meaning of life, but rather hides it from them.\n\nSo it was among the Egyptians, the Indians, the Chinese, and partially\namong the Greeks (sophists); and among the mystics, Gnostics, and\ncabalists; in the Middle Ages, in theology, scholasticism, alchemy; and\nso on down to our days. How fortunate indeed we are to be living in such\na peculiar time, when that mental activity which calls itself science is\nnot only free from errors, but, we are assured, is in a state of\npeculiar progress! Does not this good fortune come from the fact that\nman can not and will not see his own deformities? While of the sciences\nof theologians, and that of cabalists, nothing is left but empty words,\nwhy should we be so particularly fortunate?\n\nThe characteristics of our times and of former times are quite similar;\nthere is the same self-conceit and blind assurance that we only are on\nthe true way, and that only with us true knowledge begins; there are the\nsame expectations that we shall presently discover something very\nwonderful; and there is the same exposure of our error, in the fact that\nall our wisdom remains with us, while the masses of the people do not\nunderstand it, and neither accept nor need it. Our position is a very\ndifficult one, but why should we not look it in the face?\n\nIt is time to come to our senses, and to look more closely to ourselves.\nWe are, indeed, nothing but scribes and Pharisees, who, sitting in\nMoses\' seat, and having the key of the kingdom of God, do not enter\nthemselves, and refuse entrance to others.\n\nWe, priests of art and science, are most wretched deceivers, who have\nmuch less right to our position than the most cunning and depraved\npriests ever had.\n\nFor our privileged position, there is no excuse whatever: we have taken\nup this position by a kind of swindling, and we retain it by deceit.\nPagan priests, the clergy, Russian as well as Roman Catholic, however\ndepraved they may have been, had rights to their position, because they\nprofessed to teach men about life and salvation. And we, who have cut\nthe ground from under their feet, and proved to men that they were\ndeceivers, we have taken their place, and not only do not teach men\nabout life, we even acknowledge that there is no necessity for them to\nlearn. We suck the blood of the people, and for this we teach our\nchildren Greek and Latin grammars so that they also may continue the\nsame parasitic life which we are living.\n\nWe say, There have been castes, we will abolish them. But what means the\nfact that some men and their children work, and other men and their\nchildren do not work?\n\nBring a Hindu who does not know our language, and show him the Russian\nand the European lives of many generations, and he will recognize the\nexistence of two important definite castes of working-people and of\nnon-working people as they are in existence in his own country. As in\nhis country, so also among us, the right of not working is acquired\nthrough a peculiar initiation which we call art and science, and\neducation generally.\n\nIt is this education, and the perversions of reason associated with it,\nthat have brought to us this wonderful folly, whence it has come to pass\nthat we do not see what is so plain and certain. We are eating up the\nlives of our brethren, and consider ourselves to be Christians, humane,\neducated, and quite in the right.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\nWhat is to be done? What must we do?\n\nThis question, which includes acknowledgment of the fact that our life\nis bad and unrighteous, and at the same time hints that there is no\npossibility of changing it,--this question I hear everywhere, and\ntherefore I chose it for the title of my work.\n\nI have described my own sufferings, my search, and the answer which I\nhave found to this question.\n\nI am a man like others; and if I distinguish myself from an average man\nof my own circle in any thing, it is chiefly in the fact that I, more\nthan this average man, have served and indulged the false teaching of\nour world, that I have been more praised by the men of the prevalent\nschool of teaching, and that therefore I am more depraved, and have gone\nfarther astray, than most of my fellows.\n\nTherefore I think that the answer to this question which I have found\nfor myself will do for all sincere persons who will put the same\nquestion to themselves. First of all, to the question, "What is to be\ndone?" I answer that I must neither deceive other men nor myself; that I\nmust not be afraid of the truth, whatever the result may be.\n\nWe all know what it is to deceive other men; and notwithstanding this,\nwe do deceive from morning to evening,--"Not at home," when I am in;\n"Very glad," when I am not at all glad; "Esteemed," when I do not\nesteem; "I have no money," when I have it, and so on.\n\nWe consider the deception of others to be evil, particularly a certain\nkind of deception, but we are not afraid to deceive ourselves: yet the\nworst direct lie to men, seeing its result, is nothing in comparison\nwith that lie to ourselves according to which we shape our lives. Now,\nthis very lie we must avoid if we wish to be able to answer the\nquestion, "_What is to be done?_"\n\nIndeed, how am I to answer the question as to what is to be done, when\nevery thing I do, all my life, is based upon a lie and I carefully give\nout this lie to others and to myself as truth? Not to lie in this sense\nmeans to be not afraid of truth; not to invent excuses, and not to\naccept excuses invented by others, in order to hide from one\'s self the\ndeductions of reason and conscience; not to be afraid of contradicting\nall our surroundings, and of being left alone with reason and\nconscience; not to be afraid of that condition to which truth and\nconscience lead us: however dreadful it may be, it cannot be worse than\nthat which is based upon deceit.\n\nTo avoid lying, for men in our privileged position of mental labour,\nmeans not to be afraid of truth. Perhaps we owe so much that we should\nnever be able to pay it all; but however much we may owe, we must make\nout our bill: however far we have gone astray, it is better to return\nthan to continue straying.\n\nLying to our fellows is always disadvantageous. Every business is always\nmore directly done by truth than by lies, and more quickly too. Lying to\nother men makes matters only more complicated, and retards the decision;\nbut lying to one\'s self, which is given out to be the truth, entirely\nruins the life of man.\n\nIf a man considers a wrong road to be a right one, then his every step\nleads him only farther from his aim: a man who has been walking for a\nlong time on a wrong road may find out for himself, or be told by\nothers, that his road is a wrong one; but if he, being afraid of the\nthought how far he has gone astray, tries to assure himself that he may,\nby following this wrong course, still come across the right one, then he\nwill certainly never find it. If a man becomes afraid of the truth, and,\non seeing it, will not acknowledge it, but accepts falsehood for truth,\nthen this man will never learn what is to be done.\n\nWe, not only rich men, but men in privileged position, so-called\neducated men, have gone so far astray that we require either a firm\nresolution or very great sufferings on our false way to bring us to our\nsenses again, and to recognize the lie by which we live.\n\nI became aware of the lie of our life, thanks to those sufferings to\nwhich my wrong road led me; and, having acknowledged the error of the\nway on which I was bent, I had the boldness to go, first in theory, then\nin reality, wherever my reason and conscience led me, without any\ndeliberation as to whither they were tending.\n\nI was rewarded for this boldness.\n\nAll the complex, disjointed, intricate, and meaningless phenomena of\nlife surrounding me became of a sudden clear; and my position among\nthese phenomena, formerly so strange and vile, became of a sudden\nnatural and easy.\n\nIn this new position my activity has exactly determined itself, but it\nis quite a different activity from that which appeared possible to me\nbefore: it is a new activity, far more quiet, affectionate, and joyous.\nThe very thing which frightened me before, now attracts me.\n\nTherefore, I think that every one who sincerely puts to himself the\nquestion, "What is to be done?" and in answering this question, does not\nlie or deceive himself, but goes wherever his reason _and conscience_\nmay lead him, that man has already answered the question.\n\nIf he will only avoid deceiving himself, he will find out what to do,\nwhere to go, and how to act. There is only one thing which may hinder\nhim in finding an answer,--that is too high an estimate of himself, and\nof his own position. So it was with me; and therefore the second answer\nto the question, "What is to be done?" resulting from the first,\nconsisted for me in repenting, in the full meaning of this word: that\nis, entirely changing the estimate of my own position and activity.\nInstead of considering such to be useful and of importance, we must come\nto acknowledge it to be harmful and trifling; instead of considering\nourselves educated, we must come to see our ignorance; instead of\nimagining ourselves to be kind and moral, we must acknowledge that we\nare immoral and cruel; instead of seeing our importance, we must see our\nown insignificance.\n\nI say, that besides avoiding lying to myself, I had moreover to\n_repent_, because, though the one results from the other, the wrong idea\nabout my great importance was so much a part of my own nature, that\nuntil I had sincerely repented, and had put aside that wrong estimate of\nmyself, I did not see the enormity of the lie of which I had been\nguilty.\n\nIt was only when I repented,--that is, left off considering myself to be\na peculiar man, and began to consider myself to be like _all_ other\nmen,--it was then that my way became clear to me. Before this I was not\nable to answer the question, "What is to be done?" because the very\nquestion itself was put incorrectly.\n\nBefore I repented, I had put the question thus: "What activity should I\nchoose, I, the man with the education and talents I have acquired? How\ncan I compensate by this education and these talents for what I have\nbeen taking away from the people?"\n\nThis question was a false one, because it included the wrong idea of my\nnot being like other men, but a peculiar man, called to serve other men\nwith those talents and that education which I had acquired in forty\nyears.\n\nI had put the question to myself, but in reality I had already answered\nit in advance by having determined beforehand that I was called upon to\nserve men by the kind of activity agreeable to myself. I really asked\nmyself, "How can I, so fine a writer, one so very well informed, and\nwith such talents, how can I utilize those talents for the benefit of\nmankind?"\n\nBut the question ought to have been put thus,--as it would have to be\nput to a learned rabbi who had studied all the Talmud, and knew the\nexact number of letters in the Holy Scripture, and all the subtleties of\nhis science:--"What can I do, who, from unlucky circumstances, have lost\nmy best years in study instead of accommodating myself to labour,--in\nlearning the French language, the piano, grammar, geography, law,\npoetry; in reading novels, romances, philosophical theories, and in\nperforming military exercises? what can I do, who have passed the best\nyears of my life in idle occupations, depraving the soul? what can I do,\nnotwithstanding these unlucky conditions of the past, in order to\nrequite those men, who, during all this time, have fed and clothed me,\nand who still continue to feed and to clothe me?"\n\nIf the question had been put thus, after I had repented, "What can I, so\nruined a man, do?" the answer would have been easy: First of all, I must\ntry to get my living honestly,--that is, learn not to live upon the\nshoulders of others; and while learning this, and after I have learned\nit, to try on every occasion to be of use to men with my hands and with\nmy feet, as well as with my brain and my heart, and with all of me that\nis wanted by men.\n\nTherefore I say that for one of my own circle, besides avoiding lying to\nothers and ourselves, it is further necessary to repent, to lay aside\npride about our education, refinement, and talents, not considering\nourselves to be benefactors of the people, advanced men, who are ready\nto share our useful acquirements with the people, but acknowledging\nourselves to be entirely guilty, ruined, good-for-nothing men, who\ndesire to turn over a new leaf, and not to be benefactors of the people,\nbut to cease to offend and to humiliate them.\n\nVery often good young people, who sympathise with the negative part of\nmy writings, put to me the question, "What must I do then? What have I,\nwho have finished my study in the university or in some other high\nestablishment,--what have I to do in order to be useful?"\n\nThese young people ask the question; but in the depths of their souls\nthey have already decided that the education which they have received is\ntheir great advantage, and that they wish to serve the people by this\nvery advantage.\n\nTherefore, there is one thing which they do not do,--honestly and\ncritically examine what they call their education, asking themselves\nwhether it is a good or a bad thing.\n\nIf they do this, they will be unavoidably led to decry their education,\nand to begin to learn anew; and this alone is what is wanted. They will\nnever be able to answer the question, as to what there is to be done,\nwhile they put it wrongly. The question should be put thus: "How can I,\na helpless, useless man, recognizing the misfortune of having lost my\nbest years in studying the scientific Talmud, pernicious for soul and\nbody, how can I rectify this mistake, and learn to serve men?" But the\nquestion is always put thus: "How can I, who have acquired so much fine\ninformation, how can I be useful to men with this my information?"\n\nTherefore, a man can never answer the question, "What is to be done?"\nuntil he leaves off deceiving himself and repents. And repentance is not\ndreadful, even as truth is not dreadful, but it is equally beneficent\nand fruitful of good. We need only accept the whole truth and fully\nrepent in order to understand that in life no one has any rights or\nprivileges, and that there is no end of duties, and no limits to them,\nand that the first and unquestionable duty of a man is to take part in\nthe struggle with nature for his own life and for the lives of other\nmen. And this acknowledgment of men\'s duty forms the essence of the\nthird answer to the question, "What is to be done?"\n\nI have tried to avoid deceiving myself. I have endeavoured to extirpate\nthe last remnant of the false estimate of the importance of my education\nand talents, and to repent; but before answering the question, _What is\nto be done?_ there stands a new difficulty.\n\nThere are so many things to be done, that one requires to know what is\nto be done in particular? And the answer to this question has been given\nme by the sincere repentance of the evil in which I have been living.\n\nWhat is to be done? What is there exactly to be done? everybody keeps\nasking; and I, too, kept asking this, while, under the influence of a\nhigh opinion of my own calling, I had not seen that my first and\nunquestionable business is to earn my living, clothing, heating,\nbuilding, and so forth, and in doing this to serve others as well as\nmyself, because, since the world has existed, the first and\nunquestionable duty of every man has been comprised in this.\n\nIn this one business, man receives,--if he has already begun to take\npart in it,--the full satisfaction of all the bodily and mental wants of\nhis nature; to feed, clothe, take care of himself and of his family,\nwill satisfy his bodily wants; to do the same for others, will satisfy\nhis spiritual.\n\nEvery other activity of man is only lawful when these have first been\nsatisfied. In whatever department a man thinks his calling lies, whether\nin governing the people, in protecting his countrymen, in officiating at\ndivine services, in teaching, in inventing the means of increasing the\ndelights of life, in discovering the laws of the universe, in\nincorporating eternal truths in artistic images, the first and most\nunquestionable duty of a reasonable man will always consist in taking\npart in the struggle with nature for preserving his own life and the\nlives of other men.\n\nThis duty must always rank first, because the most necessary thing for\nmen is life: and therefore, in order to protect and to teach men, and to\nmake their lives more agreeable, it is necessary to keep this very life;\nwhile by not taking part in the struggle, and by swallowing up the\nlabour of others, other lives are destroyed. And it is folly and\nimpossible to endeavour to serve men while destroying their lives.\n\nMan\'s duty to acquire the means of living through the struggle with\nnature will always be unquestionably the very first of all duties,\nbecause it is the law of life, the violation of which unavoidably brings\nwith it a punishment by destroying the bodily or mental life of man. If\na man, living alone, free himself from the duty of struggling with\nnature, he will be at once punished by the perishing of his body.\n\nBut if a man free himself from this duty by compelling other men to\nfulfil it for him, in ruining their lives, he will be at once punished\nby the destruction of his reasonable life; that is, of the life which\nhas a reasonable sense in it.\n\nI had been so perverted by my antecedents, and this first and\nunquestionable law of God or nature is so hidden in our present world,\nthat the fulfilling of it had seemed to me strange, and I was afraid and\nashamed of it, as if the fulfilment, and not the violation, of this\neternal and unquestionable law were strange, unnatural, and shameful. At\nfirst it seemed to me, that, in order to fulfil this law, some sort of\naccommodation was necessary, some established association of\nfellow-thinkers, the consent of the family, and life in the country (not\nin town): then I felt ashamed, as if I were putting myself forward in\nperforming things so unusual to our life as bodily labour, and I did not\nknow how to begin.\n\nBut I needed only to understand that this was not some exclusive\nactivity, which I have to invent and arrange, but that it was merely\nreturning from the false condition in which I had lived to a natural\none, merely rectifying that lie in which I had been living,--I had only\nto acknowledge all this, and all the difficulties vanished.\n\nIt was not at all necessary to arrange and accommodate any thing, nor to\nwait for the consent of other people, because everywhere, in whatever\ncondition I was, there were men who fed, dressed, and warmed me as well\nas themselves; and everywhere, under all circumstances, if I had\nsufficient time and strength, I was able to do these things for myself\nand for them.\n\nNor could I feel a false shame in performing actions unusual and strange\nto me, because, in not doing so, I already experienced, not a false, but\na real, shame.\n\nHaving come to this conclusion, and to the practical deduction from it,\nI have been fully rewarded for not having been afraid of the deductions\nof reason, and for having gone where they led me.\n\nHaving come to this practical conclusion, I was struck by the facility\nand simplicity of the solution of all those problems which had formerly\nseemed to me so difficult and complicated. To the question, "What have\nwe to do?" I received a very plain answer: Do first what is necessary\nfor yourself; arrange all you can do by yourself,--your tea-urn, stove,\nwater, and clothes.\n\nTo the question, "Would not this seem strange to those who had been\naccustomed to do all this for me?" it appeared that it was strange only\nfor about a week, and after a week it seemed more strange for me to\nreturn to my former condition.\n\nIn answer to the question, "Is it necessary to organize this physical\nlabour, to establish a society in a village upon this basis?" it\nappeared that it was not at all necessary to do all this; that if the\nlabour does not aim at rendering idleness possible, and at utilizing\nother men\'s labour,--as is the case with men who save up money,--but\nmerely the satisfying of necessities, then such labour will naturally\ninduce people to leave towns for the country, where this labour is most\nagreeable and productive.\n\nThere was also no need to establish a society, because a workingman will\nnaturally associate with other working-people. In answer to the\nquestion, "Would not this labour take up all my time, and would it not\ndeprive me of the possibility of that mental activity which I am so fond\nof, and to which I have become accustomed, and which in moments of doubt\nI consider to be useful?" the answer will be quite an unexpected one.\nThe energy of my mental activity increased in proportion to bodily\nexercise, being freed from all that was superfluous.\n\nIn fact, having spent eight hours in physical labour,--half a\nday,--which formerly I used to spend in endeavouring to struggle with\ndulness, there still remained for me eight hours, out of which in my\ncircumstances I required five for mental labour; and if I, a very\nprolific writer, who had been doing nothing but write during forty\nyears, and who had written three hundred printed sheets, then if during\nthese forty years I had been doing ordinary work along with\nworking-people, and, not taking into consideration winter evenings and\nholidays, had been reading and learning during the five hours a day, and\nhad written only on holidays two pages a day (and I have sometimes\nwritten sixteen pages a day), I should have written the same three\nhundred printed sheets in fourteen years.\n\nA wonderful thing: a most simple arithmetical calculation which every\nboy of seven years of age may do, but which I had never done. Day and\nnight have together twenty-four hours; we sleep eight hours; there\nremain sixteen hours. If any man labour mentally five hours a day, he\nwill do a vast amount of business; what do we, then, do during the\nremaining eleven hours?\n\nSo it appears that physical labour not only does not exclude the\npossibility of mental activity, but improves and stimulates it.\n\nIn answer to the question, whether this physical labour would deprive me\nof many innocent enjoyments proper to man, such as enjoyment of art,\nacquirement of knowledge, of social intercourse, and, generally, of the\nhappiness of life, it was really quite the reverse: the more intense my\nphysical labour, the more it approached that labour which is considered\nthe hardest, to wit, agricultural labour, the more I acquired\nenjoyments, and knowledge, and the closer and more affectionate was my\nintercourse with mankind, and the more happiness did I feel in life.\n\nIn answer to the question (which I hear so often from men who are not\nquite sincere), "What result can there be from such an awfully small\ndrop in the sea? what is all my personal physical labour in comparison\nwith the sea of labour which I swallow up?"\n\nTo this question I also received a very unexpected answer.\n\nIt appeared that as soon as I had made physical labour the ordinary\ncondition of my life, at once the greatest part of the false and\nexpensive habits and wants which I had while I had been physically idle,\nceased of themselves, without any endeavour on my part. To say nothing\nof the habit of turning day into night, and _vice versa_, of my bedding,\nclothes, my conventional cleanliness, which all became impossible and\nembarrassing when I began to labour physically, both the quantity and\nthe quality of my food was totally changed. Instead of the sweet, rich,\ndelicate, complicated, and highly spiced food, which I formerly liked, I\nnow required and obtained plain food as being the most agreeable,--sour\ncabbage soup, porridge, black bread, tea with a bit of sugar.\n\nSo that, apart from the example of common workingmen satisfied with\nlittle, with whom I came in closer intercourse, my very wants themselves\nwere gradually changed by my life of labour; so that in proportion to my\ngrowing accustomed to this labour and acquiring the ways of it, my drop\nof physical labour became indeed more perceptible in the ocean of common\nlabour; and in proportion as my labour grew more fruitful, my demands\nfor other men\'s labour grew less and less, and, without effort or\nprivation, my life naturally came nearer to that simple life of which I\ncould not even have dreamed without fulfilling the law of labour.\n\nIt became apparent that my former most expensive demands--the demands of\nvanity and amusement--were the direct result of an idle life. With\nphysical labour, there was no room for vanity, and no need for\namusement, because my time was agreeably occupied; and after weariness,\nsimple rest while drinking tea, or reading a book, or conversing with\nthe members of my family, was far more agreeable than the theatre,\nplaying at cards, concerts, or large parties.\n\nIn answer to the question, "Would not this unusual labour be hurtful to\nhealth, which is necessary in order that I may serve men?" it appeared\nthat, despite the positive assurance of eminent doctors that hard\nphysical labour, especially at my age, might have the worst results (and\nthat Swedish gymnastics, riding, and other expedients intended to supply\nthe natural conditions of man, would be far better), the harder I\nworked, the sounder, more cheerful, and kinder, I felt myself.\n\nIt became undoubtedly certain that even as all those inventions of the\nhuman mind, such as newspapers, theatres, concerts, parties, balls,\ncards, magazines, novels, are nothing but means to sustain the spiritual\nlife of men outside its natural condition of labour for others, so in\nthe same way all the hygienic and medical inventions of the human mind\nfor the provision of food, drink, dwelling, ventilation, warming of\nrooms, clothes, medicines, mineral water, gymnastics, electric and other\ncures, are all merely means to sustain the bodily life of man outside of\nits natural conditions of labour; and all these are nothing else than an\nestablishment hermetically closed, in which, by means of chemical\napparatus, the evaporation of water for the plants is arranged, when you\nneed only to open the window, and do that which is natural, not for men\nalone but to beasts too; in other words, having absorbed the food, and\nthus produced a charge of energy, to discharge it by muscular labour.\n\nAll the profound study of hygiene and of the art of healing for the men\nof our circle are like the efforts of a mechanic, who, having stopped\nall the valves of an overheated engine, should invent something to\nprevent this engine from bursting.\n\nWhen I had plainly understood all this, it seemed to me ridiculous, that\nI, through a long series of doubt, research, and much thinking, had\narrived at this extraordinary truth, that if man has eyes, they are to\nbe seen through; ears, to hear by; feet to walk with, and hands and back\nto work with,--and that if man will not use these, his members, for what\nthey are meant, then it will be the worse for him. I came to this\nconclusion, that with us, privileged people, the same thing has happened\nwhich happened to the horses of a friend of mine: The steward, who was\nnot fond of horses, and did not understand any thing about them, having\nreceived from his masters orders to prepare the best cobs for sale,\nchose the best out of the drove of horses, put them into the stable, fed\nthem upon oats; but being over-anxious, he trusted them to nobody,\nneither rode them himself, nor drove nor led them.\n\nOf course, all these horses became good for nothing.\n\nThe same has happened to us with this difference,--that you cannot\ndeceive horses, and, in order not to let them out, they must be fastened\nin; while we are kept in unnatural and hurtful conditions by all sorts\nof temptations, which fasten and hold us as with chains.\n\nWe have arranged for ourselves a life which is against the moral and\nphysical nature of man, and we use all the powers of our mind in order\nto assure men that this life is the real one. All that we call\nculture,--our science and arts for improving the delights of life,--all\nthese are only meant to deceive man\'s natural moral requirements: all\nthat we call hygiene, and the art of healing, are endeavours to deceive\nthe natural physical want of human nature.\n\nBut these deceits have their limits, and we are come to these limits.\n"If such be real human life, then it is better not to live at all," says\nthe fashionable philosophy of Schopenhauer and Hartman. "If such is\nlife, then it is better not to live at all," is the witness borne by the\nincreasing number of suicides among the privileged classes. "If such be\nlife, it is better for future generations, too, not to live," says the\nindulgent healing art, and invents means to destroy women\'s fecundity.\n\nIn the Bible the law to human beings is expressed thus: "In the sweat of\nthy face shalt thou eat bread," and "In sorrow thou shall bring forth\nchildren."\n\nThe peasant Bondaref, who wrote an article about this, threw great light\nupon the wisdom of this sentence. During the whole of my life, two\nthinking men--Russians--have exercised a great influence over me: they\nhave enriched my thoughts, and enlightened my contemplation of the\nworld.\n\nThese men were neither poets, nor learned men, nor preachers: they were\ntwo remarkable men, both now living, peasants,--Sutaief and Bondaref.\nBut "nous avons chang\xc3\xa9 tout \xc3\xa7a," as says one of Moli\xc3\xa8re\'s personages,\ntalking at random about the healing art, and saying that the liver is on\nthe left side, "we have changed all that." Men need not work,--all work\nwill be done by machines; and women need not bring forth children. The\nhealing art will teach different means of avoiding this, for there are\nalready too many people in the world.\n\nIn the Krapivensky district,[6] there wanders a ragged peasant, who\nduring the war was a purchaser of bread for a commissary of stores.\nHaving become acquainted with this functionary, and having seen his\ncomfortable life, he became mad, and now thinks that he, too, can live\nas gentlemen do, without work, being provided for by the Emperor.\n\n  [6] Tolstoy\'s village of Yasnaya Polyana is situated in this\n  district.--Ed.\n\nThis peasant now calls himself "the Most Serene Marshal Prince Blokhin,\npurveyor of war-stores of all kinds."\n\nHe says of himself that he has gone through all ranks, and for his\nservices during the war he has to receive from the Emperor an unlimited\nbank-account, clothes, uniforms, horses, carriages, tea, servants, and\nall kinds of provision. When anybody asks him whether he would like to\nwork a little, he only answers, "Thanks: the peasants will attend to all\nthat." When we say to him that the peasants also may not be disposed to\nwork, he answers, "Machines have been invented to ease the labour of\npeasants. They have no difficulty in their business." When we ask him\nwhat he is living for, he answers, "To pass away the time."\n\nI always consider this man as a mirror. I see in him myself and all my\nclass. To pass through all ranks in order to live to pass away the time,\nand to receive an unlimited bank-account, while peasants attend to every\nthing, and find it easy to do so, because of the invention of machines.\n\nThis is the exact form of the foolish belief of men of our class. When\nwe ask what have we particularly to do, we are in reality asking\nnothing, but only asserting--not so sincerely indeed as the Most Serene\nMarshal Prince Blokhin, who had passed through all ranks, and lost his\nmind--that we do not wish to do anything.\n\nHe who has come to his senses cannot ask this, because from one side all\nthat he makes use of has been done, and is being done, by the hands of\nmen; on the other side, as soon as a healthy man has got up and\nbreakfasted, he feels the inclination to work, as well with his feet as\nwith his hands and brain. In order to find work, he has only not to\nrestrain himself from labour. Only he who considers labour to be a\nshame,--like the lady who asked her guest not to trouble herself to open\nthe door, but to wait till she called a servant to do it,--only such\npersons can ask what is there to be done in particular.\n\nThe difficulty is not in inventing work,--every one has enough to do for\nhimself and for others,--but in losing this criminal view of life, that\nwe eat and sleep for our own pleasure, and in gaining that simple and\ncorrect view in which every working-person grows up, that man first of\nall is a machine which is charged with food, and that therefore it is\nshameful, difficult, and impossible to eat and not to work; that to eat\nand not to work is a most dangerous state, and as bad as incendiarism.\n\nIt is necessary only to have this consciousness, and we shall find work\nand this work will always be pleasant, and capable of satisfying all the\nwants of our soul and body.\n\nI picture to myself the whole matter thus: Every man\'s day is divided by\nhis meals into four parts, or four stages as it is called by the\npeasants: First, before breakfast; secondly, from breakfast to dinner;\nthirdly, from dinner to poldnik (a slight evening meal between dinner\nand supper); and fourthly, from poldnik to night. The activity of man to\nwhich he is drawn, is also divided into four kinds: First, the activity\nof the muscles, the labour of the hands, feet, shoulders, back,--hard\nlabour by which one perspires; secondly, the activity of the fingers and\nwrists, the activity of skill and handicraft; thirdly, the activity of\nthe intellect and imagination; fourthly, the activity of intercourse\nwith other men.\n\nThe goods which man makes use of may also be divided into four kinds:\nFirst, every man makes use of the productions of hard labour,--bread,\ncattle, buildings, wells, bridges, and so on; secondly, the productions\nof handicraft,--clothes, boots, hardware, and so on; thirdly, the\nproductions of mental activity,--science, art; and fourthly, the\nintercourse with men, acquaintanceship, societies.\n\nI thought that it would be the best thing so to arrange the occupations\nof the day that one might be able to exercise all these four faculties,\nand to return all the four kinds of production of labour, which one\nmakes use of; so that the four parts of the day were devoted, first, to\nhard labour; secondly, to mental labour; thirdly, to handicraft;\nfourthly, to the intercourse with men. It would be good if one could so\narrange his labour; but if it is not possible to arrange thus, one thing\nis important,--to acknowledge the duty of labouring, the duty of making\na good use of each part of the day.\n\nI thought that it would be only then that the false division of labour\nwhich now rules our society would disappear, and a just division would\nbe established which should not interfere with the happiness of mankind.\n\nI, for instance, have all my life been busy with mental work. I had said\nto myself that I have thus divided the labour: that my special work is\nwriting; that is, mental labour: and all other works necessary for me, I\nleft to be done by other men, or rather compelled them to do it. But\nthis arrangement, seemingly so convenient for mental labour, though\nunjust, became most inconvenient, especially for mental labour. I have\nbeen writing all my life, have accommodated my food, sleep, amusements,\nwith reference to this special labour, and besides this work I did\nnothing.\n\nThe results of which were, first, that I had been narrowing the circle\nof my observation and information, and often I had not any object to\nstudy, and therefore, having had to describe the life of men (the life\nof men is a continual problem of every mental activity), I felt my\nignorance, and had to learn and to ask about such things, which everyone\nnot occupied with a special work knows; secondly, it happened that when\nI sat down to write, I often had no inward inclination to write, and\nnobody wanted my writing for itself, that is, for my thoughts, but\npeople merely wanted my name for profits in the magazines.\n\nI made great efforts to write what I could; sometimes I did not succeed\nat all; sometimes succeeded in writing something very bad, and I felt\ndissatisfied and miserable. So often and often weeks passed, during\nwhich I would eat, drink, sleep, warm myself, and do nothing--or do\nsomething of no use to anybody--i.e., commit the worst and meanest\ncrime, scarcely ever committed by a man of the working class. But since\nI have acknowledged the necessity of physical labour as well as hard\nlabour, and also that of handicraft, everything is quite different: my\ntime is occupied however humbly, but certainly in a useful way, and\npleasantly and instructively for me.\n\nTherefore I, for the sake of my speciality, leave off this undoubtedly\nuseful and pleasant occupation, only when I feel an inward want, or see\na direct demand for my literary work. And this caused the quality, and\ntherefore the usefulness and pleasantness, of my special labour to\nimprove.\n\nThus it has happened that my occupation with those physical works, which\nare necessary for me as well as for every man, not only do not interfere\nwith my special activity, but are a necessary condition of the utility,\nquality, and pleasantness of this activity.\n\nA bird is so created that it is necessary for it to fly, to walk, to\npeck, to consider; and when it does all this, it is satisfied and happy;\nthen it is a bird. Exactly so with a man when he walks, turns over heavy\nthings, lifts them up, carries them, works with his fingers, eyes, ears,\ntongue, brain, then only is he satisfied, then only is he _a man_.\n\nA man who has come to recognise his calling to labour will be naturally\ninclined to that change of labour which is proper for him for the\nsatisfying of his outward and inward wants, and he will reverse this\norder only when he feels an irresistible impulse to some special labour,\nand when other men require this labour from him. The nature of labour is\nsuch that the satisfying of all men\'s wants requires that very\nalternation of different kinds of labour which renders labour easy and\npleasant.\n\nOnly the erroneous idea that labour is a curse could lead men to free\nthemselves from some kinds of labour, that is, to seize other men\'s\nlabour, requiring from other men that forced occupation with a special\nlabour which is called nowadays the division of labour.\n\nWe have become so accustomed to our false conception of the arrangement\nof labour that it seems to us that for a boot-maker, a machinist, a\nwriter, a musician, it would be better to be freed from the labour\nproper to man. Where there is no violence over other men\'s labour, nor a\nfalse belief in the pleasure of idleness, no man will for the sake of\nhis special labour free himself from physical labour necessary for the\nsatisfying of his wants, because special occupation is not a privilege,\nbut a sacrifice to a man\'s inclination and for the sake of his brethren.\n\nA boot-maker in a village having torn himself from his usual pleasant\nlabour in the field, and having begun his labour of mending or making\nboots for his neighbours, deprives himself of a pleasant, useful labour\nin the field for the sake of others, only because he is fond of sewing,\nand knows that nobody will do it better than he does, and that people\nwill be thankful to him.\n\nBut he cannot wish to deprive himself of the pleasant alternation of\nlabour for all his life. The same with the starosta, the machinist, the\nwriter, the learned man.\n\nIt is only to our perverted ideas, that it seems, when the master sends\nhis clerk to be a peasant, or government sentences one of its ministers\nto deportation, that they are punished and have been dealt with hardly.\nIn reality they have had a great good done to them; that is, they have\nexchanged their heavy special work for a pleasant alternation of labour.\n\nIn a natural society all is different. I know a commune where the people\nearn their living themselves. One of the members of this community was\nmore educated than the rest; and they require him to deliver lectures,\nfor which he has to prepare himself during the day, that he may be able\nto deliver them in the evening. He does it joyfully, feeling that he is\nuseful to others, and that he can do it well. But he grows tired of the\nexclusive mental labour, and his health suffers accordingly. The members\nof the community therefore pity him, and ask him to come and labour in\nthe field again.\n\nFor men who consider labour to be the essential thing and the joy of\nlife, the ground, the basis, of it will always be the struggle with\nnature,--not only in agricultural labour, but also in that of\nhandicraft, mental work, and intercourse with men.\n\nThe divergence from one or many of these kinds of labour, and\nspecialities of labour, will be performed only when a man of special\ngifts, being fond of this work, and knowing that he performs it better\nthan anybody else, will sacrifice his own advantage in order to fulfil\nthe demands which others put directly to him.\n\nOnly with such a view of labour and the natural division of labour\nresulting from it, will that curse disappear which in our imagination we\nhave put upon labour; and every labour will always be a joy, because man\nwill do either an unquestionably useful, pleasant, and easy work, or\nwill be conscious that he makes a sacrifice by performing a more\ndifficult special labour for the good of others.\n\nBut the division of labour is, it is said, more advantageous.\nAdvantageous for whom? Is it more advantageous to make with all speed as\nmany boots and cotton-prints as possible? But who will make these boots\nand cotton-prints? Men who from generation to generation have been\nmaking only pin-heads? How, then, can it be more advantageous for\npeople? If the object were to make as many cotton-prints and pins as\npossible, it would be so; but the question is, how to make people happy?\n\nThe happiness of men consists in life. And life is in labour.\n\nHow, then, can the necessity of painful, oppressing work be advantageous\nfor men? If the question were only for the advantage of some men without\nany consideration of the welfare of all, then it might be most\nadvantageous for some men to eat others. They say it is savoury!\n\nThe thing most advantageous for all men is what I wish for myself,--the\ngreatest welfare and the satisfying of all my wants which are ingrafted\nin me, those of body as well as those of soul, of conscience, and of\nreason.\n\nNow, for myself I have found, that for my welfare and for the satisfying\nof these wants, I need only to be cured of the folly in which I (as well\nas the Krapivensky madman) have lived, consisting in the idea that\ngentlefolk need not work, and that all must be done for them by others,\nand that, producing nothing, I have to do only what is proper to\nman,--satisfy my own wants.\n\nHaving discovered this, I became persuaded that this labour for the\nsatisfying of my own wants, is divisible into various kinds of labour,\neach of which has its own charm, and is not only no burden, but serves\nas rest after some other labour.\n\nI have roughly divided labour, not in the least insisting on the\npropriety of such a division, into four parts parallel to the four parts\nof the labourer\'s day\'s work, divided by his meals; and thus I try to\nsatisfy my wants.\n\nThese are, then, the answers to the question, "What shall we do?" which\nI have found for myself.\n\n_First_, Not to lie to myself. However far I have gone astray from that\nroad of life which my reason shows to me, I must not be afraid of the\ntruth.\n\n_Secondly_, To renounce my own righteousness, my own advantages,\npeculiarities, distinguishing me from others, and to own my guilt.\n\n_Thirdly_, To fulfil the eternal, unquestionable law of man,--by\nlabouring with all my being to struggle with nature, to sustain my own\nlife, and the lives of others.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nI have now finished, having said all that concerns myself; but I cannot\nrestrain my desire to say that which concerns every one, and to verify\nmy own deductions by several considerations.\n\nI wish to explain why I think that a great many of my own class must\narrive where I myself am, and I must also speak of what will result if\neven a few men arrive there; in the first place, if men of our circle,\nour caste, will only seriously think the matter out themselves, the\nyounger generation, who seek their own personal happiness, will become\nafraid of the ever-increasing misery of lives which obviously lead them\nto ruin; scrupulous persons among us (if they would examine themselves\nmore closely) will be terrified at the cruelty and unlawfulness of their\nown lives, and timid persons will be frightened at the danger of their\nmode of life.\n\n_The misery of our lives!_ However we, rich men, may try to mend and to\nsupport, with the assistance of science and art, this our false life, it\nmust become weaker every day, unhealthier, and more and more painful:\nwith each year, suicide, and the sin against the unborn babe, increase;\nwith each year the new generations of our class grow weaker, with each\nyear we feel more and more the increasing misery of our lives.\n\nIt is obvious that on this road, with all its increase of the comforts\nand delights of life, of cures, artificial teeth and hair, and so on,\nthere can be no salvation.\n\nThis truth has become such a truism, that in newspapers advertisements\nare printed about stomach powder for rich people, under the title\n"Blessings of the poor," where they say that only poor people have a\ngood digestion, and the rich need help, and among other things this\npowder. You cannot ameliorate this matter by any kind of amusements,\ncomforts, powders, but only by turning over a new leaf.\n\n_The contradiction of our life with our conscience._ However we may try\nto justify to ourselves our treason against mankind, all our\njustification falls to pieces before evidence: around us, people are\ndying from overwork and want; and we destroy the food, clothes, and\nlabour of men merely to amuse ourselves. Therefore the conscience of a\nman of our circle, though he may have but a small remainder of it in his\nbreast, cannot be stifled, and poisons all these comforts and charms of\nlife which our suffering and perishing brethren procure for us. Not only\ndoes every conscientious man feel this himself, but he must feel it more\nacutely at present, because the best part of art and science, that part\nwhich still retains a sense of its high calling, constantly reminds him\nof his cruelty, and of the unlawfulness of his position.\n\nThe old secure justifications are all destroyed; and the new ephemeral\njustifications of the progress of science for science\'s sake, and art\nfor art\'s sake, will not bear the light of plain common sense.\n\nThe conscience of men cannot be calmed by new devices: it can be calmed\nonly by turning over a new leaf, when there will be no longer any need\nfor justification.\n\n_The danger to our lives!_ However much we may try to hide from\nourselves the plain and obvious danger of exhausting the patience of\nthose whom we oppress; however much we may try to counteract this danger\nby all sorts of deceit, violence and flattery,--it grows day by day,\nhour by hour,--it has long been threatening us, but now it is so ready\nthat we are scarcely able to hold our course,--as in a vessel tossed by\na roaring and overflowing sea,--a sea which will presently swallow us up\nin wrath.\n\nThe workman\'s revolution, with its terrors of destruction and murder,\nnot only threatens us, but we have already lived above it for the last\nthirty years, and it is only by various cunning devices that we have\npostponed the explosion.\n\nSuch is the state in Europe: such is the state in Russia, and still\nworse there, because we have no safety-valves. The classes who oppress\nthe people, with the exception of the Tsar, have no longer any\njustification in the eyes of our people; they all keep up their position\nmerely by violence, cunning, and expediency, i.e., skill; but the hatred\ntowards us of the worst representatives of the people, and the contempt\nof us from the best, increases every hour.\n\nAmong the Russian people a new word full of significance has been\ncirculating during the last three or four years: by this word, which I\nnever heard before, people are swearing in the streets, and by it they\ngive us a definition--"parasites."\n\nThe hatred and contempt of the oppressed people are increasing, and the\nphysical and moral strength of the richer classes are decreasing: the\ndeceit which supports all is wearing out, and the rich classes have\nnothing wherewith to comfort themselves in this mortal danger. To return\nto the old order of things is impossible, to restore the old prestige is\nimpossible. It only remains for those who are not willing to change the\ncourse of their lives, and to turn over a new leaf,--to hope that,\nduring their lives, they may fare well enough, after which the people\nmay do as they like. So think the blind crowd of the rich; but the\ndanger ever increases, and the awful catastrophe comes nearer and\nnearer.\n\nThere are three reasons which should prove to rich people the necessity\nof turning over a new leaf: First, desire for their own personal welfare\nand that of their families, which is not secured by the way in which\nrich people are living; secondly, the inability to satisfy the voice of\nconscience, which is obviously impossible in the present condition of\nthings; and thirdly, the threatening and constantly increasing danger to\nlife, which cannot be met by any outward means. All these together ought\nto induce rich people to change their mode of life. This change alone\nwould satisfy the desire of welfare and conscience, and would remove the\ndanger. There is but one means of making such change,--to leave off\ndeceiving ourselves, to repent, and to acknowledge labour to be, not a\ncurse, but the joyful business of life.\n\nTo this it is replied, "What will come out of the fact of my physical\nlabour during ten, eight, or five hours, while thousands of peasants\nwould gladly do it for the money which I have?"\n\nThe first good result would be, that you will become livelier,\nhealthier, sounder, kinder; and you will learn that real life from which\nyou have hidden yourself, or which was hidden from you.\n\nThe second good result will be, that, if you have a conscience, it will\nnot only cease to suffer as it now suffers when looking at the labour of\nmen,--the importance of which we always, from our ignorance, either\nincrease or diminish,--but you will constantly experience a joyful\nacknowledgment that with each day you are satisfying more and more the\ndemands of your conscience, and are leaving behind you that awful state\nin which so much evil is accumulated in our lives that we feel that we\ncannot possibly do any good in the world; you will experience the joy of\nfree life, with the possibility of doing good to others; you will open\nfor yourself a way into regions of the world of morality which have\nhitherto been shut to you.\n\nThe third good result will be this, that, instead of constant fear of\nrevenge upon your evil deeds, you will feel that you are saving others\nfrom this revenge, and are principally saving the oppressed from the\ncruel feeling of rancour and resentment.\n\nBut it is generally said, that it would be ridiculous if we, men of our\nstamp, with deep philosophical, scientific, political, artistic,\necclesiastical, social questions before us, we, state ministers,\nsenators, academists, professors, artists, singers, we, whose\nquarter-hours are valued so highly by men, should spend our time in\ndoing--what? Cleaning our boots, washing our shirts, digging, planting\npotatoes, or feeding our chickens and cows, and so on,--in business\nwhich not only our house-porter, or our cook, but thousands of men\nbesides who value our time, would be very glad to do for us.\n\nBut why do we dress, wash, and comb our hair ourselves? Why do we walk,\nhand chairs to ladies, to our guests, open and shut the door, help\npeople into carriages, and perform hundreds of actions which were\nformerly performed for us by our slaves?\n\nBecause we consider that such may be done by ourselves; that they are\ncompatible with human dignity; that is, human duty. The same holds good\nwith physical labour. Man\'s dignity, his sacred duty, is to use his\nhands, his feet, for the purpose for which they were given him, to spend\nthe swallowed food in work, which produces the food, and not to be\nwasted by disuse, not merely that he may wash and clean them and use\nthem only for the purpose of stuffing food and cigarettes into his\nmouth.\n\nSuch is the meaning of physical labour for every man in every society.\nBut in our class, with the divergence from this law of nature came the\nmisery of a whole circle of men; and for us, physical labour receives\nanother meaning,--the meaning of a preaching and a propaganda which\ndivert the terrible evil which threatens mankind.\n\nTo say that for an educated man, physical labour is a trifling\noccupation, is the same as to say, in the building of a temple, "What\nimportance can there be in putting each stone exactly in its place?"\nEvery great act is done under the conditions of quietness, modesty, and\nsimplicity. One can neither plough, nor feed cattle, nor think, during a\ngreat illumination, or amid thundering of guns, nor while in uniform.\n\nIllumination, the roar of cannon, music, uniforms, cleanliness,\nbrilliancy, which we usually connect with the idea of the importance of\nany act, are, on the contrary, tokens of the absence of importance in\nthat act. Great, true deeds are always simple and modest. Such is also\nthe greatest deed which is left to us to do,--the solution of those\nawful contradictions in which we are living. The acts which solve these\ncontradictions are modest, imperceptible, seemingly ridiculous acts,\nsuch as helping ourselves by physical labour, and, if possible, helping\nothers too: this is what we rich people have to do, if we understand the\nmisery, wrong, and danger of the position in which we live.\n\nWhat will result from the circumstance that I, and another, and a third,\nand a tenth man, do not despise physical labour, but consider it\nnecessary for our happiness, for the calming of our consciences, and for\nour safety? This will result from it,--that one, two, three, ten men,\ncoming into conflict with no one, without violence either of government\nor of revolution, will solve for themselves the problem which is before\nall the world, and which has appeared unsolvable; and they will solve it\nin such a way that life will become for them a good thing: their\nconsciences will be calm, and the evil which oppresses them will cease\nto be dreadful to them.\n\nAnother effect will be this: other men, too, will see that the welfare,\nwhich they have been looking for everywhere, is quite near them, that\nseemingly unsolvable contradictions between conscience and the order of\nthe world are solved in the easiest and pleasantest way, and that,\ninstead of being afraid of the men surrounding them, they must have\nintercourse with them, and love them.\n\nThe seemingly unsolvable economical and social questions are like the\nproblem of Krilof\'s casket. The casket opened of itself, without any\ndifficulty: but it will not open until men do the simplest and most\nnatural thing; that is, open it. The seemingly unsolvable question is\nthe old question of the utilizing some men\'s labour by others: this\nquestion, in our time, has found its expression in property.\n\nFormerly, other men\'s labour was used simply by violence, by slavery: in\nour time it is being done by the means of property. In our time,\nproperty is the root of all evil and of the sufferings of men who\npossess it, or are without it, and of all the remorse of conscience of\nthose who misuse it, and of the danger from the collision between those\nwho have it, and those who have it not.\n\nProperty is the root of all evil, and, at the same time, property is\nthat towards which all the activity of our modern society is directed,\nand that which directs the activity of the world. States and governments\nintrigue, make wars, for the sake of property, for the possession of the\nbanks of the Rhine, of land in Africa, China, the Balkan Peninsula.\nBankers, merchants, manufacturers, land-owners, labourers, use cunning,\ntorment themselves, torment others, for the sake of property; government\nfunctionaries, artisans, struggle, deceive, oppress, suffer, for the\nsake of property; courts of justice and police protect property; penal\nservitude, prisons, all the terrors of so-called punishments,--all is\ndone for the sake of property.\n\nProperty is the root of all evil; and now all the world is busy with the\ndistribution and protecting of wealth.\n\nWhat, then, is property? Men are accustomed to think that property is\nsomething really belonging to man, and for this reason they have called\nit property. We speak indiscriminately of our own house and our own\nland. But this is obviously an error and a superstition. We know, and if\nwe do not, it is easy to perceive, that property is only the means of\nutilizing other men\'s labour. And another\'s labour can by no means\nbelong to me. It has nothing in common with the conception of\nproperty,--a conception very exact and precise.\n\nMan has been, and will always call his own that which is subject to his\nown will and joined with his own consciousness. As soon as a man calls\nhis own something which is not his body, but which he should like to be\nsubject to his will as his body is, then he makes a mistake, and gets\ndisappointment, and suffering, and compels other people to suffer as\nwell. Man calls his wife his own, his children, his slaves, his\nbelongings, his own too; but the reality always shows him his error: and\nhe must either get rid of this superstition, or suffer, and make others\nsuffer.\n\nNow we, having nominally renounced the possessing of slaves, owing to\nmoney (and to its exactment by the government), claim our right also to\nmoney; that is, to the labour of other men.\n\nBut as to our claiming our wives as our property, or our sons, our\nslaves, our horses,--this is pure fiction contradicted by reality, and\nwhich only makes those suffer who believe in it; because a wife or a son\nwill never be so subject to my will as my body is; therefore my own body\nwill always remain the only thing I can call my true property; so also\nmoney, property,--will never be real property, but only a self-deception\nand a source of suffering, and it is only my own body which will be my\nproperty, that which always obeys me, and is connected with my\nconsciousness.\n\nIt is only to us, who are so accustomed to call other things than our\nbody our own, that such a wild superstition can appear to be useful for\nus, and without evil results; but we have only to reflect upon the\nnature of the matter to see how this, like every other superstition,\nbrings with it only dreadful consequences.\n\nLet us take the most simple example. I consider myself my own, and\nanother man like myself I consider my own too. I must understand how to\ncook my dinner: if I were free from the superstition of considering\nanother man as my property, I should have been taught this art as well\nas every other necessary to my real property (that is, my body); but now\nI have it taught to my imaginary property, and the result is that my\ncook does not obey me, does not wish to humour me, and even runs away\nfrom me, or dies, and I remain with an unsatisfied want, and have lost\nthe habit of learning, and recognize that I have spent as much time in\nworry about this cook as I should have spent in learning the art of\ncooking for myself.\n\nThe same is the case with property in buildings, clothes, wares; with\nproperty in the land; with property in money. Every imaginary property\ncalls forth in me a non-corresponding want which cannot always be\ngratified, and deprives me of the possibility of acquiring for my true\nand sure property--my own body--that information, that skill, those\nhabits, improvements, which I might have acquired.\n\nThe result is always that I have spent (without gain to myself,--to my\ntrue property) strength, sometimes my whole life, on that which never\nhas been, and never could be, my property.\n\nI provide myself with an imaginary "private" library, a "private"\npicture gallery, "private" apartments, clothes; acquire my "own" money\nin order to purchase with it every thing I want, and the matter stands\nthus,--that I, being busy about this imaginary property, which is not,\nand cannot be my property, however I may call it, and which is no object\nfor activity, leave quite out of sight that which is my true property,\nupon which I may really labour, and which really may serve me, and which\nalways remains in my power.\n\nWords have always a definite meaning until we purposely give them a\nfalse signification.\n\nWhat does property mean?\n\nProperty means that which is given to me alone, which belongs to me\nalone, exclusively; that with which I may always do everything I like,\nwhich nobody can take away from me, which remains mine to the end of my\nlife, and which I ought to use in order to increase and to improve it.\nFor every man such property is only himself.\n\nIt is in this very sense that imaginary property is understood, that\nvery property for sake of which (making it impossible for this imaginary\nproperty to become a real one) all the sufferings of this world\nexist,--wars, executions, judgments, prisons, luxury, depravity,\nmurders, and the ruin of mankind.\n\nWhat, then, will result from the circumstance that ten men plough, hew\nwood, make boots, not from necessity, but in acknowledgment that man\nneeds work, and that the more he works, the better it will be for him?\n\nThis will come out of it: that ten men, or even one single man, by\nthought and in deed, will show men that this fearful evil from which\nthey are suffering, is not the law of their destiny, nor the will of\nGod, nor any historical necessity, but is a superstition not at all\nstrong or overpowering, but weak and null, which one need only leave off\nbelieving in, as in idols, in order to get rid of, and to destroy it\neven as a frail cobweb is swept away.\n\nMen who begin to work in order to fulfil the pleasant law of their\nlives, who work for the fulfilment of the law of labour, will free\nthemselves from this superstition of property which is so full of\nmisery, and then all these worldly establishments which exist in order\nto protect this imaginary property outside of one\'s own body, will\nbecome not only unnecessary for them, but burdensome; and it will become\nclear to all that these institutions are not necessary, but pernicious,\nimaginary, and false conditions of life.\n\nFor a man who considers labour not a curse, but a joy, property outside\nhis own body--that is, the right or possibility of utilizing other men\'s\nlabour--will be not only useless, but an impediment. If I am fond of\ncooking my dinner, and accustomed to do it, then the fact that another\nman will do it for me, will deprive me of my usual business, and will\nnot satisfy me so well as I have satisfied myself; and further, the\nacquirement of imaginary property will not be necessary for such a man:\na man who considers labour to be his very life, fills up all his life\nwith it, and therefore requires less and less the labour of others,--in\nother words, as property to fill up his unoccupied time, and to\nembellish his life.\n\nIf the life of a man is occupied by labour, he does not require many\nrooms, much furniture, various fine clothes: he does not require so much\nexpensive food, or locomotion, or amusements. Especially a man who\nconsiders labour to be the business and the joy of his life, will not\nseek to ease his own labour by utilizing that of others.\n\nA man who considers life to consist in labour, will aim, in proportion\nas he acquires more skill, craft, and endurance, at having more and more\nwork to do, to occupy all his time. For such a man, who sees the object\nof his life in labour, and not in the results of his labour in\nacquirement of property, there cannot be even a question about the\ninstruments of labour. Though such a man will always choose the most\nproductive instrument of labour, he will have the same satisfaction in\nworking with the most unproductive.\n\nIf he has a steam-plough, he will plough with it; if he has not such, he\nwill plough with a horse-plough; if he has not this, he will plough with\nthe plain Russian sokh\xc3\xa1; if he has not even this, he will use a spade:\nand under any circumstances, he will attain his aim; that is, will pass\nhis life in labour useful to man, and therefore will have fullest\nsatisfaction. The position of such a man, in exterior and interior\ncircumstances, will be happier than the condition of a man who gives his\nlife away to acquire property.\n\nAccording to exterior circumstances, he will never want, because men,\nseeing that he does not shirk work, will always try to make his labour\nmost productive to them, as they arrange a mill by running water; and\nthat his labour may be more productive, they will provide for his\nmaterial existence, which they will never do for men who aim at\nacquiring property. The providing for material wants, is all that a man\nrequires.\n\nAccording to interior conditions, such a man will be always happier than\nhe who seeks for property, because the latter will never get what he is\naiming at, and the former in proportion to his strength (even the weak,\nold, dying, according to the proverb, with a Kored in his hands), will\nalways receive full satisfaction, and the love and sympathy of men.\n\nOne of the consequences of this will be, that certain odd, half-insane\npersons will plough, make boots, and so on, instead of smoking, playing\ncards, and riding about, carrying their dulness with them, from one\nplace to another, during the ten hours which every brain worker has at\nhis command.\n\nAnother result will be, that these silly people will demonstrate in\ndeed, that that imaginary property for the sake of which men suffer, and\ntorment themselves and others, is not necessary for happiness, and even\nimpedes it, and is but a superstition; and that true property is only\none\'s own head, hands, feet; and that, in order to utilize this true\nproperty usefully and joyfully, it is necessary to get rid of that false\nidea of property outside one\'s own body, on which we waste the best\npowers of our life.\n\nAnother result will be, that these men will demonstrate, that, when a\nman leaves off believing in imaginary property, then only will he make\nreal use of his true property,--his own body, which will yield him fruit\nan hundred-fold, together with happiness such as we have no idea as yet;\nand he will be a useful, strong, kind man, who will everywhere stand on\nhis own feet, will be always a brother to everybody, will be\nintelligible to all, desired by all, and dear to all.\n\nThen men, looking at one,--at ten such "silly" men will understand what\nthey have all to do to unfasten that dreadful knot in which they have\nall been tied by the superstition respecting property, and to get rid of\nthe miserable condition under which they are now groaning, and from\nwhich they do not know how to free themselves.\n\nThere is no reasoning which can so plainly demonstrate the\nunrighteousness of those who employ it as does this. The boatmen are\ndragging vessels against the stream. Is it possible that there could be\nfound a stupid boatman who would refuse to do his part in dragging,\nbecause he alone cannot drag the boat up against the stream? He who,\nbesides his rights of animal life,--to eat and to sleep,--acknowledges\nany human duty, knows very well wherein such duty consists: just in the\nsame way as a boatman knows that he has only to get into his\nbreast-collar, and to walk in the given direction. He will only seek to\nknow what to do and how to do it after having fulfilled his duty.\n\nAs with the boatmen, and with all men who do any labour in common, so\nwith the labour of all mankind; each man need only keep on his\nbreast-collar, and go in the given direction. And for this purpose one\nand the same reason is given to all men that this direction may always\nbe the same.\n\nThat this direction _is_ given to us, is obvious and certain from the\nlives of those who surround us, as well as in the conscience of every\nman, and in all the previous expressions of human wisdom; so that only\nhe who does not want work, can say that he does not see it.\n\nWhat, then, will come out of this?\n\nThis, that first one man, then another, will drag; looking at them, a\nthird will join; and so one by one the best men will join, until the\nbusiness will be set a-going, and will move as of itself, inducing those\nalso to join who do not yet understand why and wherefore it is being\ndone.\n\nFirst, to the number of men who conscientiously work in order to fulfil\nthe law of God, will be added those who will accept half conscientiously\nand half upon faith; then to these a still greater number of men, only\nupon faith in the foremost men; and lastly the majority of people: and\nthen it will come to pass that men will cease to ruin themselves, and\nwill find out happiness.\n\nThis will happen (and it will happen soon) when men of our circle, and\nafter them all the great majority of working-people, will no longer\nconsider it shameful to clean sewers, but will consider it shameful to\nfill them up in order that other men, _our brethren_, may carry their\ncontents away; they will not consider it shameful to go visiting in\ncommon boots, but they will consider it shameful to walk in goloshes\nbeside barefooted people; they will not think it shameful not to know\nFrench, nor about the last novel, but they will consider it shameful to\neat bread, and not to know how it is prepared; they will not consider it\nshameful not to have a starched shirt or a clean dress, but that it is\nshameful to wear a clean coat as a token of one\'s idleness; they will\nnot consider it shameful to have dirty hands, but shameful not to have\ncallouses on their hands.\n\nAll this will come to pass when public opinion demands it. Public\nopinion will demand it, when men get rid of those snares which hide the\ntruth from them. Great changes in this direction have taken place within\nmy memory. These changes occurred only as public opinion changed. Within\nmy memory has happened this, that whereas rich men were ashamed if they\ncould not drive out with a team of four horses, with two men-servants,\nand that it was considered shameful not to have a man-servant or a maid,\nto dress one, wash one, attend the chamber, and so on; now of a sudden\nit has become shameful not to dress and to wash oneself, without help,\nor to drive out with men-servants. All these changes have been\naccomplished by public opinion.\n\nCan we not see the changes which public opinion is now preparing?\nTwenty-five years ago it sufficed to destroy the snare which justified\nserfdom, and public opinion changed its attitude as to what is\npraiseworthy, and what is shameful, and life changed. It would suffice\nto destroy the snares justifying the power of money over men, and public\nopinion will change its view, concerning things praiseworthy and things\nshameful, and life will change.\n\nBut the destroying of the snare justifying the power of money and the\nchange of public opinion in this direction is already quickly taking\nplace. This snare is already transparent and but slightly veils the\ntruth. One needs only to look more attentively to see clearly that\nchange of public opinion, which not only must take place, but which has\nbeen already accomplished, only not yet consciously acknowledged, not\nyet named. Let a slightly educated man of our time think of the\nconsequences ensuing from those views he holds concerning the universe,\nand he will see, that the unconscious estimate of good and evil, of\npraiseworthy and shameful, by which he is guided in life, directly\ncontradicts all his conceptions of life.\n\nLet a man of our times dismiss himself, if only for a minute, from his\nown inert life, and looking at it, as an outsider, subject it to that\nvery estimate, resulting from his conception of life, and he will stand\naghast before the definition of his life, which results from his\nconception of the world.\n\nLet us take as an example, a young man (in young people the life energy\nis stronger and the self-consciousness is more vague) of the wealthy\nclasses, and of any shade of opinions. Every decent youth considers it a\nshame not to help an old man, a child, a woman; he considers it a shame\nto risk the life and health of another in common work while avoiding the\ndanger for himself. Everybody considers it shameful and barbarous to do\nwhat Skyler tells about the Kirghiz: who during storms sent out their\nwives and old women to hold the corners of the tent, while they remained\ninside drinking their koumis; everybody considers it a shame to force a\nweak man to work for him and still more shameful when in such danger,\nas, say, on a ship on fire, for the strongest to push aside the weak and\ngo first into the life-boat, and so on. Men consider all this shameful\nand would by no means act so under certain exceptional circumstances;\nbut in everyday life the same actions and even worse,--being hidden by\nsnares,--are constantly committed by them.\n\nOne need only think of it earnestly to recognize the horror of it.\n\nA young man changes his shirts daily. Who washes them? A woman, whatever\nher state may be, very often old enough to be his mother or grandmother,\noften unwell. How would this young man call another who out of whim,\nchanges his clean shirt and sends it to be washed by a woman old enough\nto be his mother?\n\nA young man, that he may be smart, provides himself with horses and an\nold man, fit to be his father or grandfather, is set to training them,\nthus endangering his very life, and the young man rides on the horse\nwhen danger is over. What would the young man say about a man who,\navoiding a dangerous situation for himself, puts another into it and for\nhis pleasure allows such a risk?\n\nYet the whole life of the well-to-do classes consists of a chain of such\nactions. The overtaxing labour of old men, children and women, and work\nconnected with danger to life done by others, not to help us to work but\nto satisfy our whims--these fill up our life. The fisherman gets drowned\nwhile catching fish for us, the washerwomen catch colds and die, the\nsmith grows blind, those who work in factories get ill and injured by\nmachinery, woodcutters are crushed by falling trees, workmen fall from\nroofs and are killed, needlewomen pine away. All real work is done with\nwaste and danger to life. To hide this and refuse to see it is\nimpossible. There is one salvation, one issue out of this situation, to\nwit--that if a man of our time is not to be obliged--according to his\nown principles--to call himself a scoundrel and a coward, who burdens\nothers with work and danger to life--he must take from men only what is\nnecessary for his life, and submit himself also to true labour\nassociated with waste and danger to life.\n\nWithin my memory, more striking changes have taken place. I remember\nthat at table, a servant stood with a plate, behind each chair. Men made\nvisits accompanied by two footmen. A Cossack boy and a girl stood in a\nroom to give people their pipes, and to clean them, and so on. Now this\nseems to us strange and remarkable. But is it not equally strange that a\nyoung man or woman, or even an elderly man, that he may visit a friend,\nshould order his horses to be harnessed, and that well-fed horses are\nkept only for this purpose? Is it not as strange that one man lives in\nfive rooms, or that a woman spends tens, hundreds, thousands of rubles\nfor her dress when she only needs some flax and wool wherewith to spin\ndresses for herself, and clothes for her husband and children?\n\nIs it not strange that men live doing nothing, riding to and fro,\nsmoking and playing, and that a battalion of people are busy feeding and\nwarming them?\n\nIs it not strange that old people quite gravely talk and write in\nnewspapers about theatres and music, and other insane people drive to\nlook at musicians or actors?\n\nIs it not strange that tens of thousands of boys and girls are brought\nup so as to make them unfit for every work (they return home from\nschool, and their two books are carried for them by a servant)?\n\nThere will soon come a time,--and it is already drawing near,--when it\nwill be shameful to dine on five courses served by footmen, and cooked\nby any but the masters themselves; it will be shameful not only to ride\nthoroughbreds or to drive in a coach when one has feet to walk on; to\nwear on week-days dress, shoes, gloves, in which it is impossible to\nwork; it will be shameful to play on a piano which costs one hundred and\nfifty pounds, or even ten pounds, while others work for one; to feed\ndogs upon milk and white bread, when there are men who have neither milk\nnor bread, and to burn lamps and candles without working by their light;\nto heat stoves in which no meal is cooked, while there are men who have\nneither light nor fuel. Then it will be impossible to think about giving\nopenly not merely one pound, but even six pence, for a place in a\nconcert or in a theatre. All this will be when the law of labour becomes\npublic opinion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n\nAs it is said in the Bible, there is a law given unto man and woman,--to\nman, the law of labour; to woman, the law of child-bearing. Although\nwith our science, "_nous avons chang\xc3\xa9 tout \xc3\xa7a_," the law of man as well\nas of woman remains as immutable as the liver in its place; and the\nbreach of it is inevitably punished by death. The only difference is,\nthat for man, the breach of law is punished by death in such a near\nfuture that it can almost be called present; but for woman, the breach\nof law is punished in a more distant future.\n\nA general breach, by all men, of the law, destroys men immediately: the\nbreach by women destroys the men of the following generation. The\nevasion of the law by a few men and women does not destroy the human\nrace, but deprives the offender of rational human nature.\n\nThe breach of this law by men began years ago in the classes which could\nuse violence with others; and, spreading on its way, it has reached our\nday, and has now attained madness, the ideal contained in a breach of\nthe law, the ideal expressed by Prince Blokhin, and shared by Renan and\nthe whole educated world: work will be done by machines, and men will be\nbundles of nerves enjoying themselves.\n\nThere has been scarcely any breach of the law by women. It has only\nmanifested itself in prostitution, and in private cases of crime\ndestroying progeny. Women of the wealthy classes have fulfilled their\nlaw, while men did not fulfil theirs; and therefore women have grown\nstronger, and have continued to govern, and will govern, men, who have\ndeviated from their law, and who, consequently, have lost their reason.\nIt is generally said that women (the women of Paris, especially those\nwho are childless) have become so bewitching, using all the means of\ncivilization, that they have mastered man by their charms.\n\nThis is not only wrong, but it is just the reverse of the truth. It is\nnot the childless woman who has mastered man, it is the mother, the one\nwho has fulfilled her duty, while man has not fulfilled his.\n\nAs to the woman who artificially remains childless, and bewitches man by\nher shoulders and curls, she is not a woman, mastering man, but a woman\ncorrupted by him, reduced to the level of the corrupted man, who, as\nwell as he, has deviated from her duty, who, as well as he, has lost\nevery reasonable sense of life.\n\nThis mistake also produces the astounding nonsense which is called\n"woman\'s rights." The formula of these rights is as follows:--\n\n"You men," says woman, "have deviated from your law of true labour, and\nwant us to carry the load of ours. No: if so, we also, as well as you,\nwill make a pretence of labour, as you do in banks, ministries,\nuniversities, and academies; we wish, as well as you, by the pretence of\ndivision of work, to profit by other people\'s work, and to live, only to\nsatisfy our lust." They say so, and in deed show that they can make that\npretence of labour not at all worse, but even better, than men do it.\n\nThe so-called question of women\'s rights arose, and could only arise,\namong men who had deviated from the law of real labour. One has only to\nreturn to it, and that question must cease to exist. A woman who has her\nown particular, inevitable labour will never claim the right of sharing\nman\'s labour,--in mines, or in ploughing fields. She claims her share\nonly in the sham labour of the wealthy classes.\n\nThe woman of our class was stronger than man, and is now still stronger,\nnot through her charms, not through her skill in performing the same\npharisaic similitude of work as man, but because she has not stepped\noutside of the law; because she has borne that true labour with danger\nof life, with uttermost effort; true labour, from which the man of the\nwealthy classes has freed himself.\n\nBut within my memory has begun also the deviation from the law by\nwoman,--that is to say, her fall; and within my memory, it has proceeded\nfarther and farther. A woman who has lost the law, believes that her\npower consists in the charms of her witchery, or in her skill at a\npharisaic pretence of intellectual labour. Children hinder the one and\nthe other. Therefore, with the help of science (science is always\nhelpful to everything wicked) within my memory it has come to pass that\namong the wealthy classes, scores of means of destroying progeny have\nappeared, and these means become a common attribute of the toilet. And\nbehold,--women, mothers, some of them of the wealthy classes, who held\ntheir power in their hands, let it slip away, and place themselves on a\nlevel with women of the street. The evil has spread far, and spreads\nfarther every day, and will soon grasp all the women of the wealthy\nclasses; and then they will be on a level with the men, and together\nwith them will lose every reasonable sense of life. There will be no\nreturn for this class then. But there is yet time. For there still\nremain more women than men who accomplish the law of their life,\ntherefore there are still reasonable beings among them,--and thus some\nof the women of our class hold in their hands the possibility of\nsalvation.\n\nIf only women would understand their worth, their power, and would use\nthese for the work of salvation of their husbands, brothers, and\nchildren,--the salvation of all men!\n\nWomen, mothers of the wealthy classes, in your hands is the salvation of\nmen of our world from the evils from which it suffers.\n\nNot those women who are occupied by their figures, bustles,\nhead-dresses, and their charms for men, and who, against their will, by\naccident and in despair, bear children, and then give them over to\nwet-nurses; nor yet those who go to different lectures, and talk of\npsychometrical centres of differentiation, and who also try to free\nthemselves from bearing children not to hinder their folly, which they\ncall development,--but those women and mothers who, having the power of\nfreeing themselves from child-bearing, hold strictly and consciously to\nthat eternal, immutable law, knowing that the weight and labour of that\nsubmission is the aim of their life. These women and mothers of our\nwealthy classes are those in whose hands, more than in any others, lies\nthe salvation of the men of our sphere in life, from the calamities\nwhich oppress them.\n\nYou women and mothers who submit consciously to the law of God, you are\nthe only ones who,--in our miserable, mutilated circle, which has lost\nall semblance of humanity,--know the whole true meaning of life\naccording to the law of God; and you are the only ones who, by your\nexample, can show men the happiness of that submission to God\'s law, of\nwhich they rob themselves.\n\nYou are the only ones who know the joy and happiness which takes\npossession of one\'s whole being,--the bliss which is the share of every\nman who does not deviate from God\'s law. You know the joy of love to\nyour husband,--a joy never ending, never destroyed, like all other joys,\nbut forming the beginning of another new joy--love to your child. You\nare the only ones, when you are simple and submissive to God\'s law, who\nknow, not the farcical pretence of labour, which men of your world call\nlabour, but that true labour which is imposed by God upon men, and you\nknow the rewards for it,--the bliss which it gives.\n\nYou know it, when after the joys of love, you expect with emotion, fear,\nand hope, the torturing state of pregnancy, which makes you ill for nine\nmonths, and brings you to the brink of death and to unbearable\nsufferings and pains: you know the conditions of true labour, when with\njoy you expect the approach and increase of the most dreadful\nsufferings, after which comes the bliss, known to you only.\n\nYou know it when, directly after those sufferings, without rest, without\ninterruption, you undertake another series of labours and\nsufferings,--those of nursing; for the sake of which you subjugate to\nyour feeling, and renounce, the strongest human necessity,--that of\nsleep, which, according to the saying, is sweeter than father and\nmother. For months and years you do not sleep two nights running, and\noften you do not sleep whole nights; walking alone to and fro, rocking\nin your wearied arms an ailing baby, whose sufferings tear your heart.\nWhen you do all this, unapproved and unseen by anybody, not expecting\nany praise or reward for it; when you do this, not as a great deed, but\nas the labourer of the gospel parable, who came from the field,\nconsidering that you are only doing your duty,--you know then what is\nfalse, fictitious labour,--for human fame; and what is true labour,--the\nfulfilment of God\'s will, the indication of which you feel in your\nheart. You know, if you are a true mother, that not only has nobody seen\nand praised your labour, considering that it is only what ought to be,\nbut even those for whom you toiled are not only ungrateful to you, but\noften torment and reproach you. With the next child you do the\nsame,--again you suffer, again you bear unseen, terrible toil, and again\nyou do not expect any reward from anybody, and feel the same\nsatisfaction.\n\nIf you are such, in your hands must lie the power over men, and in your\nhands lies the salvation. Your number is decreasing every day: some busy\nwith practising their charms over men, become prostitutes; others are\nengaged in competition with men in their artificial, ludicrous\noccupations; the third, who have not yet renounced their vocation, begin\nto repudiate it in their minds: they perform all the deeds of women and\nmothers, but accidentally, with grumblings and envy of the free women,\nnot bearing children,--and so deprive themselves of the only reward for\nthem--the inner consciousness of the fulfilment of God\'s will--and\ninstead of being satisfied they suffer from what is really their\nhappiness.\n\nWe are so confused by our false life, we, men of our circle, have all of\nus so utterly lost the sense of life, that we do not differ from one\nanother. Having loaded others with all the burdens and dangers of life,\nwe dare not call ourselves by the true names deserved by those who force\nothers to perish in providing life for them--scoundrels, cowards.\n\nBut among women a distinction still exists. There are women,--human\nbeings, women,--presenting the highest manifestation of a human being;\nand there are women--prostitutes. This discrimination will be made by\nsucceeding generations, and we, too, cannot help making it.\n\nEvery woman, however she dresses, however she calls herself, however\nrefined she may be, if being married she abstains from bearing children,\nis a prostitute.\n\nHowever low a lost woman may be, if she consciously devotes herself to\nbearing children, she does the best and highest work of life in\nfulfilling the will of God, and she has no superior.\n\nIf you are such, you will not say, after two or after twenty children,\nthat you have borne children enough; as a fifty-year old workman will\nnot say that he has worked enough, while he still eats and sleeps, and\nhis muscles demand work. If you are such, you will not cast the trouble\nof nursing and care on a strange mother,--any more than a workman will\ngive the work which he has begun, and nearly finished, to another\nman,--because in that work you put your life, and because, the more you\nhave of that work, the fuller and happier is your life.\n\nBut when you are like this,--and, happily for men, there are yet such\nwomen,--the same law of fulfilment of God\'s will, by which you guide\nyour own life, you will also apply to the life of your husband, of your\nchildren, and of men near to you. If you are such, and if you know by\nexperience that only self-denied, unseen, unrewarded labour with danger\nof life, and uttermost effort for the life of others, is the mission of\nman which gives satisfaction, you will claim the same from others, you\nwill encourage your husband to do the same labour, you will value and\nappreciate the worth of men by this same labour, and for it you will\nprepare your children.\n\nOnly that mother who looks on child-bearing as a disagreeable accident,\nand upon the pleasures of love, comfort, education, sociability, as the\nmeaning of life, will bring up her children so that they shall have as\nmany pleasures, and enjoy them as much as possible; will feed them\nluxuriously, dress them smartly, will artificially divert them, and will\nteach them, not that which will make them capable of self-sacrificing\nman\'s and woman\'s labour with danger of life and uttermost effort, but\nthat which will deliver them from that labour,--which will give them\ndiplomas and idleness. Only such a woman, who has lost the significance\nof her life, will sympathize with that false, sham man\'s labour, by\nmeans of which her husband, freeing himself from man\'s duty, may profit,\ntogether with her, by the labour of others. Only such a woman will\nchoose a similar husband for her daughter, and will value men, not for\nwhat they are in themselves, but for what is attached to\nthem,--position, money, the art of profiting by the labour of others.\n\nA true mother, who really knows God\'s law, will prepare her children for\nthe fulfilment of it. For such a mother it will be suffering to see her\nchild overfed, pampered, overdressed, because all this, she knows, will\nhinder it in the fulfilment of God\'s law, experienced by herself. Such a\nwoman will not teach that which will give her son or daughter the\npossibility of delivering themselves from labour, but that which will\nhelp them to bear the labour of life.\n\nShe will not want to ask what to teach her children, or for what to\nprepare them, knowing what it is and in what consists the mission of\nmen, and consequently knowing what to teach her children, and for what\nto prepare them. Such a woman will not only discourage her husband from\nfalse, sham labour, the only aim of which is to profit by other people\'s\nwork, but will view with disgust and dread an activity that will serve\nas a double temptation for her children. Such a woman will not choose\nher daughter\'s husband according to the whiteness of his hands, and the\nrefinement of his manners, but, knowing thoroughly what is labour and\nwhat deceit, will always and everywhere, beginning with her husband,\nrespect and appreciate men, in claiming from them true labour with waste\nand danger of life, and will scorn that false, sham labour which has for\nits aim the delivering of one\'s self from true labour.\n\nAnd let not those women say,--who, while renouncing the vocation of\nwomen, desire to profit by its rights,--that such a view of life is\nimpossible for a mother, that a mother is too intimately connected by\nlove to her children to deprive them of sweets, smart dresses, or\nentertainments, or not to fear their being unprovided for, if the\nhusband has no fortune or secure position, or not to be afraid for the\nfuture of the marrying daughters and sons, who have not got an\n"education."\n\nAll this is a lie, a burning lie!\n\nA true mother will never say this: "You cannot keep yourself from the\ndesire to give them sweets, toys, to take them to the circus?"\n\nBut surely you don\'t give them poisonous berries to eat, you do not let\nthem go out alone in a boat, you do not take them to a caf\xc3\xa9 chantant?\nWhy then can you restrain yourselves in this case and not in that?\nBecause you do not tell the truth. You say that you love the children so\nmuch that you fear for their life, you are so afraid of hunger, and\ncold, and that is why you appreciate so much the security, which your\nhusband\'s position provides for you, though you consider it unlawful.\n\nYou are so afraid of future eventualities, calamities for your children\nwhich are very distant and doubtful,--and you therefore encourage your\nhusband to do things unjustifiable in your opinion; but what are you\ndoing now to secure your children in their present conditions of life\nfrom the unfortunate eventualities of the present life?\n\nDo you spend much of your time during the day with your children? You do\nwell if you spend one-tenth of the day!\n\nThe remaining time they are under the care of strangers, hired people,\noften taken from the street, or they are in institutions, open to the\ndangers of moral and physical infection.\n\nYour children eat, they are nourished. Who cooks their dinner and what\nfrom? Mostly you know nothing about it. Who instills moral principles\ninto them? Neither do you know that!\n\nThen do not say, that you are suffering evil for the good of your\nchildren--it is not true. You do evil because you like it.\n\nA true mother, the one who in bearing and bringing up children sees her\nself-sacrificing vocation of life and the fulfilment of God\'s will--will\nnot say it.\n\nShe will not say it, because she knows it is not her business to make of\nher children what she herself or current opinions require. She knows\nthat children, i.e., the following generations,--are the greatest and\nmost sacred thing which is given to men to behold in reality: and, to\nserve with all her being, this sacred cause is her life.\n\nShe knows herself,--being constantly between life and death and ever\nrearing the feebly flickering life,--that life and death are not her\nbusiness, her business is to serve life, and she will not therefore\nsearch for distant paths of this service but will only endeavour not to\navoid the near one.\n\nSuch a mother _will bring forth and nurse her children herself_, and,\nabove all things else, will feed and provide for them, will work for\nthem, wash and teach them, will sleep and talk with them, because she\nmakes that her life-work. Only such a mother will not seek for her\nchildren external security through her husband\'s money, or her\nchildren\'s diplomas, but she will exercise in them the same capacity of\nself-sacrificing fulfilment of God\'s will which she knows in herself,\nthe capacity for bearing labour with waste and danger of life, because\nshe knows that only in that lie the security and welfare of life. Such a\nmother will not have to ask others what is her duty: she will know every\nthing, and will fear nothing, for she will always know that she has done\nwhat she was called to do.\n\nIf there can be doubts for a man or for a childless woman about the way\nto fulfil God\'s will, for a mother that way is firmly and clearly drawn;\nand if she fulfils it humbly, with a simple heart, standing on the\nhighest point of good, which it is only given to a human being to\nattain, she becomes the guiding-star for all men, tending to the same\ngood. Only a mother can before her death say to Him who sent her into\nthis world, and to Him whom she has served by bearing and bringing up\nchildren, beloved by her more than herself,--only she can peacefully\nsay, after having served Him in her appointed service,--\n\n"\'Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.\'"\n\nAnd this is that highest perfection, to which, as to the highest good,\nmen aspire.\n\nSuch women who fulfil their mission, are those who reign over reigning\nmen, and serve as a guiding-star to humanity,--those who prepare new\ngenerations of men and form public opinion: and therefore in the hands\nof these women lies the highest power of men\'s salvation from the\nexisting and threatening evils of our time.\n\nYes, women, mothers, in your hands, more than in those of any others,\nlies the salvation of the world!\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XL\n\n\nThe vocation of every man and woman is to serve other people. With this\ngeneral proposition, I think all who are not immoral people will agree.\nThe difference between men and women in the fulfilment of that vocation,\nis only in the means by which they attain it; that is to say, by which\nthey serve men.\n\nMan serves others by physical work,--procuring food; by intellectual\nwork,--studying the laws of nature in order to master it; and by social\nwork,--instituting forms of life, and establishing mutual relationships\nbetween people.\n\nThe means of serving others are various for men. The whole activity of\nmankind, with the exception of bearing children and rearing them, is\nopen for his service to men. A woman, in addition to the possibility of\nserving men by all the means open to man is, by the construction of her\nbody, called and inevitably attracted, to serve others by that which\nalone is excepted from the domain of the service of man.\n\nThe service of mankind is divided into two parts,--one, the augmentation\nof the welfare of mankind; the other, the continuation of the race. Men\nare called chiefly to the first, as they are deprived of the possibility\nof fulfilling the second. Women are called exclusively to the second, as\nthey only are fitted for it. This difference one should not, one can\nnot, forget or destroy; and it would be sinful to do so. From this\ndifference proceed the duties of each,--duties not invented by men, but\nwhich are in the nature of things. From the same difference proceeds the\nestimation of virtue and vice for woman and man,--the estimation which\nhas existed in every century, which exists now, and which will never\ncease to exist while reason exists in men.\n\nIt always has been the case, and it always will be, that a man who\nspends a great part of his life in the various physical and mental\nlabours which are natural to him, and a woman who spends a great part of\nher life in the labour of bearing, nursing, and rearing children, which\nis her exclusive prerogative, will alike feel that they are doing their\nduty, and will alike rise in the esteem and love of other people,\nbecause they both fulfil what is appointed because such is the substance\nof the matter.\n\nThe vocation of man is broader and more varied; the vocation of woman\nmore uniform and narrower, but more profound: and therefore it has\nalways been, and always will be, the case, that man, having hundreds of\nduties, will be neither a bad nor a pernicious man, even when he has\nbeen false to one or ten out of them, if he fulfils the greater part of\nhis vocation; while woman, as she has a smaller number of duties, if she\nis false to one of them, instantly falls lower than a man, who has been\nfalse to ten out of his hundreds of duties. Such has always been the\ngeneral opinion, and such it will always remain,--because such is the\nsubstance of the matter.\n\nA man, in order to fulfil God\'s will, must serve him in the domain of\nphysical work, thought and morality: in all these ways he can fulfil his\nvocation. Woman\'s service to God consists chiefly and almost exclusively\nin bearing children (because no one except herself can render it). Only\nby means of work, is man called to serve God and his fellow-men: only by\nmeans of her children, is a woman called to serve them.\n\nTherefore, that love to her own children which is inborn in woman, that\nexclusive love against which it is quite vain to strive by reasoning,\nwill always be, and ought to be, natural to a woman and a mother. That\nlove to a child in its infancy is not egotism, it is the love of a\nworkman for the work which he is doing while it is in his hands. Take\naway that love for the object of one\'s work, and the work becomes\nimpossible. While I am making a boot, I love it above everything. If I\ndid not love it, I could not work at it. If anybody spoils it for me, I\nam in despair; but I only love it thus while I am working at it. When it\nis completed, there remains an attachment, a preference, which is weak\nand illegitimate.\n\nIt is the same with a mother. A man is called to serve others by\nmultifarious labours, and he loves those labours while he is\naccomplishing them. A woman is called to serve others by her children,\nand she cannot help loving those children of hers while she is rearing\nthem to the age of three, seven, or ten years.\n\nIn the general vocation of serving God and others, man and woman are\nentirely equal, notwithstanding the difference of the form of that\nservice. The equality consists in the equal importance of one service\nand of the other,--that the one is impossible without the other, that\nthe one depends upon the other, and that for efficient service, as well\nfor man as for woman, the knowledge of truth is equally necessary.\n\nWithout this knowledge, the activity of man and woman becomes not useful\nbut pernicious for mankind. Man is called to fulfil his multifarious\nlabour; but his labour is only useful, and his physical, mental, and\nsocial labour is only fruitful, when it is fulfilled in the name of\ntruth and the welfare of others.\n\nA man can occupy himself as zealously as he will to increase his\npleasures by vain reasoning and with social activity for his own\nadvantage: his labour will not be fruitful. It will be so only when it\nis directed towards lessening the suffering of others through want and\nignorance and from false social organization.\n\nThe same with woman\'s vocation: her bearing, nursing, and bringing up\nchildren will only be useful to mankind when she gives birth to children\nnot only for her own pleasure, but when she prepares future servants of\nmankind; when the education of those children is done in the name of\ntruth and for the welfare of others,--that is to say, when she will\neducate her children in such a manner that they shall be the very best\nmen possible, and the very best labourers for others.\n\nThe ideal woman, in my opinion, is the one who,--appropriating the\nhighest view of life of the time in which she lives, yet gives herself\nto her feminine mission, which is irresistibly placed in her,--that of\nbringing forth, nursing and educating, the greatest possible number of\nchildren, fitted to work for people according to the view which she has\nof life.\n\nIn order to appropriate the highest view of life, I think there is no\nneed of visiting lectures: all that she requires is to read the gospel,\nand not to shut her eyes, ears, and, most of all, her heart.\n\nWell, and if you ask what those are to do who have no children, who are\nnot married, or who are widows, I answer that those will do well to\nshare man\'s multifarious labour. But one cannot help feeling sorry that\nsuch a precious tool as woman is, should be bereft of the possibility of\nfulfilling the great vocation which it is given to her alone to fulfil.\n\nEspecially as every woman, when she has finished bearing children, if\nshe has strength left, will have time to occupy herself with help in\nman\'s labour. Woman\'s help in that labour is very precious; but it will\nalways be a pity to see a young woman fit for child-bearing occupied by\nman\'s labour.\n\nTo see such a woman, is the same as to see precious vegetable soil\ncovered with stones as a place of parade or as a walking-ground. Still\nmore a pity, because the earth could only produce bread, and a woman\ncould produce that for which there cannot be any equivalent, than which\nthere is nothing higher,--man. And only she is able to do this.\n\n    THE END\n\n\n\n\nJUST PUBLISHED, PRICE 6d.\n\n\n  NEW STORIES by LEO TOLSTOY.\n\n  King Assarhadon,\n  and other Two Stories.\n\n  With Introduction, including quotations from the Letters of Leo Tolstoy.\n\n  Authorized Translation\n  BY\n  V.

(Luke\xc2\xa0xviii. 25.)\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nAfter having passed the greater part of my life in the country, I came\nat length, in the year 1881, to reside in Moscow, where I was\nimmediately struck with the extreme state of pauperism in that city.\nThough well acquainted with the privations of the poor in rural\ndistricts, I had not the faintest conception of their actual condition\nin towns.\n\nIn Moscow it is impossible to pass a street without meeting beggars of a\npeculiar kind, quite unlike those in the country, who go about there, as\nthe saying is, "with a bag and the name of Christ."\n\nThe Moscow beggars neither carry a bag nor ask for alms. In most cases\nwhen they meet you, they try to catch your eye, and then act according\nto the expression of your face.\n\nI know of one such, a bankrupt gentleman. He is an old man who advances\nslowly, limping painfully with each leg. When he meets you, he limps,\nand makes a bow. If you stop, he takes off his cap, ornamented with a\ncockade, bows again, and begs. If you do not stop, he pretends to be\nonly lame, and continues limping along.\n\nThat is a specimen of a genuine Moscow beggar, an experienced one.\n\nAt first I did not know why such mendicants did not ask openly; but\nafterwards I learned why, without understanding the reason.\n\nOne day I saw a policeman push a ragged peasant swollen with dropsy,\ninto a cab. I asked what he had been doing, and the policeman replied,--\n\n"Begging."\n\n"Is begging, then, forbidden?"\n\n"So it seems," he answered. As the man was being driven away, I took\nanother cab, and followed. I wished to find out whether begging was\nreally forbidden, and if so, why? I could not at all understand how it\nwas possible to forbid one man asking something from another; and,\nmoreover, I had my doubts whether it could be illegal in a city where it\nflourished to such an extent.\n\nI entered the police-station where the pauper had been taken, and asked\nan official armed with sword and pistol, and seated at a table, what he\nhad been arrested for.\n\nThe man looked up at me sharply, and said, "What business is that of\nyours?"\n\nHowever, feeling the necessity of some explanation, he added, "The\nauthorities order such fellows to be arrested, so I suppose it is\nnecessary."\n\nI went away. The policeman who had brought the man was sitting in the\nwindow of the ante-room, studying his note-book. I said to him,--\n\n"Is it really true that poor people are not allowed to ask for alms in\nChrist\'s name?"\n\nThe man started, as if waking up from a sleep, stared at me, then\nrelapsed again into a state of stolid indifference, and, reseating\nhimself on the window-sill, said,--\n\n"The authorities require it, so you see it is necessary."\n\nAs he became again absorbed in his note-book, I went down the steps\ntowards my cab.\n\n"Well! have they locked him up?" asked the cabman. He had evidently\nbecome interested in the matter.\n\n"They have," I answered. He shook his head.\n\n"Is begging forbidden in Moscow, then?" I asked.\n\n"I can\'t tell you," he said.\n\n"But how can a man be locked up," I said, "for begging in the name of\nChrist?"\n\n"Nowadays things have changed, and you see it is forbidden," he\nanswered.\n\nSince then, I have often seen policemen taking paupers to the\npolice-station and thence to the work-house. Indeed, I once met a whole\ncrowd of these poor creatures, about thirty, escorted before and behind\nby policemen. I asked what they had been doing.\n\n"Begging," was the reply.\n\nIt appears that, according to law, begging is forbidden in Moscow,\nnotwithstanding the great number of beggars one meets there in every\nstreet, notwithstanding the rows of them near the churches during\nservice-time, and especially at funerals. But why are some caught and\nlocked up, while others are let alone? This I have not been able to find\nout. Either there are lawful and unlawful beggars amongst them, or else\nthere are so many that it is impossible to catch them all; or, perhaps,\nthough some are taken up, others fill their places.\n\nThere is a great variety of such beggars in Moscow. There are those who\nlive by begging. There are also entirely honest destitute people who\nhave somehow chanced to reach Moscow and are really in extreme need.\n\nAmongst the latter are men and women evidently from the country. I have\noften met these. Some of them, who had fallen ill and afterwards\nrecovered and left the hospital, could now find no means, either of\nfeeding themselves, or of getting away from Moscow; some of them,\nbesides, had taken to drink (this was probably the case with the man\nwith dropsy whom I met); some were in good health, but had been burned\nout of house and home, or else were very old, or were widowed or\ndeserted women with children; and some others had sound health, and were\nquite capable of working.\n\nThese robust people especially interested me,--the more so, because,\nsince my arrival in Moscow, I had contracted the habit of going to the\nSparrow Hills for the sake of exercise, and working there with two\npeasants who sawed wood. These men were exactly like the beggars whom I\noften met in the streets. One, called Peter, was an ex-soldier from\nKaluga; the other, Simon, was from Vlad\xc3\xadmir. They possessed nothing save\nthe clothes on their backs: and they earned, by working very hard, from\nforty to forty-five kopeks (8d. to 9d.) a day; out of this they both put\na little aside,--the Kaluga soldier, to buy a fur coat; the Vlad\xc3\xadmir\npeasant, to get money enough to return to his home in the country.\n\nMeeting in the streets similar men, I was therefore particularly\ninterested in them, and could not understand why some begged whilst\nothers worked.\n\nWhenever I met a beggar of this description, I used to ask him how it\nwas that he had come to such a state. Once I met a strong,\nhealthy-looking peasant who asked alms. I questioned him as to who he\nwas, and whence he had come.\n\nHe told me he had come from Kaluga, in search of work. He had at first\nfound some, such as sawing old timber into fire-wood; but after he and\nhis companion had finished that job, though they had continually looked\nfor it, they had not found any more work, his mate had left him, and he\nhimself had passed a fortnight in the utmost need, and having sold all\nhe had to get food, now had not enough even to buy the necessary tools\nfor sawing.\n\nI gave him money to get a saw, and told him where to go for work. I had\npreviously arranged with Peter and Simon that they should accept a new\nfellow-worker, and find him a mate.\n\n"Be sure you come! There is plenty of work to be done," I said on\nparting.\n\n"You can reckon on me," he answered. "Do you think there is any pleasure\nin knocking about, begging, if I can work?"\n\nThe man solemnly promised that he would come; and he seemed honest, and\nreally meaning to work.\n\nNext day, on coming to my friends, Peter and Simon, I asked them whether\nthe man had arrived. They said he had not; and, indeed, he never came at\nall. In this way I was frequently deceived.\n\nI have also been deceived by those who said that they only wanted a\nlittle money to buy a ticket to return home, and whom I met in the\nstreets again a few days later. Many of them I came to know well, and\nthey knew me; though occasionally having forgotten me, they would repeat\nthe same false tale; but sometimes they would turn away on recognizing\nme.\n\nIn this way I discovered, that, even in this class of men, there are\nmany rogues.\n\nStill, these poor rogues were also very much to be pitied: they were all\nragged and hungry; they were of the sort who die of cold in the streets,\nor hang themselves to escape life, as the papers frequently tell us.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nWhen I talked to my town friends about this pauperism which surrounded\nthem, they always replied, "Oh! you have seen nothing yet! You should go\nto the Khitrof Market, and visit the lodging-houses there, if you want\nto see the genuine \'Golden Company.\'"\n\nOne jovial friend of mine added, that the number of these paupers had so\nincreased, that they already formed not a "Golden Company," but a\n"Golden Regiment."\n\nMy witty friend was right; but he would have been yet nearer the truth\nhad he said that these men formed, in Moscow, not a company, nor a\nregiment, but a whole army,--an army, I should judge, of about fifty\nthousand.\n\nThe regular townspeople, when they spoke to me about the pauperism of\nthe city, always seemed to feel a certain pleasure or pride in being\nable to give me such precise information.\n\nI remember I noticed, when visiting London, that the citizens there\nseemed also to find a certain satisfaction in telling me about London\ndestitution, as though it were something to be proud of.\n\nHowever, wishing to inspect this poverty about which I had heard so\nmuch, I had turned my steps very often towards the Khitrof Market,--but\non each occasion I felt a sensation of pain and shame. "Why should you\ngo to look at the suffering of human beings whom you cannot help?" said\none voice within me. "If you live here, and see all that is pleasant in\ntown life, go and see also what is wretched," replied another.\n\nAnd so, one cold, windy day in December, two years ago (1883), I went to\nthe Khitrof Market, the centre of the town pauperism.\n\nIt was on a week-day, about four in the afternoon. While still a good\ndistance off I noticed greater and greater numbers of men in strange\nclothes,--evidently not originally meant for them,--and in yet stranger\nfoot-wear; men of a peculiar unhealthy complexion, and all apparently\nshowing a remarkable indifference to everything that surrounded them.\n\nMen in the strangest, most incongruous costumes sauntered along,\nevidently without the least thought as to how they might look in the\neyes of others. They were all going in the same direction. Without\nasking the way, which was unknown to me, I followed them, and came to\nthe Khitrof Market.\n\nThere I found women likewise in ragged capes, rough cloaks, jackets,\nboots, and goloshes. Perfectly free and easy in their manner,\nnotwithstanding the grotesque monstrosity of their attire, these women,\nold and young, were sitting, bargaining, strolling about, and abusing\none another.\n\nMarket-time having evidently passed, there were not many people there;\nand as most of them were going up-hill, through the market-place, and\nall in the same direction, I followed them.\n\nThe farther I went, the greater became the stream of people flowing into\nthe one road. Having passed the market, and gone up the street, I found\nthat I was following two women, one old, the other young. Both were\nclothed in some grey ragged stuff. They were talking, as they walked,\nabout some kind of business.\n\nEvery expression was unfailingly accompanied by some obscene word.\nNeither was drunk, but each absorbed with her own affairs; and the\npassing men, and those about them, paid not the slightest attention to\ntheir language, which sounded so strange to me. It appeared to be the\ngenerally accepted manner of speech in those parts. On the left we\npassed some private night-lodging-houses, and some of the crowd entered\nthese; others continued to ascend the hill towards a large corner house.\nThe majority of the people walking along with me went into this house.\nBefore it, people all of the same sort were standing and sitting, on the\nsidewalk and in the snow.\n\nAt the right of the entrance were women; at the left, men. I passed by\nthe men: I passed by the women (there were several hundreds in all), and\nstopped where the crowd ceased.\n\nThis building was the "Liapin free night-lodging-house" ("doss-house").\nThe crowd was composed of night-lodgers, waiting to be let in. At five\no\'clock in the evening this house is opened and the crowd admitted.\nHither came almost all the people whom I followed.\n\nI remained standing where the file of men ended. Those nearest stared at\nme till I had to look at them. The remnants of garments covering their\nbodies were very various; but the one expression of the eyes of all\nalike seemed to be, "Why are you, a man from another world, stopping\nhere with us? Who are you? Are you a self-satisfied man of wealth,\ndesiring to be gladdened by the sight of our need, to divert yourself in\nyour idleness, and to mock at us? or are you that which does not and can\nnot exist,--a man who pities us?"\n\nOn all their faces the same question was written. Each would look at me,\nmeet my eyes, and turn away again.\n\nI wanted to speak to some of them, but for a long time I could not\nsummon up courage. However, eventually our mutual exchange of glances\nintroduced us to each other; and we felt that, however widely separated\nmight be our social positions in life, we were still fellow-men, and so\nwe ceased to be afraid of one another.\n\nNext to me stood a peasant with a swollen face and red beard, in a\nragged jacket, with worn-out goloshes on his naked feet, though there\nwere eight degrees of frost.[1] For the third or fourth time our eyes\nmet; and I felt so drawn to him that I was no longer ashamed to address\nhim (to have refrained from doing so would have been the only real\nshame), and I asked him where he came from.\n\n  [1] R\xc3\xa9aumur.\n\nHe answered eagerly, while a crowd began to collect round us, that he\nhad come from Smolensk in search of work, to be able to buy bread and\npay his taxes.\n\n"There is no work to be had nowadays," he said: "the soldiers have got\nhold of it all. So here am I knocking about; and God is my witness, I\nhave not had any thing to eat for two days."\n\nHe said this shyly, with an attempt at a smile. A seller[2] of warm\ndrinks, an old soldier, was standing near. I called him, and made him\npour out a glass. The peasant took the warm vessel in his hands, and,\nbefore drinking, warmed them against the glass, trying not to lose any\nof the precious heat; and whilst doing this he related to me his story.\n\n  [2] A sbiten-seller: _sbiten_ is a hot drink made of herbs or spices\n  and molasses\n\nThe adventures of these people, or at least the stories which they tell,\nare almost always the same: He had had a little work; then it had\nceased: and here, in the night-lodging-house, his purse, containing his\nmoney and passport, had been stolen from him. Now he could not leave\nMoscow.\n\nHe told me that during the day he warmed himself in public-houses,\neating any stale crust of bread which might be given him. His night\'s\nlodging here in Liapin\'s house cost him nothing.\n\nHe was only waiting for the round of the police-sergeant to lock him up\nfor being without his passport, when he would be sent on foot, with a\nparty of men similarly situated, to the place of his birth.\n\n"They say the inspection will take place on Thursday, when I shall be\ntaken up; so I must try and keep on until then." (The prison and his\ncompulsory journey appeared to him as the "promised land.") While he was\nspeaking, two or three men in the crowd said they were also in exactly\nthe same situation.\n\nA thin, pale youth, with a long nose, only a shirt upon his back, and\nthat torn about the shoulders, and a tattered cap on his head, edged his\nway to me through the crowd. He was shivering violently all the time,\nbut tried, as he caught my eye, to smile scornfully at the peasant\'s\nconversation, thinking thus to show his superiority.\n\nI offered him some drink.\n\nHe warmed his hands on the tumbler as the other had done; but just as he\nbegan to speak, he was shouldered aside by a big, black, hook-nosed,\nbare-headed fellow, in a thin shirt and waistcoat, who also asked for\nsome drink.\n\nThen a tall old man, with a thin beard, in an overcoat fastened round\nthe waist with a cord, and in bark shoes, had some. He was drunk.\n\nThen came a little man, with a swollen face and wet eyes, in a coarse\nbrown jacket, with his knees protruding through his torn trousers and\nknocking against each other with cold. He shivered so that he could not\nhold the glass, and spilled the contents over his clothes: the others\nbegan to abuse him, but he only grinned miserably, and shivered.\n\nAfter him came an ugly, deformed man in rags, and with bare feet. Then\nan individual of the officer type; another belonging to the church\nclass; then a strange-looking being without a nose,--all of them hungry,\ncold, suppliant, and humble,--crowded round me, and stretched out their\nhands for the glass; but the drink was exhausted. Then one man asked for\nmoney: I gave him some. A second and a third followed, till the whole\ncrowd pressed on me. In the general confusion the gatekeeper of the\nneighbouring house shouted to the crowd to clear the pavement before his\nhouse, and the people submissively obeyed.\n\nSome of them undertook to control the tumult, and took me under their\nprotection. They attempted to drag me out of the crush. But the crowd\nthat formerly had lined the pavement in a long file, had now become\ncondensed about me. Every one looked at me and begged; and it seemed as\nif each face were more pitiful, harassed, and degraded than the other. I\ndistributed all the money I had,--only about twenty rubles,--and entered\nthe lodging-house with the crowd. The house was an enormous one, and\nconsisted of four parts. In the upper storeys were the men\'s rooms; on\nthe ground-floor the women\'s. I went first into the women\'s\ndormitory,--a large room, filled with beds resembling the berths in a\nthird-class railway-carriage. They were arranged in two tiers, one above\nthe other.\n\nStrange-looking women in ragged dresses, without jackets, old and young,\nkept coming in and occupying places, some below, others climbing above.\nSome of the elder ones crossed themselves, pronouncing the name of the\nfounder of the refuge. Some laughed and swore.\n\nI went up-stairs. There, in a similar way, the men had taken their\nplaces. Amongst them I recognized one of those to whom I had given\nmoney. On seeing him I suddenly felt horribly ashamed, and made haste to\nleave.\n\nWith a sense of having committed some crime, I returned home. There I\nentered along the carpeted steps into the rug-covered hall, and, having\ntaken off my fur coat, sat down to a meal of five courses, served by two\nfootmen in livery, with white ties and white gloves. A scene of the past\ncame suddenly before me. Thirty years ago I saw a man\'s head cut off\nunder the guillotine in Paris before a crowd of thousands of spectators.\nI was aware that the man had been a great criminal: I was acquainted\nwith all the arguments in justification of capital punishment for such\noffences. I saw this execution carried out deliberately: but at the\nmoment that the head and body were severed from each other by the keen\nblade, I gasped, and realized in every fibre of my being, that all the\narguments which I had hitherto heard in favour of capital punishment\nwere wickedly false; that, no matter how many might agree that it was a\nlawful act, it was literally murder; whatever other title men might give\nit, they thus had virtually committed murder, that worst of all crimes:\nand there was I, both by my silence and my non-interference, an aider,\nan abetter, and participator in the sin.\n\nSimilar convictions were again forced upon me when I now beheld the\nmisery, cold, hunger, and humiliation of thousands of my fellow-men. I\nrealized not only with my brain, but in every pulse of my soul, that,\nwhilst there were thousands of such sufferers in Moscow, I, with tens of\nthousands of others, daily filled myself to repletion with luxurious\ndainties of every description, took the tenderest care of my horses, and\nclothed my very floors with velvet carpets!\n\nWhatever the wise and learned of the world might say about it, however\nunalterable the course of life might seem to be, the same evil was\ncontinually being enacted, and I, by my own personal habits of luxury,\nwas a promoter of that evil.\n\nThe difference between the two cases was only this: that in the first,\nall I could have done would have been to shout out to the murderers\nstanding near the guillotine, who were accomplishing the deed, that they\nwere committing a murder, and by every means to try to hinder\nthem,--while, of course, knowing that my interference would be in vain.\nWhereas, in this second case, I might have given away, not only the\ndrink and the small sum of money I had with me, but also the coat from\noff my shoulders, and all that I possessed at home. Yet I had not done\nso, and therefore felt, and feel, and can never cease to feel, that I\nmyself am a partaker in a crime which is continually being committed, so\nlong as I have superfluous food whilst others have none, so long as I\nhave two coats whilst there exists one man without any.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nOn the same evening that I returned from Liapin\'s house, I imparted my\nimpressions to a friend: and he, a resident of the town, began to\nexplain to me, not without a certain satisfaction, that this was the\nmost natural state of things in a town; that it was only owing to my\nprovincialism that I found anything remarkable in it; and that it had\nalways been, and always would be so, such being one of the inevitable\nconditions of civilization. In London it was yet worse, etc., etc.,\ntherefore there could be nothing wrong about it, and there was nothing\nto be disturbed or troubled about.\n\nI began to argue with my friend, but with such warmth and so angrily,\nthat my wife rushed in from the adjoining room to ask what had happened.\nIt appeared that, without being aware of it, I had shouted out in an\nagonized voice, gesticulating wildly, "We should not go on living in\nthis way! we must not live so! we have no right!" I was rebuked for my\nunnecessary excitement; I was told that I could not talk quietly upon\nany question, that I was irritable; and it was pointed out to me that\nthe existence of such misery as I had witnessed was in no way a reason\nfor embittering the life of my home-circle.\n\nI felt that this was perfectly just, and held my tongue; but in the\ndepth of my soul I knew that I was right, and I could not quiet my\nconscience.\n\nThe town life, which had previously seemed alien and strange to me, now\nbecame so hateful that all the indulgencies of a luxurious existence, in\nwhich I had formerly delighted, began to torment me.\n\nHowever much I tried to find some kind of excuse for my mode of life, I\ncould not contemplate without irritation either my own or other people\'s\ndrawing-rooms, nor a clean, richly served dinner-table, nor a carriage\nwith well-fed coachman and horses, nor the shops, theatres, and\nentertainments. I could not help seeing, in contrast to all this, those\nhungry, shivering, and degraded inhabitants of the night-lodging-house.\nI could never free myself from the thought that these conditions were\ninseparable--that the one proceeded from the other. I remember that the\nsense of culpability which I had felt from the first moment never left\nme; but with this feeling another soon mingled, which lessened the\nfirst.\n\nWhen I talked to my intimate friends and acquaintances about my\nimpressions in Liapin\'s house, they all answered in the same way, and\nexpressed besides their appreciation of my kindness and\ntender-heartedness, and gave me to understand that the sight had\nimpressed me so because I, Leo Tolstoy, was kind-hearted and good. And I\nwillingly allowed myself to believe this.\n\nThe natural consequence of this was, that the first keen sense of\nself-reproach and shame became blunted, and was replaced by a sense of\nsatisfaction at my own virtue, and a desire to make it known to others.\n"It is, in truth," I said to myself, "probably not my connection with a\nluxurious life which is at fault, but the unavoidable circumstances of\nexistence. Therefore a change in my particular life would not alter the\nevil I had seen."\n\nIn changing my own life, I thought, I should only render myself and\nthose nearest and dearest to me miserable, whilst the other misery would\nremain; therefore my object should be, not to alter my own way of\nliving, as I had at first imagined, but to try as much as was in my\npower to _ameliorate_ the position of those unfortunate ones who had\nexcited my compassion. The whole matter, I reasoned, lies in the fact\nthat I, being an extremely kind and good man, wish to do good to my\nfellow-men.\n\nSo I began to arrange a plan of philanthropic activity in which I might\nexhibit all my virtues. I must, however, remark here, that, while\nplanning this charitable effort, in the depth of my heart I felt that I\nwas not doing the right thing; but, as too often happens, reason and\nimagination stifled the voice of conscience.\n\nAbout this time the census was being taken, and this seemed to me a good\nopportunity for instituting that charitable organization in which I\nwanted to shine.\n\nI was acquainted with many philanthropic institutions and societies\nalready existing in Moscow, but all their activity seemed to me both\ninsignificant and wrongly directed in comparison with what I myself\nwished to do.\n\nThis was what I invented to excite sympathy amongst the rich for the\npoor: I began to collect money, and to enlist men who wished to help in\nthe work, and who would, in company with the census officers, visit all\nthe nests of pauperism, entering into relations with the poor, finding\nout the details of their needs, aiding them with money and work, sending\nthem out of Moscow, placing their children in schools, and their old men\nand women in homes and houses of refuge.\n\nI thought, moreover, that from those who undertook this work a permanent\nsociety could be formed, which, by dividing between its members the\nvarious districts of Moscow, could take care that new cases of want and\nmisery should be averted, and so by degrees pauperism might be stifled\nat its very beginning, not so much by cure, as by prevention.\n\nAlready I saw in the future the entire disappearance of begging and\npoverty, I having been the means of its accomplishment. Then we who were\nrich could go on living in all our luxury as before, dwelling in fine\nhouses, eating dinners of five courses, driving in our carriages to\ntheatres and entertainments, no longer being harassed by such sights as\nI had witnessed at Liapin\'s house.\n\nHaving invented this plan, I wrote an article about it; and, before even\ngiving it to the printers, I went to those acquaintances from whom I\nhoped to obtain co-operation, and expounded to all whom I visited that\nday (chiefly the rich) the ideas I afterwards published in my article.\n\nI proposed to profit by the census in order to study the state of\npauperism in Moscow, and to help exterminate it by personal effort and\nmoney, after which we might all with a quiet conscience enjoy our usual\npleasures. Everyone listened to me attentively and seriously; but, in\nevery case, I remarked that the moment my hearers came to understand\nwhat I was driving at, they seemed to become uncomfortable and somewhat\nembarrassed. It was principally, I feel sure, on my own account; because\nthey considered all that I said to be folly. It seemed as though some\noutside motive compelled my listeners to agree for the moment with my\nfoolishness.--"Oh, yes! Certainly. It would be delightful," they said:\n"of course it is impossible not to sympathize with you. Your idea is\nsplendid. I myself have had the same; but ... people here are so\nindifferent, that it is hardly reasonable to expect a great success.\nHowever, as far as I am concerned, I am, of course, ready to share in\nthe enterprise."\n\nSimilar answers I received from all. They consented, as it appeared to\nme, not because they were persuaded by my arguments, nor yet in\ncompliance with their own desire, but because of some exterior reason\nwhich rendered it impossible for them to refuse.\n\nI remarked this partly because none of those who promised me their help\nin the form of money, defined the sum they meant to give; so that I had\nto name the amount by asking, "May I count upon you for twenty-five, or\none hundred, or two hundred, or three hundred, rubles?" And not one of\nthem paid the money. I draw attention to this fact, because, when people\nare going to pay for what they are anxious to have, they are generally\nin haste to give it. If it is to secure a box to see Sarah Bernhardt,\nthe money is immediately produced; here, however, of all who agreed to\ngive, and expressed their sympathy, not one produced the amount, but\nmerely silently acquiesced in the sum I happened to name.\n\nIn the last house I visited that day there was a large party. The\nmistress of the house had for some years been employed in works of\ncharity. Several carriages were waiting at the door. Footmen in\nexpensive liveries were seated in the hall. In the spacious\ndrawing-room, ladies, old and young, wearing rich dresses and ornaments,\nwere talking to some young men, and dressing up small dolls, intended\nfor a lottery in aid of the poor.\n\nThe sight of this drawing-room and of the people assembled there struck\nme very painfully. For not only was their property worth several million\nrubles; not only would the interest on the capital spent here on\ndresses, laces, bronzes, jewels, carriages, horses, liveries, footmen,\nexceed a hundred times the value of these ladies\' work,--but even the\nexpenses caused by this very party of ladies and gentlemen, the gloves,\nthe linen, candles, tea, sugar, cakes, all this represented a sum a\nhundred times greater than the value of the work done.\n\nI saw all this, and therefore might have understood that here, at all\nevents, I should not find sympathy with my plan, but I had come in order\nto give a proposal, and, however painful it was, I said what I wished to\nsay, repeating almost the words of my article.\n\nOne lady present offered me some money, adding that, owing to her\nsensibilities, she did not feel strong enough to visit the poor herself,\nbut that she would give help in this form. How much money, and when she\nwould give it, she did not say. Another lady and a young man offered\ntheir services in visiting the poor, but I did not profit by their\noffer. The principal person I addressed told me that it would be\nimpossible to do much, because the means were not forthcoming. The means\nwere scarce, because all the rich men in Moscow who were known and could\nbe counted upon had already given all it was possible to get from them,\ntheir charities had already been rewarded with titles, medals, and other\ndistinctions,--which was the only effectual way to ensure success in the\ncollection of money; and to obtain new honors from the authorities was\nvery difficult.\n\nWhen I returned home I went to bed, not only with a presentiment that\nnothing would result from my idea, but also with the shameful\nconsciousness of having been doing something vile and contemptible the\nwhole day. However, I did not desist.\n\nFirst, the work had been begun, and false shame prevented my giving it\nup; second, not only the success of the enterprise itself, but even my\npart in it, afforded me the possibility of continuing to live in my\nusual way; whereas the failure of this enterprise would have put me\nunder the constraint of giving up my present mode of life and of seeking\nanother. Of this, I was unconsciously afraid; and therefore I refused to\nlisten to my inner voice, and continued what I had begun.\n\nHaving sent my article to be printed, I read a proof-copy at a\ncensus-meeting in the town hall, hesitatingly, and blushing till my\ncheeks burned again. I felt very uncomfortable, and I saw that all my\nhearers were equally uncomfortable.\n\nOn my question, whether the managers of the census would accept my\nproposal that they should remain at their posts in order to form a link\nbetween society and those in need, an awkward silence ensued.\n\nThen two of those present made speeches, which seemed to mend the\nawkwardness of my suggestions. Sympathy for me was expressed along with\ntheir general approbation, but they pointed out the impracticability of\nmy scheme. Everyone immediately seemed more at ease; but afterwards,\nstill wishing to succeed, I asked each district manager separately,\nwhether during the census he was willing to investigate the needs of the\npoor and afterwards remain at his post in order to form this link\nbetween the poor and the rich, all were again confounded; it seemed as\nthough their looks said, "Why, we have listened to your silly\nproposition out of personal regard for you; but here you come with it\nagain!" This was the expression of their faces, but in words they told\nme that they consented; and two of them, separately, but as though they\nhad agreed together, said in the same words, "We regard it as our moral\nduty to do so." The same impression was produced by my words upon the\nstudents who had volunteered to act as clerks during the census, when I\ntold them that they might accomplish a charitable work besides their\nscientific pursuits.\n\nWhen we talked the matter over I noticed that they were shy of looking\nme straight in the face, as one often hesitates to look into the face of\na good-natured man who is talking nonsense. The same impression was\nproduced upon the editor of the paper when I handed my article to him;\nalso upon my son, my wife, and various other people. Every one seemed\nembarrassed, but all found it necessary to approve of the idea itself;\nand all, immediately after this approbation, began to express their\ndoubts as to the success of the plan, and, for some reason or other, all\nwithout exception took to condemning the indifference and coldness of\nsociety and of the world, though they evidently excluded themselves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nBy my request I was appointed to make the census of the section of\nKhamovnitchesky police district, near the Smolensky Market in the\nPrototchni Lane between the Shore Drive and Nicolsky Lane. In this\ndistrict are the houses known under the name of Rzhanoff House or\nRzhanoff Fortress. In bygone times these houses belonged to the merchant\nRzhanoff, and are now the property of the merchants Zeemin. I had long\nbefore heard that this was considered the lowest circle of poverty and\nvice, which was the reason why I asked the officers of the census to\nassign this district to me.\n\nMy desire was gratified.\n\nHaving received the appointment from the Town Council, I went alone, a\nfew days before the census, to inspect my district. With the help of a\nplan I soon found the Rzhanoff Houses,--approached by a street which\nterminated on the left-hand side of Nicolsky Lane--a gloomy building\nwithout any apparent entrance. From the aspect of this house I guessed\nit was the one I was in search of. Descending the street, I came across\nsome boys, from ten to fourteen years old, in short coats, who were\nsliding down the frozen gutter, some on their feet, others upon a single\nskate.\n\nThe boys were ragged, and, like all town boys, sharp and bold. I stopped\nto look at them. An old woman in torn clothes, with hanging yellow\ncheeks, came round the corner. She was going up-hill to Smolensky\nMarket, gasping painfully at every step, like a horse out of wind; and\nwhen abreast of me, stopped with hoarse, choking breath. In any other\nplace, this old woman would have asked alms, but here she only began to\ntalk.\n\n"Just look at them!" she said, pointing to the sliding boys; "always at\nmischief! They will become the same Rzhanoff good-for-nothings as their\nfathers." One boy, in an overcoat and cap without a peak, overhearing\nher words, stopped. "You shut up!" he shouted. "You\'re only an old\nRzhanoff goat yourself!"\n\nI asked the boy if he lived here. "Yes, and so does she. She stole some\nboots," he called out, and, pushing himself off, slid on.\n\nThe old woman began a torrent of abuse, interrupted by coughs. During\nthe squabble an old white-haired man, all in rags, came down the middle\nof the street, brandishing his arms, and carrying in one hand a bundle\nof small rusk rings. He seemed to have just fortified himself with a\nglass of liquor. He had evidently heard the old woman\'s abuse and took\nher side.\n\n"I\'ll give it you, you little devils!" he shouted, pretending to rush\nafter them; and, passing behind me, he stepped on the pavement. If you\nsaw this old man in the Artat, a fashionable street, you would be struck\nwith his air of decrepitude, feebleness, and poverty. Here he appeared\nas a merry workman returning from his day\'s labor.\n\nI followed him. He turned round the corner to the left into Prototchni, an\nalley, passed the front of the house and the gate, and disappeared through\nthe door of an inn. Into this alley opened the doors of the latter,\na public-house, and several small eating-houses. It was the Rzhanoff\nHouses. Every thing was gray, dirty, and foul-smelling,--buildings,\nlodgings, courts, and people. Most of those I met here were in tattered\nclothes, half naked. Some were passing along, others were running from\none door to another. Two were bargaining about some rags. I went round\nthe whole building, down another lane and a court, and, having returned,\nstopped at the archway of the Rzhanoff Houses.\n\nI wanted to go in and see what was going on inside, but the idea made me\nfeel painfully awkward. If they asked me what I had come for, what\nshould I say?\n\nHowever after a little hesitation I went in. The moment I entered the\ncourt I was conscious of a most revolting stench. The court was\ndreadfully dirty. I turned round the corner, and at the same instant\nheard steps running along the boards of the gallery and down the stairs.\n\nFirst a gaunt-looking woman, with tucked-up sleeves, a faded pink dress,\nand shoes on her stockingless feet, rushed out; after her, a\nrough-haired man in a red shirt, and extremely wide trousers, like a\npetticoat, and goloshes on his feet. The man caught her under the\nstairs: "You sha\'n\'t escape me," he said, laughing.\n\n"Just listen to the squint-eyed devil!" began the woman, who was\nevidently not averse to his attentions; but, having caught sight of me,\nshe exclaimed angrily, "Who are you looking for?" As I did not want\nanyone in particular, I felt somewhat confused, and went away.\n\nThis little incident, though by no means remarkable in itself, suddenly\nshowed me the work I was about to undertake in an entirely new light,\nespecially after what I had seen on the other side of the\ncourtyard,--the scolding woman, the light-hearted old man, and the\nsliding boys. I had meditated doing good to these people by the help of\nthe rich men of Moscow. I now realized, for the first time, that all\nthese poor unfortunates, whom I had been wishing to help, had, besides\nthe time they spent suffering from cold and hunger in waiting to get a\nlodging, several hours daily to get through, and that they must somehow\nfill up the rest of the twenty-four hours of every day,--a whole life,\nof which I had never thought before. I realized now, for the first time,\nthat all these people, besides the mere effort to find food and shelter\nfrom the cold, must live through the rest of every day of their life as\nother people have to do, must get angry at times, and be dull, and try\nto appear light-hearted, and be sad or merry. Now, for the first time\n(however strange the confession may sound), I was fully aware that the\ntask which I was undertaking could not simply consist in feeding and\nclothing a thousand people (just as one might feed a thousand head of\nsheep, and drive them into shelter), but must develop some more\nessential help. When I considered that each one of these individuals was\njust another man like myself, possessing also a past history, with the\nsame passions, temptations, and errors, the same thoughts, the same\nquestions to be answered, then suddenly the work before me appeared\nstupendous and I felt my own utter helplessness;--but it had begun and I\nwas resolved to go on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nOn the appointed day, the students who were to assist me started early\nin the morning; while I, the philanthropist, only joined them at twelve\no\'clock. I could not come earlier, as I did not get up till ten, after\nwhich I had to take some coffee, and then smoke for the sake of my\ndigestion. Twelve o\'clock, then, found me at the door of the Rzhanoff\nHouses. A policeman showed me a public-house to which the census-clerks\nreferred all those who wished to enquire for them. I entered, and found\nit very dirty and unsavoury. Here, right in front of me, was a counter;\nto the left a small room, furnished with tables covered with soiled\nnapkins; to the right a large room on pillars, containing similar little\ntables placed in the windows and along the walls; with men here and\nthere having tea, some very ragged, others well dressed, apparently\nworkmen or small shopkeepers. There were also several women. In spite of\nthe dirt, it was easy to see, by the business air of the man in charge,\nand the ready, obliging manners of the waiters, that the eating-house\nwas driving a good trade. I had no sooner entered than one of the\nwaiters was already preparing to assist me in getting off my overcoat,\nanxious to take my orders, and showing that evidently the people here\nwere in the habit of doing their work quickly and readily.\n\nMy enquiry for the census-clerks was answered by a call for "V\xc3\xa1nya" from\na little man dressed in foreign fashion, who was arranging something in\na cupboard behind the counter. This was the proprietor of the\npublic-house, a peasant from Kaluga, Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch by name, who also\nrented half of the other houses, sub-letting the rooms to lodgers. In\nanswer to his call, a thin, sallow-faced, hook-nosed lad, about eighteen\nyears old, came forward hastily. The landlord said, "Take this gentleman\nto the clerks: they have gone to the main body of the building over the\nwell."\n\nThe lad put down his napkin, pulled on a coat over his white shirt and\ntrousers, picked up a large cap with a peak, and then, with quick, short\nsteps, led the way by a back-door through the buildings. At the entrance\nof a greasy, malodorous kitchen, we met an old woman who was carefully\ncarrying some putrid tripe in a rag. We descended into a court, built up\nall round with wooden buildings on stone foundations. The smell was most\noffensive, and seemed to be concentrated in a privy to which numbers of\npeople were constantly resorting. This privy was really only the place\nwhich custom accepted as a privy. One could not avoid noticing this\nplace as one passed through the courtyard. One suffered in entering the\nacrid atmosphere of the bad smells issuing from it.\n\nThe boy, taking care not to soil his white trousers, led me cautiously\nacross frozen and unfrozen filth, and approached one of the buildings.\nThe people crossing the yard and galleries all stopped to gaze at me. It\nwas evident that a cleanly-dressed man was an unusual sight in the\nplace.\n\nThe boy asked a woman whom we met, whether she had seen where the census\nofficials had entered, and three people at once answered his question:\nsome said that they were over the well; others said that they had been\nthere, but had now gone to Nikita Ivanovitch\'s.\n\nAn old man in the middle of the court, who had only a shirt on, said\nthat they were at No.\xc2\xa030. The boy concluded that this information was\nthe most probable and led me to No.\xc2\xa030, into the basement, where\ndarkness prevailed and a bad smell, different from that which filled the\ncourt.\n\nWe continued to descend along a dark passage. As we were traversing it a\ndoor was suddenly opened, out of which came a drunken old man in a\nshirt, evidently not of the peasant class. A shrieking washerwoman with\ntucked-up sleeves and soapy arms was pushing him out of the room.\n"V\xc3\xa1nya" (my guide) shoved him aside, saying, "It won\'t do to kick up\nsuch a row here--and you an officer too!"\n\nWhen we arrived at No.\xc2\xa030, V\xc3\xa1nya pulled the door, which opened with the\nsound of a wet slap; and we felt a gush of soapy steam and an odor of\nbad food and tobacco, and entered in complete darkness. The windows were\non the other side; and we were in a crooked corridor, that went right\nand left, with doors leading at different angles into rooms separated\nfrom it by a partition of unevenly laid boards, roughly whitewashed.\n\nIn a dark room to the left we could see a woman washing at a trough.\nAnother old woman was looking out of a door at the right. Near an open\ndoor was a hairy, red-skinned peasant in bark shoes, sitting on a couch.\nHis hands rested upon his knees; and he was swinging his feet and\nlooking sadly at his shoes.\n\nAt the end of the passage a small door led into the room where the\ncensus officers had assembled. This was the room of the landlady of the\nwhole of No.\xc2\xa030, who rented it from Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch and sub-let to\nordinary or night lodgers.\n\nIn this tiny room a student sat under an image glittering with gilt\npaper, and, with the air of a magistrate, was putting questions to a man\ndressed in shirt and vest. This last was a friend of the landlady\'s, who\nwas answering the questions in her stead. The landlady herself,--an old\nwoman,--and two inquisitive lodgers, were also present.\n\nWhen I entered, the room was quite filled up. I pushed through to the\ntable, shook hands with the student, and he went on extracting his\ninformation, while I studied the inhabitants, and put questions to them\nfor my own ends.\n\nIt appeared, however, I could find no one here upon whom to bestow my\nbenevolence. The landlady of the rooms, notwithstanding their\nwretchedness and filth (which especially struck me in comparison with\nthe mansion in which I lived), was well off, even from the point of view\nof town poverty; and compared with country destitution, with which I was\nwell acquainted, she lived luxuriously. She had a feather-bed, a quilted\nblanket, a samov\xc3\xa1r, a fur cloak, a cupboard, with dishes, plates, etc.\nThe landlady\'s friend had the same well-to-do appearance, and boasted\neven a watch and chain. The lodgers were poor, but among them there was\nno one requiring immediate help.\n\nThree only applied for aid,--the woman washing linen, who said she had\nbeen abandoned by her husband; an old widowed woman, without means of\nlivelihood; and the peasant in the bark shoes, who told me he had not\nhad anything to eat that day. But, upon gathering more precise\ninformation, it became evident that all these people were not in extreme\nwant, and that, before one could really help, it would be necessary to\nmake their more intimate acquaintance.\n\nWhen I offered the washerwoman to place her children in a "home," she\nbecame confused, thought over it some time, then thanked me much, but\nevidently did not desire it; she would rather have had some money. Her\neldest daughter helped her in the washing, and the second acted as nurse\nto the little boy.\n\nThe old woman asked to be put into a refuge; but, examining her corner,\nI saw she was not in extreme distress. She had a box containing some\nproperty and a teapot, two cups, and old bon-bon boxes with tea and\nsugar. She knitted stockings and gloves, and received a monthly\nallowance from a lady benefactress.\n\nThe peasant was evidently more desirous of wetting his throat after his\nlast day\'s drunkenness than of food, and anything given him would have\ngone to the public-house. In these rooms, therefore, there was no one\nwhom I could have rendered in any respect happier by helping them with\nmoney.\n\nThere were only paupers there,--and paupers, it seemed, of a\nquestionable kind.\n\nI put down the names of the old woman, the laundress, and the peasant,\nand settled in my mind that it would be necessary to do something for\nthem, but that first I would help those other _especially_ unfortunate\nones whom I expected to come across in this house. I made up my mind\nthat some system was necessary in distributing the aid which we had to\ngive: first, we must find the most needy, and then come to such as\nthese.\n\nBut in the next lodging, and in the next again, I found only similar\ncases, which would have to be looked into more closely before being\nhelped. Of those whom pecuniary aid alone would have rendered happy, I\nfound none.\n\nHowever ashamed I feel in confessing it, I began to experience a certain\ndisappointment at not finding in these houses anything resembling what I\nhad expected. I thought to find very exceptional people; but, when I had\ngone over all the lodgings, I became convinced that their inhabitants\nwere in no way extremely peculiar, but much like those amongst whom I\nlived.\n\nAs with us, so also with them, there were some more or less good and\nothers more or less bad: there were some more or less happy and others\nmore or less unhappy. Those who were unhappy amongst them would have\nbeen equally wretched with us, their misery being within themselves,--a\nmisery not to be mended by any kind of bank-note.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe inhabitants of these houses belonged to the lowest population of the\ntown, which in Moscow amounts to perhaps more than a hundred thousand.\nIn this house, there were representative men of all kinds,--petty\nemployers and journeymen, shoemakers, brushmakers, joiners, hackney\ncoachmen, jobbers carrying on business on their own account,\nwasherwomen, second-hand dealers, money-lenders, day-laborers, and\nothers without any definite occupation; and here also lodged beggars and\nunfortunate women.\n\nMany who were like the people I had seen waiting at Liapin\'s house lived\nhere, mixed up with the working-people. But those whom I saw then were\nin a most wretched condition, having eaten and drunk all they had, and,\nturned out of the public-house, were waiting, as for heavenly manna,\ncold and hungry, to be admitted into the free night-lodging-house,--and\nlonging day by day to be taken to prison, in order to be sent back to\ntheir homes. Here I saw the same men among a greater number of\nworking-people, at a time when by some means or other they had got a few\nfarthings to pay for their night\'s lodging, and perhaps a ruble or two\nfor food and drink.\n\nHowever strange it may sound, I had no such feelings here as I\nexperienced in Liapin\'s house; on the contrary, during my first\nvisiting-round, I and the students had a sensation which was rather\nagreeable than otherwise. Why do I say "almost agreeable?" It is not\ntrue. The sensation called forth by the companionship of these\nmen--strange as it may seem--was simply a very agreeable one.\n\nThe first impression was, that the majority of the lodgers here were\nworking people, and very kindly disposed. We found most of them at\nwork,--the washerwomen at their tubs, the joiners by their benches, the\nbootmakers at their lasts. The tiny rooms were full of people, and the\nwork was going on cheerfully and with energy. There was a smell of\nperspiration among the workmen, of leather at the bootmaker\'s, of chips\nin the carpenter\'s shop. We often heard songs, and saw bare, sinewy arms\nworking briskly and skilfully.\n\nEverywhere we were received kindly and cheerfully. Nearly everywhere our\nintrusion into the daily life of these people excited no desire in them\nto show us their importance, or to rate us soundly, which happens when\nsuch visits are paid to the lodgings of well-to-do people. On the\ncontrary, all our questions were answered simply, without any particular\nimportance being attached to them,--served, indeed, only as an excuse\nfor merriment and for jokes about how they were to be enrolled on the\nlist, how such a one was as good as two, and how two others ought to be\nreckoned as one.\n\nMany we found at dinner or at tea; and each time, in answer to our\ngreeting, "Bread and salt," or, "Tea and sugar," they said, "You are\nwelcome"; and some even made room for us to sit down. Instead of the\nplace being the resort of an ever-shifting population, such as we\nexpected to find, it turned out that in this house were many rooms which\nhad been tenanted by the same people for long periods.\n\nOne carpenter, with his workmen, and a bootmaker, with his journeymen,\nhad been living here for ten years. The bootmaker\'s shop was very dirty\nand quite choked up, but all his men were working very cheerily. I tried\nto talk with one of the workmen, wishing to sound him about the miseries\nof his lot, what he owed to the master, and so forth; but he did not\nunderstand me, and spoke of his master and of his life from a very\nfavourable point of view.\n\nIn one lodging, there lived an old man with his old wife. They dealt in\napples. Their room was warm, clean, and filled with their belongings.\nThe floor was covered with straw-matting which they got from the apple\nstores. There were chests, a cupboard, a samov\xc3\xa1r, and crockery. In the\ncorner were many holy images, before which two lamps were burning: on\nthe wall hung fur cloaks wrapped up in a sheet. The old woman with\nwrinkled face, kind and talkative, was apparently quite delighted with\nher quiet, respectable life.\n\nIv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, the owner of the inn and of the lodgings, came out and\nwalked with us. He joked kindly with many of the lodgers, calling them\nall by their names, and giving us short sketches of their characters.\nThey were as other men, did not consider themselves unhappy, but\nbelieved they were like everyone else, as in reality they were. We were\nprepared to see only dreadful things, and we met instead objects not\nonly not repulsive, but estimable. There were so many of these, compared\nwith the ragged, ruined, unoccupied people we met now and then among\nthem, that the latter did not in the least destroy the general\nimpression. To the students it did not appear so remarkable as it did to\nme. They were merely performing an act useful to science, as they\nthought; and, in passing, made casual observations: but I was a\nbenefactor; my object in going there was to help the unhappy, ruined,\ndepraved men and women whom I had expected to meet in this house.\nSuddenly, instead of unhappy, ruined, depraved beings, I found the\nmajority to be workingmen: quiet, satisfied, cheerful, kind, and very\ngood.\n\nI was still more strongly impressed when I found that in these lodgings\nthe crying want I wished to relieve had already been relieved before I\ncame. But by whom? By these same unhappy, depraved beings whom I was\nprepared to save! And this help was given in a way not open to me.\n\nIn one cellar lay a lonely old man suffering from typhus-fever. He had\nno connections in the world; yet a woman,--a widow with a little\ngirl,--quite a stranger to him, but living in the corner next to him,\nnursed him, gave him tea, and bought him medicine with her own money.\n\nIn another lodging lay a woman in puerperal fever. A woman of the town\nwas nursing her child, and had prepared a sucking-bottle for him, and\nhad not gone out to ply her sad trade for two days.\n\nAn orphan girl was taken into the family of a tailor, who had three\nchildren of his own. Thus, there remained only such miserable unoccupied\nmen as retired officials, clerks, men-servants out of situations,\nbeggars, tipsy people, prostitutes, children, whom it was not possible\nto help all at once by means of money, but whose cases it was necessary\nto consider carefully before assisting them. I had been seeking for men\nsuffering immediately from want of means, whom one might be able to help\nby sharing one\'s superfluities with them. I had not found them. All whom\nI had seen, it would have been very difficult to assist materially\nwithout devoting time and care to their cases.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThese unfortunate necessitous ones ranged themselves in my mind under\nthree heads: First, those who had lost former advantageous positions,\nand who were waiting to return to them (such men belonged to the lowest\nas well as to the highest classes of society); Secondly, women of the\ntown, who are very numerous in these houses; and Thirdly, children.\n\nThe majority of those I found, and noted down, were men who had lost\nformer places, and were desirous of returning to them, chiefly of the\nbetter class, and government officials. In almost all the lodgings we\nentered with the landlord, we were told, "Here we need not trouble to\nfill up the card ourselves: the man here is able to do it, provided he\nis not tipsy."\n\nThus summoned by Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, there would appear, from some dark\ncorner, the once rich nobleman or official, mostly drunk, and always\nhalf-dressed. If he were not drunk, he willingly undertook the task: he\nkept nodding his head with a sense of importance, knitted his brows,\ninserted now and then learned terms in his remarks, and carefully\nholding in his dirty, trembling hands the neat pink card, looked round\nat his fellow-lodgers with pride and contempt, as if he were now, by the\nsuperiority of his education, triumphing over those who had been\ncontinually humbling him.\n\nHe was evidently pleased to have intercourse with the world which used\npink cards, with a world of which he himself had once been a member.\n\nTo my questions about his life, this kind of man not only replied\nwillingly, but with enthusiasm,--beginning to tell a story, fixed in his\nmind like a prayer, about all kinds of misfortunes which had happened to\nhim, and chiefly about his former position, in which, considering his\neducation, he ought to have remained.\n\nMany such people are scattered about in all the tenements of the\nRzhanoff Houses. One lodging-house was tenanted exclusively by them,\nwomen and men. As we approached them, Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch said, "Now, here\'s\nwhere the nobility live."\n\nThe lodging was full. Almost all the lodgers--about forty persons--were\nat home. In the whole house, there were no faces so ruined and\ndegraded-looking as these,--if old, flabby; if young, pale and haggard.\n\nI talked with several of them. Almost always the same story was told,\ndiffering only in degree of development. One and all had been once rich,\nor had still a rich father or brother or uncle; or either his father or\nhis unfortunate self had held a high office. Then came some misfortune\ncaused by envious enemies, or his own imprudent kindness, or some\nout-of-the-way occurrence; and, having lost everything, he was obliged\nto descend to these strange and hateful surroundings, among lice and\nrags, in company with drunkards and loose characters, feeding upon bread\nand liver, and subsisting by beggary.\n\nAll the thoughts, desires, and recollections of these men are turned\ntoward the past. The present appears to them as something unnatural,\nhideous, and unworthy of attention. It does not exist for them. They\nhave only recollections of the past, and expectations of the future\nwhich may be realized at any moment, and for the attainment of which but\nvery little is needed; but, unfortunately, this little is out of their\nreach; it cannot be got anywhere: and so one has wasted one year,\nanother five, and a third thirty years.\n\nOne needs only to be dressed respectably in order to call on a\nwell-known person who is kindly disposed toward him; another requires\nonly to be dressed, have his debts paid, and go to some town or other; a\nthird wants to take his effects out of pawn, and get a small sum to\ncarry on a law-suit, which must be decided in his favour, and then all\nwill be well again. All say that they have need of some external\ncircumstance in order to regain that position which they think natural\nand happy.\n\nIf I had not been blinded by my pride in being a benefactor, I should\nhave needed only to look a little closer into their faces, young and\nold, which were generally weak, sensual, but kind, in order to\nunderstand that their misfortunes could not be met by external means;\nthat they could be happy in no position while their present conception\nof life remained the same; that they were by no means peculiar people in\npeculiarly unhappy circumstances, but that they were like all other men,\nourselves included.\n\nI remember well how my intercourse with men of this class was\nparticularly trying to me. I now understand why it was so. In them I saw\nmy own self as in a mirror. If I had considered carefully my own life\nand the lives of people of my own class, I should have seen that between\nus and these unfortunate men there existed no essential difference.\n\nThose who live around me in expensive suites of apartments and houses of\ntheir own in the best streets of the city, eating something better than\nliver or herring with their bread, are none the less unhappy. They also\nare discontented with their lot, regret the past, and desire a happier\nfuture, precisely as did the wretched tenants of the Rzhanoff Houses.\nBoth wished to be worked less and to be worked for more, the difference\nbetween them being only in degrees of idleness.\n\nUnfortunately, I did not see this at first, nor did I understand that\nsuch people needed to be relieved, not by my charity, but from their own\nfalse views of the world; and that to change a man\'s estimate of life he\nmust be given one more accurate than his own, which, unhappily, not\npossessing myself, I could not communicate to others.\n\nThese men were unhappy not because, to use an illustration, they were\nwithout nourishing food, but because their stomachs were spoiled; and\nthey required, not nourishment, but a tonic. I did not see that in order\nto help them, it was not necessary to give them food but to teach them\nhow to eat. Though I am anticipating, I must say that of all these\npeople whose names I put down I did not in reality help one,\nnotwithstanding that everything some of them had desired was done to\nrelieve them. Of these I became acquainted with three men in particular.\nAll three, after many failures and much assistance, are now in the same\nposition they were in three years ago.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nThe second class of unfortunates, whom I hoped afterwards to be able to\nhelp, were women of the town. These women were very numerous in the\nRzhanoff Houses; and they were of every kind, from young girls still\nbearing some likeness to women, to old and fearful-looking creatures\nwithout a vestige of humanity. The hope of helping these women, whom I\nhad not at first in view, was aroused by the following circumstances.\n\nWhen we had finished half of our tour, we had already acquired a\nsomewhat mechanical method. On entering a new lodging we at once asked\nfor the landlord. One of us sat down, clearing a space to write; and the\nother went from one to another, questioning each man and woman in the\nroom, and reporting the information obtained to him who was writing.\n\nOn our entering one of the basement lodgings, the student went to look\nfor the landlord; and I began to question all who were in the place.\nThis place was divided thus: In the middle of the room, which was four\nyards square, there stood a stove. From the stove four partitions or\nscreens radiated, making a similar number of small compartments. In the\nfirst of these, which had two doors in it opposite each other, and four\npallets, were an old man and a woman. Next to this was a rather long but\nnarrow room, in which was the landlord, a young, pale, good-looking man\ndressed in a gray woollen coat. To the left of the first division was a\nthird small room where a man was sleeping, seemingly tipsy, and a woman\nin a pink dressing-gown. The fourth compartment was behind a partition,\naccess to it being through the landlord\'s room.\n\nThe student entered the latter, while I remained in the first,\nquestioning the old man and the woman. The former had been a compositor,\nbut now had no means of livelihood whatever.\n\nThe woman was a cook\'s wife.\n\nI went into the third compartment, and asked the woman in the\ndressing-gown about the man who was asleep.\n\nShe answered that he was a visitor.\n\nI asked her who she was.\n\nShe replied that she was a peasant girl from the county of Moscow.\n\n"What is your occupation?" She laughed, and made no answer.\n\n"What do you do for your living?" I repeated, thinking she had not\nunderstood the question.\n\n"I sit in the inn," she said.\n\nI did not understand her, and asked again,--\n\n"What are your means of living?"\n\nShe gave me no answer, but continued to giggle. In the fourth room,\nwhere we had not yet been, I heard the voices of women also giggling.\n\nThe landlord came out of his room, and approached us. He had evidently\nheard my questions and the woman\'s answers. He glanced sternly at her,\nand, turning to me, said, "She is a prostitute"; and it was evident that\nhe was pleased that he knew this word,--which is the one used in\nofficial circles,--and at having pronounced it correctly. And having\nsaid this with a respectful smile of satisfaction towards me, he turned\nto the woman. As he did so, the expression of his face changed. In a\npeculiarly contemptuous manner, and with rapid utterance as one would\nspeak to a dog, he said, without looking at her, "Don\'t be a fool!\ninstead of saying you sit in the inn, speak plainly, and say you are a\nprostitute.--She does not even yet know her proper name," he said,\nturning to me.\n\nThis manner of speaking shocked me.\n\n"It is not for us to shame her," I said. "If we were all living\naccording to God\'s commandment, there would be no such persons."\n\n"There are such doings," said the landlord, with an artificial smile.\n\n"Therefore we must pity them, and not reproach them. Is it their fault?"\n\nI do not remember exactly what I said. I remember only that I was\ndisgusted by the disdainful tone of this young landlord, in a lodging\nfilled with females whom he termed prostitutes; and I pitied the woman,\nand expressed both feelings.\n\nNo sooner had I said this, than I heard from the small compartment where\nthe giggling had been, the noise of creaking bed-boards; and over the\npartition, which did not reach to the ceiling, appeared the dishevelled\ncurly head of a female with small swollen eyes, and a shining red face;\na second, and then a third, head followed. They were evidently standing\non their beds; and all three were stretching their necks and holding\ntheir breath, and looking silently at me with strained attention.\n\nA painful silence followed.\n\nThe student, who had been smiling before this happened, now became\ngrave; the landlord became confused, and cast down his eyes; and the\nwomen continued to look at me in expectation.\n\nI felt more disconcerted than all the rest. I had certainly not expected\nthat a casual word would produce such an effect. It was like the field\nof battle covered with dead bones seen by the prophet Ezekiel, on which,\ntrembling from contact with the spirit, the dead bones began to move. I\nhad casually uttered a word of love and pity, which produced upon all\nsuch an effect that it seemed as if they had been only waiting for it,\nto cease to be corpses, and to become alive again.\n\nThey continued to look at me, as if wondering what would come next, as\nif waiting for me to say those words and do those acts by which these\ndry bones would begin to come together,--be covered with flesh and\nreceive life.\n\nBut I felt, alas! that I had no such words or deeds to give, or to\ncontinue as I had begun. In the depth of my soul I felt that I had told\na lie, that I myself was like them, that I had nothing more to say; and\nI began to write down on the card the names and the occupations of all\nthe lodgers there.\n\nThis occurrence led me into a new kind of error. I began to think that\nthese unhappy creatures also could be helped. This, in my self\ndeception, it seemed to me would be very easily done. I said to myself,\n"Now we shall put down the names of these women too; and afterwards,\nwhen we (though it never occurred to me to ask who were the _we_) have\nwritten everything down, we can occupy ourselves with their affairs." I\nimagined that _we_, the very persons who, during many generations, have\nbeen leading such women into such a condition, and still continue to do\nso, could one fine morning wake up and remedy it all. And yet, if I\ncould have recollected my conversation with the lost woman who was\nnursing the baby for the sick mother, I should have understood the folly\nof such an idea.\n\nWhen we first saw this woman nursing the child, we thought that it was\nhers; but upon our asking her what she was, she answered us plainly that\nshe was a wench. She did not say "prostitute." It was left for the\nproprietor of the lodgings to make use of that terrible word.\n\nThe supposition that she had a child gave me the idea of helping her out\nof her present position.\n\n"Is this child yours?" I asked.\n\n"No: it is that woman\'s there."\n\n"Why do you nurse him?"\n\n"She asked me to. She is dying."\n\nThough my surmise turned out to be wrong, I continued to speak with her\nin the same spirit. I began to question her as to who she was, and how\nshe came to be in such a position. She told me her story willingly, and\nvery plainly. She belonged to the artisan class of Moscow, the daughter\nof a factory workman. She was left an orphan, and adopted by her aunt,\nfrom whose house she began to visit the inns. The aunt was now dead.\n\nWhen I asked her whether she wished to change her course of life, my\nquestion did not even interest her. How can a supposition about\nsomething quite impossible awaken an interest in any one? She smiled and\nsaid,--\n\n"Who would take me with a yellow ticket?"[3]\n\n  [3] The police certificate of registration as a prostitute.--Ed.\n\n"But," said I, "if it were possible to find you a situation as a cook or\nsomething else?" I said this because she looked like a strong woman,\nwith a kind, dull, round face, not unlike many cooks I had seen.\n\nEvidently my words did not please her. She repeated, "Cook! but I do not\nunderstand how to bake bread."\n\nShe spoke jestingly; but, by the expression of her face, I saw that she\nwas unwilling; that she even considered the position and rank of a cook\nbeneath her.\n\nThis woman, who, in the most simple manner, like the widow in the\ngospel, had sacrificed all that she had for a sick person, at the same\ntime, like other women of the same profession, considered the position\nof a workman or workwoman low and despicable. She had been educated to\nlive without work,--a life which all her friends considered quite\nnatural. This was her misfortune. And by this she came into her present\nposition, and is kept in it. This brought her to the inns. Who of us men\nand women will cure her of this false view of life? Are there among us\nany men convinced that a laborious life is more respectable than an idle\none, and who are living according to this conviction, and who make this\nthe test of their esteem and respect?\n\nIf I had thought about it I should have understood that neither I nor\nanybody else I know, was able to cure a person of this disease.\n\nI should have understood that those wondering and awakened faces that\nlooked over the partition expressed merely astonishment at the pity\nshown to them, but no wish to reform their lives. They did not see the\nimmorality. They knew that they were despised and condemned, but the\nreason for this they could not understand. They had lived in this manner\nfrom their infancy among women like themselves, who, they know very\nwell, have always existed, do exist, and are necessary to society, that\nthere are officials deputed by government to see that they conform to\nregulations.\n\nBesides, they know that they have power over men, and subdue them, and\noften influence them more than any other women. They see that their\nposition in society, notwithstanding the fact that they are always\nblamed, is recognised by men as well as by women and by the government;\nand therefore they cannot even understand of what they have to repent,\nand wherein they should reform.\n\nDuring one of our tours the student told me that in one of the lodgings\nthere was a woman who sends out her daughter, thirteen years old, to\nwalk the streets. Wishing to save this little girl I went on purpose to\ntheir lodging.\n\nMother and daughter were living in great poverty. The mother, a small,\ndark-complexioned prostitute of forty years of age, was not simply ugly,\nbut disagreeably ugly. The daughter was also bad-looking. To all my\nindirect questions about their mode of life, the mother replied curtly,\nwith a look of suspicion and animosity, apparently feeling that I was an\nenemy with bad intentions: the daughter said nothing without looking\nfirst at the mother, in whom she evidently had entire confidence.\n\nThey did not awaken pity in my heart, but rather disgust. Still I\ndecided that it was necessary to save the daughter, to awaken an\ninterest in ladies who might sympathize with the miserable condition of\nthese women and might so be brought here.\n\nYet if I had thought about the antecedents of the mother, how she had\ngiven birth to her daughter, how she had fed and brought her up,\ncertainly without any outside help, and with great sacrifices to\nherself; if I had thought of the view of life which had formed itself in\nher mind,--I should have understood, that, in the mother\'s conduct,\nthere was nothing at all bad or immoral, seeing she had been doing for\nher daughter all she could; i.e., what she considered best for herself.\n\nIt was possible to take this girl away from her mother by force; but to\nconvince her that she was doing wrong in selling her daughter was not\npossible. It would first be necessary to save this woman--this\nmother--from a condition of life approved by every one, and according to\nwhich a woman may live without marrying and without working, serving\nexclusively as a gratification to the passions. If I had thought about\nthis, I should have understood that the majority of those ladies whom I\nwished to send here for saving this girl were not only themselves\navoiding family duties, and leading idle and sensuous lives, but were\nconsciously educating their daughters for this very same mode of\nexistence. One mother leads her daughter to the inn, and another to\ncourt and to balls. Both the views of the world held by both mothers are\nthe same; viz., that a woman must gratify the passions of men, and for\nthat she must be fed, dressed, and taken care of.\n\nHow, then, are our ladies to reform this woman and her daughter?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nStill more strange were my dealings with the children. In my _r\xc3\xb4le_ as\nbenefactor I paid attention to the children too, wishing to save\ninnocent beings from going to ruin in this den; and I wrote down their\nnames in order to attend to them myself _afterwards_.\n\nAmong these children my attention was particularly drawn to Serozha, a\nboy twelve years old. I sincerely pitied this clever, intelligent lad,\nwho had been living with a bootmaker, and who was left without any place\nof refuge when his master was put into prison. I wished to do something\nfor him.\n\nI will now give the result of my benevolence in his case, because this\nboy\'s story will show my false position as a benefactor better than\nanything else.\n\nI took the boy into my house, and lodged him in the kitchen. Could I\npossibly bring a lousy boy out of a den of depravity to my children? I\nconsidered that I had been very kind in having put him where he was,\namongst my servants. I thought myself a great benefactor for having\ngiven him some of my old clothes and fed him; though it was properly my\ncook who did it, not I. The boy remained in my house about a week.\n\nDuring this week I saw him twice, and, passing him, spoke some words to\nhim, and, when out walking, called on a bootmaker whom I knew and\nproposed the boy as an apprentice. A peasant who was on a visit at my\nhouse invited him to go to his village and work in a family. The boy\nrefused to accept it and disappeared within a week.\n\nI went to Rzhanoff\'s house to enquire after him. He had returned there;\nbut when I called, he was not at home. He had already been two days in a\nmenagerie in Presnem Ponds, where he hired himself for 6d. a day to\nappear in a procession of savages in costume, leading an elephant. There\nwas some public show on at the time.\n\nI went to see him again, but he was so ungrateful, he evidently avoided\nme. Had I reflected upon the life of this boy and on my own, I should\nhave understood that the boy had been spoiled by the fact of his having\ntasted the sweets of a merry and idle life, and that he had lost the\nhabit of working. And I, in order to confer on him a benefit and reform\nhim, took him into my own house. And what did he see there? He saw my\nchildren, some older than he, some younger, and some of the same age,\nwho not only never did anything for themselves, but gave as much work to\nothers as they could. They dirtied and spoiled everything about them,\nsurfeited themselves with all sorts of dainties, broke the china, upset\nand threw to the dogs food which would have been a treat to him. If I\ntook him out of a den and brought him to a respectable place, he could\nnot but assimilate the views of life which existed there; and, according\nto these views, he understood that in a respectable position one must\nlive without working, eat and drink well, and lead a merry life.\n\nTrue, he did not know that my children had much labour in learning the\nexceptions in Latin and Greek grammars; nor would he have been able to\nunderstand the object of such work. But one cannot help seeing that even\nhad he understood it the influence upon him of the example of my\nchildren would have been still stronger. He would have then understood\nthat they were being educated in such a way, that, not working now, they\nmight afterwards also work as little as possible, and enjoy the good\nthings of life by virtue of their diplomas.\n\nBut what he did understand of it made him go, not to the peasant to take\ncare of cattle and feed on potatoes and kvas,[4] but to the menagerie in\nthe costume of a savage to lead an elephant for 6d. a day. I ought to\nhave understood how foolish it was of one who was educating his own\nchildren in complete idleness and luxury to try to reform other men and\ntheir children, and save them from going to ruin and idleness in what I\ncalled the _dens_ in Rzhanoff\'s house; where, however, three-fourths of\nthe men were working for themselves and for others. But then I\nunderstood nothing of all this.\n\n  [4] An unfermented home-made liquor used by Russian peasants.--Ed.\n\nIn Rzhanoff\'s house there were a great many children in the most\nmiserable condition. There were children of prostitutes, orphans, and\nchildren carried about the streets by beggars. They were all very\nwretched. But my experience with Serozha showed me that so long as I\ncontinued living the life I did I was not able to help them.\n\nWhile the boy was living with us I remember I took pains to hide from\nhim our way of life, particularly that of my children. I felt that all\nmy endeavours to lead him to a good and laborious life were frustrated\nby my example and that of my children. It is very easy to take away a\nchild from a prostitute or a beggar. It is very easy, when one has\nmoney, to wash him, dress him in new clothes, feed him well, and even\nteach him different accomplishments; but to teach him how to earn his\nliving, is, for us who have not been earning ours but doing just the\ncontrary, not only difficult but quite impossible, because by our\nexample and by the very improvements of his mode of life effected by us\nwithout any cost on our part, we teach him the very opposite.\n\nYou may take a puppy, pet him, feed him, teach him to carry things after\nyou, and be pleased with looking at him: but it is not enough to feed a\nman, dress him, and teach him Greek; you must teach him how to live;\ni.e., how to take less from others and give them more in return: and yet\nthrough our own mode of life we cannot help teaching him the very\nopposite whether we take him into our house or put him into a home to\nbring up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nI have never since experienced such a feeling of compassion towards men\nand of aversion towards myself, as I felt in Liapin\'s house. I was now\nfilled with the desire to carry out the scheme I had already begun and\nto do good to the men whom I had met.\n\nAnd, strange to say, though it might seem that to do good and to give\nmoney to those in want of it was a good deed, and ought to dispose men\nto universal love, it turned out quite the reverse; calling up in me\nbitter feelings and disposition to censure them. Even during our first\ntour a scene occurred similar to that in Liapin\'s house; but it failed\nto produce again the same effect and created a very different\nimpression.\n\nIt began with my finding in one of the lodgings a miserable person who\nrequired immediate help,--a woman who had not eaten food for two days.\n\nIt happened thus: In one very large and almost empty night-lodging, I\nasked an old woman whether there were any poor people who had nothing to\neat. She hesitated a moment and then named two; then suddenly, as if\nrecollecting herself, she said, "Yes, there lies one of them," pointing\nto a pallet. "This one," she added, "indeed, has nothing to eat."\n\n"You don\'t say so! Who is she?"\n\n"She has been a lost woman; but as nobody takes her now, she can\'t earn\nanything. The landlady has had pity on her, but now she wants to turn\nher out.--Agafia! I say, Agafia!" cried the old woman.\n\nWe went a little nearer, and saw something rise from the pallet. This\nwas a grey-haired, dishevelled woman, thin as a skeleton, in a dirty,\ntorn chemise, and with peculiarly glittering, immovable eyes. She looked\nfixedly beyond us, tried to snatch up her jacket behind her in order to\ncover her bony chest, and growled out like a dog, "What? what?"\n\nI asked her how she managed to live. For some time she was unable to see\nthe drift of my words and said, "I don\'t know myself; they are going to\nturn me out."\n\nI asked again; and oh, how ashamed of myself I feel! my hand can\nscarcely write it! I asked her whether it was true that she was\nstarving. She replied in the same feverish, excited manner, "I had\nnothing to eat yesterday; I have had nothing to eat to-day."\n\nThe miserable aspect of this woman impressed me deeply, but quite\ndifferently from those in Liapin\'s house: there, out of pity for them, I\nfelt embarrassed and ashamed of myself; but here, I rejoiced that I had\nat last found what I had been looking for,--a hungry being.\n\nI gave her a ruble and I remember how glad I felt that the others had\nseen it.\n\nThe old woman forthwith asked me also for money. It was so pleasant to\nme to give that I handed her some also, without thinking whether it was\nnecessary or not. She accompanied me to the door, and those who were in\nthe corridor heard how she thanked me. Probably my questions about the\npoor provoked expectations, for some of the inmates began to follow us\nwherever we went.\n\nAmong those that begged, there were evidently drunkards, who gave me a\nmost disagreeable impression; but having once given to the old woman I\nthought I had no right to refuse them, and I began to give away more.\nThis only increased the number of applicants, and there was a stir\nthroughout the whole lodging-house.\n\nOn the stairs and in the galleries, people appeared dogging my steps.\nWhen I came out of the yard, a boy ran quickly down the stairs, pushing\nthrough the people. He did not notice me and said hurriedly,--\n\n"He gave a ruble to Agafia!"\n\nHaving reached the ground, he, too, joined the crowd that was following\nme. I came out into the street. All sorts of people crowded round\nbegging for money. Having given away all I had in coppers, I entered a\nshop and asked the proprietor to give me change for ten rubles.\n\nHere occurred a scene similar to that which took place in Liapin\'s\nhouse. A dreadful confusion ensued. Old women, seedy gentlefolk,\npeasants, children, all crowded about the shop, stretching out their\nhands; I gave, and asked some of them about their position and means,\nand entered all in my note-book. The shopkeeper, having turned up the\nfur collar of his great-coat, was sitting like a statue, glancing now\nand then at the crowd, and again staring beyond it. He apparently felt\nlike everyone else, that all this was very foolish, but he dared not say\nso.\n\nIn Liapin\'s house the misery and humiliation of the people had\noverwhelmed me; and I felt myself to blame for it, and also the desire\nand the possibility of becoming a better man. But though the scene here\nwas similar, it produced quite a different effect. In the first place, I\nfelt angry with many of those who assailed me, and then anxious as to\nwhat the shopmen and the dvorniks might think of me. I returned home\nthat day with a weight on my mind. I knew that what I had done was\nfoolish and inconsistent; but, as usual when my conscience was troubled,\nI talked the more about my projected plan, as if I had no doubt whatever\nas to its success.\n\nThe next day I went alone to those whom I had noted down, and who seemed\nthe most miserable, thinking they could be more easily helped than\nothers.\n\nAs I have already mentioned, I was not really able to help any of these\npeople. It turned out that to do so was more difficult than I had\nimagined: in short, I only tormented these men and helped no one.\n\nBefore the last visiting-tour I went several times to Rzhanoff\'s house,\nand each time the same thing occurred: I was assailed by a crowd of men\nand women in the midst of whom I utterly lost my presence of mind.\n\nI felt the impossibility of doing anything because there were so many of\nthem; besides, each of them, taken separately, did not awaken any\nsympathy in me. I felt that every one lied, or at least prevaricated,\nand regarded me only as a purse out of which money could be drawn. It\noften seemed to me that the very money extorted from me did not improve\ntheir position but only made it worse.\n\nThe oftener I went to these houses, the closer the intercourse which I\nhad with the inmates, the more apparent became the impossibility of\ndoing anything; but notwithstanding this, I did not give up my plan\nuntil after the last night tour with the census-takers.\n\nI feel more ashamed of this visit than of any other. Formerly I had gone\nalone, but now twenty of us went together. At seven o\'clock all who\nwished to take part in this last tour began to assemble in my house.\nThey were almost all strangers to me. Some students, an officer, and two\nof my fashionable acquaintances, who, after having repeated the usual\nphrase, "C\'est tr\xc3\xa8s int\xc3\xa9ressant!" asked me to put them into the number\nof the census-takers.\n\nThese fashionable friends of mine had dressed themselves in\nshooting-jackets and tall travelling boots, which they thought more\nsuited to the visit than their ordinary clothes. They carried with them\npeculiar pocket-books and extraordinary-looking pencils. They were in\nthat agitated state of mind which one experiences just before going to a\nhunt, or to a duel, or into a battle. The falseness and foolishness of\nour enterprise was now more apparent to me in looking at them; but were\nwe not all in the same ridiculous position?\n\nBefore starting we had a conference, somewhat like a council of war, as\nto what we should begin with, how to divide ourselves, and so on. This\nconference was just like all other official councils, meetings, and\ncommittees: each spoke, not because he had anything to say, or to ask,\nbut because every one tried to find something to say in order not to be\nbehind the rest. But during the conversation no one alluded to the acts\nof benevolence to which I had so many times referred; and however much\nashamed I felt, I found it was needful to remind them that we must carry\nout our charitable intentions by writing down, during the visiting-tour,\nthe names of all whom we should find in a destitute condition.\n\nI had always felt ashamed to speak about these matters; but here, in the\nmidst of our hurried preparations for the expedition, I could scarcely\nutter a word about them. All listened to me and seemed touched, all\nagreed with me in words; but it was evident that each of them knew that\nit was folly, and that it would lead to nothing, and so they began at\nonce to talk about other subjects, and continued doing so until it was\ntime for us to start.\n\nWe came to the dark tavern, aroused the waiters, and began to sort out\npapers. When we were told that the people, having heard about this\nvisiting-tour, had begun to leave their lodgings, we asked the landlord\nto shut the gate, and we ourselves went to the yard to persuade those to\nremain who wanted to escape, assuring them that no one would ask to see\ntheir passports.\n\nI remember the strange and painful impression produced upon me by these\nfrightened night-lodgers. Ragged and half-dressed, they all appeared\ntall by the light of the lantern in the dark court-yard. Frightened and\nhorrible in their terror, they stood in a small knot round the\npestilential out-house, listening to our persuasions, but not believing\nus; and, evidently, like hunted animals, prepared to do anything to\nescape from us.\n\nGentlemen of all kinds, town and country policemen, public coroner and\njudges, had, all their lives, been hunting them in towns and villages,\non the roads and in the streets, in the taverns and in the\nlodging-houses, and suddenly these gentlemen had come at night and shut\nthe gate, only, forsooth, in order to count them! They found this as\ndifficult to believe as it would be for hares to believe that the dogs\nhad come out not to catch but to count them.\n\nBut the gates were shut, and the frightened night-lodgers returned to\ntheir places; and we, having separated into groups, began our visit.\nWith me were my fashionable acquaintances and two students. V\xc3\xa1nya, with\na lantern, went before us in a great-coat and white trousers, and we\nfollowed. We entered lodgings well known to me. The place was familiar,\nsome of the persons also; but the majority were new to me, and the\nspectacle was also a new and dreadful one,--still more dreadful than\nthat which I had seen at Liapin\'s house. All the lodgings were filled,\nall the pallets occupied, and not only by one, but often by two persons.\nThe sight was dreadful, because of the closeness with which these people\nwere huddled together, and because of the indiscriminate commingling of\nmen and women. Such of the latter as were not dead-drunk were sleeping\nwith men. Many women with children slept with strange men on narrow\nbeds.\n\nThe spectacle was dreadful, owing to the misery, dirt, raggedness, and\nterror of these people; and chiefly because there were so many of them.\nOne lodging, then another, then a third, a tenth, a twentieth, and so\non, without end. And everywhere the same fearful stench, the same\nsuffocating exhalation, the same confusion of sexes, men and women,\ndrunk, or in a state of insensibility; the same terror, submissiveness,\nand guilt stamped on all faces, so that I felt deeply ashamed and\ngrieved, as I had before at Liapin\'s. At last I understood that what I\nwas about to do was disgusting, foolish, and therefore impossible; so I\nleft off writing down their names and questioning them, knowing now that\nnothing would come of it.\n\nI felt deeply hurt.\n\nAt Liapin\'s I had been like a man who sees a horrible wound on the body\nof another. He feels sorry for the man, ashamed of not having relieved\nhim before, yet he can still hope to help the sufferer; but now I was\nlike a doctor who comes with his own medicines to the patient, uncovers\nhis wound only to mangle it, and to confess to himself that all he has\ndone has been done in vain, and that his remedy is ineffectual.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nThis visit gave the last blow to my self-deception. It became very\nevident to me that my aim was not only foolish, but even productive of\nevil. Yet, though I knew this, it seemed my duty to continue the project\na little longer: first, because of the article I had written and by my\nvisits I had raised the expectations of the poor; secondly, because what\nI had said and written had awakened the sympathy of some benefactors,\nmany of whom had promised to assist me personally and with money. And I\nwas expecting to be applied to by both, and hoped to satisfy them as\nwell as I was able.\n\nAs regards the applications made to me by those who were in need, the\nfollowing details may be given: I received more than a hundred letters,\nwhich came exclusively from the "rich poor," if I may so express myself.\nSome of them I visited, and some I left unanswered. In no instance did I\nsucceed in doing any good. All the applications made to me were from\npersons who were once in a privileged position (I call such persons\nprivileged who receive more from others than they give in return), had\nlost that position, and were desirous of regaining it. One wanted two\nhundred rubles in order to keep his business from going to ruin, and to\nenable him to finish the education of his children; another wanted to\nhave a photographic establishment; a third wanted money to pay his\ndebts, and take his best clothes out of pawn; a fourth was in need of a\npiano, in order to perfect himself and to earn money to support his\nfamily by giving lessons. The majority did not name any particular sum\nof money: they simply asked for help; but when I began to investigate\nwhat was necessary, it turned out that their wants increased in\nproportion to the help offered, and nothing satisfactorily resulted. I\nrepeat again, the fault may have been in my want of understanding; but\nin any case I helped no one, notwithstanding the fact that I made every\neffort to do so.\n\nAs for the philanthropists who were to co-operate with me, something\nvery strange and quite unexpected occurred: of all who promised to\nassist with money, and even stated the amount they would give, not one\ncontributed anything for distribution among the poor.\n\nThe promises of pecuniary assistance amounted to about three thousand\nrubles; but of all these people, not one recollected his agreement, or\ngave me a single kopek. The students alone gave the money which they\nreceived as payment for visiting, about twelve rubles; so that my\nscheme, which was to have collected tens of thousands of rubles from the\nrich, and to have saved hundreds and thousands of people from misery and\nvice, ended in my distributing at random some few rubles offered by the\nstudents, with twenty-five more sent me by the town-council for my\nlabour as manager, which I positively did not know what to do with.\n\nSo ended the affair.\n\nThen, before leaving Moscow for the country, on the Sunday before the\nCarnival, I went to the Rzhanoff house in the morning in order to\ndistribute the thirty-seven rubles among the poor. I visited all whom I\nknew in the lodgings, but found only one invalid, to whom I gave\nsomething,--five rubles, I think. There was nobody else to give to. Of\ncourse, many began to beg; but, as I did not know them, I made up my\nmind to take the advice of Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, the tavern-keeper, respecting\nthe distribution of the remaining thirty-two rubles.\n\nIt was the first day of the carnival. Everybody was smartly dressed, all\nhad had food, and many were drunk. In the yard near the corner of the\nhouse stood an old-clothes man, dressed in a ragged peasant\'s coat and\nbark shoes. He was still hale and hearty. Sorting his purchases, he was\nputting them into different heaps,--leather, iron, and other\nthings,--and was singing a merry song at the top of his voice.\n\nI began to talk with him. He was seventy years of age; had no relatives;\nearned his living by dealing in old clothes, and not only did not\ncomplain, but said he had enough to eat, drink, and to spare. I asked\nhim who in the place were particularly in want. He became cross, and\nsaid plainly that there was no one in want but drunkards and idlers; but\non learning my object in asking, he begged me five kopeks for drink, and\nran to the tavern for it.\n\nI also went to the tavern to see Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, to ask him to\ndistribute the money for me. It was full; gayly-dressed tipsy\nprostitutes were walking to and fro; all the tables were occupied; many\npeople were already drunk; and in the small room someone was playing a\nharmonium, and two people were dancing. Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, out of respect\nfor me, ordered them to leave off, and sat down next me at a vacant\ntable. I asked him, as he knew his lodgers well, to point out those most\nin want, as I was intrusted with a little money for distribution, and\nwished him to direct me. The kind-hearted man (he died a year after)\ngave me his attention for a time in order to oblige me, although he had\nto wait on his customers. He began to think it over, and was evidently\npuzzled. One old waiter had overheard us, and took his part in the\nconference.\n\nThey began to go over his lodgers, some of whom were known to me, but\nthey could not agree. "Paramonovna," suggested the waiter.\n\n"Well; yes, she does go hungry sometimes; but she drinks."\n\n"What difference does that make?"\n\n"Well, Spiridon Ivanovitch, he has children; that\'s the man for you."\n\nBut Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch had doubts about Spiridon too.\n\n"Akulina, but she has a pension. Ah, but there is the blind man!"\n\nTo him I myself objected: I had just seen him. This was an old man of\neighty years of age, without any relatives. One could scarcely imagine\nany condition to be worse; and yet I had just seen him lying drunk on a\nfeather bed, cursing at his comparatively young mistress in the most\nfilthy language.\n\nThey then named a one-armed boy and his mother. I saw that Iv\xc3\xa1n\nFedotitch was in great difficulty owing to his conscientiousness, for he\nknew that every thing given away by me would be spent at his tavern. But\nas I had to get rid of my thirty-two rubles, I insisted, and we managed\nsomehow or other to distribute the money. Those who received it were\nmostly well-dressed, and we had not far to go to find them: they were\nall in the tavern. The one-armed boy came in top-boots and a red shirt\nand waistcoat.\n\nThus ended all my benevolent enterprises; and I left for the country\nvexed with everyone, as it always happens when one does something\nfoolish and harmful. Nothing came of it all, except the train of\nthoughts and feelings which it called forth in me, which not only did\nnot cease, but doubly agitated my mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nWhat did it all mean?\n\nI had lived in the country and had entered into relations with the\ncountry-poor. It is not out of false modesty, but that I may state the\ntruth, which is necessary in order to understand the run of all my\nthoughts and feelings, that I must say that in the country I had done\nperhaps but little for the poor, the help which had been required of me\nwas so small; but even the little I had done had been useful, and had\nformed round me an atmosphere of love and sympathy with my\nfellow-creatures, in the midst of whom it might yet be possible for me\nto quiet the gnawing of my conscience as to the unlawfulness of my life\nof luxury.\n\nOn going to the city I had hoped for the same happy relations with the\npoor, but here things were upon quite another footing. In the city,\npoverty was at once less truthful, more exacting, and more bitter, than\nin the country. It was chiefly because there was so much more of it\naccumulated together, that it produced upon me a most harrowing\nimpression. What I experienced at Liapin\'s house made my own luxurious\nlife seem monstrously evil. I could not doubt the sincerity and strength\nof this conviction; yet, notwithstanding this, I was quite incapable of\ncarrying out a revolution which demanded an entire change in my mode of\nlife: I was frightened at the prospect, and so I resorted to\ncompromises. I accepted what I was told by everyone, and what has been\nsaid by everybody since the world began,--that riches and luxury are in\nthemselves no evil, that they are given by God, and that whilst\ncontinuing to live luxuriously it is possible to help those in need. I\nbelieved this and wanted to do so. And I wrote an article in which I\ncalled upon all rich people to help. These all admitted themselves\nmorally obliged to agree with me, but evidently did not wish to do or\ngive anything for the poor, or could not do so.\n\nI then began visiting, and discovered what I had in no way expected to\nsee. On the one hand, I saw in these dens (as I had at first called\nthem) men whom it was impossible for me to help, because they were\nworking-men, accustomed to labour and privation, and therefore having a\nmuch firmer hold on life than I had. On the other hand, I saw miserable\nmen whom I could not aid because they were just such as I was myself.\nThe majority of the poor whom I saw were wretched, merely because they\nhad lost the capacity, desire, and habit of earning their bread; in\nother words, their misery consisted in the fact that they were just like\nmyself. Whereas, of poor people to whom it was possible to give\nimmediate assistance--those suffering from illness, cold, and hunger,--I\nfound none, except the starving Agafia; and I became persuaded that,\nbeing so far removed from the life of those whom I wished to succour, it\nwas almost impossible to find such need as I sought, because all real\nneed was attended to by those amongst whom these unhappy creatures\nlived: and my principal conviction now was, that, with money, I could\nnever reform that life of misery which these people led.\n\nI was persuaded of this: yet a feeling of shame to leave off all I had\nbegun, and self-deception as to my own virtues, made me continue my plan\nfor some time longer till it died a natural death; thus, only with great\ndifficulty and the help of Iv\xc3\xa1n Fedotitch, I managed to distribute in\nthe tavern at Rzhanoff\'s house the thirty-seven rubles which I\nconsidered were not my own.\n\nOf course I might have continued this style of thing and have\ntransformed it into a kind of charity; and, by importuning those who\npromised to give me money, I might have obtained and distributed more,\nthus comforting myself with the idea of my own excellence: but I became\nconvinced on the one hand that we rich people do not wish,--and are also\nunable,--to distribute to the poor a portion of our superfluities (we\nhave so many wants ourselves), and that money should not be given to any\none if we really wish to do good, instead of merely distributing it at\nrandom as I had done in the Rzhanoff tavern. So I dropped the affair\nentirely and in despair quitted Moscow for my own village.\n\nI intended on returning home to write a pamphlet on my experience, and\nto state why my project had not succeeded. I wanted to justify myself\nfrom the imputations which resulted from my article on the census; I\nwanted also to denounce society and its heartless indifference; and I\ndesired to point out the causes of this town misery, and the necessity\nfor endeavouring to remedy it, as well as the means which I thought were\nrequisite for this purpose. I began even then to write, and fancied I\nhad many very important facts to communicate. But in vain did I rack my\nbrain: I could not manage it, notwithstanding the super-abundance of\nmaterial at my command, because of the irritation under which I wrote,\nand because I had not yet learned by experience what was necessary to\ngrasp the question rightly; still more because I had not become fully\nconscious of the cause of it all,--a very simple cause, deep-rooted in\nmyself. So the pamphlet was not finished at the commencement of the\npresent year (1884-1885).\n\nIn the matter of moral law we witness a strange phenomenon to which men\npay too little attention. If I speak to an unlearned man about geology,\nastronomy, history, natural philosophy, or mathematics, he receives the\ninformation as quite new to him, and never says to me, "There is nothing\nnew in what you tell me; every one knows it, and I have known it for a\nlong time." But tell a man one of the highest moral truths in the\nsimplest manner, in such a way as it has never been before formulated,\nand every ordinary man, particularly one who does not take any interest\nin moral questions, and, above all, one who dislikes them, is sure to\nsay, "Who does not know that? It has been always known and expressed."\nAnd he really believes this. Only those who can appreciate moral truths\nknow how to value their elucidation and simplification by a long and\nlaborious process, or can prize the transition from a proposition or\ndesire at first vaguely understood to a firm and determined expression\ncalling for a corresponding change of conduct.\n\nWe are all accustomed to consider moral doctrine to be a very insipid\nand dull affair in which there can be nothing new or interesting;\nwhereas, in reality, human life, with all its complicated and varied\nactions which seem to have no connection with morals,--political\nactivity, activity in the sciences, in the arts, and in commerce,--has\nno other object than to elucidate moral truths more and more, and to\nconfirm, simplify, and make them accessible to all.\n\nI recollect once while walking in a street in Moscow I saw a man come\nout and examine the flag-stones attentively; then, choosing one of them,\nhe sat down by it and began to scrape and rub it vigorously.\n\n"What is he doing with the pavement?" I wondered; and, having come up\nclose to him, I discovered he was a young man from a butcher\'s shop, and\nwas sharpening his knife on the flag-stone. He was not thinking about\nthe stones when examining them, and still less while doing his work; he\nwas merely sharpening his knife. It was necessary for him to do so in\norder to cut the meat, but to me it seemed that he was doing something\nto the pavement.\n\nIn the same way mankind seems to be occupied with commerce, treaties,\nwars, sciences, arts; and yet for them one thing only is important, and\nthey do only that,--they are elucidating those moral laws by which they\nlive.\n\nMoral laws are already in existence, and mankind has been and is merely\nre-discovering them: this elucidation appears to be unimportant and\nimperceptible to one who has no need of moral law, and who does not\ndesire to live by it. Yet this is not only the chief but is the sole\nbusiness of all men. The elucidation is imperceptible in the same way as\nthe difference between a sharp knife and a blunt one is imperceptible. A\nknife remains a knife; and one who has not to cut anything with it will\nnot notice its edge: but for one who understands that all his life\ndepends more or less upon whether his knife is blunt or sharp, every\nimprovement in sharpening it is important; and such a man knows that\nthere must be no limit to this improvement, and that the knife is only\nreally a knife when it is sharp, and when it cuts what it has to cut.\n\nThe conviction of this truth flashed upon me when I began to write my\npamphlet. Previously it seemed to me that I knew everything about my\nsubject, that I had a thorough understanding of everything connected\nwith those questions which had been awakened in me by the impressions\nmade in Liapin\'s house and during the census; but when I tried to sum\nthem up, and to put them on paper, it turned out that the knife would\nnot cut, and had to be sharpened: so it is only now after three years\nthat I feel my knife is sharp enough for me to cut out what I want. It\nis not that I have learned new things: my thoughts are still the same;\nbut they were blunt formerly; they kept diverging in every direction;\nthere was no edge to them; nor was anything brought, as it is now, to\none central point, to one most simple and plain conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nI recollect that during the whole time of my unsuccessful endeavours to\nhelp the unfortunate inhabitants of Moscow, I felt I was like a man\ntrying to help others out of a bog, who was all the time stuck fast in\nit himself. Every effort made me feel the instability of the ground upon\nwhich I was standing. I felt that I myself was in this bog, but the\nacknowledgement did not help me to look more closely under my feet to\nfind out the nature of the ground on which I stood: I kept looking for\nsome external means to remedy the evil.\n\nI felt my life was a bad one, and that people ought not to live so; yet\nI did not come to the most natural and obvious conclusion: that I must\nfirst reform my own mode of life before I could have any conception of\nhow to reform others. And so I began at the wrong end, as it were. I was\nliving in town, and wished to improve the lives of the men there; but I\nsoon became convinced that I had no power to do so; and then I began to\nponder over the _nature_ of town life and town misery.\n\nI said to myself over and over again, "What is this town life and town\nmisery? And why, while living in town, am I unable to help the town\npoor?" The only reply I found was, that I was powerless to do anything\nfor them, First, because there were too many collected together in one\nplace; Secondly, because none of them were at all like those in the\ncountry. And again I asked myself, "Why are there so many here, and in\nwhat do they differ from the country poor?"\n\nTo both these questions the answer was the same. The poor are numerous\nin towns because all who have nothing to subsist on in the country are\ncollected there round the rich; and their peculiarity is due to the fact\nthat they have all come into the towns from the country to get a living.\n(If there are any town poor born there, whose fathers and grandfathers\nwere town born, these in their turn originally came there to get a\nliving.) But what are we to understand by the expression, "getting a\nliving in town"? There is something strange in the expression; it sounds\nlike a joke when we reflect on its meaning. How is it that from the\ncountry,--i.e., from places where there are woods, meadows, corn and\ncattle, where the earth yields the treasures of fertility--men come\naway, to get a living in a place where there are none of these\nadvantages, but only stones and dust? What then, do the words, "getting\na living in town," mean?\n\nSuch a phrase is constantly used, both by the employed and their\nemployers, as if it were quite clear and intelligible. I remember now\nall the hundreds and thousands of town people living well or ill with\nwhom I had spoken about their object in coming here; and all of them,\nwithout exception, told me they had quitted their villages "to get a\nliving"; that "Moscow neither sows nor reaps, yet lives in wealth"; that\nin Moscow there is abundance of everything; and that, therefore, in\nMoscow one may get the money which is needed in the country for corn,\ncottages, horses, and the other essentials of life.\n\nBut, in fact, the country is the source of all wealth; there, only, are\nreal riches,--corn, woods, horses, and everything necessary. Why go to\ntowns, then, to get what is to be had in the country? And why should\npeople carry away from the country into the towns the things that are\nnecessary for country people,--flour, oats, horses, and cattle?\n\nHundreds of times I have spoken thus with peasants who live in towns;\nand from my talks with them, and from my own observations, it became\nclear to me that the accumulation of country people in our cities is\npartly _necessary_, because they could not otherwise earn their\nlivelihood, and partly voluntary, because they are attracted by the\ntemptations of a town life.\n\nIt is true that the circumstances of a peasant are such, that, in order\nto satisfy the pecuniary demands made on him in his village, he cannot\ndo otherwise than sell that corn and cattle which he knows very well\nwill be necessary for himself; and he is compelled, whether he will or\nnot, to go to town to earn back what was his own. But it is also true\nthat he is attracted to town by the charms of a comparatively easy way\nof getting money, and by the luxury of life there; and, under the\npretext of earning his living, he goes there in order to have easier\nwork and better food, to drink tea three times a day, to dress himself\nsmartly, and even to get drunk and lead a dissolute life.\n\nThe cause is a simple one; for property passing from the hands of the\nagriculturalists into those of non-agriculturalists accumulates in\ntowns. Observe towards autumn how much wealth is gathered together in\nthe villages. Then come the demands of taxes, rents, recruiting; then\nthe temptations of vodka, marriages, feasts, peddlers, and all sorts of\nother snares; so that in one way or other, this property, all in its\nvarious forms (sheep, calves, cows, horses, pigs, poultry, eggs, butter,\nhemp, flax, rye, oats, buckwheat, peas, hemp-seed, and flax-seed),\npasses into the hands of strangers, and is taken first to provincial\ntowns, and thence to the capitals. A villager is compelled to dispose of\nall these things in order to satisfy the demands made upon him and the\ntemptations offered him; and, having thus parted with his goods, he is\nleft in want, and must follow where his wealth has been taken; and there\nhe tries to earn back the money which is necessary for his most urgent\nneeds at home; and so, being partly carried away by these temptations,\nhe himself, along with others, makes use of the accumulated wealth.\n\nEverywhere throughout Russia, and, I think, not only in Russia but all\nover the world, the same thing happens. The wealth of the country people\nwho produce it passes into the hands of tradespeople, landowners,\ngovernment officials, manufacturers. The men who receive this wealth\nwant to enjoy it, and to enjoy it fully they must be in town.\n\nIn the country, in the first place, it is difficult for the rich to\ngratify all their desires, owing to the inhabitants being scattered: you\ndo not find there the shops, banks, restaurants, theatres, and various\nkinds of public amusements.\n\nSecondly, another of the chief pleasures procured by wealth,--vanity,\nthe desire to astonish, to make a display before others,--cannot be\ngratified in the country for the same reason: its inhabitants being too\nscattered. There is no one in the country to appreciate luxury; there is\nno one to astonish. There you may have what you like to embellish your\ndwelling,--pictures, bronze statues, all sorts of carriages, and fine\ntoilets,--but there is nobody to look at them or to envy you. The\npeasants do not understand the value of all this, and cannot make head\nor tail of it. Thirdly, luxury in the country is even disagreeable to a\nman who has a conscience, and is an anxiety to a timid person. One feels\nuneasy or ashamed at taking a milk bath, or in feeding puppies with\nmilk, when there are children close by needing it; one feels the same in\nbuilding pavilions and gardens among a people who live in cottages\ncovered with stable litter, and who have no wood to burn.\n\nThere is no one in the village to prevent the stupid, uneducated\npeasants from spoiling our comforts.\n\nTherefore, rich people gather together in towns, and settle near those\nwho, in similar positions, have similar desires. In towns, the enjoyment\nof luxuries is carefully protected by a numerous police. The principal\ninhabitants of towns are government officials, round whom all the rich\npeople, master-workmen, and artisans have settled. There, a rich man has\nonly to think about a thing, and he can get it. It is also more\nagreeable for him to live there, because he can gratify his vanity;\nthere are people with whom he may try to compete in luxury, whom he may\nastonish or eclipse. But it is especially pleasant for a wealthy man to\nlive in town, because, where his country life was uncomfortable, and\neven somewhat incongruous because of his luxury, in town, on the\ncontrary, it would be uncomfortable for him _not_ to live splendidly, as\nhis equals in wealth do. What seemed out of place there, appears\nindispensable here.\n\nRich people collect together in towns, and, under the protection of the\nauthorities, enjoy peacefully all that has been brought there by the\nvillagers. A countryman often cannot help going to town, where a\nceaseless round of feasting is going on, where what has been procured\nfrom the peasants is being spent. He comes into the town to feed on\nthose crumbs which fall from the tables of the rich; and partly by\nobserving the careless, luxurious, and generally approved mode of living\nof these men, he begins to desire to order his own affairs in such a\nmanner that he, too, may be able to work less and avail himself more of\nthe labour of others. At last he decides to settle down in the\nneighbourhood of the wealthy, trying by every means in his power to get\nback from them what is necessary for him, and submitting to all the\nconditions which the rich enforce. These country people assist in\ngratifying all the fancies of the wealthy: they serve them in public\nbaths, in taverns, as coachmen, and as prostitutes. They manufacture\ncarriages, make toys and dresses, and little by little learn from their\nwealthy neighbours how to live like them, not by real labour, but by all\nsorts of tricks, squeezing out from others the money they have\ncollected,--and so they become depraved, and are ruined.\n\nIt is then this same population, depraved by the wealth of towns, which\nforms that city misery which I wished to relieve, but could not.\n\nIndeed, if one only reflects on the condition of these country folk\ncoming to town to earn money to buy bread or to pay taxes, and who see\neverywhere thousands of rubles squandered foolishly, and hundreds very\neasily earned while they have to earn their pence by the hardest of\nlabour, one cannot but be astonished that there are still many such\npeople at work, and that they do not all have recourse to a more easy\nway of getting money,--trading, begging, vice, cheating, and even\nrobbery.\n\nIt is only we who join in the ceaseless orgie going on in the towns who\ncan get so accustomed to our own mode of life that it seems quite\nnatural to us that one fine gentleman should occupy five large rooms\nheated with sufficient firewood to enable twenty families to warm their\nhomes and cook their food with. To drive a short distance, we employ two\nthoroughbreds and two men; we cover our inlaid floors with carpets, and\nspend five or ten thousand rubles on a ball, or even twenty-five for a\nChristmas-tree, and so on. Yet a man who needs ten rubles to buy bread\nfor his family, or from whom his last sheep has been taken to meet a tax\nof seven rubles which he cannot save by the hardest of labour, cannot\nget accustomed to all this which we imagine must seem quite natural to\nthe poor. There are even people _na\xc3\xafve_ enough to say that the poor are\nthankful to us because we feed them by living so luxuriously!\n\nBut poor people do not lose their reasoning powers because they are\npoor: they reason quite in the same manner as we do. When we have heard\nthat some one has lost a fortune at cards, or squandered ten or twenty\nthousand rubles, the first thought that comes into our minds is: "How\nstupid and bad this man must be to have parted with such a large sum\nwithout any equivalent; and how well _I_ could have employed this money\nfor some building I have long wanted to get done, or for the improvement\nof my estate," and so on.\n\nThe poor reason in the same way on seeing how foolishly we waste our\nwealth; all the more forcibly, because this money is needed, not to\nsatisfy their _whims_, but for the chief necessaries of life, of which\nthey are in want. We are greatly mistaken in thinking that the poor,\nwhile able to reason thus, still look on unconcernedly at the luxury\naround them.\n\nThey have never acknowledged, and never will, that it is right for one\nman to be always idling, and for another to be continually working. At\nfirst they are astonished and offended; then, looking closer into the\nquestion, they see that this state of things is acknowledged to be\nlegal, and they themselves try to get rid of work, and to take part in\nthe feasting. Some succeed in so doing, and acquire similar wanton\nhabits; others, little by little, approach such a condition; others\nbreak down before they reach their object, and, having lost the habit of\nworking, fill the night-houses and the haunts of vice.\n\nThe year before last we took from the village a young peasant to be our\nbutler\'s assistant. He could not agree with the footman, and was sent\naway; he entered the service of a merchant, pleased his masters, and now\nwears a watch and chain, and has smart boots.\n\nIn his place we took another peasant, a married man. He turned out a\ndrunkard, and lost money. We took a third: he began to drink, and,\nhaving drunk all he had, was for a long time in distress in a\nnight-lodging-house. Our old cook took to drinking in the town, and fell\nill. Last year a footman who used formerly to have fits of drunkenness,\nbut who, while living in the village kept himself from it for five\nyears, came to live in Moscow without his wife (who used to keep him in\norder), began again to drink, and ruined himself. A young boy of our\nvillage is living as butler\'s assistant at my brother\'s. His\ngrandfather, a blind old man, came to me while I was living in the\ncountry, and asked me to persuade this grandson to send ten rubles for\ntaxes, because, unless this were done, the cow would have to be sold.\n\n"He keeps telling me that he has to dress himself respectably," said the\nold man. "He got himself long boots, and that ought to be enough; but I\nactually believe he would like to buy a watch!"\n\nIn these words the grandfather expressed what he felt was the utmost\ndegree of extravagance. And this was really so; for the old man could\nnot afford a drop of oil for his food during the whole of Lent, and his\nwood was spoilt because he had not the ruble and a quarter necessary for\ncutting it up. But the old man\'s irony turned out to be reality. His\ngrandson came to me dressed in a fine black overcoat, and in long boots\nfor which he had paid eight rubles. Recently he had got ten rubles from\nmy brother, and spent them on his boots. And my children, who have known\nthe boy from his infancy, told me that he really considers it necessary\nto buy a watch. He is a very good boy, but he considers that he will be\nlaughed at for not having one.\n\nThis year a housemaid, eighteen years of age, formed an intimacy with\nthe coachman, and was sent away. Our old nurse, to whom I related the\ncase, reminded me of a girl whom I had quite forgotten. Ten years ago,\nduring a short stay in Moscow, she formed an intimacy with a footman.\nShe also was sent away, and drifted at last into a house of ill-fame,\nand died in a hospital before she was twenty years of age.\n\nWe have only to look around us to become alarmed by the infection which\n(to say nothing of manufactories and workshops existing only to gratify\nour luxury) we directly, by our luxurious town life, spread among those\nvery people whom we desire afterwards to help.\n\nThus, having got at the root of that town misery which I was not able to\nalleviate, I saw that its first cause is in our taking from the\nvillagers their necessaries and carrying them to town. The second cause\nis, that in those towns we avail ourselves of what we have gathered from\nthe country, and, by our foolish luxury, tempt and deprave the peasants\nwho follow us there in order to get back something of what we have taken\nfrom them in the country.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nFrom another point of view than the one stated, I also came to the same\nconclusion. Recollecting my connection with the town-poor during this\nperiod, I saw that one cause which prevented me from helping them was\ntheir insincerity and falseness. They all considered me, not as an\nindividual but merely as a means to an end. I felt I could not become\nintimate with them; I thought I did not perhaps understand how to do so;\nbut without truthfulness, no help was possible. How can one help a man\nwho does not tell all his circumstances? Formerly I accused the poor of\nthis (it is so natural to accuse others), but one word spoken by a\nremarkable man, Sutaief, who was then on a visit at my house, cleared up\nthe difficulty, and showed me wherein lay the cause of my failure.\n\nI remember that even then what he said made a deep impression on me; but\nI did not understand its full meaning until afterwards. It happened that\nwhile in the full ardour of my self-deception I was at my sister\'s\nhouse, Sutaief being also there; and my sister was questioning me about\nmy work.\n\nI was relating it to her; and, as is always the case when one does not\nfully believe in one\'s own enterprises, I related with great enthusiasm,\nardour, and at full length, all I had been doing, and all the possible\nresults. I was telling her how we should keep our eyes open to what went\non in Moscow; how we should take care of orphans and old people; how we\nshould afford means for impoverished villagers to return to their homes,\nand pave the way to reform the depraved. I explained, that, if we\nsucceeded in our undertaking, there would not be in Moscow a single poor\nman who could not find help.\n\nMy sister sympathized with me; and while speaking, I kept looking now\nand then at Sutaief; knowing his Christian life, and the importance\nattached by him to works of charity, I expected sympathy from him, and I\nspoke so that he might understand me; for, though I was addressing my\nsister, yet my conversation was really more directed to him.\n\nHe sat immovable, dressed in his black-tanned-sheepskin coat, which he,\nlike other peasants, wore in-doors as well as out. It seemed that he was\nnot listening to us, but was thinking about something else. His small\neyes gave no responding gleam, but seemed to be turned inwards. Having\nspoken out to my own satisfaction, I turned to him and asked him what he\nthought about it.\n\n"The whole thing is worthless," he replied.\n\n"Why?"\n\n"The plan is an empty one, and no good will come of it," he repeated\nwith conviction.\n\n"But why will nothing come of it? Why is it a useless business, if we\nhelp thousands, or even hundreds, of unhappy ones? Is it a bad thing,\naccording to the gospel, to clothe the naked, or to feed the hungry?"\n\n"I know, I know; but what you are doing is not that. Is it possible to\nhelp thus? You are walking in the street; somebody asks you for a few\nkopeks; you give them to him. Is that charity? Do him some spiritual\ngood; teach him. What you give him merely says, \'Leave me alone.\'"\n\n"No; but that is not what we were speaking of: we wish to become\nacquainted with the wants, and then to help by money and by deeds. We\nwill try to find for the poor people some work to do."\n\n"That would be no way of helping them."\n\n"How then? must they be left to die of starvation and cold?"\n\n"Why left to die? How many are there of them?"\n\n"How many?" said I, thinking that he took the matter so lightly from not\nknowing the great number of these men; "you are not aware, I dare say,\nthat there are in Moscow about twenty thousand cold and hungry. And\nthen, think of those in St. Petersburg and other towns!"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n"Twenty thousand! And how many households are there in Russia alone?\nWould they amount to a million?"\n\n"Well; but what of that?"\n\n"What of that?" said he, with animation, and his eyes sparkled. "Let us\nunite them with ourselves; I am not rich myself, but will at once take\ntwo of them. Here is a fellow you settled in your kitchen; I asked him\nto go with me, but he refused. If there were ten times as many, we\nshould take them all into our families. You one, I another. We shall\nwork together; he will see how I work; he will learn how to live, and we\nshall eat out of one bowl, at one table; and they will hear a good word\nfrom me, and from you also. That is charity; but all this plan of yours\nis no good."\n\nThese plain words made an impression upon me. I could not help\nrecognizing that they were true. But it seemed to me then, that,\nnotwithstanding the justice of what he said, my proposed plan might\nperhaps be useful also.\n\nBut the longer I was occupied with this affair; and the closer my\nintercourse with the poor, the oftener I recollected these words and the\ngreater meaning I found in them.\n\nI, indeed, go in an expensive fur coat, or drive in my own carriage to a\nman who is in want of boots: he sees my house which costs two hundred\nrubles a month, or he notices that I give away, without thinking, five\nrubles, only because of a caprice; he is then aware that if I give away\nrubles in such a manner, it is because I have accumulated so many that I\nhave a lot to spare which I am not only never in the habit of giving to\nany one, but which I have taken away from others without compunction.\nWhat can he see in me but one of those persons who have become possessed\nof something which should belong to him? And what other feelings can he\nhave towards me than the desire to get back as many as possible of these\nrubles which were taken by me from him and from others?\n\nI should like to become intimate with him, and complain that he is not\nsincere. But I am afraid to sit down upon his bed for fear of lice or\nsome infectious disease; I am also afraid to let him come into my room;\nand when he comes to me half-dressed, he has to wait, if fortunate, in\nthe entrance-hall, but oftener in the cold porch. And then I say that it\nis all his fault that I cannot become intimate with him, and that he is\nnot sincere.\n\nLet the most hard-hearted man sit down to dine upon five courses among\nhungry people who have little or nothing to eat except dry bread, and no\none could have the heart to eat while these hungry people are around him\nlicking their lips.\n\nTherefore, before one can eat well when living among half-starved men,\nthe first thing necessary is to hide ourselves from them, and to eat so\nthat they may not see us. This is the very thing we do in the first\nplace.\n\nI looked into our own mode of life without prejudice, and became aware\nthat it was not by chance that closer intercourse with the poor is\ndifficult for us, but that we ourselves are intentionally ordering our\nlives in such a way as to make this intercourse impossible. And not only\nthis; but, on looking at our lives, or at the lives of rich people from\nwithout, I saw that all that is considered as the _happiness_ of these\nlives consists in being separated as much as possible from the poor, or\nis in some way or other connected with this desired separation.\n\nIn fact, the entire aim of our lives, beginning with food, dress,\ndwelling and cleanliness, and ending with our education, consists in\nplacing a gulf between us and them. And we spend nine-tenths of our\nwealth to erect impassable barriers in order to establish this\ndistinction and separation.\n\nThe first thing a man who has grown rich does is to leave off eating\nwith others out of one bowl. He arranges plates for himself and his\nfamily, and separates himself from the kitchen and the servants. He\nfeeds his servants well so that their mouths may not water, and he dines\nalone. But eating alone is dull. He invents whatever he can to improve\nhis food, embellish his table; and the very manner of taking food, as at\ndinner-parties, becomes a matter of vanity and pride. His manner of\neating his food is a means of separating himself from other people. For\na rich man it is out of the question to invite a poor person to his\ntable. One must know how to hand a lady to table, how to bow, how to\nsit, to eat, to use a finger-bowl, all of which the rich alone know how\nto do.\n\nThe same holds good with dress.\n\nIf a rich man wore ordinary dress,--a jacket, a fur coat, felt shoes,\nleather boots, an undercoat, trousers, a shirt,--he would require very\nlittle to cover his body and protect it from cold; and, having two fur\ncoats, he could not help giving one away to somebody who had none. But\nthe wealthy man begins with wearing clothes which consist of many\nseparate parts, of use only on particular occasions, and therefore of no\nuse to a poor man. The man of fashion must have evening dress-coats,\nwaistcoats, frock-coats, patent-leather shoes; his wife must have\nbodices, and dresses which, according to fashion, are made of many\nparts, high-heeled shoes, hunting and travelling jackets, and so on. All\nthese articles can be useful only to people in a condition far removed\nfrom poverty.\n\nAnd thus dressing also becomes a means of isolation. Fashions make their\nappearance, and are among the chief things which separate the rich man\nfrom the poor one.\n\nThe same thing shows itself more plainly still in our dwellings. In\norder that one person may occupy ten rooms we must manage so that he may\nnot be seen by the people who are living by tens in one room.\n\nThe richer a man is, the more difficult it is to get at him; the more\nfootmen there are between him and people not rich, the more impossible\nit is for him to receive a poor guest, to let him walk on his carpets\nand sit on his satin-covered chairs.\n\nThe same thing happens in travelling. A peasant who drives in a cart or\non a carrier\'s sledge must be very hard-hearted if he refuses to give a\npedestrian a lift; he has enough room, and can do it. But the richer the\ncarriage is, the more impossible it is to put any one in it besides the\nowner. Some of the most elegant carriages are so narrow as to be termed\n"_egotists_."\n\nThe same thing applies to all the modes of living expressed by the word\n"cleanliness." Cleanliness! Who does not know human beings, especially\nwomen, who make a great virtue of cleanliness? Who does not know the\nvarious phrases of this cleanliness, which have no limit whatever when\nit is procured by the labour of others? Who among self-made men has not\nexperienced in his own person the pains with which he carefully\naccustomed himself to this cleanliness, which illustrates the saying,\n"White hands are fond of another\'s labour"?\n\nTo-day cleanliness consists in changing one\'s shirt daily; to-morrow it\nwill be changed twice a day. At first, one has to wash one\'s hands and\nneck every day, then one will have to wash one\'s feet every day, and\nafterwards it will be the whole body, and in peculiar methods. A clean\ntable-cloth serves for two days, then it is changed every day, and\nafterwards two table-cloths a day are used. To-day the footman is\nrequired to have clean hands; to-morrow he must wear gloves, and clean\ngloves, and he must hand the letters on a clean tray.\n\nThere are no limits to this cleanliness, which is of no other use to\nanyone except to separate us, and to make our intercourse with others\nimpossible while the cleanliness is obtained through the labour of\nothers.\n\nNot only so, but when I had deeply reflected upon this, I came to the\nconclusion that what we term education is a similar thing. Language\ncannot deceive: it gives the right name to everything. The common people\ncall education fashionable dress, smart conversation, white hands, and a\ncertain degree of cleanliness. Of such a man they say, when\ndistinguishing him from others, that he is an educated man.\n\nIn a little higher circle men denote by education the same things, but\nadd playing on the piano, the knowledge of French, good Russian\nspelling, and still greater cleanliness.\n\nIn the still higher circle education consists of all this, with the\naddition of English, and a diploma from a high educational\nestablishment, and a still greater degree of cleanliness. But in all\nthese shades, education is in substance quite the same.\n\nIt consists in those forms and various kinds of information which\nseparate a man from his fellow-creatures. Its object is the same as that\nof cleanliness: to separate us from the crowd, in order that they,\nhungry and cold, may not see how we feast. But it is impossible to hide\nourselves, and our efforts are seen through.\n\nThus I became aware that the reason why it was impossible for us rich\nmen to help the town poor was nothing more or less than the\nimpossibility of our having closer intercourse with them, and that this\nbarrier we ourselves create by our whole life and by all the uses we\nmake of our wealth. I became persuaded that between us rich men and the\npoor there stood, erected by ourselves, a barrier of cleanliness and\neducation which arose out of our wealth; and that, in order to be able\nto help them, we have first to break down this barrier and to render\npossible the realization of the means suggested by Sutaief: to take the\npoor into our respective homes. And so, as I have already said at the\nbeginning of this chapter, I came to the same conclusion from a\ndifferent point of view from that to which the train of thought about\ntown misery had led me; viz., the cause of it all lay in our wealth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nI began again to analyze the matter from a third and purely personal\npoint of view. Among the phenomena which particularly impressed me\nduring my benevolent activity, there was one,--a very strange\none,--which I could not understand for a long time.\n\nWhenever I happened, in the street or at home, to give a poor person a\ntrifling sum without entering into conversation with him, I saw on his\nface, or imagined I saw, an expression of pleasure and gratitude, and I\nmyself experienced an agreeable feeling at this form of charity. I saw\nthat I had done what was expected of me. But when I stopped and began to\nquestion the man about his past and present life, entering more or less\ninto particulars, I felt it was impossible to give him 3 or 20 kopeks;\nand I always began to finger the money in my purse, and, not knowing how\nmuch to give, I always gave more under these circumstances; but,\nnevertheless, I saw that the poor man went away from me dissatisfied.\nWhen I entered into still closer intercourse with him, my doubts as to\nhow much I should give increased; and, no matter what I gave, the\nrecipient seemed more and more gloomy and dissatisfied.\n\nAs a general rule, it always happens that if, upon nearer acquaintance\nwith the poor man I gave him three rubles or even more, I always saw\ngloominess, dissatisfaction, even anger depicted on his face; and\nsometimes, after having received from me ten rubles, he has left me\nwithout even thanking me, as if I had offended him.\n\nIn such cases I was always uncomfortable and ashamed, and felt myself\nguilty. When I watched the poor person during weeks, months, or years,\nhelped him, expressed my views, and became intimate with him, then our\nintercourse became a torment, and I saw that the man despised me. And I\nfelt that he was right in doing so. When in the street a beggar asks me,\nalong with other passers-by, for three kopeks, and I give it him, then,\nin his estimation, I am a kind and good man who gives "one of the\nthreads which go to make the shirt of a naked one": he expects nothing\nmore than a thread, and, if I give it, he sincerely blesses me.\n\nBut if I stop and speak to him as man to man, show him that I wish to be\nmore than a mere passer-by, and, if, as it often happened, he shed tears\nin relating his misfortune, then he sees in me not merely a chance\nhelper, but that which I wish him to see,--a kind man. If I am a kind\nman, my kindness cannot stop at twenty kopeks, or at ten rubles, or ten\nthousand. One cannot be a slightly kind man. Let us suppose that I give\nhim much; that I put him straight, dress him, and set him on his legs so\nthat he can help himself; but, from some reason or other, either from an\naccident or his own weakness, he again loses the great-coat and clothing\nand money I gave him, he is again hungry and cold, and he again comes to\nme, why should I refuse him assistance? For if the cause of my\nbenevolent activity was merely the attainment of some definite, material\nobject, such as giving him so many rubles or a certain great-coat, then,\nhaving given them I could be easy in my mind; but the cause of my\nactivity was not this: the cause of it was my desire to be a kind\nman--i.e., to see myself in everybody else. Everyone understands\nkindness in this way, and not otherwise.\n\nTherefore if such a man should spend in drink all you gave him twenty\ntimes over, and be again hungry and cold, then, if you are a benevolent\nman, you cannot help giving him more money, you can never leave off\ndoing so while you have more than he has; but if you draw back, you show\nthat all you did before was done not because you are benevolent, but\nbecause you wish to appear so to others and to him. And it was because I\nhad to back out of such cases, and to cease to give, and thus to disown\nthe good, that I felt a painful sense of shame.\n\nWhat was this feeling, then?\n\nI had experienced it in Liapin\'s house and in the country, and when I\nhappened to give money or anything else to the poor, and in my\nadventures among the town people. One case which occurred lately\nreminded me of it forcibly, and led me to discover its cause.\n\nIt happened in the country. I wanted twenty kopeks to give to a pilgrim.\nI sent my son to borrow it from somebody. He brought it to the man, and\ntold me that he had borrowed it from the cook. Some days after, other\npilgrims came, and I was again in need of twenty kopeks. I had a ruble.\nI recollected what I owed the cook, went into the kitchen, hoping that\nhe would have some more coppers. I said,--\n\n"I owe you twenty kopeks: here is a ruble."\n\nI had not yet done speaking when the cook called to his wife from the\nadjoining room: "Parasha, take it," he said.\n\nThinking she had understood what I wanted, I gave her the ruble. I must\ntell you that the cook had been living at our house about a week, and I\nhad seen his wife, but had never spoken to her. I merely wished to tell\nher to give me the change, when she briskly bowed herself over my hand\nand was about to kiss it, evidently thinking I was giving her the ruble.\nI stammered out something and left the kitchen. I felt ashamed,\npainfully ashamed, as I had not felt for a long time. I actually\ntrembled, and felt that I was making a wry face; and, groaning with\nshame, I ran away from the kitchen.\n\nThis feeling, which I fancied I had not deserved, and which came over me\nquite unexpectedly, impressed me particularly, because it was so long\nsince I had felt anything like it and also because I fancied that I, an\nold man, had been living in a way I had no reason to be ashamed of.\n\nThis surprised me greatly. I related the case to my family, to my\nacquaintances, and they all agreed that they also would have felt the\nsame. And I began to reflect: Why is it that I felt so?\n\nThe answer came from a case which had formerly occurred to me in Moscow.\nI reflected upon this case, and I understood the shame which I felt\nconcerning the incident with the cook\'s wife, and all the sensations of\nshame I had experienced during my charitable activity in Moscow, and\nwhich I always feel when I happen to give anything beyond trifling alms\nto beggars and pilgrims, which I am accustomed to give, and which I\nconsider not as charity, but as politeness and good breeding. If a man\nasks you for a light, you must light a match if you have it. If a man\nbegs for three or twenty kopeks, or a few rubles, you must give if you\nhave them. It is a question of politeness, not of charity.\n\nThe following is the case I referred to. I have already spoken about the\ntwo peasants with whom I sawed wood three years ago. One Saturday\nevening, in the twilight, I was walking with them back to town. They\nwere going to their master to receive their wages. On crossing the\nDragomilor bridge we met an old man. He begged, and I gave him twenty\nkopeks. I gave, thinking what a good impression my alms would make upon\nSimon, with whom I had been speaking on religious questions.\n\nSimon, the peasant from Vlad\xc3\xadmir, who had a wife and two children in\nMoscow, also stopped, turned up the lappet of his kaftan, and took out\nhis purse; and, after having looked over his money, he picked out a\nthree-kopek piece, gave it to the old man, and asked for two kopeks\nback. The old man showed him in his hand two three-kopek pieces and a\nsingle kopek. Simon looked at it, was about to take one kopek, but,\nchanging his mind, took off his cap, crossed himself, and went away,\nleaving the old man the three-kopek piece.\n\nI was acquainted with all Simon\'s pecuniary circumstances. He had\nneither house nor other property. When he gave the old man the three\nkopeks, he possessed six rubles and fifty kopeks, which he had been\nsaving up, and this was all the capital he had.\n\nMy property amounted to about six hundred thousand rubles. I had a wife\nand children, so also had Simon. He was younger than I, and had not so\nmany children; but his children were young, and two of mine were\ngrown-up men, old enough to work, so that our circumstances,\nindependently of our property, were alike, though even in this respect I\nwas better off than he.\n\nHe gave three kopeks, I gave twenty. What was, then, the difference in\nour gifts? What should I have given in order to do as he had done? He\nhad six hundred kopeks; out of these he gave one, and then another two.\nI had six hundred thousand rubles. In order to give as much as Simon\ngave, I ought to have given three thousand rubles, and asked the man to\ngive me back two thousand; and, in the event of his not having change,\nto leave him these two also, cross myself, and go away calmly,\nconversing about how people live in the manufactories, and what is the\nprice of liver in the Smolensk market.\n\nI thought about it at the time, but it was long before I was able to\ndraw from this case the conclusion which inevitably follows from it.\nThis conclusion appears to be so uncommon and strange, notwithstanding\nits mathematical accuracy, that it requires time to get accustomed to\nit. One is inclined to think there is some mistake, but there is none.\nIt is only the terrible darkness of prejudice in which we live.\n\nThis conclusion, when I arrived at it and recognized its inevitableness,\nexplained to me the nature of my feelings of shame in the presence of\nthe cook\'s wife, and before all the poor to whom I gave and still give\nmoney. Indeed, what is that money which I give to the poor, and which\nthe cook\'s wife thought I was giving her? In the majority of cases it\nforms such a minute part of my income that it cannot be expressed in a\nfraction comprehensible to Simon or to a cook\'s wife,--it is in most\ncases a millionth part or thereabout. I give so little that my gift is\nnot, and cannot be, a sacrifice to me: it is only a something with which\nI amuse myself when and how it pleases me. And this was indeed how my\ncook\'s wife had understood me. If I gave a stranger in the street a\nruble or twenty kopeks, why should I not give her also a ruble? To her,\nsuch a distribution of money is the same thing as a gentleman throwing\ngingerbread nuts into a crowd. It is the amusement of people who possess\nmuch "fool\'s money." I was ashamed, because the mistake of the cook\'s\nwife showed me plainly what ideas she and all poor people must have of\nme. "He is throwing away \'fool\'s money\'"; that is, money not earned by\nhim.\n\nAnd, indeed, what is my money, and how did I come by it? One part of it\nI collected in the shape of rent for my land, which I had inherited from\nmy father. The peasant sold his last sheep or cow in order to pay it.\n\nAnother part of my money I received from the books I had written. If my\nbooks are harmful, and yet sell, they can only do so by some seductive\nattraction, and the money which I receive for them is badly earned\nmoney; but if my books are useful, the thing is still worse. I do not\ngive them to people, but say, "Give me so many rubles, and I will sell\nthem to you."\n\nAs in the former case a peasant sells his last sheep, here a poor\nstudent or a teacher does it: each poor person who buys denies himself\nsome necessary thing in order to give me this money. And now that I have\ngathered much of such money what am I to do with it? I take it to town,\ngive it to the poor only when they satisfy all my fancies and come to\ntown to clean pavements, lamps, or boots, to work for me in the\nfactories, and so on. And with this money I draw from them all I can. I\ntry to give them as little as I can and take from them as much as\npossible.\n\nNow, quite unexpectedly, I begin to share all this said money with these\nsame poor persons for nothing; but not with everyone, only as fancy\nprompts me. And why should not every poor man expect that his turn might\ncome to-day to be one of those with whom I amuse myself by giving them\nmy "fool\'s money"?\n\nSo everyone regards me as the cook\'s wife did. And I had gone about with\nthe notion that this was charity,--this taking away thousands with one\nhand, and with the other throwing kopeks to those I select!\n\nNo wonder I was ashamed. But before I can begin to do good I must leave\noff the evil and put myself in a position in which I should cease to\ncause it. But all my course of life is evil. If I were to give away a\nhundred thousand, I should not yet have put myself in a condition in\nwhich I could do good, because I have still five hundred thousand left.\n\nIt is only when I possess nothing at all that I shall be able to do a\nlittle good; such as, for instance, the poor prostitute did who nursed a\nsick woman and her child for three days. Yet this seemed to me to be but\nso little! And _I_ ventured to think of doing good! One thing only was\ntrue, which I at first felt on seeing the hungry and cold people outside\nLiapin\'s house,--that _I_ was guilty of that; and that to live as I did\nwas impossible, utterly impossible. What shall we do then? If somebody\nstill needs an answer to this question, I will, by God\'s permission,\ngive one, in detail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nIt was hard for me to own this; but when I had got so far I was\nterrified at the delusion in which I had been living. I had been head\nover ears in the mud myself, and yet I had been trying to drag others\nout of it.\n\nWhat is it that I really want? I want to do good; I want to contrive so\nthat no human beings shall be hungry and cold, and that men may live as\nit is proper for them to live. I desire this; and I see that in\nconsequence of all sorts of violence, extortions, and various expedients\nin which I too take part, the working people are deprived of the\nnecessary things, and the non-working community, to whom I also belong,\nmonopolize the labour of others. I see that this use of other people\'s\nlabour is distributed thus: That the more cunning and complicated the\ndevices employed by the man himself (or by those from whom he has\ninherited his property), the more largely he employs the labours of\nother people, and the less he works himself.\n\nFirst come the millionaires; then the wealthy bankers, merchants,\nland-owners, government officials; then the smaller bankers, merchants,\ngovernment officials and land-owners, to whom I belong too; then\nshopmen, publicans, usurers, police sergeants and inspectors, teachers,\nsacristans, clerks; then, again, house-porters, footmen, coachmen,\nwater-carters, cabmen, pedlers; and then, last of all, the workmen,\nfactory hands and peasants, the number of this class in proportion to\nthe former being as ten to one.\n\nI see that the lives of nine-tenths of the working people essentially\nrequire exertion and labour, like every other natural mode of living;\nbut that, in consequence of the devices by which the necessaries of life\nare taken away from these people, their lives become every year more\ndifficult, and more beset with privations; and our lives, the lives of\nthe non-labouring community, owing to the co-operation of sciences and\narts which have this very end in view, become every year more sumptuous,\nmore attractive and secure.\n\nI see that in our days the life of a labouring man, and especially the\nlives of the old people, women, and children of the working-classes, are\nquite worn away by increased labour out of proportion to their\nnourishment, and that even the very first necessaries of life are not\nsecured for them. I see that side by side with these the lives of the\nnon-labouring class, to which I belong, are each year more and more\nfilled up with superfluities and luxury, and are becoming continually\nmore secure. The lives of the wealthy have reached that degree of\nsecurity of which in olden times men only dreamed in fairy-tales, to the\ncondition of the owner of the magic purse with the "inexhaustible\nruble"; to a state where a man not only is entirely free from the law of\nlabour for the sustenance of his life, but has the possibility of\nenjoying all the goods of this life without working, and of bequeathing\nto his children, or to anyone he chooses, this purse with the\n"inexhaustible ruble."\n\nI see that the results of the labour of men pass over more than ever\nfrom the masses of labourers to those of the non-labourers; that the\npyramid of the social structure is, as it were, being rebuilt, so that\nthe stones of the foundation pass to the top, and the rapidity of this\npassage increases in a kind of geometric progression.\n\nI see that there is going on something like what would take place in an\nant-hill if the society of ants should lose the sense of the general\nlaw, and some of them were to take the results of labour out of the\nfoundations and carry them to the top of the hill, making the foundation\nnarrower and narrower and thus enlarging the top, and so by that means\ncause their fellows to pass also from the foundation to the top.\n\nI see that instead of the ideal of a laborious life, men have created\nthe ideal of the purse with the "inexhaustible ruble." The rich, I among\ntheir number, arrange this ruble for themselves by various devices; and\nin order to enjoy it we locate ourselves in towns, in a place where\nnothing is produced but everything is swallowed up.\n\nThe poor labouring man, swindled so that the rich may have this magic\nruble, follows them to town; and there he also has recourse to tricks,\neither arranging matters so that he may work little and enjoy much (thus\nmaking the condition of other workingmen still more heavy), or, not\nhaving attained this state, he ruins himself and drifts into the\ncontinually and rapidly increasing number of cold and hungry tenants of\ndoss-houses.\n\nI belong to the class of those men who by means of these various devices\ntake away from the working people the necessaries of life, and who thus,\nas it were, create for themselves the inexhaustible fairy ruble which\ntempts in turn these unfortunate ones.\n\nI wish to help men; and therefore it is clear that first of all I ought\non the one side to cease to plunder them as I am doing now, and on the\nother to leave off tempting them. But by means of most complicated,\ncunning, and wicked contrivances practised for centuries, I have made\nmyself the owner of this ruble; that is, have got into a condition\nwhere, never doing anything myself, I can compel hundreds and thousands\nof people to work for me, and I am really availing myself of this\nprivileged monopoly notwithstanding that all the time I imagine I pity\nthese men and wish to help them.\n\nI sit on the neck of a man, and having quite crushed him down compel him\nto carry me and will not alight from off his shoulders, though I assure\nmyself and others that I am very sorry for him and wish to ease his\ncondition by every means in my power--except by getting off his back.\n\nSurely this is plain. If I wish to help the poor, that is, to make the\npoor cease to be poor, I ought not to create the poor. Yet I give money\ncapriciously to those who have gone astray, and take away tens of rubles\nfrom men who have not yet become bad, thereby making them poor and at\nthe same time depraved.\n\nThis is very clear; but it was exceedingly difficult for me to\nunderstand at first, without some modification or reserve which would\njustify my position. However as soon as I come to see my own error, all\nthat formerly appeared strange, complicated, clouded, and inexplicable,\nbecame quite simple and intelligible; but the important matter was, that\nthe direction of my life indicated by this explanation, became at once,\nsimple, clear, and agreeable, instead of being, as formerly, intricate,\nincomprehensible, and painful.\n\nWho am I, I thought, that desire to better men\'s condition? I say I\ndesire this, and yet I do not get up till noon, after having played\ncards in a brilliantly lighted saloon all night,--I, an enfeebled and\neffeminate man requiring the help and services of hundreds of people, I\ncome to help them! to help these men who rise at five, sleep on boards,\nfeed on cabbage and bread, understand how to plough, to reap, to put a\nhandle to an axe, to hew, to harness horses, to sew; men who, by their\nstrength and perseverance and skill and self-restraint are a hundred\ntimes stronger than I who come to help them.\n\nWhat _could_ I experience in my intercourse with these people but shame?\nThe weakest of them, a drunkard, an inhabitant of Rzhanoff\'s house, he\nwhom they call "the sluggard," is a hundred times more laborious than I;\nhis balance, so to say,--in other words the relation between what he\ntakes from men and what he gives to them,--is a thousand times more to\nhis credit than mine when I count what I receive from others and what I\ngive them in return. And such men I go to assist!\n\nI go to help the poor. But of the two who is the poorer? No one is\npoorer than myself. I am a weak, good-for-nothing parasite who can only\nexist under very peculiar conditions, can live only when thousands of\npeople labour to support this life which is not useful to anyone. And I,\nthis very caterpillar which eats up the leaves of a tree, I wish to help\nthe growth and the health of the tree and to cure it!\n\nAll my life is spent thus: I eat, talk, and listen; then I eat, write,\nor read, which are only talking and listening in another form; I eat\nagain, and play; then eat, talk, and listen, and finally eat and go to\nsleep: and thus every day is spent; I neither do anything else nor\nunderstand how to do it. And in order that I may enjoy this life it is\nnecessary that from morning till night house-porters, dvorniks, cooks\n(male and female), footmen, coachmen, and laundresses, should work; to\nsay nothing of the manual labour necessary so that the coachmen, cooks,\nfootmen, and others may have the instruments and articles by which and\nupon which they work for me,--axes, casks, brushes, dishes, furniture,\nglasses, shoe-black, kerosene, hay, wood, and food. All these men and\nwomen work hard all the day and every day in order that I may talk, eat,\nand sleep. And I, this useless man, imagined I was able to benefit the\nvery people who were serving me! That I did not benefit any one and that\nI was ashamed of myself, is not so strange as the fact that such a\nfoolish idea ever came into my mind.\n\nThe woman who nursed the sick old man helped him; the peasant\'s wife,\nwho cut a slice of her bread earned by herself, from the very sowing of\nthe corn that made it, helped the hungry one; Simon, who gave three\nkopeks which he had earned, assisted the pilgrim, because these three\nkopeks really represented his labour; but I had served nobody, worked\nfor no one, and knew very well that my money did not represent my\nlabour.\n\nAnd so I felt that in money, or in money\'s worth, and in the possession\nof it, there was something wrong and evil; that the money itself, and\nthe fact of my having it, was one of the chief causes of those evils\nwhich I had seen before me; and I asked myself, What is money?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nMoney! Then what is money?\n\nIt is answered, money represents labour. I meet educated people who even\nassert that money represents labour performed by those who possess it. I\nconfess that I myself formerly shared this opinion, although I did not\nvery clearly understand it. But now it became necessary for me to learn\nthoroughly what money is.\n\nIn order to do so, I addressed myself to science. Science says that\nmoney in itself is neither unjust nor pernicious; that money is the\nnatural result of the conditions of social life, and is indispensable,\nfirst, for convenience of exchange; secondly, as a measure of value;\nthirdly, for saving; and fourthly, for payments.\n\nThe fact that when I have in my pocket three rubles to spare, which I am\nnot in need of, I have only to whistle and in every civilized town I can\nobtain a hundred people ready for these three rubles to do the worst,\nmost disgusting, and humiliating act I require, it is said, comes not\nfrom money, but from the very complicated conditions of the economical\nlife of nations!\n\nThe dominion of one man over others does not come from money, but from\nthe circumstance that a workingman does not receive the full value of\nhis labour; and the fact that he does not get the full value of his\nlabour depends upon the nature of capital, rent, and wages, and upon\ncomplicated connections between the distribution and consumption of\nwealth.\n\nIn plain language, it means that people who have money may twist round\ntheir finger those who have none. But science says that this is an\nillusion; that in every kind of production three factors take\npart,--land, savings of labour (capital), and labour, and that the\ndominion of the few over the many proceeds from the various connections\nbetween these factors of production, because the two first factors, land\nand capital, are not in the hands of working people; and from this fact\nand from the various combinations which result from it this domination\nproceeds.\n\nWhence comes the great power of money, which strikes us all with a sense\nof its injustice and cruelty? Why is one man, by the means of money, to\nhave dominion over others? Science says, "It comes from the division of\nthe factors of production, and from the consequent combinations which\noppress the worker."\n\nThis answer has always appeared to me to be strange, not only because it\nleaves one part of the question unnoticed (namely, the significance of\nmoney), but also because of the division of the factors of production,\nwhich to an unprejudiced man will always appear artificial and out of\ntouch with reality. Science asserts that in every production three\nagents come into operation,--land, capital and labour; and along with\nthis division it is understood that property (or its value in money) is\nnaturally divided among those who possess one of these agents; thus,\nrent (the value of the ground) belongs to the land-owner; interest\nbelongs to the capitalist; and wages to the worker.\n\nIs this really so?\n\nFirst, is it true that in every production only three agencies operate?\nNow, while I am writing proceeds the production of hay around me. Of\nwhat is this production composed? I am told of the land which produces\nthe grass; of capital (scythes, rakes, pitch-forks, carts which are\nnecessary for the housing of the hay); and of labour. But I see that\nthis is not true. Besides the land, there is the sun and rain; and, in\naddition, social order, which has been keeping these meadows from any\ndamage which might be caused by letting stray cattle graze upon them,\nthe skill of workmen, their knowledge of language, and many other\nagencies of production,--which, for some unknown reason, are not taken\ninto consideration by political economy.\n\nThe power of the sun is as necessary as the land, even more. I may\nmention the instances when men (in a town, for example), assume the\nright to keep out the sun from others by means of walls or trees. Why,\nthen, is the sun not included among the factors of production?\n\nRain is another means as necessary as the ground itself. The air too. I\ncan imagine men without water and pure air because other men had assumed\nto themselves the right to monopolise these essential necessaries of\nall. Public security is likewise a necessary element. Food and dress for\nworkmen are similar factors in production; this is even recognized by\nsome economists. Education, the knowledge of language which creates the\npossibility to apply work, is likewise an agent. I could fill a volume\nby enumerating such combinations, not mentioned by science.\n\nWhy, then, are three only to be chosen, and laid as a foundation for the\nscience of political economy? Sunshine and water equally with the earth\nare factors in production, so with the food and clothes of the workers,\nand the transmission of knowledge. All may be taken as distinct factors\nin production. Simply because the right of men to enjoy the rays of the\nsun, rain, food, language, and audience, are challenged only on rare\noccasions; but the use of land and of the instruments of labour are\nconstantly challenged in society.\n\nThis is the true foundation; and the division of the factors of\nproduction into three, is quite arbitrary, and is not involved in the\nnature of things. But it may perhaps be urged that this division is so\nsuitable to man, that wherever economic relationships are formed these\nthree factors appear at once and alone.\n\nLet us see whether this is really so.\n\nFirst of all, I look at what is around me,--at Russian colonists, of\nwhom millions have for ages existed. They come to a land, settle\nthemselves on it, and begin to work; and it does not enter the mind of\nany of them that a man who does not use the land can have any claim to\nit,--and the land does not assert any rights of its own. On the\ncontrary, the colonists conscientiously recognize the communism of the\nland and the right of every one of them to plough and to mow wherever he\nlikes.\n\nFor cultivation, for gardening, for building houses, the colonists\nobtain various implements of labour: nor does it enter the mind of any\nof them that these instruments of labour may be allowed to bring profit\nin themselves, and the capital does not assert any rights of its own. On\nthe contrary, the colonists consciously recognize among themselves that\nall interest for tools, or borrowed corn or capital, is unjust.\n\nThey work upon a free land, labour with their own tools, or with those\nborrowed without interest, each for himself, or all together, for common\nbusiness; and in such a community, it is impossible to prove either the\nexistence of rent, interest accruing from capital, or remuneration for\nlabour.\n\nIn referring to such a community I am not indulging my fancy but\ndescribing what has always taken place, not only among Russian\ncolonists, but everywhere, as long as human nature is not sinned\nagainst.\n\nI am describing what appears to everyone to be natural and rational. Men\nsettle on land, and each member undertakes the business which suits him,\nand, having procured the necessary tools, does his own work.\n\nIf these men find it more convenient to work together, they form a\nworkmen\'s association. But neither in separate households, nor in\nassociations, will separate agents of production appear till men\nartificially and forcibly divide them. There will be simply labour and\nthe necessary conditions of labour,--the sun which warms all, the air\nwhich they breathe, water which they drink, land on which they labour,\nclothes on the body, food in the stomach, stakes, shovels, ploughs,\nmachines with which they work. And it is evident that neither the rays\nof the sun, nor the clothes on the body, nor the stakes, nor the spade,\nnor the plough, with which each man works, nor the machines with which\nthey labour in the workmen\'s association, can belong to anyone else than\nthose who enjoy the rays of the sun, breathe the air, drink the water,\neat the bread, clothe their bodies, and labour with the spade or with\nthe machines, because all these are necessary only for those who use\nthem. And when men act thus, we see they act rationally.\n\nTherefore, observing all the economic conditions created among men, I do\nnot see that division into three is natural. I see, on the contrary,\nthat it is neither natural nor rational.\n\nBut perhaps the setting apart of these three does not occur in primitive\nsocieties, only when the population increases and cultivation begins to\ndevelop it is unavoidable. And we cannot but recognise the fact that\nthis division has occurred in European society.\n\nLet us see whether it is really so.\n\nWe are told that in European society this division of agencies has been;\nthat is, that one man possesses land, another accomplished the\ninstruments of labour, and the third is without land and instruments.\n\nWe have grown so accustomed to this assertion that we are no longer\nstruck by the strangeness of it. But in this assertion lies an inner\ncontradiction. The conception of a labouring man, includes the land on\nwhich he lives and the tools with which he works. If he did not live on\nthe land and had no tools he would not be a labourer. A workman deprived\nof land and tools never existed and never can exist. There cannot be a\nbootmaker without a house for his work built on land, without water,\nair, and tools to work with.\n\nIf the peasant has no land, horse, water or scythe; if the bootmaker is\nwithout a house, water, or awl, then that means that some one has driven\nhim from the ground, or taken it from him, and has cheated him out of\nhis scythe, cart, horse, or awl; but it does not in any way mean that\nthere can be country labourers without scythes or bootmakers without\ntools.\n\nAs you cannot think of a fisherman on dry land without fishing\nimplements, unless you imagine him driven away from the water by some\none who has taken his fishing implements from him; so also you cannot\npicture a workman without land on which to live, and without tools for\nhis trade, unless somebody has driven him from the former, or robbed him\nof the latter.\n\nThere may be men who are hunted from one place to another, and who,\nhaving been robbed, are compelled perforce to work for another man and\nmake things necessary for themselves, but this does not mean that such\nis the nature of production. It means only that in such case, the\nnatural conditions of production are violated.\n\nBut if we are to consider as factors of production all of which a\nworkman may be deprived by force, why not count among these the claim on\nthe person of a slave? Why not count claims on the rain and the rays of\nthe sun?\n\nOne man might build a wall and so keep the sun from his neighbour;\nanother might come who would turn the course of a river through his own\npond and so contaminate its water; or claim a fellow-being as his own\nproperty. But none of these claims, although enforced by violence, can\nbe recognised as a basis. It is therefore as wrong to accept the\nartificial rights to land and tools as separate factors in production,\nas to recognise as such the invented rights to use sunshine, air, water,\nor the person of another.\n\nThere may be men who claim the land and the tools of a workman, as there\nwere men who claimed the persons of others, and as there may be men who\nassert their rights to the exclusive use of the rays of the sun, or of\nwater and air. There may be men who drive away a workman from place to\nplace, taking from him by force the products of his labour as they are\nproduced, and the very instruments of its production, who compel him to\nwork, not for himself, but for his master, as in the factories;--all\nthis is possible; but the conception of a workman without land and tools\nis still an impossibility, as much as that a man can willingly become\nthe property of another, notwithstanding men have claimed other men for\nmany generations.\n\nAnd as the claim of property in the person of another cannot deprive a\nslave of his innate right to seek his own welfare and not that of his\nmaster; so, too, the claim to the exclusive possession of land and the\ntools of others cannot deprive the labourer of his inherent rights as a\nman to live on the land and to work with his own tools, or with communal\ntools, as he thinks most useful for himself.\n\nAll that science can say in examining the present economic question, is\nthis: that in Europe certain claims to the land and the tools of workmen\nare made, in consequence of which, for some of these workmen (but by no\nmeans for all of them), the proper conditions of production are\nviolated, so that they are deprived of land and implements of labour and\ncompelled to work with the tools of others. But it is certainly not\nestablished that this accidental violation of the law of production is\nthe fundamental law itself.\n\nIn saying that this separate consideration of the factors is the\nfundamental law of production, the economist is doing the very thing a\nzo\xc3\xb6logist would do, if on seeing a great many siskins with their wings\ncut, and kept in little cages, he should assert that this was the\nessential condition of the life of birds, and that their life is\ncomposed of such conditions.\n\nHowever many siskins there may be, kept in paste-board houses, with\ntheir wings cut, a zo\xc3\xb6logist cannot say that these, and a tiny pail of\nwater running up rails, are the conditions of the birds\' lives. And\nhowever great the number of workpeople there may be, driven from place\nto place, and deprived of their productions as well as their tools, the\nnatural right of man to live on the land, and to work with his own\ntools, is essential to him, and so it will remain forever.\n\nOf course there are some who lay claim to the land and to the tools of\nworkmen, just as in former ages there were some who laid claim to the\npersons of others; but there can be no real division of men into lords\nand slaves--as they wanted to establish in the ancient world--any more\nthan there can be any real division in the agents of production (land\nand capital, etc.), as the economists are trying to establish.\n\nThese unlawful claims on the liberty of other men, science calls "the\nnatural conditions of production." Instead of taking its fundamental\nprinciples from the natural properties of human societies, science took\nthem from a special case; and desiring to justify this case, it\nrecognized the right of some men to the land on which other men earn\ntheir living, and to the tools with which others again work; in other\nwords, it recognized as a right something which had never existed, and\ncannot exist, and which is in itself a contradiction, because the claim\nof the man to the land on which he does not labour, is in essence\nnothing else than the right to use the land which he does not use; the\nclaim on the tools of others is nothing else than the assumption of a\nright to work with implements with which a man does not work.\n\nScience, by dividing the factors of production, declares that the\nnatural condition of a workman--that is, of a man in the true sense of\nthe word--is the unnatural condition in which he lives at present, just\nas in ancient times, by the division of men into citizens and slaves, it\nwas asserted that the unnatural condition of slavery was the natural\ncondition of life.\n\nThis very division, which science has accepted only for the purpose of\njustifying the existing injustice, and the recognition of this division\nas the foundation of all its inquiries, is responsible for the fact that\nscience vainly tries to explain existing phenomena and, denying the\nclearest and plainest answers to the questions that arise, gives answers\nwhich have absolutely no meaning in them.\n\nThe question of economic science is this: What is the cause of the fact\nthat some men, by means of money, acquire an imaginary right to land and\ncapital, and may make slaves of those who have no money? The answer\nwhich presents itself to common sense is, that it is the result of\nmoney, the nature of which is to enslave men.\n\nBut economic science denies this, and says: This arises, not from the\nnature of money, but from the fact that some men have land and capital,\nand others have neither.\n\nWe ask: Why do persons who possess land and capital oppress those who\npossess neither? And we are answered: Because they possess land and\ncapital.\n\nBut this is just what we are inquiring about. Is not deprivation of land\nand tools enforced slavery? And the answer is like saying, "A remedy is\nnarcotic because its effects are narcotic." Life does not cease to put\nthis essential question, and even science herself notices and tries to\nanswer it, but does not succeed, because, starting from her own\nfundamental principles, she only turns herself round in a vicious\ncircle.\n\nIn order to give itself a satisfactory answer to the question, science\nmust first of all deny that wrong division of the agents of production,\nand cease to acknowledge the result of the phenomena as being their\ncause; and she must seek, first the more obvious, and then the remoter,\ncauses of those phenomena which constitute the matter questioned.\n\nScience must answer the question, Why are some men deprived of land and\ntools while others possess both? or, Why is it that lands and tools are\ntaken from the people who labour on the land and work with the tools?\n\nAnd as soon as economic science puts this question to herself she will\nget new ideas which will transform all the previous ideas of sham\nscience,--which has been moving in an unalterable circle of\npropositions,--that the miserable condition of the workers proceeds from\nthe fact that they are miserable.\n\nTo simple-minded persons it must seem unquestionable that the obvious\nreason of the oppression of some men by others is money. But science,\ndenying this, says that money is only a medium of exchange, which has no\nconnection with slavery of men.\n\nLet us see whether it is so or not.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nWhat is the origin of money? What are the conditions under which nations\nalways have money, and under what circumstances need nations not use\nmoney?\n\nThere are small tribes in Africa, and one in Australia, who live as the\nSknepies and the Drevlyans lived in olden times. These tribes lived by\nbreeding cattle and cultivating gardens. We become acquainted with them\nat the dawn of history, and history begins by recording the fact that\nsome invaders appear on the scene. And invaders always do the same\nthing: they take away from the aborigines everything they can\ntake,--cattle, corn, and cloth; they even make prisoners, male and\nfemale, and carry them away.\n\nIn a few years the invaders appear again, but the people have not yet\ngot over the consequences of their first misfortunes, and there is\nscarcely anything to take from them; so the invaders invent new and\nbetter means of making use of their victims.\n\nThese methods are very simple, and present themselves naturally to the\nmind of all men. The _first_ is personal slavery. There is a drawback to\nthis, because the invaders must take over the entire control and\nadministration of the tribe, and feed all the slaves; hence, naturally,\nthere appears the _second_. The people are left on their own land, but\nthis becomes the recognized property of the invaders, who portion it out\namong the leading military men, by whose means the labour of the tribe\nis utilized and transferred to the conquerors.\n\nBut this, too, has its drawback. It is inconvenient to have to oversee\nall the production of the conquered people, and thus the _third_ means\nis introduced, as primitive as the two former; this is, the levying of a\ncertain obligatory tax to be paid by the conquered at stated periods.\n\nThe object of conquest is to take from the conquered the greatest\npossible amount of the product of their labour. It is evident, that, in\norder to do this, the conquerors must take the articles which are the\nmost valuable to the conquered, and which at the same time are not\ncumbersome, and are convenient for keeping,--skins of animals, and gold.\n\nSo the conquerors lay upon the family or the tribe a tax in these skins\nor gold, to be paid at fixed times; and thus, by means of this tribute,\nthey utilize the labour of the conquered people in the most convenient\nway.\n\nWhen the skins and the gold have been taken from the original owners,\nthey are compelled to sell all they have amongst themselves to obtain\nmore gold and skins for their masters; that is, they have to sell their\nproperty and their labour.\n\nSo it was in ancient times, in the Middle Ages, and so it occurs now. In\nthe ancient world, where the subjugation of one people by another was\nfrequent, personal slavery was the most widespread method of\nsubjugation, and the centre of gravity in this compulsion, owing to the\nnon-recognition of the equality of men. In the Middle Ages,\nfeudalism--land-ownership and the servitude connected with it--partly\ntakes the place of personal slavery, and the centre of compulsion is\ntransferred from persons to land. In modern times, since the discovery\nof America, the development of commerce, and the influx of gold (which\nis accepted as a universal medium of exchange), the money tribute has\nbecome, with the increase of state power, the chief instrument for\nenslaving men, and upon this all economic relations are now based.\n\nIn "The Literary Miscellany" there is an article by Professor Yanjoul in\nwhich he describes the recent history of the Fiji Islands. If I were\ntrying to find the most pointed illustration of how in our day the\ncompulsory money payment became the chief instrument in enslaving some\nmen by others, I could not imagine anything more striking and convincing\nthan this trustworthy history,--history based upon documents of facts\nwhich are of recent occurrence.\n\nIn the South-Sea Islands, in Polynesia, lives a race called the Fiji.\nThe group on which they live, says Professor Yanjoul, is composed of\nsmall islands, which altogether comprise about forty thousand square\nmiles. Only half of these islands are inhabited, by a hundred and fifty\nthousand natives and fifteen hundred white men. The natives were\nreclaimed from savagery a long time ago, and were distinguished among\nthe other natives of Polynesia by their intellectual capacities. They\nappear to be capable of labour and development, which they proved by the\nfact that within a short period they became good workmen and cattle\nbreeders.\n\nThe inhabitants were well-to-do, but in the year 1859 the condition of\ntheir state became desperate: the nation and its representative, Kakabo,\nwere in need of money. This money, forty-five thousand dollars, was\nwanted as compensation or indemnification demanded of them by the United\nStates of America for violence said to have been done by Fijis to some\ncitizens of the American Republic.\n\nTo collect this, the Americans sent a squadron, which unexpectedly\nseized some of the best islands under the pretext of guaranty, and\nthreatened to bombard and ruin the towns if the indemnification were not\npaid over on a certain date to the representatives of America.\n\nThe Americans were among the first colonists who came to the Fiji\nIslands with the missionaries. They chose and (under one pretext or\nanother) took possession of the best pieces of land on the islands, and\nestablished there cotton and coffee plantations. They hired whole crowds\nof natives, binding them by contracts unknown to this half-civilized\nrace, or they acted through special contractors and dealers of human\nmerchandise.\n\nMisunderstandings between these master planters and the natives, whom\nthey considered almost as slaves, were unavoidable, and it was some of\nthese quarrels which served as a pretext for the American\nindemnification.\n\nNotwithstanding their prosperity the Fijis had preserved almost up to\nthat time the forms of the so-called natural economy which existed in\nEurope during the Middle Ages: money was scarcely in circulation among\nthem, and their trade was almost exclusively on the barter basis,--one\nmerchandise being exchanged for another, and the few social taxes and\nthose of the state being paid in rural products. What could the Fijis\nand their King Kakabo do, when the Americans demanded forty-five\nthousand dollars under terrible threats in the event of nonpayment? To\nthe Fijis the very figures seemed inconceivable, to say nothing of the\nmoney itself, which they had never seen in such large quantities. After\ndeliberating with other chiefs, Kakabo made up his mind to apply to the\nQueen of England, at first merely asking her to take the islands under\nher protection, but afterwards requesting definite annexation.\n\nBut the English regarded this request cautiously, and were in no hurry\nto assist the half-savage monarch out of his difficulty. Instead of\ngiving a direct answer, they sent special commissioners to make\ninquiries about the Fiji Islands in 1860, in order to be able to decide\nwhether it was worth while to annex them to the British Possessions, and\nto lay out money to satisfy the American claims.\n\nMeanwhile the American Government continued to insist upon payment, and\nas a pledge held in their _de facto_ dominion some of the best parts,\nand, having looked closely into the national wealth, raised their former\nclaim to ninety thousand dollars, threatening to increase it still more\nif Kakabo did not pay at once.\n\nBeing thus pushed on every side, and knowing nothing of European means\nof credit accommodation, the poor king, acting on the advice of European\ncolonists, began to try to raise money in Melbourne among the merchants,\ncost what it might, if even he should be obliged to yield his kingdom\ninto private hands.\n\nSo in consequence of his application a commercial society was formed in\nMelbourne. This joint-stock company, which took the name of the\n"Polynesian Company," formed a treaty with the chiefs of the\nFiji-Islanders on the most advantageous terms. It took over the debt to\nthe American Government, pledging itself to pay it by several\ninstalments; and for this the company received, according to the first\ntreaty, one, and then two hundred thousand acres of the best land,\nselected by itself; perpetual immunity from all taxes and dues for all\nits factories, operations, and colonies, and the exclusive right for a\nlong period to establish banks in the Fiji Islands, with the privilege\nof issuing unlimited notes.\n\nThis treaty was definitely concluded in the year 1868, and there has\nappeared in the Fiji Islands, side by side with the local government, of\nwhich Kakabo is the head, another powerful authority,--a commercial\norganization, with large estates over all the islands, exercising a\npowerful influence upon the government.\n\nUp to this time the wants of the government of Kakabo had been satisfied\nwith a payment in local products, and a small custom tax on goods\nimported. But with the conclusion of the treaty and the formation of the\ninfluential "Polynesian Company," the king\'s financial circumstances had\nchanged.\n\nA considerable part of the best land in his dominion having passed into\nthe hands of the company, his income from the land had therefore\ndiminished; on the other hand the income from the custom taxes also\ndiminished, because the company had obtained for itself the right to\nimport and export all kinds of goods free of duties.\n\nThe natives--ninety-nine per cent. of the population--had never paid\nmuch in custom duties, as they bought scarcely any of the European\nproductions except some stuffs and hardware; and now, from the freeing\nof custom duties of many well-to-do Europeans along with the Polynesian\nCompany, the income of King Kakabo was reduced to _nil_, and he was\nobliged to take steps to resuscitate it if possible.\n\nHe began to consult his white friends as to the best way to remedy the\ntrouble, and they advised him to create the first direct tax in the\ncountry; and, in order, I suppose, to have less trouble about it, to\nmake it in money. The tax was established in the form of a general\npoll-tax, amounting to one pound for every man, and to four shillings\nfor every woman, throughout the islands.\n\nAs I have already said, there still exists on the Fiji Islands a natural\neconomy and a trade by barter. Very few natives possess money. Their\nwealth consists chiefly of raw products and cattle; whilst the new tax\nrequired the possession of considerable sums of money at fixed times.\n\nUp to that date a native had not been accustomed to any individual\nburden in the interests of his government, except personal obligations;\nall the taxes which had to be paid, were paid by the community or\nvillage to which he belonged, and from the common fields from which he\nreceived his principal income.\n\nOne alternative was left to him,--to try to raise money from the\nEuropean colonists; that is, to address himself either to the merchant\nor to the planter.\n\nTo the first he was obliged to sell his productions on the merchant\'s\nown terms (because the tax-collector required money at a certain fixed\ndate), or even to raise money by the sale of his expected harvest, which\nenabled the merchant to take iniquitous interest. Or he had to address\nhimself to the planter, and sell him his labour; that is, to become his\nworkman: but the wages on the Fiji Islands were very low (owing, I\nsuppose, to the exceptionally great supply of labour); not exceeding a\nshilling a week for a grown-up man, or two pounds twelve shillings a\nyear; and therefore, merely to be able to get the money necessary to pay\nhis own tax, to say nothing of his family, a Fiji had to leave his\nhouse, his family, and his own land, often to go far away to another\nisland, and enslave himself to the planter for at least half a year;\neven then there was the payment for his family, which he must provide by\nsome other means.\n\nWe can understand the result of such a state of affairs. From his\nhundred and fifty thousand subjects, Kakabo collected only six thousand\npounds; and so there began a forcible extortion of taxes, unknown till\nthen, and a whole series of coercive measures.\n\nThe local administration, formerly incorruptible, soon made common cause\nwith the European planters, who began to have their own way with the\ncountry. For nonpayment of the taxes the Fijis were summoned to the\ncourt, and sentenced not only to pay the expenses but also to\nimprisonment for not less than six months. The prison really meant the\nplantations of the first white man who chose to pay the tax-money and\nthe legal expenses of the offender. Thus the white settlers received\ncheap labour to any amount.\n\nAt first this compulsory labour was fixed for not longer than half a\nyear; but afterwards the bribed judges found it possible to pass\nsentence for eighteen months, and even then to renew the sentence.\n\nVery quickly, in the course of a few years, the picture of the social\ncondition of the inhabitants of Fiji was quite changed.\n\nWhole districts, formerly flourishing, lost half of their population,\nand were greatly impoverished. All the male population, except the old\nand infirm, worked far away from their homes for European planters, to\nget money necessary for the taxes, or in consequence of the law court.\nThe women on the Fiji Islands had scarcely ever worked in the fields, so\nthat in the absence of the men, all the local farming was neglected and\nwent to ruin. And in the course of a few years, half the population of\nFiji had become the slaves of the colonists.\n\nTo relieve their position the Fiji-Islanders again appealed to England.\nA new petition was got up, subscribed by many eminent persons and\nchiefs, praying to be annexed to England; and this was handed to the\nBritish consul. Meanwhile, England, thanks to her scientific\nexpeditions, had time not only to investigate the affairs of the\nislands, but even to survey them, and duly to appreciate the natural\nriches of this fine corner of the globe.\n\nOwing to all these circumstances, the negotiations this time were\ncrowned with full success; and in 1874, to the great dissatisfaction of\nthe American planters, England officially took possession of the Fiji\nIslands, and added them to its colonies. Kakabo died, his heirs had a\nsmall pension assigned to them, and the administration of the islands\nwas intrusted to Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales.\nIn the first year of its annexation the Fiji-Islanders had no\nself-government, but were under the direction of Sir Hercules Robinson,\nwho appointed an administrator.\n\nTaking the islands into their hands, the English Government had to\nundertake the difficult task of gratifying various expectations raised\nby them. The natives, of course, first of all expected the abolition of\nthe hated poll-tax; one part of the white colonists (the Americans)\nlooked with suspicion upon the British rule; and another part (those of\nEnglish origin) expected all kinds of confirmations of their power over\nthe natives,--permission to enclose the land, and so on. The English\nGovernment, however, proved itself equal to the task; and its first act\nwas to abolish for ever the poll-tax, which had created the slavery of\nthe natives in the interest of a few colonists.\n\nBut here Sir Hercules Robinson had at once to face a difficult dilemma.\nIt was necessary to abolish the poll-tax, which had made the Fijis seek\nthe help of the English Government; but, at the same time, according to\nEnglish colonial policy, the colonies had to support themselves; they\nhad to find their own means for covering the expenses of the government.\nWith the abolition of the poll-tax, all the incomes of the Fijis (from\ncustom duties) did not amount to more than six thousand pounds, while\nthe government expenses required at least seventy thousand a year.\n\nHaving abolished the money tax, Sir Hercules Robinson now thought of a\nlabour tax; but this did not yield the sum necessary to feed him and his\nassistants. Matters did not mend until a new governor had been\nappointed,--Gordon,--who, to get out of the inhabitants the money\nnecessary to keep him and his officials, resolved not to demand money\nuntil it had come sufficiently into general circulation on the islands,\nbut to take from the natives their products, and to sell them himself.\n\nThis tragical episode in the lives of the Fijis is the clearest and best\nproof of the nature and true meaning of money in our time.\n\nIn this illustration every essential is represented. The first\nfundamental condition of slavery,--the guns, threats, murders, and\nplunder,--and lastly, money, the means of subjugation which has\nsupplanted all the others. That which in an historical sketch of\neconomical development, has to be investigated during centuries, we have\nhere, where all the forms of monetary violence have fully developed\nthemselves, concentrated in a space of ten years.\n\nThe drama begins thus: the American Government sends ships with loaded\nguns to the shores of the islands, whose inhabitants they want to\nenslave. The pretext of this threat is monetary; but the beginning of\nthe tragedy is the levelling of guns against all the inhabitants,--women,\nchildren, old people, and men,--though innocent of any crime.\n"Your money or your life,"--forty-five thousand dollars, then\nninety thousand or slaughter. But the ninety thousand are not to be had.\nSo now begins the second act: it is the postponement of a measure which\nwould be bloody, terrible, and concentrated in a short period; and the\nsubstitution of a suffering less perceptible, which can be laid upon\nall, and will last longer. And the natives, with their representative,\nseek to substitute for the massacre a slavery of money. They borrow\nmoney, and the method at once begins to operate like a disciplined army.\nIn five years the thing is done,--the men have not only lost their right\nto utilize their own land and their property, but also their\nliberty,--they have become slaves.\n\nHere begins act three. The situation is too painful, and the unfortunate\nones are told they may change their master and become the slaves of\nanother. Of freedom from the slavery brought about by the means of money\nthere is not one thought. And the people call for another master, to\nwhom they give themselves up, asking him to improve their condition. The\nEnglish come, see that dominion over these islanders will give them the\npossibility of feeding their already too greatly multiplied parasites,\nand take possession of the islands and their inhabitants.\n\nBut it does not take them in the form of personal slaves, it does not\ntake even the land, nor distribute it among its assistants. These old\nways are not necessary now: only one thing is necessary,--taxes which\nmust be large enough on the one hand to prevent the workingmen from\nfreeing themselves from virtual slavery, and on the other hand, to feed\nluxuriously a great number of parasites. The inhabitants must pay\nseventy thousand pounds sterling annually,--that is the fundamental\ncondition upon which England consents to free the Fijis from the\nAmerican despotism, and this is just what was wanting for the final\nenslaving of the inhabitants. But it turns out that the Fiji-Islanders\ncannot under any circumstances pay these seventy thousand pounds in\ntheir present state. The claim is too great.\n\nThe English temporarily modify it, and take a part of it out in natural\nproducts in order that in time, when money has come into circulation,\nthey may receive the full sum. They do not behave like the former\ncompany, whose conduct we may liken to the first coming of savage\ninvaders into an uncivilized land, when they want only to take as much\nas possible and then decamp; but England behaves like a more\nclear-sighted enslaver; she does not kill at one blow the goose with the\ngolden eggs, but feeds her in order that she may continue to lay them.\nEngland at first relaxes the reins for her own interest that she may\nhold them tight forever afterwards, and so has brought the\nFiji-Islanders into that state of permanent monetary thraldom in which\nall civilized European people now exist, and from which their chance of\nescape is not apparent.\n\nThis phenomenon repeats itself in America, in China, in Central Asia;\nand it is the same in the history of the conquest of all nations.\n\nMoney is an inoffensive means of exchange when it is not collected while\nloaded guns are directed from the sea-shore against the defenceless\ninhabitants. As soon as it is taken by the force of guns, the same thing\nmust inevitably take place which occurred on the Fiji Islands, and has\nalways and everywhere repeated itself.\n\nMen who consider it their lawful right to utilize the labour of others,\nwill achieve their ends by the means of a forcible demand of a sum of\nmoney which will compel the oppressed to become the slaves of the\noppressors.\n\nMoreover, that will happen which occurred between the English and the\nFijis,--the extortioners will always, in their demand for money, rather\nexceed the limit to which the amount of the sum required must rise, so\nthat the enslaving may be earlier. They will respect this limit only\nwhile they have moral sense and sufficient money for themselves: they\nwill overstep it when they lose their moral sense or even do not require\nfunds.\n\nAs for governments, they will always exceed this limit,--first, because\nfor a government there exists no moral sense of justice; and secondly,\nbecause, as everyone knows, every government is always in the greatest\nwant of money, through wars and the necessity of giving gratuities to\ntheir allies. All governments are insolvent, and involuntarily follow a\nmaxim expressed by a Russian statesman of the eighteenth century,--that\nthe peasant must be sheared of his wool lest it grow too long. All\ngovernments are hopelessly in debt, and this debt on an average (not\ntaking in consideration its occasional diminution in England and\nAmerica) is growing at a terrible rate. So also grow the budgets; that\nis, the necessity of struggling with other extortioners, and of giving\npresents to those who assist in extortion, and because of that grows the\nland rent.\n\nWages do not increase, not because of the law of rent, but because\ntaxes, collected with violence, exist, with the object of taking away\nfrom men their superfluities, so that they may be compelled to sell\ntheir labour to satisfy them,--utilizing their labour being the aim of\nraising the taxes.\n\nAnd their labour can only be utilized when, on a general average, the\ntaxes required are more than the labourers are able to give without\ndepriving themselves of all means of subsistence. The increase of wages\nwould put an end to the possibility of slavery; and therefore, as long\nas violence exists, wages can never be increased. The simple and plain\nmode of action of some men towards others, political economists term\n_the iron law_; the instrument by which such action is performed, they\ncall a medium of exchange; and money is this inoffensive medium of\nexchange necessary for men in their transactions with each other.\n\nWhy is it, then, that, whenever there is no violent demand for money\ntaxes, money in its true signification has never existed, and never can\nexist; but, as among the Fiji-Islanders, the Phoenicians, the Kirghis,\nand generally among men who do not pay taxes, such as the Africans,\nthere is either a direct exchange of produce, sheep, hides, skins, or\naccidental standards of value, such as shells?\n\nA definite kind of money, whatever it may be, always becomes not a means\nof exchange, but a means of ransoming from violence; and it begins to\ncirculate among men only when a definite standard is compulsorily\nrequired from all.\n\nIt is only then that everybody wants it equally, and only then does it\nreceive any value.\n\nAnd further, it is not the thing that is most convenient for exchange\nthat receives exchange value, but that which is required by the\ngovernment. If gold is demanded, gold becomes valuable: if knuckle-bones\nwere demanded, they, too, would become valuable. If it were not so, why,\nthen, has the issue of this means of exchange always been the\nprerogative of the government? The Fiji-Islanders, for instance, have\narranged among themselves their own means of exchange; well, then, let\nthem be free to exchange what and how they like, and you, men possessing\npower, or the means of violence, do not interfere with this exchange.\nBut instead of this you coin money, and do not allow anyone else to coin\nit; or, as is the case with us, you merely print some notes, engraving\nupon them the heads of the tsars, sign them with a particular signature,\nand threaten to punish every falsification of them. Then you distribute\nthis money to your assistants, and, under the name of duties and taxes,\nyou require everybody to give you such money or such notes with such\nsignatures, and so many of them, that a workman must give away all his\nlabour in order to get these notes or coins; and then you want to\nconvince us that this money is necessary for us as a means of exchange!\n\nHere are all men free, and none oppresses the others or keeps them in\nslavery; but money appears in society and immediately an iron law\nexists, in consequence of which rent increases and wages diminish to the\nminimum.\n\nThat half (nay, more than half) of the Russian peasants, in order to pay\ndirect and indirect taxes, voluntarily sell themselves as slaves to the\nland-owners or to manufacturers, does not at all signify (which is\nobvious); for the violent collection of the poll-taxes and indirect and\nland taxes, which have to be paid in money to the government and to its\nassistants (the landowners), _compels_ the workman to be a slave to\nthose who own money; but it means that this money, as a means of\nexchange, and an iron law, exist.\n\nBefore the serfs were free, I could compel Iv\xc3\xa1n to do any work; and if\nhe refused to do it, I could send him to the police-sergeant, and the\nlatter would give him the rod till he submitted. But if I compelled Iv\xc3\xa1n\nto overwork himself, and did not give him either land or food, the\nmatter would go up to the authorities, and I should have to answer for\nit.\n\nBut now that men are free, I can compel Iv\xc3\xa1n and Peter and Sidor to do\nevery kind of work; and if they refuse I give them no money to pay\ntaxes, and then they will be flogged till they submit: besides this, I\nmay also make a German, a Frenchman, a Chinaman, and an Indian, work for\nme by that means, so that, if they do not submit, I shall not give them\nmoney to hire land, or to buy bread, because they have neither land nor\nbread. And if I make them overwork themselves, or kill them with excess\nof labour, nobody will say a word to me about it; and, moreover, if I\nhave read books on political economy I shall be quite sure that all men\nare free and that money does not create slavery!\n\nOur peasants have long known that with a ruble one can hurt more than\nwith a stick. It is only political economists who cannot see it.\n\nTo say that money does not create bondage, is the same as to have\nasserted, fifty years ago, that serfdom did not create slavery.\nPolitical economists say that money is an inoffensive medium of\nexchange, notwithstanding the fact that its possession enables one man\nto enslave another. Why, then, was it not said half a century ago that\nservitude was, in itself, an inoffensive medium of reciprocal services,\nnotwithstanding the fact that no man could lawfully enslave another?\nSome give their manual labour, and the work of others consists in taking\ncare of the physical and intellectual welfare of the slaves, and in\nsuperintending their efforts.\n\nAnd, I fancy, some really did say this.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nIf the object of this sham pseudo-science of Political Economy had not\nbeen the same as that of all other legal sciences,--the justification of\ncoercion,--it could not have avoided noticing the strange phenomena that\nthe distribution of wealth, the deprivation of some men of land and\ncapital, and the enslavery of some men to others, depend upon money, and\nthat it is only by means of money that some men utilize the labour of\nothers,--in other words, enslave them.\n\nI repeat that a man who has money may buy up and monopolise all the corn\nand kill others by starvation, completely oppressing them, as it has\nfrequently happened before our own eyes on a very large scale.\n\nIt would seem then that we ought to examine the connection of these\noccurrences with money; but Political Science, with full assurance,\nasserts that money has no connection whatever with the matter.\n\nThis science says, "Money is as much an article of merchandise as\nanything else which contains the value of its production, only with this\ndifference,--that this article of merchandise is chosen as the more\nconvenient medium of exchange for establishing values, for saving, and\nfor making payments. One man has made boots, another has grown wheat,\nthe third has bred sheep; and now, in order to exchange more\nconveniently, they put money into circulation, which represents the\nequivalent of labour; and by this medium they exchange the soles of\nboots for a loin of mutton, or ten pounds of flour."\n\nStudents of this sham science are very fond of picturing to themselves\nsuch a state of affairs; but there has never been such a condition in\nthe world. This idea about society is like the fancy about the\nprimitive, prehistoric, perfect human state which the philosophers\ncherished; but such a state never existed.\n\nIn all human societies where money has been used there has also been the\noppression by the strong and the armed of the weak and the defenceless;\nand wherever there was oppression, there the standard of value, money,\nwhatever it consisted of, cattle or hides, skin or metals, must have\nunavoidably lost its significance as a medium of exchange, and received\nthe meaning of a ransom from violence.\n\nThere is no doubt that money does possess the inoffensive properties\nwhich science enumerates; but it would have these properties only in a\nsociety in which there was no violence,--in an ideal state. But in such\na society money would not be found as a general measure of value. In\nsuch a community, at the advent of violence, money would immediately\nlose its significance.\n\nIn all societies known to us where money is used it receives the\nsignificance of a medium of exchange only because it serves as a means\nof violence. And its chief object is to act thus,--not as a mere medium.\nWhere violence exists, money cannot be a true medium of exchange,\nbecause it is not a measure of value,--because, as soon as one man may\ntake away from another the products of his labour, all measures of value\nare directly violated. If horses and cows, bred by one man, and\nviolently taken away by others, were brought to a market, it is plain\nthat the value of other horses and cows there, when brought into\ncompetition with stolen animals, would no longer correspond with the\nlabour of breeding them. And the value of everything else would also\nchange with this change, and so money could not determine values.\n\nBesides, if one man may acquire by force a cow or a horse or a house, he\nmay by the same force acquire money itself, and with this money acquire\nall kinds of produce. If, then, money itself is acquired by violence,\nand spent to purchase products, money entirely loses its quality as a\nmedium of exchange.\n\nThe oppressor who takes money and gives it for the products of labour\ndoes not exchange anything, but obtains from labour all that he wants.\n\nBut let us suppose that such an imaginary and impossible state of\nsociety really existed, in which money is in circulation, without the\nexercise of general violence,--silver or gold serving as a measure of\nvalue and as a medium of exchange. All the savings in such a society are\nexpressed by money. There appears in this society an oppressor in the\nshape of a conqueror. Let us suppose that this oppressor claims the\ncows, horses, clothes, and the houses of the inhabitants; but, as it is\nnot convenient for him to take possession of all this, he naturally\nthinks of taking that which represents among these men all kinds of\nvalues and is exchanged for everything,--money. And at once in this\ncommunity, money receives, for the oppressor and his assistants, another\nsignification, and its character as a medium of exchange therefore\nimmediately ceases.\n\nThe measure of the values will always depend on the pleasure of the\noppressor. The articles most necessary to him, and for which he gives\nmore money, are considered greater value, and _vice versa_; so that, in\na community exposed to violence, money at once receives its chief\nmeaning,--it becomes a means of violence and a ransom from violence, and\nit retains, among the oppressed, its significance as a medium of\nexchange only so far as that is convenient to the oppressor.\n\nLet us picture the whole affair in a circle, thus:--The serfs supply\ntheir landlord with linen, poultry, sheep, and daily labour. The\nlandlord substitutes money for these goods, and fixes the value of the\nvarious articles sent in. Those who have no linen, corn, cattle, or\nmanual labour to offer, may bring a definite sum of money.\n\nIt is obvious, that, in the society of the peasants of this landlord,\nthe price of the various articles will always depend upon the landlord\'s\npleasure. The landlord uses the articles collected among his peasants,\nand some of these articles are more necessary for him than others: he\nfixes the prices for them accordingly, more or less. It is clear that\nthe mere will and requirements of the landlord must regulate the prices\nof these articles among the payers. If he is in want of corn, he will\nset a high price for a fixed quantity of it, and a low price for linen,\ncattle, or work; and therefore those who have no corn will sell their\nlabour, linen, and cattle to others, in order to buy corn to give it to\nthe landlord.\n\nIf the landlord chooses to substitute money for all his claims, then the\nvalue of things will again depend, not upon the value of labour, but\nfirst upon the sum of money which the landlord requires, and secondly\nupon the articles produced by the peasants, which are more necessary to\nthe landlord, and for which he allows a higher price.\n\nThe money-claim made by the landlord on the peasants ceases to influence\nthe prices of the articles only when the peasants of this landlord live\nseparately from other people and have no connection with any one; and\nsecondly, when the landlord employs money, not in purchasing things in\nhis own village, but elsewhere. Only under these two conditions would\nthe prices of things, though changed nominally, remain relatively the\nsame, and money would become a measure of value and a medium of\nexchange.\n\nBut if the peasants have any business connections with the inhabitants\nsurrounding them, the prices of their produce, as sold to their\nneighbours, would depend on the sum required from them by their\nlandlord. (If less money is required from their neighbours than from\nthemselves, then their products would be sold cheaper than the products\nof their neighbours, and _vice versa_.) Again, the landlord\'s\nmoney-demand would cease to influence the prices of the articles, only\nwhen the sums collected by the landlord were not spent in buying the\nproducts of his own peasants. But if he spends the money in purchasing\nfrom them, it is plain that the prices of various articles will\nconstantly vary among them according as the landlord buys more of one\nthing than another.\n\nSuppose one landlord has fixed a very high poll-tax, and his neighbour a\nvery low one: it is clear that on the estate of the first landlord every\nthing will be cheaper than on the estate of the second, and that the\nprices on either estate will depend only upon the increase and decrease\nof the poll-taxes. This is one effect of violence on value.\n\nAnother, rising out of the first, consists in relative values. Suppose\none landlord is fond of horses, and pays a high price for them; another\nis fond of towels, and offers a high figure for them. It is obvious that\non the estate of either of these two landlords, the horses and the\ntowels will be dear, and the prices of these articles will be out of\nproportion to those of cows or of corn. If to-morrow the collector of\ntowels dies, and his heirs are fond of poultry, then it is obvious that\nthe price of towels will fall and that of poultry will rise.\n\nWherever in society there is the mastery of one man over another, there\nthe meaning of money as the measure of value at once yields to the will\nof the oppressor, and its meaning as a medium of exchange of the\nproducts of labour is replaced by another,--that of the most convenient\nmeans of utilizing other people\'s labour.\n\nThe oppressor wants money neither as a medium of exchange,--for he takes\nwhatever he wants without exchange,--nor as a measure of value,--for he\nhimself determines the value of everything,--but only for the\nconvenience it affords of exercising violence; and this convenience\nconsists in the fact that money may be stored up, and is the most\nconvenient means of holding in slavery the majority of mankind.\n\nIt is not convenient to carry away all the cattle in order always to\nhave horses, cows, and sheep whenever wanted, because they must be fed;\nthe same holds good with corn, for it may be spoiled; the same with\nslaves; sometimes a man may require thousands of workmen, and sometimes\nnone. Money demanded from those who have not got it makes it possible to\nget rid of all these inconveniences and to have everything that is\nrequired; and this is why the oppressor wants money. Besides which, he\nwants money so that his right to utilize another man\'s labour may not be\nconfined to certain men but may be extended to all men who require the\nmoney.\n\nWhen there was no money in circulation each landlord could utilize the\nlabour of his own serfs only; but when they agreed to demand from the\npeasants money which they had not, they were enabled to appropriate\nwithout distinction the labour of all men on every estate.\n\nThus the oppressor finds it more convenient to press all his claims on\nlabour in the shape of money, and for this sole object is it desired. To\nthe victim from whom it is taken away money cannot be of use, either for\nthe purpose of exchange (seeing he exchanges without money, as all\nnations have exchanged who had no government); nor for a measure of\nvalue, because this is fixed without him; nor for the purpose of saving,\nbecause the man whose productions are taken away cannot save; neither\nfor payments, because an oppressed man always has more to pay than to\nreceive; and if he does receive anything, the payment is made, not in\nmoney, but in articles of merchandise in either case; whether the\nworkman takes his goods from his master\'s shop to remunerate his labour,\nor whether he buys the necessaries of life with his earnings in other\nshops, the money is required from him, and he is told by his oppressors\nthat if he does not pay it they will refuse to give him land or bread,\nor will take away his cow or his horse, or condemn him to work, or put\nhim in prison. He can only free himself from all this by selling the\nproducts of his toil, his own labour, or that of his children.\n\nHe will have to sell this according to the prices established, not by a\nregular exchange, but by the authority which demands money of him.\n\nUnder the conditions of the influence of tribute and taxes on\nprices,--which everywhere and always repeat themselves, as much with the\nland-owners in a narrow circle, as with the state on a larger scale (in\nwhich the causes of the modification of prices are as obvious to us, as\nthe motion of the hands and feet of puppets is obvious to those who look\nbehind the curtain and see who are the wire-pullers):--under these\ncircumstances, to say that money is a medium of exchange and a measure\nof value, is at least astonishing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nAll slavery is based solely on the fact that one man can deprive another\nof his life, and by threatening to do so can compel him to do his will.\nWe may see for certain that whenever one man is enslaved by another,\nwhen, against his own will and by the will of another, he does certain\nactions contrary to his inclination, the cause, if traced to its source,\nis nothing more nor less than a result of this threat. If a man gives to\nothers all his labour, has not enough to eat, has to send his little\nchildren from home to work hard, leaves the land, and devotes all his\nlife to a hated and unnecessary task, which happens before our own eyes\nin the world (which we term civilized because we ourselves live in it),\nthen we may certainly say that he does so only because not to do so\nwould be equivalent to loss of life.\n\nTherefore in our civilized world, where the majority of the people,\namidst terrible privations, perform hated labours unnecessary to\nthemselves, the greater number of men are in a slavery based on the\nthreat of being deprived of their existence. Of what, then, does this\nslavery consist? Wherein lies this power of threat?\n\nIn olden times the means of subjugation and the threat to kill were\nplain and obvious to all: the primitive means of enslaving men then\nconsisted in a direct threat to kill with the sword.\n\nAn armed man said to an unarmed, "I can kill thee, as thou hast seen I\nhave done to thy brother, but I do not want to do it: I will spare\nthee,--first, because it is not agreeable for me to kill thee; secondly,\nbecause, as well for me as for thee, it will be more convenient that\nthou shouldst labour for me than that I should kill thee. Therefore do\nall I order thee to do, but know that, if thou refusest, I will take thy\nlife."\n\nSo the unarmed man submitted to the armed one and did everything he was\nordered to do. The unarmed man laboured, the armed threatened. This was\nthat personal slavery which appeared first among all nations, and which\nstill exists among primitive races.\n\nThis means of enslaving always begins the work; but when life becomes\nmore complicated it undergoes a change. With the complication of life\nsuch a method presents great inconveniences to the oppressor. Before he\ncan appropriate the labour of the weaker he must feed and clothe them\nand keep them at work, and so their number remains small; and, besides,\nthis compels the slave-holder to remain continually with the slaves,\ndriving them to work by the threat of murdering them. And thus another\nmeans of subjugation is developed.\n\nFive thousand years ago (according to the Bible) this novel, convenient,\nand clever means of oppression was discovered by Joseph the Beautiful.\n\nIt is similar to that employed now in the menageries for taming restive\nhorses and wild beasts.\n\nIt is hunger!\n\nThis contrivance is thus described in the Bible (Genesis\xc2\xa0xli., 48-57):--\n\n    And he (Joseph) gathered up all the food of the seven years, which\n    were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the\n    food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in\n    the same.\n\n    And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he\n    left numbering; for it was without number.\n\n    And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt,\n    were ended.\n\n    And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had\n    said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt,\n    there was bread.\n\n    And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to\n    Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto\n    Joseph; what he said to you, do.\n\n    And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened\n    all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine\n    waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\n\n    And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; even\n    because that the famine was so sore in all lands.\n\nJoseph, making use of the primitive means of enslaving men by the threat\nof the sword, gathered corn during the years of plenty in expectation of\nyears of famine which generally follow years of plenty,--men know all\nthis without the dreams of Pharaoh,--and then by the pangs of hunger he\nmade all the Egyptians and the inhabitants of the surrounding countries\nslaves to Pharaoh more securely and conveniently. And when the people\nbegan to be famished, he arranged matters so as to keep them in his\npower _forever_.\n\n    (Genesis\xc2\xa0xlvii., 13-26.) And there was no bread in all the land; for\n    the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land\n    of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.\n\n    And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of\n    Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:\n    and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh\'s house.\n\n    And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of\n    Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:\n    for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. And\n    Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle,\n    if money fail. And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph\n    gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for\n    the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with\n    bread for all their cattle for that year.\n\n    When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and\n    said unto him, We will not hide it from my Lord, how that our money\n    is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought\n    left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:\n    Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy\n    us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto\n    Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that\n    the land be not desolate. And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt\n    for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the\n    famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh\'s. And as for\n    the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of\n    Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n\n    Only the lands of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a\n    portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which\n    Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.\n\n    Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day\n    and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall\n    sow the land. And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye\n    shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your\n    own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your\n    households, and for food for your little ones.\n\n    And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the\n    sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh\'s servants.\n\n    And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that\n    Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests\n    only, which became not Pharaoh\'s.\n\nFormerly, in order to appropriate labour, Pharaoh had to use violence\ntowards them; but now, when the stores and the land belonged to Pharaoh,\nhe had only to keep these stores by force, and hunger compelled the men\nto labour for him.\n\nAll the land now belonged to Pharaoh, and he had all the stores (which\nwere taken away from the people); and therefore, instead of driving them\nto work individually by the sword, he had only to keep food from them\nand they were enslaved, not by the sword, but by hunger.\n\nIn a year of scarcity, all men may be starved to death at Pharaoh\'s\nwill; and in a year of plenty, all may be killed who, from casual\nmisfortunes, have no stores of corn.\n\nThus comes into operation the second means of enslaving, not directly\nwith the sword,--that is, by the strong man driving the weak one to\nlabour under threat of killing him,--but by the strong one having taken\naway from the weak the stores of corn which, keeping by the sword, he\ncompels the weak to work for.\n\nJoseph said to the hungry men, "I could starve you to death, because I\nhave the corn; but I will spare your lives, but only under the condition\nthat you do all I order you for the food which I will give you." For the\nfirst means of enslaving, the oppressor only needs soldiers to ride to\nand fro among the inhabitants, and make them fulfil the requirements of\ntheir master under threat of death. And thus the oppressor has only to\npay his soldiers. But with the second means, besides the soldiers, the\noppressor must have different assistants for keeping and protecting the\nland and stores from the starving people.\n\nThese are the Josephs and their stewards and distributors. And the\noppressor has to reward them, and to give Joseph a dress of brocade, a\ngold ring, and servants, and corn and silver to his brothers and\nrelatives. Besides this, from the very nature of the second means, not\nonly the stewards and their relations, but all who have stores of corn\nbecome participators in this violence, just as by the first means, based\nupon immediate force, every one who has arms becomes a partner in\ntyranny, so by this means, based upon hunger, every one who has stores\nof provision shares in it, and has power over those who have no stores.\n\nThe advantage of this method over the former consists, first and\nchiefly, in the fact that the oppressor need no longer compel the\nworkmen to do his will by force, for they themselves come to him and\nsell themselves to him; secondly, in the circumstance that fewer men\nescape from his violence. The drawback is, that he has to employ a\ngreater number of men. For the oppressed the advantage of it consists in\nthe fact that they are no longer exposed to rough violence but are left\nto themselves; and can always hope to pass from being the oppressed to\nbecoming oppressors in their turn, which by fortunate circumstances they\nsometimes really do. The drawback for them is, that they can never\nescape from participating in the oppression of others.\n\nThis new means of enslaving generally comes into operation together with\nthe old one; and the oppressor lessens the one and increases the other\naccording to his desires. But this does not fully satisfy the man who\nwishes to take away as much as possible of the products of the labour of\nas many working-people as he can find, and to enslave as many men as\npossible; and, therefore, a third means of oppression is evolved.\n\nThis is the slavery of taxation, and, like the second, it is based upon\nhunger; but to the means of subduing men by depriving them of bread is\nadded the deprivation of other necessaries.\n\nThe oppressor requires from the slaves so much of the money he himself\nhas coined, that, in order to obtain it, the slaves are compelled to\nsell not only stores of corn in greater quantity than the fifth part\nwhich was fixed by Joseph, but the first necessaries of life as\nwell,--meat, skins, wool, clothes, firewood, even their buildings; and\ntherefore the oppressor always keeps his slaves in his power, not only\nby hunger, but by thirst, cold and other privations.\n\nAnd thus the third means of slavery comes into operation, a monetary,\ntributary one, consisting in the oppressor saying to the oppressed, "I\ncan do with each of you just what I like; I can kill and destroy you by\ntaking away the land by which you earn your living; I can, with this\nmoney which you must give me, buy all the corn upon which you feed, and\nsell it to strangers, and at any time annihilate you by starvation; I\ncan take from you all that you have,--your cattle, your houses, your\nclothes; but it is neither convenient nor agreeable for me to do so, and\ntherefore I let you alone, to work as you please; only give me so much\nof the money which I demand of you, either as a poll-tax, or according\nto your land or the quantity of your food and drink, or your clothes or\nyour houses. Give me this money, and do what you like among yourselves,\nbut know that I shall neither protect nor maintain widows nor orphans\nnor invalids nor old people, nor such as have been burned out: I shall\nonly protect the regular circulation of this money. This right will\nalways be mine, to protect only those who regularly give me the fixed\nnumber of these pieces of money: as to how or where you get it, I shall\nnot in the least trouble myself." And so the oppressor distributes these\npieces of money as an acknowledgement that his demand has been complied\nwith.\n\nThe second method of enslaving consisted in this, that, having taken\naway the fifth part of the harvest, and collected stores of corn,\nPharaoh, besides the personal slavery by the sword, received, by his\nassistants, the possibility of dominion over the working-people during\nthe time of famine, and over some of them during misfortunes which\nhappen to them.\n\nThe third method consists in this: Pharaoh requires from the\nworking-people more money than the value of the fifth part of corn which\nhe took from them; he and his assistants get a new means of dominion\nover the working-class, not merely during the famine and their casual\nmisfortunes, but permanently.\n\nBy the second method, men retain some stores of corn which help them to\nbear indifferent harvests and casual misfortunes without going into\nslavery; but by the third, when there are more demands, the stores, not\nof corn only but of all other necessaries of life are taken away from\nthem, and at the first misfortune a workman, having neither stores of\ncorn nor any other stores which he might exchange for corn, falls into\nslavery to those who have money.\n\nTo set the first in motion an oppressor need have only soldiers, and\nshare the booty with them; for the second, besides the protectors of the\nland and the stores, he must have collectors and clerks for the\ndistribution of the corn; for the third, besides the soldiers for\nkeeping the land and his property, he must have collectors of taxes,\nassessors of direct taxation, supervisors, custom-house clerks, managers\nof money, and coiners of it.\n\nThe organization of the third method is much more complicated than that\nof the second. By the second, the getting in of corn may be leased out,\nas was done in olden times and is still the custom in Turkey; but by\nputting taxes on men there is need of a complicated administration,\nwhich has to ensure the right levying of the taxes. And therefore by the\nthird method the oppressor has to share the plunder with a still greater\nnumber of men than by the second; besides, according to the very nature\nof the thing, all the men of the same or of the foreign country who\npossess money become sharers with the oppressed.\n\nThe advantage of the third method over the first and second consists\nchiefly in the following fact: that by it there is no need to wait for a\nyear of scarcity, as in the time of Joseph, but years of famine are\nestablished forever, and (whilst by the second method the part of the\nlabour which is taken away depends upon the harvest, and cannot be\naugmented _ad libitum_, because if there is no corn, there is nothing to\ntake) by the new _monetary_ method the requirement can be brought to any\ndesired limit, for the demand for money can always be satisfied, because\nthe debtor, to satisfy it, must sell his cattle, clothes, or houses. The\nchief advantage to the oppressor of this method is that he can take away\nthe greatest quantity of labour in the most convenient way; for a\nmoney-tax, like a screw, may easily and conveniently be turned to the\nutmost limit, and golden eggs be obtained though the bird that lays them\nis all but dead.\n\nAnother of its advantages for the oppressor is that its violence reaches\nall those also who, by possessing no land, formerly escaped from it by\ngiving only a part of their labour for corn; whereas now, besides that\npart which they give for corn, they must now give another part for\ntaxes. A drawback for the oppressor is that he has to share the plunder\nwith a still greater number of men, not only with his direct assistants,\nbut also with all those men of his own country, and even of foreign\ncountries, who may have the money which is demanded from the slaves.\n\nIts advantage for the oppressed is only that he is allowed greater\nindependence than under the second method; he may live where he chooses,\ndo what he likes; he may sow or not sow; he has to give no account of\nhis labour; and if he has money, he may consider himself entirely free,\nand constantly hope, though only for a time, to obtain not only an\nindependent position, but even to become an oppressor himself, when he\nhas money to spare.\n\nThe drawback for the oppressed is, that on a general average their\nsituation becomes much worse, and they are deprived of the greater part\nof the products of their labour, because the number of those who utilize\ntheir labour has increased, and therefore the burden of keeping them\nfalls upon a smaller number of men.\n\nThis third method of enslaving men is also very old, and comes into\noperation with the former two without entirely excluding them.\n\nThese three methods of enslaving men have always been in operation.\n\nThey may all be compared to screws which secure the board laid on the\nwork-people which presses them down. The fundamental, or middle screw,\nwithout which the other screws could not hold, which is first screwed\nup, and which is never slackened, is the screw of personal slavery, the\nenslaving of some men by others under threat of slaughter; the second,\nwhich is screwed up after the first, is that of enslaving men by taking\naway the land and stores of provisions from them, such alienation being\nmaintained by the threat to murder; and the third screw is slavery\nenforced by the requirement of certain money taxes; and this demand is\nalso maintained under threat of murder.\n\nThese three screws are made fast, and it is only when one of them is\ntightened more that the others are slackened. For the complete\nenslavement of the workman, all three are necessary; and in our society,\nall three are in operation together. The first method of personal\nslavery under threat of murder by the sword has never been abolished,\nand never will be so long as there is any oppression, because every kind\nof oppression is based on this alone.\n\nWe are all quite sure that personal slavery is abolished in our\ncivilized world; that the last remnant of it has been annihilated in\nAmerica and in Russia, and that it is only among the barbarians that\nreal slavery exists, and that with us it is no longer in being. We\nforget only one small circumstance,--those hundreds of millions of\nstanding troops without which no state exists, and with the abolition of\nwhich all the economical organization of each state would inevitably\nfall to pieces. Yet what are these millions of soldiers but the personal\nslaves of those who rule them? Are not these men compelled to do the\nwill of their commanders under the threat of torture and death,--a\nthreat often carried out? the difference consisting only in the fact\nthat the submission of these slaves is not called slavery, but\ndiscipline, and that slaves are slaves from their birth, but soldiers\nonly during a more or less short period of their so-called "service."\n\nPersonal slavery, therefore, is not only not abolished in our civilized\nworld, but, under the system of conscription, it has of late years been\nconfirmed; and it has remained as it has always existed, only slightly\nchanged from its original form. And it cannot but exist, because, so\nlong as there is the enslaving of one man by another there will be this\npersonal slavery too, this slavery which, under the threat of the sword,\nmaintains serfdom, land-ownership, and taxes.\n\nIt may be that this slavery of troops is useful, as it is said, for the\ndefence and the glory of the country; but this kind of utility is more\nthan doubtful, because we see how often in the case of unsuccessful wars\nit serves only for the subjugation and shame of the country. But of the\nexpediency of this slavery for maintaining that of the land and taxes\nthere is no question.\n\nIf Irish or Russian peasants were to take possession of the land of the\nproprietors, troops would be sent to dispossess them. If you build a\ndistillery or a brewery and do not pay excise, then soldiers will be\nsent to shut it up. Refuse to pay taxes, and the same thing will happen\nto you.\n\nThe second screw is the method of enslaving men by taking away from them\ntheir land and their stores of provisions. This method has also always\nbeen in existence wherever men are oppressed; and, whatever changes it\nmay undergo, it is everywhere in operation.\n\nSometimes all the land belongs to the sovereign, as in Turkey, and there\none-tenth is given to the state treasury. Sometimes a part of the land\nbelongs to the sovereign, and taxes are raised on it. Sometimes all the\nland belongs to a few people and is let out for labour, as in England.\nSometimes more or less large portions of land belong to the land-owners,\nas in Russia, Germany, and France. But wherever there is enslaving there\nexists also the appropriation of the land by the oppressor, and this\nscrew is slackened or tightened only according to the condition of the\nother screws.\n\nThus, in Russia, when personal slavery was extended to the majority of\nthe working-people there was no need of land-slavery; but the screw of\npersonal slavery was slackened in Russia only when the screws of land\nand tax slavery were tightened. Only when the government had\nappropriated the land and divided it among private individuals, and had\ninstituted money payments and taxation, did it give the peasants\npersonal freedom.\n\nIn England, for instance, land-slavery is pre-eminently in operation,\nand the question about the nationalizing of the land consists only in\nthe screw of taxation being tightened in order that the screw of land\nappropriation may be slackened.\n\nThe third method of enslaving men, by taxes, has also been in operation\nfor ages; and in our days, with the extension of uniform standards of\nmoney and the strengthening of state powers it has become an especially\npowerful influence.\n\nThis method is so developed in our days that it tends to be a substitute\nfor the second method of enslaving,--the land monopoly.\n\nIt is obvious from the state of the political economy of all Europe,\nthat it is by the tightening of this screw that the screw of land\nslavery is slackened.\n\nIn our own lifetime we have witnessed in Russia two transformations of\nslavery. When the serfs were liberated, and their landlords retained the\nright to the greater part of the soil, the landlords were afraid they\nwould lose their power; but experience has shown that having let go the\nwhole chain of personal slavery, they had only to seize another,--that\nof the land. A peasant was short of corn; he had not enough to live on.\nThe landlord had land and stores of corn: and therefore the peasant\nstill remained the same slave.\n\nAnother transformation was caused by the government screw of taxation\nbeing pressed home. The majority of working-people, having no stores,\nwere obliged to sell themselves to their landlords and to the factories.\nThis new form of oppression held the people still tighter, so that\nnine-tenths of the Russian working-people are still working for their\nlandlords and in the factories to pay these taxes. This is so obvious,\nthat, if the government were to remit taxation for one year only, all\nlabour would be stopped in the fields of the landlords, and in the\nfactories. Nine-tenths of the Russian people hire themselves out during\nand before the collection of taxes.\n\nAll these three methods have never ceased to operate, and are still in\noperation, but people are inclined to ignore them or to invent new\nexcuses for them. And, what is most remarkable of all is, that the very\nmeans on which everything is based, that screw which is screwed up\ntighter than all others, which holds everything at the moment in\nquestion, is not noticed so long as it holds. When in the ancient world\nthe entire economical order was upheld by personal slavery, the greatest\nintellects did not notice it. To Plato, as well as to Xenophon, and\nAristotle, and to the Romans, it seemed that it could not be otherwise,\nand that slavery was an unavoidable and natural result of wars, without\nwhich the existence of mankind was inconceivable. Similarly, in the\nMiddle Ages, and till recently, people did not apprehend the meaning of\nland-ownership, on which depended the entire economical organization of\ntheir time.\n\nSo also, at present, no one sees or wants to see, that in our time the\nslavery of the majority of the people depends on taxes collected by the\ngovernment from its own land slaves, taxes collected _by administration\nand the troops_,--by the very same troops which are maintained by these\ntaxes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nNo wonder that the slaves themselves, who have always been enslaved, do\nnot understand their own position, and that this condition in which they\nhave always lived is considered by them to be natural to human life, and\nthat they hail as a relief any change in their form of slavery; no\nwonder that their owners sometimes quite sincerely think they are, in a\nmeasure, freeing the slaves by slacking one screw, though they are\ncompelled to do so by the over-tension of another.\n\nBoth become accustomed to their state; and the slaves, never having\nknown what freedom is, merely seek an alleviation, or only the change of\ntheir condition; the other, the owners, wishing to mask their injustice,\ntry to assign a particular meaning to those new forms of slavery which\nthey enforce in place of the older ones. But it is wonderful how the\nmajority of the critics of the economic conditions of the life of the\npeople fail to see that which forms the basis of the entire economic\nconditions of a people.\n\nOne would think the duty of a true science would be to try to ascertain\nthe connection of the phenomena and general cause of a series of\noccurrences. But the majority of the representatives of modern Political\nEconomy are doing just the reverse of this: they carefully hide the\nconnection and meaning of the phenomena, and avoid answering the most\nsimple and essential questions.\n\nModern Political Economy, like an idle, lazy cart-horse, goes well only\ndown-hill, when it has no collar-work; but as soon as it has anything to\ndraw, it at once refuses, pretending it has to go somewhere aside after\nits own business. When any grave, essential question is put to Political\nEconomy, scientific discussions are started about some other matter\nhaving only in view to divert attention from this subject.\n\nYou ask, "How are we to account for a fact so unnatural, monstrous,\nunreasonable, and not useless only, but harmful, that some men can eat\nor work only according to the will of other men?"\n\nYou are gravely answered, "Because some men must arrange the labour and\nfeeding of others, such is the law of production."\n\nYou ask, "What is this property-right which allows some men to\nappropriate to themselves the land, food, and instruments of labour\nbelonging to others?" You are again gravely answered, "This right is\nbased upon the protection of labour,"--that is, the protection of some\nmen\'s labour is effected by taking possession of the labour of other\nmen.\n\nYou ask, "What is that money which is everywhere coined and stamped by\nthe governments, by the authorities, and which is so exorbitantly\ndemanded from the working-people, and which in the shape of national\ndebts is levied upon the future generations of workingmen? Further, has\nnot this money, demanded from the people in the shape of taxes which are\nraised to the utmost pitch, has not this money any influence on the\neconomic relationships of men,--between the payers and the receivers?"\nAnd you are answered in all seriousness, "Money is an article of\nmerchandise like sugar, or chintz; and it differs from other articles\nonly in the fact that it is more convenient for exchange."\n\nAs for the influence of taxes on the economic conditions of a people, it\nis a different question altogether: the laws of production, exchange,\nand distribution of wealth, are one thing, but taxation is quite\nanother. You ask whether it has any influence on the economic conditions\nof a people that the government can arbitrarily raise or lower prices,\nand, having increased the taxes, can make slaves of all who have no\nland? The pompous answer is, "The laws of production, exchange, and\ndistribution of wealth constitute one science,--Political Economy; and\ntaxes, and, generally speaking, State Economy, come under another\nhead,--the Law of Finance."\n\nYou ask finally, "Is no influence exercised on economic conditions by\nthe circumstance that all the people are in bondage to the government,\nand that this government can arbitrarily ruin them all, can take away\nall the products of their labour, and even carry the men themselves away\nfrom their work into military slavery?" You are answered, "This is\naltogether a different question, belonging to the State Law."\n\nThe majority of the representatives of science discuss quite seriously\nthe laws of the economic life of a people, while all the functions and\nactivities of this life are dependent on the will of the oppressor.\nWhilst they recognize the influence of the oppressor as a natural\ncondition of a nation\'s life, they do just what a critic of the economic\nconditions of the life of the personal slaves of different masters would\ndo, were he to omit to consider the influence exercised on the life of\nthese slaves by the will of that master who compels them to work on this\nor that thing and drives them from one place to another according to his\npleasure, who feeds them or neglects to do so, who kills them or leaves\nthem alive.\n\nA noxious superstition has been long in existence and still survives,--a\nsuperstition which has done more harm to men than the most terrible\nreligious superstitions.\n\nAnd so-called science supports this superstition with all its power, and\nwith the utmost zeal. This superstition exactly resembles religious\nsuperstitions. It consists in affirming that, besides the duties of man\nto man, there are still more important duties towards an imaginary\nbeing,--which the theologians call God, and the political scientists the\nState.\n\nThe religious superstition consists in affirming that sacrifices, even\nof human lives, must be offered to this imaginary being, and that they\ncan and ought to be enforced by every means, even by violence. The\npolitical superstition consists in the belief that, besides the duties\nof man to man, there are still more important duties to an imaginary\nbeing, the State; and the offerings,--often of human lives,--brought to\nthis imaginary being are also essential, and can and ought to be\nenforced by every means, even by violence.\n\nThis superstition it is, formerly encouraged by the priests of different\nreligions, which is now sustained by so-called science.\n\nMen are thrown into slavery, into the most terrible slavery, worse than\nhas ever before existed; but Political Science tries to persuade men\nthat it is necessary and unavoidable.\n\nThe state must exist for the welfare of the people, and it must do its\nduty, to rule and protect them from their enemies. For this purpose the\nstate needs money and troops. Money must be subscribed by all the\ncitizens of the state. And hence all the relations of men must be\nconsidered in the light of the existence of the state.\n\n"I want to help my father by my labour," says a common unlearned man. "I\nwant also to marry; but instead, I am taken and sent to Kazan, to be a\nsoldier for six years. I leave the military service, I want to plough\nthe ground to earn food and drink for my family; but I am not allowed to\nplough for a hundred versts around me unless I pay money, which I have\nnot got, and pay it to those men who do not know how to plough, and who\ndemand for the land so much money that I must give them all my labour to\nprocure it: however, I still manage to save something, and wish to give\nthis to my children; but a police official comes and takes from me all I\nhad saved, for taxes: I can earn a little more, and again I am deprived\nof it. My entire economic activity is at the mercy of state demands; and\nit seems to me that my position and that of my brethren, will certainly\nimprove if we are liberated from the demands of the state."\n\nBut he is told, "Such reasoning is the result of your ignorance. Study\nthe laws of production, exchange, and distribution of wealth, and do not\nmix up economical questions with those of the state. The phenomena which\nyou point to are no restraints on your freedom; they are the necessary\nsacrifices which you, along with others, must make for your own freedom\nand welfare."\n\n"But my son has been taken away from me," says again a common man; "and\nthey threaten to take away all my sons as soon as they are grown up:\nthey took him away by force, and drove him to face the enemy\'s guns in\nsome country which we have never heard of, and for an object which we\ncannot understand.\n\n"And as for the land which they will not allow us to plough, and for\nwant of which we are starving, it belongs to a man who got possession of\nit by force, and whom we have never seen, and whose usefulness we cannot\neven understand. And the taxes, to collect which the police official has\nby force taken my cow from my children, will, so far as I know, go to\nthis same man who took my cow away, and to various members of the\ncommittees and of departments which I do not know of, and in the utility\nof which I do not believe. How is it, then, that all these acts of\nviolence secure my liberty, and all this evil procures good?"\n\nYou may compel a man to be a slave and to do that which he considers to\nbe evil for himself, but you cannot compel him to think, that, in\nsuffering violence, he is free, and that the obvious evil which he\nendures constitutes his good. This appears impossible. Yet by the help\nof science this very thing has been done in our time.\n\nThe state, that is, the armed oppressors, decide what they want from\nthose whom they oppress (as in the case of England and the\nFiji-Islanders): they decide how much labour they want from their\nslaves,--they decide how many assistants they will need in collecting\nthe fruits of this labour; they organize their assistants in the shape\nof soldiers, land-owners, and collectors of taxes. And the slaves give\ntheir labour, and, at the same time, believe that they give it, not\nbecause their masters demand it, but for the sake of their own freedom\nand welfare; and that this service and these bloody sacrifices to the\ndivinity called the State are necessary, and that, except this service\nto their Deity, they are free. They believe this because the same had\nbeen formerly said in the name of religion by the priests, and is now\nsaid in the name of so-called science, by learned men.\n\nBut one need only cease to believe what is said by these other men who\ncall themselves priests or learned men, for the absurdity of such an\nassertion to become obvious.\n\nThe men who oppress others assure them that this oppression is necessary\nfor the state,--and the state is necessary for the freedom and welfare\nof men; so that it appears that the oppressors oppress men for the sake\nof their freedom, and do them evil for the sake of good.\n\nBut men are furnished with reason so that they may understand wherein\nconsists their own good, and do it willingly.\n\nAs for the acts, the goodness of which is not intelligible to men, and\nto which they are compelled by force, these cannot be for their good,\nbecause a reasoning being can consider as good only the thing which\nappears so to his reason. If men are driven to evil through passion or\nfolly, all that those who are not so driven can do is to persuade the\nothers into what constitutes their real good. You may try to persuade\nmen that their welfare will be greater when they are all soldiers, are\ndeprived of land, and have given their entire labour away for taxes; but\nuntil all men consider this condition to be welfare, and undertake it\nwillingly, one cannot call such a state of things the common welfare of\nmen.\n\nThe sole criterion of a good conception is its willing acceptance by\nmen. And the lives of men abound with such acts. Ten workmen buy tools\nin common, in order to work together with them, and in so doing they are\nundoubtedly benefitting themselves; but we cannot suppose that if these\nten workmen were to compel an eleventh, by force, to join in their\nassociation, they would insist that their common welfare will be the\nsame for him.\n\nSo with gentlemen who agree to give a subscription dinner at a pound a\nhead to a mutual friend; no one can assert that such a dinner will\nbenefit a man who, against his will, has been obliged to pay a sovereign\nfor it. And so with peasants who decide, for their common convenience,\nto dig a pond. To those who consider the existence of a pond more\nvaluable than the labour spent on it, digging it will be a common good.\nBut to the one who considers the pond of less value than a day\'s\nharvesting in which he is behind-hand, digging it will appear evil. The\nsame holds good with roads, churches, and museums, and with all various\nsocial and state affairs.\n\nAll such work may be good for those who consider it good, and who\ntherefore freely and willingly perform it,--the dinner which the\ngentlemen give, the pond which the peasants dig. But work to which men\nmust be driven by force ceases to be a common good precisely by the fact\nof such violence.\n\nAll this is so plain and simple, that, if men had not been so long\ndeceived, there would be no need to explain it.\n\nSuppose we live in a village where all the inhabitants have agreed to\nbuild a road over a swamp which is a danger to them. We agree together,\nand each house promises to give so much money or wood or days of labour.\nWe agree to this because the making of the road is more advantageous to\nus than what we exchange for it; but among us there are some for whom it\nis more advantageous to do without a road than to spend money on it, or\nwho at all events think so. Can compelling these men to labour make it\nof advantage to them? Obviously not; because those who considered that\ntheir choosing to join in making the way would have been\ndisadvantageous, will consider it _a fortiori_ still more\ndisadvantageous when they are _compelled_ to do so. Suppose, even, that\nwe all, without exception, were agreed, and promised so much money or\nlabour from each house, but that it happened that some of those who had\npromised did not give what they agreed, their circumstances having\nmeanwhile changed, so that it was more advantageous for such now to be\nwithout the road than to spend money on it; or that they have simply\nchanged their mind about it; or even calculate that others will make the\nroad without them and that they will then use it. Can coercing these men\nto join in the labour make them consider that the sacrifices are\nenforced for their own good?\n\nObviously not; because, if these men have not fulfilled what they\npromised, owing to a change in circumstances, so that now the sacrifices\nfor the sake of the road outbalance their gain by it, the compulsory\nsacrifices of such would be only a worse evil. But if those who refuse\nto join in building the road intend to utilize the labour of the others,\nthen in this case also coercing them into making a sacrifice would be\nonly a punishment on a supposition, and their object, which nobody can\nprove, will be punished before it is made apparent; but in neither case\ncan coercing them to join in a work which they do not desire be good for\nthem.\n\nIf this is so with sacrifices for a work which every one can comprehend,\nobvious, and undoubtedly useful to everyone, such as a road over a\nswamp; how still more unjust and unreasonable is it to coerce millions\nof men into making sacrifices for objects which are incomprehensible,\nimperceptible, and often undoubtedly harmful, such as military service\nand taxation.\n\nBut, according to science, what appears to every one to be an evil is a\ncommon good: it appears that there are men, a small minority, who alone\nknow of what the common good consists, and, notwithstanding the fact\nthat all other men consider this good to be an evil, this minority can\ncompel the others to do whatever they may consider to be for the common\ngood. And it is this belief which constitutes the chief superstition and\nthe chief deceit and hinders the progress of mankind towards the True\nand the Good.\n\nTo nurse this superstitious deceit has been the object of political\nsciences in general, and of so-called "Political Economy" in particular.\n\nMany are making use of its aims in order to hide from men the state of\noppression and slavery in which they now are.\n\nThe way they set about doing so is by starting the theory that the\nviolence connected with the economy of social slavery is a natural and\nunavoidable evil; and men thereby are deceived and turn their eyes from\nthe real causes of their misfortunes.\n\nSlavery has long been abolished. It has been abolished in Rome as well\nas in America, and in Russia; but only the word has been abolished,--not\nthe evil.\n\nSlavery is the violent freeing of some men from the labour necessary for\nsatisfying their wants, which transfers this labour to others; and\nwherever there is a man who does not work, not because others willingly\nand lovingly work for him, but because he has the possibility, while not\nworking himself, to make others work for him, there slavery exists.\n\nWherever there are, as in all European societies, men who utilize the\nlabour of thousands of others by coercion, and consider such to be their\nright, and others who submit to this coercion considering it to be their\nduty,--there you have slavery in its most dreadful proportions.\n\nSlavery exists. In what, then, does it consist? Slavery consists of that\nof which it has always consisted, and without which it cannot exist at\nall,--in the coercion of a weak and unarmed man by a strong and armed\nman.\n\nSlavery in its three fundamental modes of operation,--personal violence,\nthe military, land-taxes,--maintained by the military, and direct and\nindirect taxes put upon all the inhabitants, is still in operation now\nas it has been before.\n\nWe do not see it because each of these three forms of slavery has\nreceived a new justification, which hides its meaning from us.\n\nThe personal violence of armed over unarmed men has been justified as\nthe defence of one\'s country from imaginary enemies,--while in its\nessence it has the one old meaning, the submission of the conquered to\nthe oppressors.\n\nThe violent seizure of the labourers\' land has been justified as the\nrecompense for services rendered to an imaginary common welfare, and\nconfirmed by the right of heritage; but in reality it is the same\ndispossession of men from their land and enslaving them which was\nperformed by the troops.\n\nAnd the last, the monetary violence by means of taxes, the strongest and\nmost effective in our days, has received a most wonderful justification.\n\nDispossessing men of their liberty and their goods is said to be done\nfor the sake of the common liberty and of the common welfare. But in\nfact it is the same slavery, only an impersonal one.\n\nWherever violence becomes law, there is slavery.\n\nWhether violence finds its expression in the circumstance that princes\nwith their courtiers come, kill, and burn down villages; whether\nslave-owners take labour or money for the land from their slaves, and\nenforce payment by means of armed men, or by putting taxes on others,\nand riding armed to and fro in the villages; or whether a Home\nDepartment collects money through governors or police sergeants,--in one\nword, as long as violence is maintained by the bayonet,--there will be\nno distribution of wealth, but it will be accumulated among the\noppressors.\n\nAs a striking illustration of the truth of this assertion the project of\nHenry George to nationalize the land may serve us. Henry George proposes\nto declare all land the property of the state, and to substitute a\nland-rent for all taxes, direct and indirect. That is, everyone who\nutilizes the land would have to pay to the state the value of its rent.\n\nWhat would be the result? The land would belong to the state,--English\nland to England, American land to America, and so on; that is, there\nwould be slavery, determined by the quantity of cultivated land. It\nmight be that the condition of some labourers would improve; but while a\nforcible demand for rent remained, the slavery would remain too. The\ncultivator, after a bad harvest, being unable to pay the rent exacted of\nhim by force, would be obliged to enslave himself to any one who\nhappened to have the money in order not to lose everything and to retain\nthe land.\n\nIf a pail leaks, there must be a hole. Looking at the pail, we might\nimagine the water runs from many holes; but no matter how we might try\nto stop the imaginary holes from without, the water would not cease\nrunning. In order to put a stop to the leakage we must find the place\nfrom which water runs, and stop it from the inside.\n\nThe same holds good with the proposed means of stopping the irregular\ndistribution of wealth,--the holes through which the wealth runs away\nfrom the people.\n\nIt is said, _Organize workmen\'s corporations, make capital social\nproperty, make land social property_. All this is only mere stopping\nfrom the outside those holes from which we fancy the water runs. In\norder to stop the wealth going from the hands of the workers to those of\nthe non-workers, it is necessary to try to find from the inside the hole\nthrough which this leakage takes place. And this hole is the violence of\narmed men towards unarmed men, the violence of troops, by means of which\nmen are carried away from their labour, and the land, and the products\nof labour, taken from them.\n\nSo long as there is one armed man, whoever he may be, with the\nacknowledged right to kill another man, so long will there also exist an\nunjust distribution of wealth,--in other words, slavery.\n\nI was led into the error that I can help others by the fact that I\nimagined my money was as good as Semion\'s. But it was not so.\n\nThe general opinion is that money represents wealth; that wealth is the\nresult of work and therefore that money represents work. This opinion is\nas just as the opinion asserting that every form of state is the result\nof a contract (contrat social).\n\nAll men like to believe that money is only a means of exchange of\nlabour. I have made boots, you have made bread, he has fed sheep; now,\nin order to exchange our wares the more conveniently, we introduce\nmoney, which represents the corresponding share of labour, and through\nit we exchange leather soles for a mutton brisket and ten pounds of\nflour.\n\nBy means of money we exchange our products and this money, belonging to\neach of us, represents our labour. This is perfectly true, but true only\nwhile in the community, where this exchange takes place, violence of one\nman towards another did not appear, violence not only over another man\'s\nlabour, as happens in war and in slavery, but not even violence applied\nto defend the products of labour of one man against another. This could\nbe only in a community whose members entirely fulfil the Christian\nlaw,--in a community where one gets what he demands and where one is not\nrequested to return what he gets. But as soon as violence in any form is\napplied in the community, the meaning of money for its owner at once\nloses its significance as a representative of labour, and acquires the\nsignificance of a right, based not on labour, but on violence.\n\nAs soon as there is war and one man has taken away something from\nanother, then money cannot always represent labour; the money received\nby the soldier for the booty he has sold, as well as the money got by\nhis superior, is by no means the produce of their work and has quite a\ndifferent meaning from the money received for the labour resulting in\nboots. When there are slave-owners and slaves, as have been always in\nthe world, then one cannot assert that money represents labour. The\nwomen have woven a quantity of linen, have sold it and received money;\nthe serfs have woven some linen for their master, and the master has\nsold it and received money. The one and the other money are the same;\nbut one is the product of labour and the other is the product of\nviolence. Likewise, if somebody,--say my father,--made me a present of\nmoney and he, when giving it to me, knew, and I knew and everybody knew,\nthat no one can take this money away from me, that if anybody tried to\ntake it, or even merely failed to return it at the date promised, then\nthe authorities would defend me and by force compel the man to return me\nthis money,--then again it is evident that by no means can this money be\ncalled a representative of labour, like the money which Semion got for\ncutting wood.\n\nThus in a community, where by some kind of violence somebody\'s money is\ntaken possession of, or the ownership of somebody\'s money defended\nagainst others--there money cannot always represent labour. It\nrepresents in such a community sometimes labour, sometimes violence.\n\nSo it would be if only one fact of violence of one man over another\nappeared in the midst of perfectly free relations; but now, when the\naccumulated money has passed through centuries of most various forms of\nviolence, when these acts of violence continue under other forms; when\nmoney itself by its accumulation creates violence,--which is recognized\nby everybody,--when the direct products of labour constitute only a\nsmall part of money made up of all sorts of violence,--to assert now\nthat money represents the work of its owner is an obvious error, or an\nopen lie. One may say it ought to be so, one may say it is desirable\nthat it should be so, but by no means can any one say that it is so.\n\nMoney represents labour. Yes; money represents labour, but whose labour?\nIn our society it is only in the rarest cases that money represents the\nwork of its owner. Almost always it represents the labour of other\nmen,--the past or future labours of men. It is the representative of a\nclaim on the labour of other men by force of violence.\n\nMoney, in its most exact and at the same time its simplest definition,\nrepresents conventional signs, which bestow the right,--or rather the\npossibility,--to use the work of other men. In its ideal meaning, money\nought to give this right or possibility only when it serves itself as a\nrepresentative of labour, and as such, money could exist in a society\ndevoid of any kind of violence. But as soon as violence takes place in a\nsociety, i.e., the possibility of the utilizing of the labour of others\nby the idler,--then this possibility of using the labour of others,\nwithout defining persons over which this violence is committed, is also\nexercised in money.\n\nThe landowner taxed his serfs by a contribution in kind, making them\nbring a certain quantity of linen, corn, cattle, or a corresponding\namount of money. One household delivered the cattle, but the linens were\nreplaced by money. The landowner accepts the money in a certain\nquantity, only because he knows that for this money he can get the same\npieces of linen (generally he takes a little more money to be sure that\nhe will receive for it the same quantity of linen), and this money\nevidently offers for the landowner lien on other men\'s labour.\n\nThe peasant gives money as a security against persons unknown but\nnumerous, who would undertake to work out so much linen for this money.\nThose who will undertake to work the linen will do it because they did\nnot succeed in feeding the sheep, and for these they must pay in money;\nand the peasant who will get the money for the sheep will take it, only\nbecause he must pay for the corn, which was a failure that year. The\nsame goes on in the State and all over the world.\n\nA man sells the produce of his past, present or future labour, sometimes\nhis food-stuff, not mostly because money is a convenient exchange for\nhim,--he would exchange without money,--but because he is required by\nmeans of violence to give money, as a security on his work.\n\nWhen Pharaoh has demanded the labour of his slaves, then the slaves have\ngiven him all their labour, but they could give only the past and\npresent labour, and could not give that of the future. But with the\nspread of money tokens and their result of "credit" it becomes possible\nto give also one\'s future work for money.\n\nMoney, with the existence of violence in society, offers the means for a\nnew form of impersonal slavery, which replaces the personal one. A\nslave-owner claims a right to the work of Peter, Iv\xc3\xa1n, Sidor. But\nwherever money is required from everybody, the owner of money acquires a\nclaim on the labour of all those unknown people who are in need of\nmoney. Money removes the painful side of slavery, by which the owner\nknows about his right on Iv\xc3\xa1n, at the same time it removes all those\nhuman relations between the owner and the slave, which softened down the\nburden of personal slavery.\n\nI will not dwell on the theory that perhaps such a state is necessary\nfor the development of mankind, for its progress and so forth--I will\nnot dispute it. I only strive to make clear to myself the conception of\nmoney and to discover the general misconception I have made in accepting\nmoney, as a representative of labour. I became convinced by experience\nthat money is not a representative of labour, but in the great majority\nof cases is a representative of violence, or of specially complex\nartifices founded on violence.\n\nMoney in our time has already altogether lost the desirable significance\nof being the representative of labour; such significance it may have in\nexceptional cases, but as a rule it has become the right or the\npossibility of using the labour of others.\n\nThis spreading of money, of credit and different conventional signs,\nmore and more confirm this meaning of money. Money is the possibility or\nthe right to use the labours of others.\n\nMoney is a new form of slavery differing from the old form of slavery\nonly by its impersonality, by the freedom it gives from all human\nrelations to the slave.\n\nMoney is money, a value always equal to itself, and which is always\nconsidered quite correct and lawful, and the use of which is not\nconsidered immoral, as slavery was.\n\nIn my young days a game of lotto was introduced in the clubs. All\neagerly played the game and, as was said, many lost their fortunes,\nruined their families, lost money entrusted to them, and government\nfunds, and finally shot themselves, so that the game was forbidden and\nis still forbidden.\n\nI remember I have met old, hardened card players who told me that this\ngame was especially fascinating, because one did not know whom one was\nto beat, as is the case in other games; the attendant does not even\nserve one with money, but with counters, everybody loses a small stake\nand does not betray grief. It is the same in roulette, which is rightly\nforbidden everywhere.\n\nSo it is with money. I have a magical, everlasting ruble; I cut off\ncoupons and live apart from all the affairs of the world. Whom do I\nharm? I am the most quiet and kind-hearted man. But this is only a game\nof lotto or roulette where I do not see the man, who shoots himself\nafter having lost, and who provides for me these small coupons, which I\ncarefully cut off under the right angle from the tickets.\n\nI have done nothing, I am doing nothing, and never will do anything,\nsave cut off the coupons, and firmly believe that money represents\nlabour. This is really astounding! And people talk of lunatics! But what\nmania could be more horrible than this? An intelligent, learned, and in\nall other respects sensible man lives madly, and soothes himself by not\nacknowledging that one thing which he should acknowledge to make his\nargument reasonable, and he considers himself in the right! The coupons\nare representatives of labour! Of labour! Yes, but of whose labour? Not\nof his, who owns them, evidently, but of the one who works.\n\nMoney is the same as slavery; its aim is the same and its consequences\nare the same. Its aim is the freeing of some men from the original law,\ntruly called so by a thoughtful writer of the working-classes, from the\nnatural law of life, as we call it, from the law of personal labour for\nthe satisfaction of one\'s needs. The consequences of the slavery for the\nowner: the begetting, the invention of infinitely more and more needs\nnever to be satisfied, of effeminate wretchedness and of depravity, and\nfor the slaves,--oppression of the man, and his lowering to the level of\na beast.\n\nMoney is a new and terrible form of slavery and, like the old form of\npersonal slavery, it equally demoralises the slave and the slave-owner,\nbut it is so much worse, because it frees the slave and the slave-owner\nfrom personal human relations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nI always wonder at the often repeated words, "Yes, it is all true in\ntheory, but how is it in practice?" As though the theory were only a\ncollection of words useful for conversation, and not as though all\npractice,--that is, all activity of life--were inevitably based upon it.\n\nThere must have been an immense number of foolish theories in the world\nfor men to employ such wonderful reasoning. We know that theory is what\na man thinks about a thing, and practice is what he does. How can a man\nthink that he ought to act in one way, and then do quite the reverse? If\nthe theory of baking bread consists in this, that first of all one must\nknead the dough, then put it by to rise, anyone knowing it would be a\nfool to do the reverse. But with us it has come into fashion to say, "It\nis all very well in theory, but how would it be in practice?"\n\nIn all that has occupied me practice has unavoidably followed theory,\nnot mainly in order to justify it, but because it could not help doing\nso: if I have understood the affair upon which I have meditated I cannot\nhelp doing it in the way in which I have understood it.\n\nI wished to help the needy only because I had money to spare: and I\nshared the general superstition that money represents labour, and,\ngenerally speaking, is something lawful and good in itself. But, having\nbegun to give this money away, I saw that I was only drawing bills of\nexchange collected from poor people; that I was doing the very thing the\nold landlords used to do in compelling some of their serfs to work for\nother serfs.\n\nI saw that every use of money, whether buying anything with it, or\ngiving it away gratis, is a drawing of bills of exchange on poor people,\nor passing them to others to be drawn by them. And therefore I clearly\nunderstood the foolishness of what I was doing in helping the poor by\nexacting money from them.\n\nI saw that money in itself was not only not a good thing, but obviously\nan evil one, depriving men of their chief good, labour, and that this\nvery good I cannot give to anyone because I am myself deprived of it: I\nhave neither labour nor the happiness of utilizing my labour.\n\nIt might be asked by some, "What is there so peculiarly important in\nabstractly discussing the meaning of money?" But this argument which I\nhave opened is not merely for the sake of discussion, but in order to\nfind an answer to the vital question which had caused me so much\nsuffering, and on which my life depended, in order to discover what I\nwas to do.\n\nAs soon as I understood what wealth means, what money means, then it\nbecame clear and certain what I have to do, it became clear and certain\nwhat all others have to do,--and that they will inevitably do it, what\nall men must do. In reality I merely came to realize what I have long\nknown,--that truth which has been transmitted to men from the oldest\ntimes, by Buddha, by Isaiah, by Laotse, by Socrates, and most clearly\nand definitely by Jesus and his predecessor John the Baptist.\n\nJohn the Baptist, in answer to men\'s question "What shall we do then?"\nanswered plainly and briefly, "He that hath two coats, let him impart to\nhim that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise"\n(Luke\xc2\xa0iii., 10, 11).\n\nThe same thing, and with still greater clearness, said Jesus,--blessing\nthe poor, and uttering woes on the rich. He said that no man can serve\nGod and mammon. He forbade his disciples not only to take money, but\nalso to have two coats. He said to the rich young man that he could not\nenter into the kingdom of God because he was rich, and that it is easier\nfor a camel to go through the needle\'s eye than for a rich man to enter\nthe kingdom of God.\n\nHe said that he who would not leave every thing--his houses and children\nand his fields--in order to follow him, was not his disciple. He spoke a\nparable about a rich man who had done nothing wrong (like our own rich\npeople), but merely dressed well and ate and drank well, yet by this\nlost his own soul; and about a beggar named Lazarus, who had done\nnothing good, but who had saved his soul by his beggar\'s life.\n\nThis truth had long been known to me; but the false teaching of the\nworld had so cunningly hidden it that it became a theory in the sense\nwhich men like to attach to this word,--that is, a pure abstraction. But\nas soon as I succeeded in pulling down in my consciousness the sophistry\nof the world\'s teaching, then theory became one with practice and the\nreality of my life and the life of all men became its unavoidable\nresult.\n\nI came to understand that man, besides living for his own good, must\nwork for the good of others; and that if we were to draw our comparison\nfrom the world of animals, as some men are so fond of doing in\njustifying violence and contest by the law of the struggle for\nexistence, we must take this comparison from the lives of social animals\nlike bees; and therefore man, to say nothing of that love to his\nneighbours which is incumbent on him, is called upon to serve his\nfellows and their common object, as much by reason as by his very\nnature.\n\nI understood that this is the natural law of man, by fulfilling which he\ncan alone fulfil his calling and therefore be happy. I understood that\nthis law has been and is being violated by the fact that men (as\nrobber-bees do) free themselves from labour by violence, and utilize the\nlabour of others, using this labour not for the common purpose but for\nthe personal satisfaction of their constantly increasing lusts, and\nalso, like robber-bees, they perish thereby. I understood that the\nmisfortune of men comes from the slavery in which some men are kept by\nothers; and I understood that this slavery is brought about in our days\nby military force, violence, by the appropriation of land, and by the\nexaction of money.\n\nAnd, having understood the meaning of all these three instruments of\nmodern slavery, I could not help desiring to free myself from any share\nin it.\n\nWhen I was a landlord, possessing serfs, and came to understand the\nimmorality of such a position, I, along with other men who had\nunderstood the same thing, tried to free myself from it. And I freed\nmyself from this state thus. Finding it immoral, but not being able as\nyet to free myself wholly from it, I tried meanwhile to assert my rights\nas a serf-owner as little as possible.\n\nI cannot help doing the same now with reference to the present\nslavery--that is, I try as little as possible to assert my claims while\nI am unable to free myself from the power which gives me land-ownership,\nand from money raised by the violence of military force--and at the same\ntime by all means in my power to suggest to other men the unlawfulness\nand inhumanity of these imaginary rights.\n\nThe share in enslaving men consists, on the standpoint of a slave-owner,\nin utilizing the labour of others. (It is all the same whether the\nenslaving is based on a claim to the person of the slave or on the\npossession of land or money.) And, therefore, if a man really does not\nlike slavery and does not desire to be a partaker in it, the first thing\nwhich he must do is this: neither take men\'s labour by serving the\ngovernment, nor possess land or money.\n\nThe refusal of all the means in use for taking another\'s labour will\nunavoidably bring such a man to the necessity of lessening his wants on\nthe one hand, and, on the other, of doing himself what formerly was done\nfor him by other men. This simple and unavoidable conclusion enters into\nevery detail of my life, changes it entirely, and at once sets me free\nfrom the moral sufferings I had endured at the sight of the misery and\nwickedness of men.\n\nThe first cause was the accumulation of people in towns, and the\nabsorption there of the products of the country.\n\nAll that a man needs is not to desire to take another\'s labour by\nserving the government and possessing land and money, and then,\naccording to his strength and ability, to satisfy unaided his own wants.\nThe idea of leaving his village would never enter the mind of such a\nman, because in the country it is easier for him to satisfy his wants\npersonally, while in a town everything is the product of the labour of\nothers, all must be bought; in the country a man will always be able to\nhelp the needy, and will not experience that feeling of being useless,\nwhich I felt in the town when I wanted to help men, not with my own, but\nwith other men\'s labours.\n\nThe second cause was the estrangement between the poor and the rich. A\nman need only not desire to profit by other men\'s labour by serving the\ngovernment and possessing land and money, and he would be compelled to\nsatisfy his wants himself, and at once involuntarily that barrier would\nbe pushed down which separates him from the working-people, and he would\nbe one with the people, standing shoulder to shoulder with them, and\nseeing the possibility of helping them.\n\nThe third cause was shame, based on the consciousness of the immorality\nof possessing money with which I wanted to help others. A man need only\nnot desire to profit by another man\'s labour by serving the government\nand possessing land and money, and he will never have that superfluous\n"fool\'s money," the fact of possessing which made those who wanted money\nask me for pecuniary assistance which I was not able to satisfy, and\ncalled forth in me the consciousness of my unrighteousness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nI saw that the cause of the sufferings and depravity of men lies in the\nfact that some men are in bondage to others; and therefore I came to the\nobvious conclusion that if I want to help men I have first of all to\nleave off causing those very misfortunes which I want to remedy,--in\nother words, I must not share in the enslaving of men.\n\nI was led to the enslaving of men by the circumstance that from my\ninfancy I had been accustomed not to work, but to profit by the labour\nof others, and that I had been living in a society which is not only\naccustomed to this slavery but which justifies it by all kinds of\nsophistry, clever and foolish.\n\nI came to the following simple conclusion, that, in order to avoid\ncausing the sufferings and depravity of men, I ought to make other men\nwork for me as little as possible and to work myself as much as\npossible.\n\nIt was by this roundabout way that I arrived at the inevitable\nconclusion to which the Chinese arrived some thousand years ago, and\nwhich they express thus: "If there is one idle man, there must be\nanother who is starving."\n\nI came to this simple and natural conclusion, that if I pity the\nexhausted horse on whose back I ride the first thing for me to do if I\nreally pity him is to get off his back and walk. This answer, which\ngives such complete satisfaction to the moral sense, had always been\nbefore my eyes, as it is before the eyes of every one, but we do not all\nsee it, and look aside.\n\nIn seeking to heal our social diseases we look everywhere,--to the\ngovernmental, anti-governmental, scientific, and philanthropic\nsuperstitions,--and yet we do not see that which meets the eyes of every\none. We fill our drains with filth and require other men to clean them,\nand pretend to be very sorry for them and want to ease their work; and\nwe invent all sorts of devices except one, the simplest; namely, that we\nshould ourselves remove our slops so long as we find it necessary to\nproduce them in our rooms.\n\nFor him who really suffers from the sufferings of the other men\nsurrounding him, there exists a most clear, simple, and easy means, the\nonly one sufficient to heal this evil and to confer a sense of the\nlawfulness of one\'s life. This means is that which John the Baptist\nrecommended when he answered the question, "What shall we do then?" and\nwhich was confirmed by Christ: not to have more than one coat, and not\nto possess money,--that is, not to profit by another man\'s labour. And\nin order not to profit by another\'s labour, we must do with our own\nhands all that we can do. This is so plain and simple! But it is plain\nand simple and clear only when our wants are also plain, and when we\nourselves are still sound and not corrupted to the backbone by idleness\nand laziness.\n\nI live in a village, lie by the stove, and tell my neighbour, who is my\ndebtor, to chop wood and light the stove. It is obvious that I am lazy\nand take my neighbour away from his own work; and at last I feel ashamed\nof it; and besides, it grows dull for me to be always lying down when my\nmuscles are strong and accustomed to work,--and I go to chop the wood\nmyself.\n\nBut slavery of all kinds has been going on so long, so many artificial\nwants have grown about it, so many people with different degrees of\nfamiliarity with these wants are interwoven with one another, through so\nmany generations men have been spoiled and made effeminate, such\ncomplicated temptations and justifications of luxury and idleness have\nbeen invented by men, that for one who stands on the top of the pyramid\nof idle men, it is not at all so easy to understand his sin as it is for\nthe peasant who compels his neighbour to light his stove.\n\nMen who stand at the top find it most difficult to understand what is\nrequired of them. From the height of the structure of lies on which they\nstand they become giddy when they look at that spot on the earth to\nwhich they must descend in order to begin to live, not righteously, but\nonly not quite inhumanly; and that is why this plain and clear truth\nappears to these men so strange.\n\nA man who employs ten servants in livery, coachmen and cooks, who has\npictures and pianos, must certainly regard as strange and even\nridiculous the simple preliminary duty of, I do not say a good man, but\nof every man who is not an animal, to hew that wood with which his food\nis cooked and by which he is warmed; to clean those boots in which he\ncarelessly stepped into the mud; to bring that water with which he keeps\nhimself clean; and to carry away those slops in which he has washed\nhimself.\n\nBut besides the estrangement of men from the truth, there is another\ncause which hinders them from seeing the duty of doing the most simple\nand natural physical work; that is the complication and intermingling of\nthe conditions in which a rich man lives.\n\nThis morning I entered the corridor in which the stoves are heated. A\npeasant was heating the stove which warmed my son\'s room. I entered his\nbedroom: he was asleep, and it was eleven o\'clock in the morning. The\nexcuse was, "To-day is a holiday; no lessons." A stout lad of eighteen\nyears of age, having over-eaten himself the previous night, is sleeping\nuntil eleven o\'clock; and a peasant of his own age, who had already that\nmorning done a quantity of work, was now lighting the tenth stove. "It\nwould be better, perhaps, if the peasant did not light the stove to warm\nthis stout, lazy fellow!" thought I; but I remembered at once that this\nstove also warmed the room of our housekeeper, a woman of forty years of\nage, who had been working the night before till three o\'clock in the\nmorning to prepare everything for the supper which my son ate; and then\nshe put away the dishes, and, notwithstanding this, got up at seven. She\ncannot heat the stove herself: she has no time for that. The peasant is\nheating the stove for her, too. And under her name my lazy fellow was\nbeing warmed.\n\nTrue, the advantages are all interwoven; but without much consideration\nthe conscience of each will say, On whose side is the labour, and on\nwhose the idleness? But not only does conscience tell this, the\naccount-book also tells it: the more money one spends, the more people\nwork for us. The less one spends, the more one works one\'s self. "My\nluxurious life gives means of living to others. Where should my old\nfootman go, if I were to discharge him?" "What! every one must do\neverything for himself? Make his coat as well as hew his wood? And how\nabout division of labour? And industry and social undertakings?" And,\nlast of all, come the most horrible of words,--civilization, science,\nart!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nLast March I was returning home late in the evening. On turning into a\nbye-lane I perceived on the snow in a distant field some black shadows.\nI should not have noticed this but for the policeman who stood at the\nend of the lane and cried in the direction of the shadows, "Vasili, why\ndon\'t you come along?"\n\n"She won\'t move," answered a voice; and thereupon the shadows came\ntowards the policeman. I stopped and asked him,--\n\n"What is the matter?"\n\nHe said, "We have got some girls from Rzhanoff\'s house, and are taking\nthem to the police-station; and one of them lags behind, and won\'t come\nalong."\n\nA night-watchman in sheepskin coat appeared now driving on a girl who\nslouched along while he prodded her from behind. I, the watchman and the\npoliceman, were wearing winter coats: she alone had none, having only\nher gown on. In the dark I could distinguish only a brown dress and a\nkerchief round her head and neck. She was short, like most starvelings,\nand had a broad, clumsy figure.\n\n"We aren\'t going to stay here all night for you, you hag! Get on, or\nI\'ll give it you!" shouted the policeman. He was evidently fatigued and\ntired of her. She walked some paces and stopped again.\n\nThe old watchman, a good-natured man (I knew him), pulled her by the\nhand. "I\'ll wake you up! come along!" said he, pretending to be angry.\nShe staggered, and began to speak with a croaking hoarse voice, "Let me\nbe; don\'t you push. I\'ll get on myself."\n\n"You\'ll be frozen to death," he returned.\n\n"A girl like me won\'t be frozen: I\'ve lots of hot blood."\n\nShe meant it as a joke, but her words sounded like a curse. By a lamp,\nwhich stood not far from the gate of my house, she stopped again, leaned\nback against the paling, and began to seek for something among her\npetticoats with awkward, frozen hands. They again shouted to her; but\nshe only muttered and continued searching. She held in one hand a\ncrumpled cigarette and matches in the other. I remained behind her: I\nwas ashamed to pass by or to stay and look at her. But I made up my mind\nand came up to her. She leaned with her shoulder against the paling and\nvainly tried to light a match on it.\n\nI looked narrowly at her face. She was indeed a starveling and appeared\nto me to be a woman of about thirty. Her complexion was dirty; her eyes\nsmall, dim, and bleared with drinking; she had a squat nose; her lips\nwere wry and slavering, with downcast angles; from under her kerchief\nfell a tuft of dry hair. Her figure was long and flat; her arms and legs\nshort.\n\nI stopped in front of her. She looked at me and grinned as if she knew\nall that I was thinking about. I felt that I ought to say something to\nher. I wanted to show her that I pitied her.\n\n"Have you parents?" I asked. She laughed hoarsely, then suddenly\nstopped, and, lifting her brows, began to look at me steadfastly.\n\n"Have you parents?" I repeated.\n\nShe smiled with a grimace which seemed to say, "What a question for him\nto put!"\n\n"I have a mother," she said at last; "but what\'s that to you?"\n\n"And how old are you?"\n\n"I am over fifteen," she said, at once answering a question she was\naccustomed to hear.\n\n"Come, come! go on; we shall all be frozen for you, the deuce take you!"\nshouted the policeman; and she edged off from the paling and staggered\nalong the lane to the police-station: and I turned to the gate and\nentered my house, and asked whether my daughters were at home. I was\ntold that they had been to an evening party, had enjoyed themselves\nmuch, and now were asleep.\n\nThe next morning I was about to go to the police-station to enquire what\nhad become of this unhappy girl. I was ready to start early enough, when\none of those unfortunate men called, who from weakness have dropped out\nof the gentlemanly line of life to which they have been accustomed, and\nwho rise and fall by turns. I had been acquainted with him three years.\nDuring this time he had several times sold every thing he had,--even his\nclothes; and, having just done so again, he passed his nights\ntemporarily in Rzhanoff\'s house, and his days at my lodgings. He met me\nas I was going out, and, without listening to me, began at once to\nrelate what had happened at Rzhanoff\'s house the night before.\n\nHe began to relate it, yet had not got through one-half when, all of a\nsudden, he, an old man, who had gone through much in his life, began to\nsob, and, ceasing to speak, turned his face away from me. This was what\nhe related. I ascertained the truth of his story on the spot, where I\nlearned some new particulars, which I shall relate too.\n\nA washerwoman thirty years of age, fair, quiet, good-looking, but\ndelicate, passed her nights in the same lodging-house, the ground-floor\nof No.\xc2\xa032 where my friend slept among various shifting night-lodgers,\nmen and women, who for five kopeks slept with each other.\n\nThe landlady at this lodging was the mistress of a boatman. In summer\nher lover kept a boat; and in winter they earned their living by letting\nlodgings to night-lodgers at three kopeks without a pillow, and at five\nkopeks with one.\n\nThe washerwoman had been living here some months, and was a quiet woman;\nbut lately they began to object to her because she coughed, and\nprevented the other lodgers from sleeping. An old woman in particular,\neighty years old, half silly, and a permanent inmate of this lodging,\nbegan to dislike the washerwoman and kept annoying her because she\ndisturbed her sleep; for all night she coughed like a sheep.\n\nThe washerwoman said nothing. She owed for rent, and felt herself\nguilty, and was therefore compelled to endure. She began to work less\nand less, for her strength failed her; and that was why she was unable\nto pay her rent. She had not been to work at all the whole of the last\nweek; and she had been making the lives of all, and particularly of the\nold woman, miserable by her cough.\n\nFour days ago the landlady gave her notice to leave. She already owed\nsixty kopeks, and could not pay them, and there was no hope of doing so;\nand other lodgers complained of her cough.\n\nWhen the landlady gave the washerwoman notice, and told her she must go\naway if she did not pay the rent, the old woman was glad, and pushed her\nout into the yard. The washerwoman went away, but came back again in an\nhour, and the landlady had not the heart to send her away again....\nDuring the second and the third day the landlady left her there. "Where\nshall I go?" she kept saying. On the third day the landlady\'s lover, a\nMoscow man, who knew all the rules and regulations, went for a\npoliceman. The policeman, with a sword and a pistol slung on a red cord,\ncame into the lodging and quietly and politely turned the washerwoman\nout into the street.\n\nIt was a bright, sunny, but frosty day in March. The melting snow ran\ndown in streams, the house-porters were breaking the ice. The hackney\nsledges bumped on the ice-glazed snow, and creaked over the stones. The\nwasherwoman went up the hill on the sunny side, got to the church, and\nsat down in the sun at the church-porch. But when the sun began to go\ndown behind the houses and the pools of water began to be covered with a\nthin sheet of ice, the washerwoman felt chilly and terrified. She got up\nand slowly walked on.... Where? Home,--to the only house in which she\nhad been living lately.\n\nWhile she was walking there, several times resting herself, it began to\nget dark. She approached the gate, turned into it, her foot slipped, she\ngave a shriek, and fell down.\n\nOne man passed by, then another. "She must be drunk," they thought.\nAnother man passed, and stumbled up against her, and said to the\nhouse-porter, "Some tipsy woman is lying at the gate. I very nearly\nbroke my neck over her. Won\'t you take her away?"\n\nThe house-porter came. The washerwoman was dead. This was what my friend\nrelated to me.\n\nThe reader will perhaps fancy I have picked out particular cases in the\nprostitute of fifteen years of age and the story of this washerwoman;\nbut let him not think so: this really happened in one and the same\nnight. I do not exactly remember the date, only it was in March, 1884.\n\nHaving heard my friend\'s story I went to the police-station, intending\nfrom there to go to Rzhanoff\'s house to learn all the particulars of the\nwasherwoman\'s story.\n\nThe weather was fine and sunny; and again under the ice of the previous\nnight, in the shade, you could see the water running; and in the sun, in\nthe square, everything was melting fast. The trees of the garden\nappeared blue from over the river; the sparrows that were reddish in\nwinter, and unnoticed then, now attracted people\'s attention by their\nmerriness; men also tried to be merry, but they all had too many cares.\nThe bells of the churches sounded; and blending with them were heard\nsounds of shooting from the barracks,--the hiss of the rifle balls, and\nthe crack when they struck the target.\n\nI entered the police-station. There some armed men--policemen--led me to\ntheir chief. He, also armed with a sword, sabre, and pistol, was busy\ngiving some orders about a ragged, trembling old man who was standing\nbefore him, and from weakness could not clearly answer what was asked of\nhim. Having done with the old man, he turned to me. I inquired about the\nprostitute of last night. He first listened to me attentively, then he\nsmiled, not only because I did not know why they were taken to the\npolice-station, but more particularly at my astonishment at her youth.\n"Goodness! there are some of twelve, thirteen, and fourteen years of age\noften," said he, in a lively tone.\n\nTo my question about the girl of yesterday, he told me that she had\nprobably been already sent to the committee (if I understood him right).\nTo my question where such women passed the night, he gave a vague\nanswer. The one about whom I spoke he did not remember. There were so\nmany of them every day.\n\nAt Rzhanoff\'s house, in No.\xc2\xa032, I already found the sacristan reading\nprayers over the dead washerwoman. She had been brought in and laid on\nher former pallet; and the lodgers, all starvelings themselves,\ncontributed money for the prayers, the coffin, and the shroud; the old\nwoman had dressed her, and laid her out. The clerk was reading something\nin the dark; a woman in a cloak stood holding a wax taper; and with a\nsimilar wax taper stood a man (a gentleman, it is fair to state), in a\nnice great-coat, trimmed with an astrachan collar, in bright goloshes,\nand with a starched shirt. That was her brother. He had been hunted up.\n\nI passed by the dead woman to the landlady\'s room in order to ask her\nall the particulars. She was afraid of my questions,--afraid probably of\nbeing charged with something; but by and by she grew talkative and told\nme all. On passing by again, I looked at the dead body. All the dead are\nbeautiful; but this one was particularly beautiful and touching in her\ncoffin, with her clear, pale face, with closed, prominent eyes, sunken\ncheeks, and fair, soft hair over her high forehead; her face looked\nweary, but kind, and not sad at all, but rather astonished. And indeed,\nif the living do not see, the dead may well be astonished.\n\nOn the day I wrote this there was a great ball in Moscow. On the same\nnight I left home after eight o\'clock. I live in a locality surrounded\nby factories; and I left home after the factory whistle had sounded, and\nwhen, after a week of incessant work, the people were freed for their\nholiday. Factory-men passed by me, and I by them, all turning their\nsteps to the public-houses and inns. Many were already tipsy: many were\nwith women.\n\nEvery morning at five I hear each of the whistles, which means that the\nlabour of women, children, and old people has begun. At eight o\'clock\nanother whistle,--this means half an hour\'s rest; at twelve the third\nwhistle,--this means an hour for dinner. At eight o\'clock the fourth\nwhistle, indicating cessation from work. By a strange coincidence, all\nthe three factories in my neighbourhood produce only the articles\nnecessary for balls.\n\nIn one factory,--the one nearest to me,--they make nothing but\nstockings; in the other opposite, silk stuffs; in the third, perfumes\nand pomades.\n\nOne may, on hearing these whistles, attach to them no other meaning than\nthat of the indication of time. "There, the whistle has sounded: it is\ntime to go out for a walk."\n\nBut one may associate with them also the meaning they have in\nreality,--that at the first whistle at five o\'clock in the morning, men\nand women, who have slept side by side in a damp cellar, get up in the\ndark, and hurry away into the noisy building to take their part in a\nwork of which they see neither cessation nor utility for themselves, and\nwork often so in the heat, in suffocating exhalations, with very rare\nintervals of rest, for one, two, or three, or even twelve or more hours.\nThey fall asleep, and get up again, and again do this work, meaningless\nfor themselves, to which they are goaded only by want. So it goes on\nfrom one week to another, interrupted only by holidays.\n\nAnd now I see these working-people freed for one of these holidays. They\ngo out into the street: everywhere there are inns, public-houses, and\ngay women. And they, in a drunken state, pull each other by the arms,\nand carry along with them girls like the one whom I saw conducted to the\npolice-station: they hire hackney-coaches, and ride and walk from one\ninn to another, and abuse each other, and totter about, and say they\nknow not what.\n\nFormerly when I saw the factory people knocking about in this way I used\nto turn aside with disgust, and almost reproached them; but since I hear\nthese daily whistles, and know what they mean, I am only astonished that\nall these men do not come into the condition of the utter beggars with\nwhom Moscow is filled, and the women into the position of the girl whom\nI had met near my house.\n\nThus I walked on, looking at these men, observing how they went about\nthe streets, till eleven o\'clock. Then their movements became quieter:\nthere remained here and there a few tipsy people, and I met some men and\nwomen who were being conducted to the police-station. And now, from\nevery side, carriages appeared, all going in one direction. On the\ncoach-box sat a coachman, sometimes in a sheepskin coat, and a\nfootman,--a dandy with a cockade. Well-fed horses, covered with cloth,\ntrotted at the rate of fifteen miles an hour. In the carriages sat\nladies wrapped in shawls, taking great care not to spoil their flowers\nand their toilets. All, beginning with the harness on the horses, the\ncarriages, indiarubber wheels, the cloth of the coachman\'s coat, down to\nthe stockings, shoes, flowers, velvet, gloves, scents,--all these\narticles have been made by those men, some of whom fell asleep on their\nown pallets in their mean rooms, some in night-houses with prostitutes,\nand others in the police-station.\n\nThe ball-goers drive past these men, in and with things made by them;\nand it does not even enter into their minds that there could possibly be\nany connection between the ball they are going to, and these tipsy\npeople to whom their coachmen shout out so angrily. With easy minds and\nassurance that they are doing nothing wrong, but something very good,\nthey enjoy themselves at the ball.\n\nEnjoy themselves!\n\nFrom eleven o\'clock in the evening till six in the morning, in the very\ndepth of the night; while with empty stomachs men are lying in\nnight-lodgings, or dying as the washer-woman had done!\n\nThe enjoyment of the ball consists in women and girls uncovering their\nbosoms, putting on artificial protuberances at the back, and altogether\ngetting themselves up as no girl and no woman who is not yet depraved\nwould, on any account, appear before men; and in this half-naked\ncondition, with uncovered bosoms, and arms bare up to the shoulders,\nwith dresses puffed behind and tight round the hips, in the brightest\nlight, women and girls, whose first virtue has always been modesty,\nappear among strange men, who are also dressed in indecently\ntight-fitting clothes, embrace each other, and pivot round and round to\nthe sound of exciting music. Old women, often also half naked like the\nyounger ones, are sitting looking on, and eating and drinking: the old\nmen do the same. No wonder it is done at night when everyone else is\nsleeping, so that no one may see it!\n\nBut it is not done at night in order to hide it; there is nothing indeed\nto hide; all is very nice and good; and by this enjoyment, in which is\nswallowed up the painful labour of thousands, not only is nobody harmed,\nbut by this very thing poor people are fed!\n\nThe ball goes on very merrily, may be, but how did it come to do so?\nWhen we see in society or among ourselves one who has not eaten, or is\ncold, we are ashamed to enjoy ourselves, and cannot begin to be merry\nuntil he is fed, to say nothing of the fact that we cannot even imagine\nthat there are people who can enjoy themselves by means of anything\nwhich produces the sufferings of others.\n\nWe are disgusted with and do not understand the enjoyment of brutal boys\nwho have squeezed a dog\'s tail into a piece of split wood. How is it,\nthen, that in our enjoyment we become blind, and do not see the cleft in\nwhich we have pinched those men who suffer for our enjoyment.\n\nWe know that each woman at this ball whose dress costs a hundred and\nfifty rubles was not born at the ball, but has lived in the country, has\nseen peasants, is acquainted with a nurse and maid whose fathers and\nbrothers are poor, for whom the earning of a hundred and fifty rubles to\nbuild a cottage with is the end and aim of a long, laborious life. She\nknows all this; how can she, then, enjoy herself, knowing that on her\nhalf-naked body she is wearing the cottage which is the dream of her\nhousemaid\'s brother?\n\nBut let us suppose she has not thought about this: still she cannot help\nknowing that velvet and silk, sweetmeats and flowers, and laces and\ndresses, do not grow of themselves, but are made by men. One would think\nshe could not help knowing that men make all these things, and under\nwhat circumstances, and why. She cannot help knowing that her\ndressmaker, whom she scolded to-day, made this dress not at all out of\nlove to her, therefore she cannot help knowing that all these\nthings--her laces, flowers, and velvet--were made from sheer want.\n\nBut perhaps she is so blinded that she does not think of this. Well,\nbut, at all events, she could not help knowing that five people, old,\nrespectable, often delicate men and women, have not slept all night, and\nhave been busy on her account. She saw their tired, gloomy faces. This,\nalso, she could not help knowing,--that on this night there were\ntwenty-eight degrees of frost, and that her coachman--an old man--was\nsitting in this frost all night on his coach-box.\n\nBut I know that they do not really see this. If from the hypnotic\ninfluence of the ball these young women and girls fail to see all this,\nwe cannot judge them. Poor things! They consider all to be good which is\npronounced so by their elders. How do these elders explain their\ncruelty? They, indeed, always answer in the same way: "I compel no one;\nwhat I have, I have bought; footmen, chambermaids, coachman, I hire.\nThere is no harm in engaging and in buying. I compel none; I hire; what\nwrong is there in that?"\n\nSome days ago I called on a friend. Passing through the first room I\nwondered at seeing two women at a table, for I knew my acquaintance was\na bachelor. A skinny yellow, old-looking woman, about thirty, with a\nkerchief thrown over her shoulders, was briskly doing something over the\ntable with her hands, jerking nervously, as if in a fit. Opposite to her\nsat a young girl, who was also doing something and jerking in the same\nway. They both seemed to be suffering from St. Vitus\'s dance. I came\nnearer and looked closer to see what they were about.\n\nThey glanced up at me and then continued their work as attentively as\nbefore.\n\nBefore them were spread tobacco and cigarettes. They were making\ncigarettes. The woman rubbed the tobacco fine between the palms of her\nhands, caught it up by a machine, put on the tubes, and threw them to\nthe girl. The girl folded the papers, put them over the cigarette, threw\nit aside, and took up another.\n\nAll this was performed with such speed, with such dexterity, that it was\nimpossible to describe it. I expressed my wonder at their quickness. "I\nhave been at this business fourteen years," said the woman.\n\n"Is it hard work?"\n\n"Yes: my chest aches, and the air is choky with tobacco."\n\nBut it was not necessary for her to have said so: you need only have\nlooked at her or at the girl. The latter had been at this business three\nyears; but anyone not seeing her at this work would have said that she\nhad a strong constitution which was already beginning to be broken.\n\nMy acquaintance, a kind-hearted man of liberal views, hired these women\nto make him cigarettes at two rubles and a half (5s.) a thousand. He has\nmoney, and he pays it away for this work: what harm is there in it?\n\nMy acquaintance gets up at twelve. His evenings, from six to two, he\nspends at cards or at the piano; he eats and drinks well; other people\ndo all the work for him. He has devised for himself a new\npleasure,--smoking. I can remember when he began to smoke. Here are a\nwoman and a girl who can scarcely earn their living by transforming\nthemselves into machines, and who pass all their lives in breathing\ntobacco, thus ruining their lives. He has money which he has not earned,\nand he prefers playing at cards to making cigarettes for himself. He\ngives these women money only on condition that they continue to live as\nmiserably as they lived before in making cigarettes for him.\n\nI am fond of cleanliness; and I give money on condition that the\nwasherwoman washes my shirts, which I change twice a day; and the\nwashing of these shirts having taxed the utmost strength of the\nwasherwoman, she has died.\n\nWhat is wrong in this?\n\nMen who buy and hire will continue doing so whether I do or do not; they\nwill force other people to make velvets and dainties, and will buy them\nwhether I do or do not; so also they will hire people to make cigarettes\nand to wash shirts. Why should I, then, deprive myself of velvets,\nsweetmeats, cigarettes, and clean shirts, when their production is\nalready set in going. Often,--almost constantly I hear this reasoning.\n\nThis is the very reasoning which a crowd, maddened with the passion of\ndestruction, will employ. It is the same reasoning which leads a pack of\ndogs, when one of their number runs against another and knocks it down,\nthe rest attack it and tear it to pieces. Others have already begun,\nhave done a little mischief; why shouldn\'t I, too, do the same? What can\nit possibly signify if I wear a dirty shirt and make my cigarettes\nmyself? could that help any one? men ask who desire to justify\nthemselves.\n\nHad we not wandered so far from truth one would be ashamed to answer\nthis question; but we are so entangled that such a question seems\nnatural to us, and, therefore, though I feel ashamed, I must answer it.\n\nWhat difference would it be if I should wear my shirt a week instead of\na day, and make my cigarettes myself, or leave off smoking altogether?\n\nThe difference would be this,--that a certain washerwoman, and a certain\ncigarette-maker, would exert themselves less, and what I gave formerly\nfor the washing of my shirt, and for the making of my cigarettes, I may\ngive now to that or to another woman; and working-people who are tired\nby their work, instead of overworking themselves, will be able to rest\nand to have tea. But I have heard objections to this, so ashamed are the\nrich and luxurious to understand their position.\n\nThey reply, "If I should wear dirty linen, leave off smoking, and give\nthis money away to the poor, then this money would be all the same taken\naway from them, and my drop will not help to swell the sea."\n\nI am still more ashamed to answer such a reply, but at the same time I\nmust do so. If I came among savages who gave me chops which I thought\ndelicious, but the next day I learned (perhaps saw myself) that these\ndelicious chops were made of a human prisoner who had been slain in\norder to make them; and if I think it bad to eat men, however delicious\nthe cutlets may be, and however general the custom to eat men among the\npersons with whom I live, and however small the utility of my refusal to\neat them may be,--to the prisoners who have been prepared for food,--I\nshall not and cannot eat them.\n\nIt may be that I shall eat human flesh when urged by hunger; but I shall\nnot make a feast of it, and shall not take part in feasts with human\nflesh, and shall not seek such feasts, nor be proud of my partaking of\nthem.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nBut what is to be done, then? We did not do it, did we? And if not we,\nwho did?\n\nWe say, "It is not we who have done all this; it has been done of\nitself"; as children say when they break anything, that "it broke\nitself." We say that, as towns are already in existence, we, who are\nliving there, must feed men by buying their labour. But that is not\ntrue. It need only be observed how we live in the country, and how we\nfeed people there.\n\nWinter is over: Easter is coming. In the town the same orgies of the\nrich go on,--on the boulevards, in gardens, in the parks, on the river;\nmusic, theatres, riding, illuminations, fire-works. But in the country\nit is still better,--the air is purer; the trees, the meadows, the\nflowers, are fresher. We must go where all is budding and blooming. And\nnow we, the majority of rich people, who live by other men\'s labour, go\ninto the country to breathe the purer air, to look at the meadows and\nwoods. Here in the country among humble villagers who feed on bread and\nonions, work eighteen hours every day, and have neither sufficient sleep\nnor clothes, rich people take up their abode. No one tempts these\npeople: here are no factories, and no idle hands, of which there are so\nmany in town, whom we may imagine we feed by giving them work to do.\nHere people never can do their own work in time during the summer; and\nnot only are there no idle hands, but much property is lost for want of\nhands; and an immense number of men, children, and old people, and women\nwith child, overwork themselves.\n\nHow, then, do rich people order their lives here in the country? Thus:\nif there happens to be an old mansion, built in the time of the serfs,\nthen this house is renovated and re-decorated: if there is not, one is\nbuilt of two or three stories. The rooms, which are from twelve to\ntwenty and more in number, are all about sixteen feet high. The floors\nare inlaid; in the windows are put whole panes of glass, costly carpets\non the floors; expensive furniture is procured,--a sideboard, for\ninstance, costing from twenty to sixty pounds. Near the mansion, roads\nare made; flower-beds are laid out; there are croquet-lawns,\ngiant-strides, reflecting globes, conservatories, and hot-houses, and\nalways luxurious stables. All is painted in colours, prepared with the\nvery oil which the old people and children lack for their porridge. If a\nrich man can afford it he buys such a house for himself; if he cannot he\nhires one: but however poor and however liberal a man of our circle may\nbe, he always takes up his abode in the country in such a house, for\nbuilding and keeping which it is necessary to take away dozens of\nworking-people who have not enough time to do their own business in the\nfield to earn their living.\n\nHere we cannot say that factories are already in existence and will\ncontinue so whether we make use of their work or no; we cannot say that\nwe are feeding idle hands; here we plainly establish the factories for\nmaking things necessary for us, and simply make use of the surrounding\npeople; we divert the people from work necessary for them, as for us and\nfor all, and by such system deprave some, and ruin the lives and the\nhealth of others.\n\nThere lives, let us say, in a village, an educated and respectable\nfamily of the upper class, or that of a government officer. All its\nmembers and the visitors assemble towards the middle of June, because up\nto June they had been studying and passing their examinations: they\nassemble when mowing begins, and they stay until September, until the\nharvest and sowing time. The members of the family (as almost all men of\nthis class) remain in the country from the beginning of the urgent\nwork,--hay-making,--not to the end of it, indeed, because in September\nthe sowing goes on, and the digging up of potatoes, but till labour\nbegins to slacken. During the whole time of the stay, around them and\nclose by the peasants\' summer work has been proceeding, the strain of\nwhich, however much we may have heard or read of it, however much we may\nhave looked at it, we can form no adequate idea without having\nexperienced it ourselves.\n\nThe members of the family, about ten persons have been living as they\ndid in town, if possible still worse than in town, because here in the\nvillage they are supposed to be resting (after doing nothing), and offer\nno pretence in the way of work, and no excuse for their idleness.\n\nIn the midsummer-lent, when people are forced from want to feed on\nkvas[5] and bread and onions, begins the mowing time. Gentlefolk who\nlive in the country see this labour, partly order it, partly admire it;\nenjoy the smell of the drying hay, the sound of women\'s songs, the noise\nof the scythes, and the sight of the rows of mowers, and of the women\nraking. They see this near their house as well as when they, with young\npeople and children who do nothing all the day long, drive well-fed\nhorses a distance of a few hundred yards to the bathing-place.\n\n  [5] A home-made cheap fermented drink.--Ed.\n\nThe work of mowing is one of the most important in the world. Nearly\nevery year, from want of hands and of time, the meadows remain half\nuncut and may remain so till the rains begin; so that the degree of\nintensity of the labour decides the question whether twenty or more per\ncent will be added to the stores of the world, or whether this hay will\nbe left to rot or spoil while yet uncut.\n\nAnd if there is more hay, there will be also more meat for old people\nand milk for children; thus matters stand in general; but in particular\nfor each mower here is decided the question of bread and milk for\nhimself, and for his children during the winter.\n\nEach of the working-people, male and female, knows this: even the\nchildren know that this is an important business and that one ought to\nwork with all one\'s strength, carry a jug with kvas for the father to\nthe mowing-place, and, shifting it from one hand to another, run\nbarefoot as quickly as possible, a distance of perhaps a mile and a half\nfrom the village, in order to be in time for dinner, that father may not\ngrumble. Every one knows, that, from the mowing to the harvest, there\nwill be no cessation of labour, and no time for rest. And besides\nmowing, each has some other business to do,--to plough up new land and\nharrow it; the women have the linen to make, bread to bake, and the\nwashing to do; and the peasants must drive to the mill and to market;\nthey have the official affairs of their community to attend to; they\nhave also to provide the local government officials with means of\nlocomotion, and to pass the night in the fields with the pastured\nhorses.\n\nAll, old and young and sick, work with all their strength.\n\nThe peasants work in such a way, that, when cutting the last rows, the\nmowers, some of them weak people, growing youths, and old men, are so\ntired, that, having rested a little, it is with great pain they begin\nanew; the women, often with child, work hard too.\n\nIt is a strained, incessant labour. All work to the utmost of their\nstrength, and use not only all their provisions but what they have in\nstore. During harvest-time all the peasants grow thinner although they\nnever were very stout.\n\nThere is a small company labouring in the hayfield; three peasants--one\nan old man, another his married nephew, and the third the village\ncobbler, a thin, wiry man. Their mowing this morning decides their fate\nfor the coming winter, whether they will be able to keep a cow and pay\ntheir taxes. This is their second weeks\' work. The rain hindered them\nfor a while. After the rain had left off and the water had dried up they\ndecided to make hayricks; and in order to do it quicker they decided\nthat two women must rake to each scythe. With the old man came out his\nwife, fifty years of age, worn out with labour and the bearing of eleven\nchildren; deaf, but still strong enough for work; and his daughter,\nthirteen years of age, a short but brisk and strong little girl.\n\nWith the nephew came his wife,--a tall woman, as strong as a peasant,\nand his sister in law,--a soldier\'s wife, who was with child. With the\ncobbler came his wife,--a strong working-woman, and her mother,--an old\nwoman about eighty, who for the rest of the year used to beg.\n\nThey all draw up in a line, and work from morning to evening in the\nburning sun of June. It is steaming hot and a thunder-shower is\nthreatening. Every moment of work is precious. They have not wished to\nleave off working even to fetch water or kvas. A small boy, the grandson\nof the old woman, brings them water. The old woman is evidently anxious\nonly on one point,--not to be sent away from work. She does not let the\nrake out of her hands, and moves about with great difficulty. The little\nboy, quite bent under the jug with water, heavier than himself, walks\nwith short steps on his bare feet, and carries the jug with many shifts.\nThe little girl takes on her shoulders a load of hay which is also\nheavier than herself; walks a few paces, and stops, then throws it down,\nhaving no strength to carry it farther. The old man\'s wife rakes\ntogether unceasingly, her kerchief loosened from her disordered hair;\nshe carries the hay, breathing heavily and staggering under the burden:\nthe cobbler\'s mother is only raking, but this is also beyond her\nstrength; she slowly drags her feet, in baste shoes, and looks gloomily\nbefore her, like one very ill, or at the point of death. The old man\npurposely sends her far away from the others, to rake about the ricks,\nin order that she may not attempt to compete with them; but she does not\nleave off working, but continues with the same dead gloomy face as long\nas the others.\n\nThe sun is already setting behind the wood and the ricks are not yet in\norder: there is much still to be done.\n\nAll feel that it is time to leave off working but no one says so; each\nwaiting for the other to suggest it. At last, the cobbler, realizing\nthat he has no more strength left, proposes to the old man to leave the\nricks till to-morrow, and the old man agrees to it; and at once the\nwomen go to fetch their clothes, their jugs, their pitchforks; and the\nold woman sits down where she was standing, and then lays herself down\nwith the same fixed stare on her face. But as the women go away she gets\nup groaning, and, crawling along, follows them.\n\nLet us turn to the country-house. The same evening, when from the side\nof the village were heard the rattle of the scythes of the toil-worn\nmowers who were returning from work, the sounds of the hammer against\nthe anvil, the cries of women and girls who had just had time to put\naway their rakes, and were already running to drive the cattle in,--with\nthose blend other sounds from the country-house. Rattle, rattle, goes\nthe piano; a Hungarian song is heard through the noise of the\ncroquet-balls; before the stable an open carriage is standing harnessed\nwith four fat horses, which has been hired for twenty shillings to bring\nsome guests a distance of ten miles.\n\nHorses standing by the carriage rattle their little bells. Before them\nhay has been thrown, which they are scattering with their hoofs, the\nsame hay which the peasants have been gathering with such hard labour.\nIn the yard of this mansion there is movement; a healthy, well-fed\nfellow in a pink shirt, presented to him for his service as a\nhouse-porter, is calling the coachmen and telling them to harness and\nsaddle some horses. Two peasants who live here as coachmen come out of\ntheir room, and go in an easy manner, swinging their arms, to saddle\nhorses for the ladies and gentlemen. Still nearer to the house the\nsounds of another piano are heard. It is the music-mistress,--who lives\nin the family to teach the children,--practising her Schumann. The\nsounds of one piano jangle with those of another. Quite near the house\nwalk two nurses; one is young, another old; they lead and carry children\nto bed; these children are of the same age as those who ran from the\nvillage with jugs. One nurse is English: she cannot speak Russian. She\nwas engaged to come from England, not from being distinguished by some\npeculiar qualities but simply because she does not speak Russian.\nFarther on is another person, a French woman, who is also engaged\nbecause she does not know Russian. Farther on a peasant, with two women,\nis watering flowers near the house: another is cleaning a gun for one of\nthe young gentlemen. Here two women are carrying a basket with clean\nlinen,--they have been washing for all these gentlefolks. In the house\ntwo women have scarcely time to wash the plates and dishes after the\ncompany, who have just done eating; and two peasants in evening clothes\nare running up and down the stairs, serving coffee, tea, wine,\nseltzer-water, etc. Up-stairs a table is spread. One meal has just\nended, and another will soon begin, to continue till cock-crow and often\ntill morning dawns. Some are sitting smoking, playing cards; others are\nsitting and smoking, engaged in discussing liberal ideas of reform; and\nothers, again, walk to and fro, eat, smoke, and, not knowing what to do,\nhave made up their mind to take a drive.\n\nThe household consists of fifteen persons, healthy men and women; and\nthirty persons, healthy working-people, male and female, labour for\nthem. And this takes place there, where every hour, and each little boy,\nare precious.\n\nThis will be so, also, in July, when the peasants, not having had their\nsleep out, will mow the oats at night in order that it may not be lost,\nand the women will get up before dawn in order to finish their threshing\nin time; when this old woman, who had been exhausted during the harvest,\nand the women with child, and the little children will again all\noverwork themselves, and when there is a great want of hands, horses,\ncarts, in order to house this corn upon which all men feed, of which\nmillions of bushels are necessary in Russia in order that men should not\ndie: during even such a time, the idle lives of ladies and gentlemen\nwill go on. There will be private theatricals, picnics, hunting,\ndrinking, eating, piano-playing, singing, dancing,--in fact, incessant\norgies.\n\nHere, at least, it is impossible to find any excuse from the fact that\nall this had been going on before: nothing of the kind had been in\nexistence. We ourselves carefully create such a life, taking bread and\nlabour away from the work-worn people. We live sumptuously, as if there\nwere no connection whatever between the dying washerwoman,\nchild-prostitute, women worn out by making cigarettes and all the\nintense labour around us to which their unnourished strength is\ninadequate. We do not want to see the fact that if there were not our\nidle, luxurious, depraved lives, there would not be this labour,\ndisproportioned to the strength of people, and that if there were not\nthis labour we could not go on living in the same way.\n\nIt appears to us that their sufferings are one thing and our lives\nanother, and that we, living as we do, are innocent and pure as doves.\nWe read the description of the lives of the Romans, and wonder at the\ninhumanity of a heartless Lucullus, who gorged himself with fine dishes\nand delicious wines while people were starving: we shake our heads and\nwonder at the barbarism of our grandfathers,--the serf-owners,--who\nprovided themselves with orchestras and theatres, and employed whole\nvillages to keep up their gardens. From the height of our greatness we\nwonder at their inhumanity. We read the words of Isaiah\xc2\xa0v., 8:\n\n    "Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field,\n    till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of\n    the land.\n\n    Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may\n    follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine\n    inflame them!\n\n    The harp, and the lute, the tabret, the pipe, and wine are in their\n    feasts: but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither have they\n    considered the operation of his hands.\n\n    Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it\n    were with a cart rope.\n\n    Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness\n    for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and\n    sweet for bitter!\n\n    Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their\n    own sight!\n\n    Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to\n    mingle strong drink:\n\n    Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness\n    of the righteous from him."\n\nWe read these words, and it seems to us that they have nothing to do\nwith us.\n\nWe read in the Gospel, Matthew\xc2\xa0iii., 10: "And even now is the axe laid\nunto the root of the tree: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth\ngood fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire," and we are quite sure\nthat the good tree bearing good fruit is we ourselves, and that those\nwords are said, not to us, but to some other bad men.\n\nWe read the words of Isaiah\xc2\xa0vi., 10:\n\n    "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and\n    shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their\n    ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be\n    healed. Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities\n    be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land\n    become utterly waste."\n\nWe read, and are quite assured that this wonderful thing has not\nhappened to us, but to some other people. For this very reason we do not\nsee that this has happened to us, and is taking place with us. We do not\nhear, we do not see, and do not understand with our heart.\n\nBut why has it so happened?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nHow can a man who considers himself to be,--we will not say a Christian\nor an educated and humane man,--but simply a man not entirely devoid of\nreason and of conscience,--how can he, I say, live in such a way, taking\nno part in the struggle of all mankind for life, only swallowing up the\nlabour of others struggling for existence, and by his own claims\nincreasing the labour of those who struggle and the number of those who\nperish in the struggle?\n\nSuch men abound in our so-called Christian and cultured world; and not\nonly do they abound in our world but the very ideal of the men of our\nChristian, cultured world, is to get the largest amount of\nproperty,--that is, wealth,--which secures all comforts and idleness of\nlife by freeing its possessors from the struggle for existence, and\nenabling them, as much as possible, to profit by the labour of those\nbrothers of theirs who perish in that struggle.\n\nHow could men have fallen into such astounding error?\n\nHow could they have come to such a state that they can neither see nor\nhear nor understand with their heart what is so clear, obvious, and\ncertain?\n\nOne need only think for a moment in order to be terrified at the way our\nlives contradict what we profess to believe, whether we be Christian or\nonly humane educated people. Whether it be God or a law of nature that\ngoverns the world and men, good or bad, the position of men in this\nworld, so long as we know it has always been such that naked\nmen,--without wool on their bodies, without holes in which to take\nrefuge, without food which they might find in the field like Robinson\nCrusoe on his island,--are put into a position of continual and\nincessant struggle with nature in order to cover their bodies by making\nclothes for themselves, to protect themselves by a roof over their\nheads, and to earn food in order twice or thrice a day to satisfy their\nhunger and that of their children and their parents.\n\nWherever and whenever and to whatever extent we observe the lives of\nmen, whether in Europe, America, China, or Russia; whether we take into\nconsideration all mankind or a small portion, whether in olden times in\na nomad state, or in modern times with steam-engines, steam-ploughs,\nsewing-machines, and electric light,--we shall see one and the same\nthing going on,--that men, working constantly and incessantly, are not\nable to get clothes, shelter, and food for themselves, their little\nones, and the old, and that the greatest number of men in olden times as\nwell as now, perish slowly from want of the necessaries of life and from\noverwork.\n\nWherever we may live, if we draw a circle around us of a hundred\nthousand, or a thousand or ten, or even one mile\'s circumference, and\nlook at the lives of those men who are inside our circle, we shall find\nhalf-starved children, old people male and female, pregnant women, sick\nand weak persons, working beyond their strength, who have neither food\nnor rest enough to support them, and who, for this reason, die before\ntheir time: we shall see others full-grown who are even being killed by\ndangerous and hurtful tasks.\n\nSince the world has existed we find that with great efforts, sufferings,\nand privations men have been struggling for their common wants, and have\nnot been able to overcome the difficulty.\n\nBesides, we also know that every one of us, wherever and however he may\nlive, _nolens volens_, is every day, and every hour of the day,\nabsorbing for himself a part of the labour performed by mankind.\n\nWherever and however a man lives, the roof over his head did not grow of\nitself; the firewood in his stove did not get there of itself; the water\ndid not come of itself either; and the baked bread does not fall down\nfrom the sky; his dinner, his clothes, and the covering for his feet,\nall this has been made for him, not only by men of past generations,\nlong dead, but it is being done for him now by those men of whom\nhundreds and thousands are fainting away and dying in vain efforts to\nget for themselves and for their children sufficient shelter, food, and\nclothes,--means to save themselves and their children from suffering and\na premature death.\n\nAll men are struggling with want. They are struggling so intensely that\naround them always their brethren, fathers, mothers, children, are\nperishing. Men in this world are like those on a dismantled or\nwater-logged ship with a short allowance of food; all are put by God, or\nby nature, in such a position that they must husband their food and\nunceasingly war with want.\n\nEach interruption in this work of every one of us, each absorption of\nthe labour of others which is useless for the common welfare, is\nruinous, alike for us and them.\n\nHow is it that the majority of educated people, without labouring, are\nquietly absorbing the labours of others which are necessary for their\nown lives, and are considering such an existence quite natural and\nreasonable?\n\nIf we are to free ourselves from the labour proper and natural to all\nand lay it on others, and yet not at the same time consider ourselves\ntraitors and thieves, we can do so only by two suppositions,--first,\nthat we (the men who take no part in common labour) are different beings\nfrom working-men and have a peculiar destiny to fulfil in society (like\ndrone-bees, or queen-bees, which have a different function from the\nworking-bees); or secondly, that the business which we (the men freed\nfrom the struggle for existence) are doing for other men is so useful\nfor all that it undoubtedly compensates for that harm which we do to\nothers in overburdening them.\n\nIn olden times men who lived by the labour of others asserted, first,\nthat they belonged to a different race; and secondly, that they had from\nGod a peculiar mission,--caring for the welfare of others; in other\nwords, to govern and teach them: and therefore, they assured others, and\npartly believed themselves, that the business they did was more useful\nand more important for the people than those labours by which they\nprofit. This justification was sufficient so long as the direct\ninterference of God in human affairs, and the inequality of human races,\nwas not doubted.\n\nBut with Christianity and that consciousness of the equality and unity\nof all men which proceeds from it, this justification could no longer be\nexpressed in its previous form.\n\nIt was no longer possible to assert that men are born of different kind\nand quality and have a different destiny; and the old justification,\nthough still held by some, has been little by little destroyed and has\nnow almost entirely disappeared.\n\nBut though the justification disappeared, the fact itself,--of the\nfreeing of some men from labour, and the appropriation by them of other\nmen\'s labour, remained the same for those who had the power to enforce\nit. For this existing fact new excuses have constantly been invented, in\norder that without asserting the difference of human beings, men might\nbe able with apparent justice to free themselves from personal labour.\n\nA great many justifications have been invented. However strange it may\nseem, the main object of all that has been called science, and the\nruling tendency of science, has been to seek out such excuses.\n\nThis has been the object of the theological sciences and of the science\nof law: this was the object of so-called philosophy, and this became\nlately the object of modern rationalistic science, however strange it\nappears to us, the contemporaries, who use this justification.\n\nAll the theological subtleties which aimed at proving that a certain\nchurch is the only true successor of Christ, and that, therefore, she\nalone has full and uncontrolled power over the souls and bodies of men,\nhad in view this very object.\n\nAll the legal sciences,--those of state law, penal law, civil law, and\ninternational law,--have this sole aim.\n\nThe majority of philosophical theories, especially that of Hegel, which\nreigned over the minds of men for such a long time, and maintained the\nassertion that everything which exists is reasonable, and that the state\nis a necessary form of the development of human personality, had only\nthis one object in view.\n\nComte\'s positive philosophy and its outcome, the doctrine that mankind\nis an organism; Darwin\'s doctrine of the struggle for existence,\ndirecting life and its conclusion, the theory of the diversity of human\nraces, the anthropology now so popular, biology, and sociology,--all\nhave the same aim. These sciences have become favourites, because they\nall serve for the justification of the existing fact of some men being\nable to free themselves from the human duty of labour, and to consume\nother men\'s labour.\n\nAll these theories, as is always the case, are worked out in the\nmysterious sanctums of augurs, and in vague, unintelligible expressions\nare spread abroad among the masses and adopted by them.\n\nAs in olden times the subtleties of theology, which justified violence\nin church and state, were the special property of priests; and among the\nmasses of the people, the conclusions, taken by faith, and ready made\nfor them, were circulated, that the power of kings, clergy and nobility\nwas sacred: so afterwards, the philosophical and legal subtleties of\nso-called science became the property of the priests of science; and\nthrough the masses only the ready-made conclusion, accepted by\nfaith,--that social order (the organization of society) must be such as\nit is, and cannot be otherwise,--was diffused.\n\nSo it is now. It is only in the sanctuaries of the modern sages that the\nlaws of life and the development of organisms are analyzed. Whereas in\nthe crowd, the ready-made conclusion, accepted on trust,--that division\nof labour is a law confirmed by science, and therefore it must be that\nsome starve and toil and others eternally feast, and that this very ruin\nof some and feasting of others is the undoubted law of man\'s life, to\nwhich we must submit,--is circulated.\n\nThe current justification of their idleness by all so-called educated\npeople, with their various activities, from the railway proprietor down\nto the author or artist, is this: We men who have freed ourselves from\nthe common human duty of taking part in the struggle for existence, are\nfurthering progress, and so we are of great use to all human society, of\nsuch use that we counterbalance all the harm we do the people by\nconsuming their labour.\n\nThis reasoning seems to the men of our day to be not at all like the\nreasoning by which the former non-workers justified themselves; just as\nthe reasoning of the Roman emperors and citizens, that but for them the\ncivilized world would go to ruin, seemed to them to be of quite another\norder from that of the Egyptians and Persians; and so also an exactly\nsimilar kind of reasoning seemed in turn to the knights and clergy of\nthe Middle Ages totally different from that of the Romans.\n\nBut it only _seems_. One need only reflect on the justification of our\ntime in order to ascertain that there is nothing new in it. It is only a\nlittle differently dressed up, but it is the same because it is based on\nthe same principle. Every justification of one man\'s consumption of the\nlabour of others, while producing none himself, as with Pharaoh and his\nsoothsayers, the emperors of Rome and those of the Middle Ages and their\ncitizens, knights, priests, and clergy, always consists in these two\nassertions: First, we take the labour of the masses because we are\ndifferent from others, people called by God to govern them and to teach\nthem divine truths: Secondly, those who compose the masses cannot be\njudges of the measure of labour which we take from them for the good we\ndo for them, because, as it has been said by the Pharisees, "This\nmultitude which knoweth not the law are accursed" (John\xc2\xa0vii. 49).\n\nThe people do not understand what is for their good, and therefore they\ncannot be judges of the benefits done to them. The justification of our\ntime, notwithstanding all apparent originality, consists in facts of the\nsame fundamental assertions: First, we are a different people,--we are\nan educated people,--we further progress and civilization, and by this\nfact we procure for the masses a great advantage. Secondly, the\nuneducated crowd does not understand the advantages we procure for them,\nand therefore cannot be judges of them.\n\nThe fundamental assertions are the same. We free ourselves from labour,\nappropriate the labour of others, and by this increase the burden of our\nfellows; and then assert that in compensation for this we bring them a\ngreat advantage, of which they, owing to ignorance, cannot be judges.\n\nIs it not, then, the same thing? The only difference lies in this: that\nformerly the claims on other men\'s labour were made by citizens, Roman\npriests, knights, and nobility, and now these claims are put forward by\na caste who term themselves educated.\n\nThe lie is the same, because the men who justify themselves are in the\nsame false position. The lie consists in the fact, that, before\nbeginning to reason about the advantages conferred on the workers by\npeople who have freed themselves from labour,--certain men, Pharaohs,\npriests, or we ourselves, educated people, assume this position first,\nand only afterwards manufacture a justification for it.\n\nThe very position universally serves as a basis for the justification.\nThe difference of our justification from the ancient ones consists\nmerely in the fact that it is more false and less well grounded. The old\nemperors and popes, if they themselves, and the people, believed in\ntheir divine calling, could easily explain why they were to control the\nlabour of others: they asserted that they were appointed by God himself\nfor this very thing, and from God they had a commandment to teach the\npeople divine truths revealed to them, and to govern them.\n\nBut modern, educated men, who do not labour with their hands, and who\nacknowledge the equality of all men, cannot explain why they and their\nchildren (for education is only by money; that is, by power) should be\nthose lucky persons called to an easy, idle life, out of those millions\nwho by hundreds and thousands are perishing to make it possible for them\nto be educated. Their only justification consists in this, that, just as\nthey are, instead of doing harm to the workers by freeing themselves\nfrom labour, and by swallowing up labour, they bring to the people some\nadvantages, unintelligible to them, which compensate for all the evil\nthey perpetrate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nThe theory by which men who have freed themselves from personal labour\njustify themselves, is, in its simplest and most exact form, this: "We\nmen, having freed ourselves from work, and having by violence\nappropriated the labour of others, we find ourselves better able to\nbenefit them." In other words, certain men, for doing the people a\npalpable and comprehensible harm,--utilizing their labour by violence,\nand thereby increasing the difficulty of their struggles with\nnature,--do to them an impalpable and incomprehensible good. This is a\nvery strange proposition; but the men, both of former as well of modern\ntimes, who have lived on the labour of workmen, believe it, and calm\ntheir conscience by it.\n\nLet us see in what way it is justified, in different classes of men who\nhave freed themselves from labour in our own days.\n\n"I serve men by my activity in church or state,--as king, minister,\narchbishop; I serve men by my trading or by industry; I serve men by my\nactivity in the departments of science or art. By our activities we are\nall as necessary to the people as they are to us."\n\nSo say various men of to-day who have freed themselves from labour.\n\nLet us consider _seriatim_ the principles upon which they base the\nusefulness of their activity.\n\nThere are only two indications of the usefulness of any activity of one\nman for another: (1) an exterior indication,--the acknowledgement of the\nutility of the activity by those to whom it is applied; and (2) an\ninterior indication,--the desire to be of use to others lying at the\nroot of the activity of the one who is trying to be of use.\n\nStatesmen (I include the Church dignitaries appointed by the government\nin the category of statesmen) are, it is said, of use to those whom they\ngovern. The emperor, the king, the president of a republic, the prime\nminister, the minister of justice, the minister of war, the minister of\npublic instruction, the bishop, and all under them who serve the state,\nall live free from the struggle of mankind for existence, having laid\nall the burden of this struggle on someone else, on the ground that\ntheir non-activity compensates for this.\n\nLet us apply the first indication to those for whose welfare the\nactivity of statesmen is bestowed. Do they, I ask, recognize the\nusefulness of this activity?\n\nYes, it is recognized. Most men consider statesmanship necessary to\nthem. The majority recognize the usefulness of this activity in\nprinciple; but in all its manifestations known to us, in all\n_particular_ cases known to us, the usefulness of each of the\ninstitutions and of each of the manifestations of this activity is not\nonly denied by those for whose advantage it is performed, but they\nassert that it is even pernicious and hurtful. There is no state\nfunction or social activity which is not considered by many men to be\nhurtful: there is no institution which is not considered\npernicious,--courts of justice, banks, local self-government, police,\nclergy. Every state activity, from the minister down to the policeman,\nfrom the bishop to the sexton, is considered by some men to be useful\nand by others to be pernicious. And this is the case not only in Russia\nbut throughout the world; in France as well as in America.\n\nThe activity of the republican party is considered pernicious by the\nradical party, and _vice versa_: the activity of the radical party, if\nthe power is in their hands, is considered bad by the republican and\nother parties. But not only is it a fact that the activity of statesmen\nis never considered by all men to be useful, this activity has, besides,\nthis peculiarity, that it must always be carried out by violence, and\nthat, to attain its end, murders, executions, prisons, taxes raised by\nforce, and so on, became necessary.\n\nIt appears therefore that besides the fact that the usefulness of state\nactivity is not recognized by all men, and is always denied by one\nportion of men, this usefulness has the peculiarity of vindicating\nitself always by violence.\n\nTherefore the usefulness of state activity cannot be confirmed by the\nfirst indication,--i.e., the fact that it is recognized by those men for\nwhom it is said to be performed.\n\nLet us apply the second test. Let us ask statesmen themselves, from the\nTsar down to the policeman, from the president to the secretary, from\nthe patriarch to the sexton, begging for a sincere answer, whether, in\noccupying their respective positions they have in view the good which\nthey wish to do for men or something else. In their desire to fill the\nsituation of a Tsar, a president, a minister, a police-sergeant, a\nsexton, a teacher, are they moved by the desire of being useful to men\nor for their own personal advantage? And the answer of sincere men would\nbe that their chief motive is their own personal advantage.\n\nSo it appears that one class of men, who live by the labour of some\nothers who are perishing by these labours, compensate for this\nindubitable evil by an activity which is always considered by a great\nmany men to be not only useless, but pernicious; which cannot be\naccepted voluntarily, but to which men must always be compelled, and the\naim of which is not the benefit of others but the personal advantage of\nthe men who perform it.\n\nWhat is it, then, that confirms the theory that state activity is useful\nfor humanity? Only the fact that the men who perform it firmly profess\nto believe it to be useful, and that it has been always in existence.\nBut so some not only useless, but very pernicious institutions, like\nslavery, prostitution, and wars, have always been in existence.\n\nBusiness people (merchants, manufacturers, railway proprietors, bankers,\nland-owners) believe that they do a good which compensates for the harm\nundoubtedly done by them. On what grounds do they believe this? To the\nquestion, By whom is the usefulness of their activity recognized? men in\nchurch and in state are able to point to the thousands and millions of\nworking-people who in principle recognize the usefulness of state and\nchurch activity. But to whom will bankers, distillers, manufacturers of\nvelvet, of bronzes, of looking-glasses, to say nothing of guns,--to whom\nwill they point when we ask them, Is their usefulness recognized by\npublic opinion?\n\nIf men can be found who recognize the usefulness of manufacturing\nchintzes, rails, beer, and such like things, there will be found also a\nstill greater number of men who consider the manufacture of these\narticles pernicious.\n\nAs for the merchants whose activity is confined to prices, and\nland-owners, nobody would even attempt to justify them.\n\nBesides, this activity is always associated with harm to working-people,\nand with violence, which, if less direct than that of the state, is yet\njust as cruel in its consequences. For the activities displayed in\nindustry and in trade are entirely based on taking advantage of the\nwants of working-people in every form in order to compel them to hard\nand hated labour; to buying cheap, and to selling necessaries at the\nhighest possible price and to raising the interest on money. From\nwhatever point we consider this activity we can see that the usefulness\nof business-men is not recognised by those for whom it is expended,\nneither generally nor in particular cases; and by the majority their\nactivity is considered to be directly pernicious.\n\nIf we were to apply the second test and to ask, What is the chief motive\nof the activity of business-men? we should receive a still more\ndeterminate answer than that on the activity of statesmen. If a\nstatesman says that besides a personal advantage he has in view the\ncommon benefit, we cannot help believing him, and each of us knows such\nmen. But a business-man, from the very nature of his occupations cannot\nhave in view a common advantage, and would be ridiculous in the sight of\nhis fellows if he were in his business aiming at something besides\nincreasing his wealth and keeping it.\n\nAnd, therefore, working-people do not consider the activity of\nbusiness-men of any advantage to them. Their activity is associated with\nviolence; and its object is not their good but always and only personal\nadvantage; and yet, strange to say, these business-men are so assured of\ntheir own usefulness that they boldly, for the sake of their imaginary\ngood, do an undoubted, obvious harm to workmen by extricating themselves\nfrom labour, and consuming the produce of the working-classes.\n\nScientists and artists have also freed themselves from labour by putting\nit on others, and live with a quiet conscience believing that they bring\nsufficient advantages to other men to compensate for it. On what is this\nassurance based? Let us ask them as we have done statesmen and\nbusiness-men. Is the utility of the arts and sciences recognized by all,\nor even by the majority, of working-people?\n\nWe shall receive a very sad answer. The activity of men in the State\nChurch and government offices is recognized to be useful in theory by\nalmost all, and in application by the majority of those for whom it is\nperformed. The activity of business-men is recognized only by those who\nare engaged in it or who desire to practise it. Those who bear on their\nshoulders all the labour of life and who feed and clothe the scientists\nand artists cannot recognize the usefulness of the activity of these men\nbecause they cannot even form an idea about an activity which always\nappears to workmen useless and even depraving.\n\nThus, without any exception, working-people think the same about\nuniversities, libraries, conservatories, picture and statue galleries,\nand theatres, which are built at their expense.\n\nA workman considers this activity so decidedly pernicious that he does\nnot send his children to be taught; and in order to compel people to\naccept this activity it has everywhere been found necessary to introduce\na law compelling parents to send the children to school.\n\nA workman always looks at this activity with ill-will, and only ceases\nto look at it so when he ceases to be a workman, and through gain and\nso-called education passes out of the class of working-people into the\nclass of men who live on the neck of others.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the usefulness of the activity of\nscientists and artists is not recognized and even cannot be recognized\nby any workman, these men are, all the same, compelled to make\nsacrifices for such an activity.\n\nA statesman simply sends another to the guillotine or to prison; a\nbusiness-man, utilizing the labour of someone else, takes from him his\nlast resource, leaving him the alternative of starvation or labour\ndestructive to his health and life: but a man of science or of art\nseemingly compels nobody to do anything; he merely offers the good he\nhas done to those who are willing to take it; but, to be able to make\nhis productions undesirable to the working-people, he takes away from\nthem by violence, through the statesmen, a great part of their labour\nfor the building and keeping open of academies, universities, colleges,\nschools, museums, libraries, conservatories, and for the wages for\nhimself and his fellows.\n\nBut if we were to ask the scientists and artists the object which they\nare pursuing in their activity, we should receive the most astonishing\nreplies.\n\nA statesman would answer that his aim was the common welfare; and in his\nanswer, there would be an admixture of truth confirmed by public\nopinion.\n\nIn the answer of the business-man, there would be less probability; but\nwe could admit even this also.\n\nBut the answer of the scientists and artists strikes one at once by its\nwant of proof and by its effrontery. Such men say, without bringing any\nproofs (just as priests used to do in olden times) that their activity\nis the most important of all, and that without it mankind would go to\nruin. They assert that it is so, notwithstanding the fact that nobody\nexcept themselves either understands or acknowledges their activity, and\nnotwithstanding the fact that, according to their own definition, true\nscience and true art should not have a utilitarian aim.\n\nThese men are occupied with the matter they like, without troubling\nthemselves what advantage will come out of it to men; and they are\nalways assured that they are doing the most important and the most\nnecessary thing for all mankind.\n\nSo that while a sincere statesman, acknowledging that the chief motive\nof his activity is a personal one, tries to be as useful as possible to\nthe working-people; while a business-man, acknowledging the egotism of\nhis activity, tries to give it an appearance of being one of universal\nutility,--men of science and art do not consider it necessary even to\nseem to shelter themselves under a pretence of usefulness, they deny\neven the object of usefulness, so sure are they, not only of the\nusefulness but even of the sacredness of their own business.\n\nSo it turns out that the third class of men who have freed themselves\nfrom labour and laid it on others, are occupied with things which are\ntotally incomprehensible to the working-people, and which these people\nconsider trifles and often very pernicious trifles; and are occupied\nwith these things without any consideration of their usefulness but\nmerely for the gratification of their own pleasure: it turns out that\nthese men are, from some reason or other, quite assured that their\nactivity will always produce that without which the work-people would\nnever be able to exist.\n\nMen have freed themselves from labouring for their living and have\nthrown the work upon others who perish under it: they utilize this\nlabour and assert that their occupations, which are incomprehensible to\nall other men, and which are not directed to useful aims, compensate for\nall the evil they are doing to men by freeing themselves from the\ntrouble of earning their livelihood and by swallowing up the labour of\nothers.\n\nThe statesman, to compensate for the undoubted and obvious evil which he\ndoes to man by freeing himself from the struggle with nature and by\nappropriating the labour of others, does men another obvious and\nundoubted harm by countenancing all sorts of violence.\n\nThe business-man, to compensate for the undoubted and obvious harm which\nhe does to men by using up their labour, tries to earn for himself as\nmuch wealth as possible; that is, as much of other men\'s labour as\npossible.\n\nThe man of science and art, in compensating for the same undoubted and\nobvious harm which he does to working-people, is occupied with matters\nto which he feels attracted and which are quite incomprehensible to\nwork-people, and which, according to his own assertion, in order to be\ntrue, ought not to aim at usefulness.\n\nTherefore, all these men are quite sure that their right of utilizing\nother men\'s labour is secure. Yet it seems obvious that all those men\nwho have freed themselves from the labour of earning their livelihood\nhave no justification for doing so.\n\nBut, strange to say, these men firmly believe in their own\nrighteousness, and live as they do with an easy conscience.\n\nThere must be some plausible ground, some false belief, at the bottom of\nsuch a profound error.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nIn reality, the position in which men who live by other men\'s labour are\nplaced, is based not only on a certain belief but on an entire doctrine;\nand not only on one doctrine but on three, which have grown one upon\nanother during centuries and are now fused together into an awful\ndeceit,--or humbug as the English call it,--which hides from men their\nunrighteousness.\n\nThe oldest of these, which justifies the treason of men against the\nfundamental duty of labour to earn their own living, was the\nChurch-Christian doctrine, which asserts that men by the will of God\ndiffer one from another as the sun differs from the moon and the stars,\nand as one star differs from another. Some men God has ordained to have\ndominion over all, others to have power over many, others, still, over a\nfew, and the remainder are ordained by God to obey.\n\nThis doctrine, though already shaken to its foundations, still continues\nto influence some men, so that many who do not accept it, who often even\nignore the existence of it, are, nevertheless, guided by it.\n\nThe second is what I cannot help terming the State-philosophical\ndoctrine. According to this, as fully developed by Hegel, everything\nthat exists is reasonable, and the established order of life is\nconstant, and is sustained not merely by men, but as the only possible\nform of the manifestation of the spirit, or, generally, of the life of\nmankind.\n\nThis doctrine, too, is no longer accepted by the men who direct social\nopinion, and it holds its position only by the power of inertia.\n\nThe last doctrine, which is now ruling the minds of men and on which is\nbased the justification of leading statesmen, men of business, and\nscience and art, is a scientific one, not in the evident sense of the\nword (meaning knowledge generally), but in the sense of a knowledge\npeculiar in form as well as in matter, termed _Science_. On this new\ndoctrine, the justification of man\'s idleness and the hiding from him\nhis treason against his calling, is particularly based.\n\nThis doctrine appeared in Europe contemporaneously with a large class of\nrich and idle people who served neither the church nor the state and who\nwere in want of a justification of their position.\n\nNot very long ago, before the French revolution in Europe, all\nnon-working people, in order to have a right to utilize other men\'s\nlabour, were obliged to have some definite occupation,--to serve in the\nchurch, the state, or the army.\n\nThe men who served the government, "governed the people"; those who\nserved the church, "taught the people divine truths"; and those who\nserved the army, "protected the people."\n\nOnly these three classes of men--the clergy, the statesmen, and the\nmilitary men--claimed for themselves the right of utilizing labour, and\nthey could always point out their services to the people: the remaining\nrich men who had not this justification, were despised, and, feeling\ntheir own want of right, were ashamed of their wealth and their\nidleness. But as time went on, this class of rich people, who belonged\nneither to the clergy, to the government, nor to the army, owing to the\nvices of these other three classes, increased in number and became a\npowerful party. They were in want of a justification of their position.\nAnd one was invented for them. A century had not elapsed before the men\nwho served neither the State nor the Church and took no part whatever in\ntheir affairs, received the same right to live on labour as the former\nclasses; and they not only left off being ashamed of their wealth and\nidleness but began to consider their position quite justified. And the\nnumber of such men has increased, and is still increasing in our days.\n\nThe most wonderful of all is this, that these men whose claims to be\nfreed from labour were unrecognized not long ago, now consider\nthemselves alone to be fully right and are attacking the former three\nclasses,--the servants of the Church, State, and Army,--alleging their\nexemption from labour to be unjust and often even considering their\nactivity directly pernicious. What is still more wonderful is this, that\nthe former servants of Church, State, and Army, do not now lean on the\ndivinity of their calling, nor even on the philosophy which considers\nthe state necessary for individual development, but setting aside these\nsupports which have so long maintained them, they are now seeking the\nsame supports on which the new reigning class of men, who have found a\nnovel justification, stand, and at the head of which are the men of\nScience and Art.\n\nIf a statesman now sometimes, appealing to old memories, justifies his\nposition by the fact that he was set in it by God, or by the fact that\nthe state is a form of the development of personality, he does it\nbecause he is behind the age, and he feels that nobody believes him.\n\nIn order to justify himself effectually, he ought to find now neither\ntheological nor philosophical but new and scientific supports.\n\nIt is necessary to point to the principle of nationalities, or to that\nof the development of an organism; and to gain over the ruling class, as\nin the Middle Ages it was necessary to gain over the clergy; and as at\nthe end of the last century, it was necessary to obtain the sanction of\nphilosophers, as seen in the case of Frederick the Great and Catherine\nof Russia. If now a rich man, after the old fashion, says sometimes that\nit is God\'s providence which makes him rich, or if he points to the\nimportance of a nobility for the welfare of a state, he does it because\nhe is behind the times.\n\nIn order to justify himself completely he must point to the way he\nfurthers progress by improving the modes of production, by lowering the\nprices of consumption, by establishing intercourse between nations. A\nrich man must think and speak in scientific language, and, like the\nclergy formerly, he must offer sacrifices to the ruling class: he must\npublish magazines and books, provide himself with a picture-gallery, a\nmusical society, a kindergarten or technical school. The ruling class is\nthe class of learned men and artists of a definite character. They\npossess the complete justification for having freed themselves from\nlabour; and on this justification (as in former times on the theological\njustification, and afterwards on the philosophical one) everything is\nbased: and it is these men who now give the diploma of exemption to\nother classes.\n\nThe class of men who now feel completely justified in freeing themselves\nfrom labour, is that of men of science, and particularly of\nexperimental, positive, critical, evolutional science, and of artists\nwho develop their ideas according to the same tendency.\n\nIf a learned man or an artist of the old style speaks nowadays about\nprophecy, revelation, or the manifestation of the spirit, he does so\nbecause he is behind the age, and he will not succeed in justifying\nhimself: to stand firm he must try to associate his activity with\nexperimental, positive, critical science, and he must make this science\nthe fundamental principle of his activity. Only then will the science or\nthe art with which he is occupied appear true, and he will stand on firm\nground, and then there will be no doubt as to his usefulness to mankind.\nThe justification of all who have freed themselves from labour is now\nbased upon this experimental, critical, positive science.\n\nThe theological and philosophical explanations have had their day: now\nthey timidly and bashfully introduce themselves to notice and try to\nhumour their scientific usurper, who, however, boldly knocks down and\ndestroys the remnants of the past, everywhere taking its place, and,\nassured of its own firmness, lifts aloft its head.\n\n_The theological justification_ maintained that men are\npredestined,--some to govern, others to obey; some to live sumptuously,\nothers to labour: and therefore those who believed in the revelation of\nGod could not doubt the lawfulness of the position of those men, who, by\nthe will of God, are called to govern and to be rich.\n\n_The state-philosophical justification_ used to say, "The state with all\nits institutions and differences of classes according to rights and\npossessions, is that historical form which is necessary for the right\nmanifestation of the spirit in mankind; and therefore the situation\nwhich everyone occupies in state and in society according to his rights\nand to his possessions must be such as to ensure the sound life of\nmankind."\n\n_The scientific theory_ says, "All this is nonsense and superstition:\nthe one is the fruit of the theological period of thought, and the other\nof the metaphysical period. To study the laws of the life of human\nsocieties, there is only one sure method,--that of a positive,\nexperimental, critical science. It is only sociology, based on biology,\nin its turn based on all the other positive sciences, which is able to\ngive us new laws for the life of mankind. Mankind, or human societies,\nare organisms either already perfect, or in a state of development\nsubject to the laws of the evolution of organisms. One of the first of\nthese laws is the division of labour among the portions of the organs.\nIf some men govern and others obey, some live in opulence and others in\nwant, then this is so, neither according to the will of God nor because\nthe state is the form of the manifestation of personality, but because\nin societies as in organisms a division of labour takes place which is\nnecessary for the life of the whole. Some men perform in societies the\nmuscular part of labour, and others, the mental."\n\nOn this doctrine is built the ruling excuse of the age.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nChrist teaches men in a new way, and this teaching is written down in\nthe Gospels.\n\nIt is first persecuted, and not accepted. Then the fables of the fall of\nman, and of the first angel, are invented, and these fables are believed\nto be the teaching of Christ. The fables are absurd, they have no\nfoundation whatever, but by virtue of them men are led to believe that\nthey may continue to live in an evil way, and none the less consider\nthemselves as saved by Christ. This conclusion is so agreeable to the\nmass of weak men who have no affection for moral effort, that the system\nis eagerly accepted, not only as true, but even as the Divine truth as\nrevealed by God himself. And the invention becomes the groundwork on\nwhich for centuries theologians build their theories.\n\nThen by degrees these learned men diverge by various channels into\nspecial systems of their own, and finally endeavour to overthrow each\nother\'s theories. They begin to feel there is something amiss, and cease\nto understand what they themselves are talking about. But the crowd\nstill requires them to expound its favourite instruction; and thus the\ntheologians, pretending both to understand and believe what they are\nsaying, continue to dispense it.\n\nIn process of time, however, the conclusions drawn from theological\nconceptions cease to be necessary to the masses, who, then, peeping into\nthe very sanctuaries of their augurs, discover them to be utterly void\nof those glorious and indubitable truths which the mysteries of theology\nhad seemed to be, and see instead that there is nothing there but crude\ndeception, and they marvel at their own blindness.\n\nThe same happened to philosophy, not in the sense of the wisdom of men\nlike Confucius or Epictetus, but with professional philosophy which\nhumoured the instincts of the crowd of rich and idle people. Not long\nago a moral philosophy was in fashion in the learned world, according to\nwhich it appeared that everything that is, is reasonable; that there is\nneither good nor evil; that man has not to struggle with evil, but has\nmerely to manifest the spirit of the age, some in military service, some\nin courts of justice, and some on the violin.\n\nMany and various were the expressions of human wisdom known to the men\nof the nineteenth century,--of Rousseau, Pascal, Lessing, and Spinoza;\nand all the wisdom of antiquity was expounded, but none of its systems\nlaid hold of the crowd. We cannot say that Hegel\'s success was due to\nthe harmony of his theory. We had no less harmonious theories from\nDescartes, Leibnitz, Fichte, and Schopenhauer.\n\nThere was only one reason for the fact that this doctrine became for a\nshort time the belief of the civilized world, the same reason that\ncaused the success of the theory of the fall and redemption of man; to\nwit, that the deductions of this philosophical theory humoured the weak\nside of men\'s nature. It said, "All is reasonable, all is good; nobody\nis to blame for any thing."\n\nAs at first with the church upon theological foundations, so also, with\nthe philosophy of Hegel for a base, a Babel\'s tower was built (some who\nare behind the age are still sitting upon it); and here again was a\nconfusion of tongues, men feeling that they themselves did not know of\nwhat they were talking, but were trying to conceal their ignorance and\nkeep up their prestige before the crowd; and here again the masses found\nconfirmation of their accepted teachings, and believed that whatever\nmight seem to them bewildering and contradictory is as clear as\nday-light on philosophic altitudes. In the same way, the time came when\nthis doctrine wore out and a new one replaced it. It had become useless,\nand the crowd peeped into the mysterious temples of the teachers, and\nsaw there was nothing there--nor ever had been, but obscure and\nunmeaning words. I have seen this in my own day.\n\nWhen I began life, Hegelianism was the order of the day; it was in the\nvery air you breathed; it found its expression in newspapers and\nmagazines, in lectures on history and on law, in novels, in tracts, in\nart, in sermons, in conversation. A man who did not know Hegel had no\nright to open his mouth; those who desired to learn the truth were\nstudying Hegel,--every thing pointed to him; and lo! forty years have\nelapsed and nothing is left of him; there is no remembrance of him; all\nis as though he had never existed. And the most remarkable of all is,\nthat just as false Christianity, so also Hegelianism has fallen, not\nbecause someone refuted or overthrew it; no, it is now as it was before,\nbut both have only become no longer necessary for the learned, educated\nworld.\n\nIf at the present time we speak to any man of modern culture about the\nfall of the angel, of Adam, about atonement, he does not argue or\ndeny;--he simply asks, amazed, "What angel? Adam? What for? What\natonement? What is all this to me?"\n\nSo also with Hegelianism. No one of our day will argue its theses. He\nwill only inquire, "What Spirit?" "Where did it come from?" "With what\npurpose?" "What good will it do me?" Not very long ago the sages of\nHegelianism were solemnly teaching the crowd; and the crowd,\nunderstanding nothing, blindly believed all, finding the confirmation of\nwhat suited them, and thinking that what seemed to them to be not quite\nclear or even contradictory, was clearer than day on the heights of\nphilosophy: but time went on, the theory was worn out, a new one\nappeared in its place, the former one was no longer demanded, and again\nthe crowd looked into the mysterious temples of the augurs and saw there\nwas nothing there, and that nothing had ever been there but words, very\ndark and meaningless.\n\nThis happened within my memory. These things happened, we are told,\nbecause they were ravings of the theological and metaphysical period,\nbut now we have a critical, positive science which will not deceive us,\nbecause it is based upon induction and experience; now our knowledge is\nno longer uncertain as it formerly was, and it is only by following it\nthat one can find the answer to all the questions of life.\n\nBut this is exactly what was said by the old teachers, and they\ncertainly were no fools, and we know that among them were men of immense\nintellect; and within my memory the disciples of Hegel said exactly the\nsame thing, with no less assurance and no less acknowledgment on the\nside of the crowd of so-called educated people. And such men as our\nHerzen, Stankievich, Bylinsky, were no fools either. But why, then, has\nthis wonderful thing happened, that clever men preached with the\ngreatest assurance and the crowd accepted with veneration, only\ngroundless and meaningless doctrines? The reason is only that these\ndoctrines justified men in their bad mode of living.\n\nA very commonplace English writer, whose books are now almost forgotten\nand recognized as the emptiest of all empty ones, wrote a tract upon\npopulation, in which he invented an imaginary law that the means of\nliving do not increase with the increase of population. This sham law\nthe author dressed out with the formul\xc3\xa6 of mathematics which have no\nfoundation whatever, and published it. Judged by the lightness of mind\nand the want of talent displayed in this treatise we might have supposed\nthat it would have passed unnoticed and been forgotten as all other\nwritings of the same author have been; but it turned out quite\ndifferently. The author who wrote it became at once a scientific\nauthority, and has maintained this position for nearly half a century.\nMalthus! The Malthusian theory,--the law of the increase of population\nin geometrical progression, and the increase of means of living in\narithmetical progression, and the natural and prudent means of\nrestraining the increase of population,--all these became scientific,\nundoubted truths which have never been verified, but, accepted as\naxioms, have served for further deductions.\n\nThus learned and educated men were deceived; whereas in the crowd of\nidle men there was a blind and religious trust in the great laws\ndiscovered by Malthus. How did this happen? These statements seem to be\nscientific deductions which have nothing in common with the instincts of\nthe crowd.\n\nBut they are only sacred to those who believe science to be something\nself-existent and infallible, like the Church, and not merely the\nthoughts of weak men liable to mistakes, who only for importance\' sake\ncall their own thoughts and words by a pompous word, _science_. It was\nonly necessary to draw practical conclusions from the Malthusian theory\nin order to see that it was quite a human one with very determinate\naims.\n\nThe deductions which were directly drawn from this theory were the\nfollowing: The miserable condition of working-people does not come from\nthe cruelty, egotism, and unreasonableness of rich and powerful men, but\nit exists according to an unchangeable law which does not depend upon\nman, and, if anybody is to blame, it is the starving working-people\nthemselves: why do these fools come into the world when they know that\nthey will not have enough to eat? and therefore the wealthy and powerful\nclasses are not at all to blame for any thing, and they may quietly\ncontinue to live as they have done.\n\nThis conclusion, being pleasant to the crowd of idle men, induced the\nlearned dons to overlook the incorrectness and total arbitrariness of\nthe deductions; and the crowd of educated, i.e., idle people,\ninstinctively guessing to what these deductions led, greeted the theory\nwith delight, set upon it the seal of truth, and cherished it during\nhalf a century. The reason for all this was, that these doctrines\njustified men in their bad mode of life.\n\nIs not the same cause at the bottom of the self-assurance of men of the\nnew positive, critical, experimental science, and of the reverent regard\nof the crowd to what they preach? At first it seems strange that the\ntheory of evolution (like the theory of atonement in theology, it serves\nfor the majority of men as a popular expression of the new teaching)\nshould justify men in their false lives, and it would seem that the\nscientific theory has only to do with facts, and does nothing but\nobserve facts. But it only seems so.\n\nIt had been so with theological teaching; theology seemed to be occupied\nonly with doctrines and to have nothing to do with the lives of men. It\nhad been so with philosophy, which also seemed to be occupied only with\nfacts.\n\nIt had been so with the teaching of Hegel on a large scale, and with the\ntheory of Malthus on a small one. Hegelianism seemed to be occupied\nmerely with its logical constructions and to have nothing to do with the\nlives of men; and the theory of Malthus seemed to be occupied\nexclusively with statistics.\n\nBut it only seemed so.\n\nModern science also claims to be occupied exclusively with facts: it\nstudies facts.\n\nBut what facts? Why some facts and not others?\n\nThe disciples of the modern science are very fond of saying with a\nsolemn assurance, "We study facts alone," imagining that these words\nhave some meaning.\n\nTo study facts alone is quite impossible, because the number of facts\nwhich may be objects of our study, are, in the strict sense of the word,\ncountless.\n\nBefore beginning to study facts, one must have some theory according to\nwhich the facts are studied; that is, determining which shall be\nselected from the countless number of facts. And this theory indeed\nexists and is even very definitely expressed, though many of the agents\nof modern science ignore it; that is, do not want to know it, or really\ndo not know it;--sometimes pretend not to know it.\n\nThus matters stood before with all most important beliefs.\n\nThe basis of each is always given in theory; and so-called learned men\nseek only further deductions from the various bases given to them,\nthough sometimes they ignore even these.\n\nBut a fundamental theory must always be present, and so it is also now.\nModern science selects its facts on the ground of a determinate theory,\nwhich sometimes it knows, sometimes does not wish to know, sometimes\nreally does not know; but which exists. The theory is this: Mankind is\nan undying organism, having each his special calling for the service of\nthe whole. As the cells, growing into an organism, divide among\nthemselves the labour of the struggle for existence of the whole\norganism, increase one capacity, and diminish another, and all together\nform an organ in order better to satisfy the wants of the whole\norganism; and as among social animals,--ants and bees,--the individuals\ndivide the labour among themselves (queen-bees lay eggs, drone-bees\nfecundate, working-bees labour for the life of the whole),--so also in\nmankind and in human societies there take place the same differentiation\nand integration of the parts. And therefore, in order to find the law of\nman\'s life, we must study the laws of the lives and development of\norganisms. And in these we find the following laws: That each phenomenon\nis followed by more than one consequence. The failure of uniformity. The\nlaw of uniformity and diversity; and so on.\n\nAll this seems to be very innocent, but we need only draw deductions\nfrom these observations of facts in order to see at once to what they\nare tending. These facts lead to one thing,--the acknowledgement of\nhumanity or human society as an organism, and hence to the\nacknowledgment of the division of activities in human society as\norganic, that is necessary; and as there exist in human societies many\ncruelties and vices, therefore these phenomena must not be considered as\ncruelties and vices, but must be accepted as inevitable facts confirming\na general law--i.e., that of "division of labour." Moral philosophy used\nalso to justify every cruelty and wickedness; but there it became\nphilosophical, and therefore incorrect. According to science, however,\nthe same thing turns out to be scientific, and therefore unquestionable.\n\nHow can we help accepting such a fine theory! We need only look at human\nsociety merely as something to be observed, and we may quietly devour\nthe labour of perishing men, calming ourselves with the idea that our\nactivity as a dancing-master, a lawyer, a doctor, a philosopher, an\nactor, an investigator of the theory of mediumism and of forms of atoms,\nand so on, is a functional activity of the organism of mankind and\ntherefore there can be no question whether it is just that I should\ncontinue to live doing only what is pleasant, just as there can be no\nquestion whether the division of labour between a mental and a muscular\ncell is fair or not. How can we help accepting such a nice theory which\nenables us afterwards to put our consciences into our pockets forever,\nand live a completely unbridled, animal life, feeling under our feet a\nfirm, scientific support? And it is upon this new belief that the\njustification of idleness and the cruelty of men is built.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nThis doctrine had its commencement about half a century ago. Its chief\nfounder was the French philosopher Comte. Comte, being a lover of\nsystematic theory, and at the same time a man of religious tendency, was\nimpressed by the then new physiological researches of Bichat; and he\nconceived the old idea, expressed in bygone days by Menenius Agrippa,\nthat human societies, indeed all human-kind, may be regarded as one\nwhole, An Organism, and men--as live particles of separate organs, each\nhaving his definite destination to fulfil in the service of the whole\norganism.\n\nComte was so fascinated by this idea that he founded his philosophical\ntheory on it; and this theory so captivated him that he quite forgot\nthat his point of departure was no more than a pretty comparison,\nsuitable enough in a fable, but in no way justifiable as the foundation\nof a science. As it often happens, he took his pet hypothesis for an\naxiom, and so imagined that his whole theory was based upon the most\nfirm and positive foundations.\n\nAccording to his theory it appeared that, as mankind is an organism,\ntherefore the knowledge of what man is and what his relation to the\nworld ought to be, is only possible through the knowledge of the\nproperties of this organism. And to be able to learn these properties\nman is fitted to make observations upon other lower organisms and to\ndraw deductions from their lives.\n\nTherefore, first, the true and exclusive method of science, according to\nComte, is the inductive one, and science is only science when it has\nexperiment for its basis. Secondly, the final aim and the summit of\nscience becomes the new science concerning the imaginary organism of\nMankind, or the organic being,--Mankind. This new hypothetic science is\nSociology. From this view of science it generally turns out that all\nformer knowledge was false, and that the whole history of mankind, in\nthe sense of its self-consciousness, divides itself into three, or\nrather two, periods. First, the theological and metaphysical period,\nfrom the beginning of the world to Comte. And, secondly, the modern\nperiod of true science, positive science, beginning with Comte.\n\nAll this was very well, but there was one mistake in it, which was this:\nthat all this edifice was built on the sand, on an arbitrary (and\nincorrect) assertion that mankind, collectively considered, was an\norganism.\n\nThis assertion is arbitrary because, if we are to acknowledge the\nexistence of mankind as an organism, which is beyond observation, we\nmight as well acknowledge the existence of the triple God and similar\ntheological propositions.\n\nIt was incorrect, because to the idea of mankind, that is, of men, the\ndefinition of an organism was added, whereas man lacks the essential\ncharacteristics of an organism,--a centre of sensation or consciousness.\nWe call an elephant, as well as a bacterium, organisms, only because we\nsuppose by analogy in these beings that there is unification of\nsensations, or consciousness. But human societies and mankind lack this\nessential; and therefore, however many other general character-signs we\nmay find in mankind and in an organism,--without this, the assertion\nthat man is an organism is incorrect.\n\nBut notwithstanding the arbitrariness and incorrectness of the\nfundamental proposition of Positive Philosophy, it was accepted by the\nso-called "Educated World" with great sympathy, because of that great\nfact, important for the crowd, that it afforded a justification of the\nexisting order of things by recognizing the lawfulness of the existing\ndivision of labour; that is, of violence in mankind. It is remarkable in\nthis respect that from the writings of Comte, composed of two parts,--a\nPositive Philosophy and a Positive Politics,--only the first part was\naccepted on new experimental principles by the learned world, that which\njustified the existing evil in human society. The second part, treating\nof the moral, altruistic duties, following from this recognition of\nmankind as an organism, was considered not only unimportant but even\nunscientific.\n\nHere the same thing was repeated which occurred with the two parts of\nKant\'s writings. The "Critique of Pure Reason," was accepted by science;\nbut the "Critique of Practical Reason," that part which contains the\nessence of moral doctrine, was rejected. In the teaching of Comte, that\nwas recognized to be scientific which humoured the reigning evil.\n\nBut the Positive Philosophy accepted by the crowd, based on an arbitrary\nand incorrect supposition, was by itself too ill-grounded, and therefore\ntoo unsteady, and could not be sustained by itself.\n\nAnd now, among the idle play of ideas of so-called "Men of Science,"\nthere has appeared a similarly arbitrary and incorrect assertion, not at\nall new, to the effect that all living beings (that is, organisms),\nproceed one from another; not only one organism from another, but one\norganism from many; that during a very long period, a million of years,\nfor instance, not only may a fish and a duck have proceeded from one and\nthe same forefather, but also one organism might have proceeded from\nmany separate organisms; so, for instance, out of a swarm of bees a\nsingle animal may proceed. This arbitrary and incorrect assertion was\naccepted by the learned world with still greater sympathy.\n\nThe assertion was arbitrary, because no one has ever seen how one kind\nof organism is made from others; and therefore the hypothesis about the\nOrigin of Species will always remain a mere supposition and never become\nan experimental fact.\n\nThe hypothesis was incorrect, because the solution of the problem of the\nOrigin of Species by the theory of the laws of inheritance and\naccommodation during an infinitely long period, is not a solution of the\nproblem at all, but the mere reiteration of the question in another\nform.\n\nAccording to the solution of this problem by Moses (to oppose which is\nthe object of Comte\'s theory), it appeared that the variety of the\nspecies of living beings proceeded from the will of God and his infinite\nomnipotence. According to the Theory of Evolution, it appears that the\nvariety of species of living beings proceeded from themselves in\nconsequence of the infinite variety of conditions of inheritance and\nenvironment in an infinite period of time.\n\nThe Theory of Evolution, speaking plainly, asserts only that (by chance)\nin an infinite period of time, anything you like may proceed from\nanything else you choose.\n\nThis is no answer to the question; it is simply the same question put\ndifferently: instead of Will is put Chance, and the co-efficient of the\nInfinite is transferred from Omnipotence to Time.\n\nBut this new assertion, enforced by Darwin\'s followers in an arbitrary\nand inaccurate spirit, maintained the first assertion of Comte, and\ntherefore it became the Revelation for our time, and the foundation of\nall sciences, even that of the history of philosophy and religion; and\nbesides, according to the _na\xc3\xafve_ confession of Darwin himself, the idea\nwas awakened in him by the law of Malthus; and therefore he pointed to\nthe "Struggle for Existence" not only of men but of all living beings,\nas a fundamental law of every living thing, and this was exactly what\nwas wanted by the crowd of idle people for their own justification.\n\nTwo unstable theories which could not stand on their own feet supported\neach other, and so received a show of stability. Both the theories bore\nin them a sense, precious to the crowd, that men are not to be blamed\nfor the existing evil in human societies, that the existing order is\nwhat should be; and thus the new theory was accepted by the crowd in the\nsense wanted by them, with full confidence and unprecedented enthusiasm.\n\nThus the new scientific doctrine was founded upon two arbitrary and\nincorrect propositions, accepted in the same way that dogmas of faith\nare accepted. Both in matter and form this new doctrine is remarkably\nlike the Church-Christian one. In matter, the similarity lies in the\nfact that in both doctrines alike a fantastical meaning is attached to\nreally existing things, and this artificial meaning is taken as the\nobject of our research.\n\nIn the Church-Christian doctrine, to Christ who did really exist, is\nattributed the fantastic conception of being God Himself, screened. In\nthe Positive doctrine, to the really existing fact of live men is\nattributed the fantastical attributes of an organism.\n\nIn form, the similarity of these two doctrines is remarkable, since, in\nboth cases, a theory emanating from one class of men is accepted as the\nonly and infallible truth. In the Church-Christian doctrine, the\nChurch\'s way of understanding God\'s revelation to men is regarded as the\nsacred and only true one. In the doctrine of Positivism, certain men\'s\nway of understanding science is regarded as absolutely correct and true.\n\nAs the Church-Christians regard the foundation of their church as the\nonly origin of true knowledge of God, and only out of a kind of courtesy\nadmit that former believers may also be regarded as having formed a\nchurch; so in precisely the same manner does Positive science, according\nto its own statement, place its origin in Comte: and its\nrepresentatives, also only out of courtesy, admit the existence of\nprevious science, and that only as regarding certain thinkers, as, for\ninstance, Aristotle. Both the Church and Positive science altogether\nexclude the ideas of all the rest of mankind, and regard all knowledge\noutside their own as _erroneous_. The similarity persists. Just as to\nthe support of the first advental theological dogmas of the Trinity and\nof the divinity of Christ comes the old--but newly-interpreted--dogmas\nof man\'s fall and of his redemption by the death of Christ, and out of\nthese dogmas is developed popular Church teaching: so in our time, the\nold dogma of Evolution comes in with new importance to help the\nfundamental dogma of Comte concerning the organism of mankind; and from\nthese two elements the popular scientific doctrine has been formed. As\nin one teaching, so in the other: the new dogma is necessary for the\nsupport of the old one, and becomes comprehensible only in connection\nwith it. If to a believer in the Divinity of Christ, it is not clearly\ncomprehensible why God should come down to earth, the doctrine of\natonement explains it. If it is not quite clear to a believer in the\nOrganism of Mankind why a collection of individuals may be counted as an\norganism, the dogma of Evolution is charged with the explanation. This\ndogma is needed to reconcile the contradictions and certainties of the\nfirst: mankind is an organism, and we see that it does not contain the\nchief characteristic of an organism; how must we account for it?\n\nHere the dogma of evolution comes in, and explains, Mankind is an\norganism in a state of development. If you accept this, you may then\nconsider mankind as such.\n\nAs to any man free from superstitions about the trinity and the Divinity\nof Christ, it is impossible even to understand the force and the meaning\nof the teaching of atonement, which meaning comes only through the\nacknowledgment of Christ as God Himself, so a man who is free from the\nPositive superstition cannot even understand wherein lies the interest\nof the theory of the Origin of Species and of Evolution; and this\ninterest is explained only when we learn the fundamental dogma, that\n"Mankind is an Organism." And as the subtleties of theology are only\nintelligible to those who believe in its fundamental dogmas, so also the\nsubtleties of sociology, which now occupy the minds of all adherents of\nthis recent and profound science, are intelligible only to believers.\nThe doctrine of atonement is necessary to reconcile the contradiction\nbetween the first dogma and facts. God descended on earth to save men.\nBut men are not saved. How then explain this? The dogma of atonement\nasserts "He saved those, who believed in atonement. If you believe in\natonement, you are saved."\n\nThe similarity between these two doctrines holds good yet further. Being\nfounded on dogmas accepted by faith, these doctrines neither question\nnor analyze their own principles, which, on the other hand, are used as\nstarting-points for the most extraordinary theories. The preachers of\nthese call themselves, in Theology, sanctified; in Positive knowledge,\nscientific; in both cases, infallible. And at the same time, they\nconceive the most peremptory, incredible, and unfounded assertions,\nwhich they give forth with the greatest pomp and seriousness, and which\nare with equal pomp and seriousness contradicted in all their details by\nothers who do not agree, and yet who equally recognize the fundamental\ndogmas.\n\nThe Basil the Great of scientific doctrine, Herbert Spencer, in one of\nhis first writings expresses these doctrines thus: Societies and\norganisms, says he, are alike in the following points: First, in that,\nbeing conceived as small aggregates, they imperceptibly grow in mass, so\nthat some of them become ten thousand times bigger than their originals.\n\nSecondly, in that, while in the beginning they have such simple\nstructure that they may almost be considered structureless, in their\ngrowth they develop an ever-increasing complexity of structure.\n\nThirdly, in that, though in their early undeveloped period there does\nnot exist among them any dependence of particles upon one another, these\nparticles by and by acquire a mutual dependence, which at last becomes\nso strong that the activity and the life of each part is possible only\nwith the activity and the lives of all others.\n\nFourthly, in this, that the life and the development of society is more\nindependent and longer than the life and the development of every unit\nwhich goes to form it, and which is separately born and growing and\nacting and multiplying and dying while the political body formed of such\ncontinues to live one generation after another, developing in mass, in\nperfection of structure, and in functional activity.\n\nThen follow the points of difference between organisms and societies,\nand it is demonstrated that these differences are only seeming ones, and\nthat organisms and societies are quite similar.\n\nTo an impartial man the question at once arises, What are you speaking\nabout, then? Why is mankind an organism or something similar? You say\nthat societies are similar to organisms according to these four points;\nbut even this comparison is incorrect. You take only a few\ncharacteristics of an organism, and you then apply them to human\nsocieties. You produce four points of similarity, then you take the\npoints of difference which you say are only seemingly so, and you\nconclude that human societies may be considered as organisms. But this\nis nothing else than an idle play of dialectics. On this ground we may\nconsider as an organism everything we choose. I take the first thing\nwhich comes to my mind,--a forest, as it is planted in a field and grows\nup: first beginning as a small aggregate and imperceptibly increasing in\nmass. Secondly, "In the beginning the structure of an organism is\nsimple, then the complexity increases," and so on. This is the case with\nthe forest: at first there are only birch-trees, then hazel, and so on;\nfirst all the trees grow straight, and afterwards they interlace their\nbranches. Thirdly, "The dependence of the parts increases so that the\nlife of each part depends upon the lives and activities of all the\nothers": it is exactly the same with the forest; the nut-tree keeps the\ntrunks warm (if you hew it down, the other trees will be frozen in\nwinter), the underwood keeps off wind, the seed-trees continue the\nspecies, the tall and leafy ones give shadow, and the life of each tree\ndepends upon that of the rest. Fourthly, "Separate parts may die, but\nthe whole organism continues to live." Separate trees perish, but the\nforest continues in life and growth.\n\nThe same holds good with the example so often brought by the defenders\nof the scientific doctrine. Cut off an arm,--the arm will die: we may\nsay remove a tree from the shadow and the ground of a forest, it will\ndie.\n\nAnother remarkable similarity between this scientific doctrine and the\nChurch-Christian one,--and any other theory founded upon propositions\nwhich are accepted through faith,--lies in their mutual capacity of\nbeing proof against logic.\n\nHaving demonstrated that by this theory a forest may be considered as an\norganism, you think you have proved to the followers of the theory the\nincorrectness of their definition? Not at all. Their definition of an\norganism is so loose and plastic that they can apply it to everything\nthey like.\n\nYes, they will say, you may consider the forest, too, as an organism. A\nforest is a mutual co-operation of the individuals who do not destroy\neach other; an aggregate: its parts can also pass into a closer\nrelationship, and by differentiation and integration it may become an\norganism.\n\nThen you will say, that in that case, the birds too and the insects, and\nthe herbs of this forest, which mutually co-operate and do not destroy\neach other, may be considered, with the trees, to be an organism. They\nwould agree to this, too. According to their theory, we may consider as\nan organism every collection of living beings which mutually co-operate,\nand do not destroy one another. You can establish a connection and\nco-operation between everything you like, and, according to evolution,\nyou can assert that from anything may proceed anything else you like, if\na long enough period is granted.\n\nTo those who believe in the Trinity, it is impossible to prove that it\ndoes not exist. But one can show them that their assertion is not based\non knowledge, but is an assertion of faith, and that if they assert that\nthere are three Gods, I have an equal right to assert that there are 17\xc2\xbd\nGods. One may say the same thing with yet better ground to the followers\nof Positive and Evolutional science. On the basis of this science one\ncould undertake to prove anything one liked. And the strangest thing of\nall is, that this same Positive science regards the scientific method as\na condition of true knowledge, and that it has itself defined the\nelements of the scientific method. It professes that common sense is the\nscientific method. And yet common sense itself discloses the fallacies\nof the doctrine at every step. The moment those who occupied the\nposition of saints felt there was no longer anything sacred in them,\nthat they are cursed like the Pope and our own Synod, they immediately\ncalled themselves not merely sacred, but "most sacred." The moment\nscience felt that it had given up common sense, it called itself The\nScience of Reason, The Only Really Scientific Science.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\n"Division of Labour" is the law pervading everything that exists,\ntherefore it must exist in human societies too. That may be so; but the\nquestion still remains, whether the existing division of labour in human\nsociety is the division which ought to exist. And when men consider a\ncertain division of labour unreasonable and unjust, no science whatever\ncan prove to men that what they consider unreasonable and unjust ought\nto continue.\n\nThe theological theory demonstrated that "Power is of God"; and it very\nwell may be so. But the question still remains, To whom is the power\ngiven, to Catherine the Empress, or to the rebel Pugatchof? And no\ntheological subtleties whatever can solve this difficulty. Moral\nphilosophy demonstrates that "A State is merely a form of the social\ndevelopment of the individual"; but the question still remains,--Can the\nstate of a Nero or that of a Gengis Khan be considered a form of such\ndevelopment? And no transcendentalism whatever can solve that\ndifficulty.\n\nIt is the same with Scientific Science also. Division of Labour is the\ncondition of the life of organisms and of human societies; but what have\nwe to consider in these human societies as an organic division of\nlabour? However much science studies the division of labour in the\nmolecules of a tape-worm, all the observations cannot compel men to\nacknowledge as correct a division of labour which is repudiated by their\nreason and conscience. However convincing the proofs of the division of\nlabour in the cells of investigated organisms may be, a man who has not\nyet lost his reason will say it is wrong that some should only weave\ncloth all their long life, and that this is not division of labour, but\noppression of human beings.\n\nHerbert Spencer and others affirm that as there is a whole population of\nweavers, the weaver\'s activity is in organic division of labour. In\nsaying this they use a similar line of reasoning to the theologians:\nThere is a power, therefore it is of God, whatever it may be: there are\nweavers, therefore they exist as a result of the law of division of\nlabour. There might be some sense in this if the power and the position\nof weavers were created by themselves; but we know that they are not but\nthat it is we who create them. Well, then, we ought to ascertain whether\nwe have established this power according to the will of God or of\nourselves, and whether we have called these weavers into being by virtue\nof some organic law or from some other cause.\n\nHere are men earning their living by agriculture, as it is proper for\nall men to do: one man has set up a smith\'s forge and mended his plough;\nhis neighbour comes to him and asks him to mend his plough, too, and\npromises to give labour or money in return. A second comes with a\nsimilar request; others follow; and in the society of these men a form\nof division of labour arises. Thus, one man becomes a smith.\n\nAnother man has taught his children well; his neighbour brings him his\nchildren and asks him to teach them, and thus a teacher is formed: but\nthe smith as well as the teacher become, and continue to be, a smith and\na teacher, only because they were asked, and they remain a smith and a\nteacher only as long as people require their trades. If it happens that\ntoo many smiths and teachers appear, or if their labour is no longer\nwanted, they at once, according to common sense, throw aside their trade\nand become labourers again, as it everywhere and always happens where\nthere is no cause for the violation of a right division of labour.\n\nMen who behave in such a way are directed both by their reason and their\nconscience; and therefore we who are endowed with reason and conscience,\nall agree that such a division of labour is a right one. But if it were\nto happen that smiths, having the possibility of compelling other men to\nlabour for them, were to continue to make horseshoes when there was no\nlonger a demand for them, and teachers were to wish to continue to teach\nwhen there was nobody to be taught, then, to every impartial man endowed\nwith reason and conscience, it would be obvious that this is not real\ndivision of labour but a usurpation of other men\'s labour; because such\na division could no longer be tested satisfactorily by the sole standard\nby which we may know whether it is right or not,--the demand of such\nlabour by other men, and a voluntary compensation offered for it by\nthem. But exactly such a surplus, however, is what Scientific Science\nterms "a division of labour."\n\nMen do what is not required, and they ask to be fed for it, and say it\nis just, because it is division of labour. The chief _social_ evil of a\npeople,--not with us alone,--is the countless horde of State officials.\nThe chief cause of the _economical_ misery of our days, is what is\ncalled in England "over-production" (that is, the production of an\nenormous quantity of articles, wanted by nobody, and which no one knows\nhow to get rid of). All this comes simply from the strange idea about\nthe "division of labour?"\n\nIt would be very strange to see a boot-maker who considered that men\nwere bound to feed him because, forsooth, he continued to produce boots\nwanted by no one; but what shall we say about those men in government,\nchurch, science, and art, who not only do not produce any thing tangibly\nuseful for the people but whose produce is wanted by nobody, yet who as\nboldly require to be well fed and clothed on account of "The division of\nlabour."\n\nThere may be magicians for whose activity there is a demand and to whom\nmen give casks and spirits; but we cannot even imagine the existence of\nmagicians who, while their magic is not wanted by anybody, require to be\nfed simply because they wish to practice their art. Yet in our world\nthis is the very position of the men in church and state, of the men of\nscience and art. And it all proceeds from that false conception of the\ndivision of labour, defined, not by reason and conscience, but by\ndeductions to which these scientists so unanimously resort.\n\nDivision of labour, indeed, has always existed; but it is correct only\nwhen man decides it by his reason and conscience, and not by his making\nobservations on it. And the conscience and the reason of all men solve\nthis question in the simplest and surest way. They always decide the\nquestion by recognizing the division of labour to be right only when the\nspecial activity of a man is so necessary to others, that they freely\noffer to feed him in compensation for what they ask him to do for them.\nBut when a man from his infancy up to his thirtieth year lives on the\nshoulders of other men, promising to do, when he finishes his studies,\nsomething very useful, which nobody has ever asked him for, and then for\nthe rest of his life lives in the same way, promising only to do\npresently something which nobody asks him to do, this would not be a\ntrue division of labour, but, as it really is, only the violation by a\nstrong man of the labour of others; the same appropriation of other\nmen\'s labour by a strong man, which formerly Theology called Divine\npredestination; Philosophy, Inevitable Conditions of Life; and now\nScientific Science, the Organic Division of Labour.\n\nThe entire importance of the ruling science consists in this alone. This\nscience is now the dispenser of diplomas for idleness, because in her\ntemples she alone analyzes and determines what activity in the social\norganism is parasitic and what organic. As if each man could not decide\nmuch better and more quickly, too, by consulting his own reason and\nconscience.\n\nAs formerly, both for clergy and for statesmen, there could have been no\ndoubt as to who were most necessary to other people, so now for the\nbelievers in Positive Science it seems that there can be no doubt about\nthis, that their own activity is undoubtedly an organic one: they, the\nfactors of science and art, are the cells of the brain, the most\nprecious cells of all the human organism.\n\nLet us leave them to reign, eat, drink, and be feasted, as priests and\nsophists of old have before them, so long as they do not deprave men!\n\nSince men are reasonable creatures they have discriminated good from\nevil, making use of what has been done in this direction before them by\nothers, have struggled with evil, seeking a true and better way, and\nslowly but unceasingly have advanced in this way. But always across the\nroad different deceptions stood before them, trying to assure them that\nthis struggle was not at all necessary, and that they should submit to\nthe tide of life. First the awful deceptions of the old Church; little\nby little with dreadful struggle and effort men got rid of them: but\nscarcely had they done so when in their place arose new ones--state and\nphilosophical deceptions.\n\nMen freed themselves from these too, and now a new deceit, a still worse\none, has sprung up in their path,--the scientific deception.\n\nThis new deception is exactly what the old ones were: its essence\nconsists in the substitution of an externality for reason and\nconscience, and this externality is _observation_, as in theology it was\n_revelation_.\n\nThe snare of this science consists in this, that having exposed some\nbare-faced perversions of the activity of reason and conscience, it\ndestroys men\'s confidence in both reason and conscience. Hiding their\nlie clothed in a scientific theory, scientists assure men that by\nstudying external phenomena they study undeniable facts which will\nreveal to them the law of man\'s life. Things which are the property of\nconscience and reason are now to be discovered by observation alone.\nThese men lose the conception of good and evil and thus become unable to\nunderstand those expressions and definitions of good and evil which have\nbeen worked out during the entire former existence of mankind.\n\nAll that reason and conscience say to them, all that they have said to\nthe highest representatives of men since the world has existed, all\nthis, in their slang, is "conditional and subjective." All this must be\nleft behind.\n\nIt is said that by reason one cannot apprehend the truth, because reason\nis liable to error: there is another way, unmistakable and almost\nmechanical,--one must study facts on the ground of science; that is, on\ntwo groundless suppositions, Positivism and Evolution, which are offered\nas the most undoubted truths. With mock solemnity the ruling science\nasserts that the solution of all the questions of life is only possible\nthrough studying the facts of nature, and especially those of organisms.\n\nThe credulous crowd of youth, overwhelmed by the novelty of this\nauthority,--not only not destroyed, not yet even touched by\ncritics,--rush to the study of these facts of natural sciences, to that\n"only way" which, according to the assertion of the ruling doctrine,\nalone can lead to the elucidation of all questions of life. But the\nfarther the students proceed in this study, the farther do they remove\nnot only the possibility of solving the questions of life, but even the\nvery thought of this solution. The more they grow accustomed, not so\nmuch to observe themselves, as to believe other men\'s observations on\ntheir word (to believe in cells, in protoplasm, in the fourth dimension\nof matter, and so on), the more the form hides from them the contents.\nThe more they lose the consciousness of good and evil and the capacity\nof understanding those expressions and definitions of good and evil\nwhich have been worked out in all the former career of mankind, the more\nthey appropriate to themselves that special scientific slang of\n"conditional" expressions which have no common human meaning in them.\nThe farther and farther they get into the thick forest of observations\nlighted by anything, the more they lose the capacity, not only of\nindependent thought, but even of understanding other men\'s fresh human\nideas which are not included in their Talmud. But chiefly they pass\ntheir best years in losing the habit of life, that is, of labour, and\naccustom themselves to consider their own position justified, and thus\nbecome, physically, good-for-nothing parasites, and, mentally, dislocate\ntheir brains and lose all power of thought-production.\n\nSo, their capacities more and more blunted, they acquire by degrees\nself-assurance which deprives them forever of the possibility of\nreturning to a simple, laborious life, and to any plain, clear, common,\nhuman manner of thinking.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nThe division of labour has always existed in human society, and I\ndaresay always will exist; but the question for us is, not if it has\nbeen and will still continue, but, what should guide us in providing\nthat this division may be a right one.\n\nIf we take the facts of observation for our standard, we refuse to have\nany standard at all: for every division of labour which we see among\nmen, and which may seem to us to be right, we shall consider right; and\nthis is what the ruling Scientific Science is leading us to.\n\nDivision of labour!\n\n"Some are occupied with mental and spiritual, others with muscular and\nphysical, labour."\n\nWith what an assurance men express this! They wish to think it, and so\nthat which is transparently the ancient violence, seems to them in\nreality a fair exchange of services.\n\n"Thou," or rather, "you" (because it is always the many who have to feed\nthe one),--"you feed me, dress me, do for me all this rough labour which\nI require of you, and to which you are accustomed from your infancy, and\nI will do for you that mental work to which I have already become\naccustomed. Give me bodily food, and in return I will give you the\nspiritual."\n\nThe statement seems fair; and it would really be so if such exchange of\nservices were free; if those who supply the bodily food were not obliged\nto supply it before they get the spiritual. The producer of the\nspiritual food says, "In order that I may be able to give you this food,\nyou must feed me, clothe me, and remove all filth from my house."\n\nBut the producer of bodily food must do his work without making any\nclaims of his own, and he has to give the bodily food whether he receive\nspiritual food or not. If the exchange were a free one the conditions on\nboth sides would be equal. We agree that spiritual food is as necessary\nto man as bodily. But the learned man, the artist, says, "Before we can\nbegin to serve men by giving them spiritual food, we want men to provide\nus with bodily food."\n\nBut why should not the producers of this say, "Before we begin to serve\nyou with bodily food, we want spiritual food; and until we receive it,\nwe cannot labour?"\n\nYou say, "I require the labour of a ploughman, a smith, a book-maker, a\ncarpenter, masons, and others, in order that I may prepare the spiritual\nfood I have to offer."\n\nEvery workman might say, too, "Before I go to work to prepare bodily\nfood for you, I want the fruits of the spirit. In order to have strength\nfor labouring, I require a religious teaching, the social order of\ncommon life, application of knowledge to labour, and the joys and\ncomforts which art gives. I have no time to work out for myself a\nteaching concerning the meaning of life,--give it to me. I have no time\nto think out statutes of common life which would prevent the violation\nof justice,--give me this too. I have no time to study mechanics,\nnatural philosophy, chemistry, technology; give me books with\ninformation as to how I am to improve my tools, my ways of working, my\ndwelling, its heating and lighting. I have no time to occupy myself with\npoetry, with plastic art, or music. Give me the excitements and comforts\nnecessary for life; give me the productions of the arts."\n\nYou say it would be impossible for you to do your important and\nnecessary business if you were deprived of the labour that\nworking-people do for you; and I say, a workman may declare, "It is\nimpossible for me to do my important and necessary business, not less\nimportant than yours,--to plough, to cart away refuse, and to clean\n_your_ houses,--if I am deprived of a religious guidance corresponding\nto the wants of my intellect and my conscience, of a reasonable\ngovernment which will secure my labour, of information for easing my\nlabour, and the enjoyment of art to ennoble it. All you have hitherto\noffered me in the shape of spiritual food is not only of no use to me\nwhatever, I cannot even understand to whom it could be of any use. And\nuntil I receive this nourishment, proper for me as for every man, I\ncannot produce bodily food to feed you with."\n\nWhat if the working-people should speak thus? And if they did, it would\nbe no jest but the simplest justice. If a workman said this, he would be\nfar more in the right than a man of intellectual labour; because the\nlabour produced by the workman is more urgent and more necessary than\nthat of the intellectual worker, and because a man of intellect is\nhindered by nothing from giving that spiritual food which he promised to\ngive, while the workingman is hindered in giving the bodily food by the\nfact that he himself is short of it.\n\nWhat, then, should we intellectual labourers answer, if such simple and\nlawful claims were made upon us? How should we satisfy these claims?\nShould we satisfy the religious wants of the people by the catechism of\nPhilaret, by sacred histories of Sokolof, by the literature sent out by\nmonasteries and cathedrals? Should we satisfy their demand for order by\nthe "Code of Laws," and cassation verdicts of different departments, or\nby reports of committees and commissions? And should we satisfy their\nwant of knowledge by giving them spectrum analysis, a survey of the\nMilky Way, speculative geometry, microscopic investigations,\ncontroversies concerning spiritualism and mediumism, the activity of\nacademies of science? How should we satisfy their artistic wants? By\nPushkin, Dostoyevsky, Turgenief, L. Tolstoy? By pictures of French\n_salons_, and of those of our artists who represent naked women, satin,\nvelvet, and landscapes, and pictures of domestic life; by the music of\nWagner, and that of our own musicians?\n\nAll this is of no use and cannot be of use because we, with our right to\nutilize the labour of the people and absence of all duties in\npreparation of their spiritual food, have quite lost from sight the\nsingle destination our activity should have.\n\nWe do not even know what is required by the workman; we have even\nforgotten his mode of life, his views of things, his language; we have\neven lost sight of the very working-people themselves, and we study them\nlike some ethnographical rarity or newly-discovered continent. Demanding\nfor ourselves bodily food, we have taken upon ourselves to provide the\nspiritual; but in consequence of the imaginary division of labour,\naccording to which we may not only first take our dinner and afterwards\ndo our work, but may during many generations dine luxuriously and do no\nwork,--we, in the way of compensation for our food, have prepared\nsomething which is of use, as it seems to us, for ourselves and for\nscience and art, but of no use whatever for those very people whose\nlabour we consume under the pretext of providing them in return with\nintellectual food; not only is of no use, but is quite unintelligible\nand distasteful to them.\n\nIn our blindness, we have to such a degree left out of sight the duty we\ntook upon us, that we have even forgotten for what our labour is being\ndone; and the very people whom we undertook to serve we have made an\nobject of our scientific and artistic activities. We study them and\nrepresent them for our own pleasure and amusement: but we have quite\nforgotten that it is our duty, not to study and depict, but to serve\nthem.\n\nWe have to such a degree left out of sight the duty we assumed that we\nhave not even noticed that other people do what we undertook in the\ndepartments of science and art, and that our place turns out to be\noccupied.\n\nIt appears that while we have been in controversy,--now about the\nimmaculate conception, and now about spontaneous generation; now about\nspiritualism, and now about the forms of atoms; now about pangenesis,\nnow about protoplasms, and so on,--all this while the people none the\nless required spiritual food, and the abortive outcasts of science and\nart began to provide for the people this spiritual food to the order of\nvarious speculators, who had in view exclusively their own profit and\ngain.\n\nNow, for some forty years in Europe, and ten years in Russia, millions\nof books and pictures and songs have been circulating; shows have been\nopened: and the people gaze and sing, and receive intellectual food,\nthough not from those who promised to provide it for them; and we, who\njustify our idleness by the need for that intellectual food which we\npretend to provide for the people, are sitting still, and taking no\nnotice.\n\nBut we cannot do so, because our final justification has vanished from\nunder our feet. We have taken upon ourselves a peculiar department: we\nhave a peculiar functional activity of our own. We are the brain of the\npeople. They feed us, and we have undertaken to teach them. Only for the\nsake of this have we freed ourselves from labour. What, then, have we\nbeen teaching them? They have waited years, tens of years, hundreds of\nyears. And we are still conversing among ourselves, and teaching each\nother, and amusing ourselves, and have quite forgotten them; we have so\ntotally forgotten them, that others have taken upon themselves to teach\nand amuse them, and we have not even become aware of this in our\nflippant talk about division of labour: and it is very obvious that all\nour talk about the utility we offer to the people was only a shameful\nexcuse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nThere was a time when the _Church_ guided the intellectual life of the\nmen of our world. The Church promised men happiness, and, in\ncompensation for this she freed herself from taking part in mankind\'s\ncommon struggle for life.\n\nAs soon as she did this she went away from her calling, and men turned\nfrom her. It was not the _errors_ of the Church which originally caused\nher ruin, but the fact that by the help of the secular power, in the\ntime of Constantine, her ministers violated the law of labour; and then\ntheir claim to idleness and luxury gave birth to the errors.\n\nAs soon as she obtained this power she began to care for herself, and\nnot for humanity, whom she had taken upon herself to serve. The\nministers of the Church gave themselves up to idleness and depravity.\n\n_The State_ took upon itself to guide men\'s lives. The State promised\nmen justice, peace, security, order, satisfaction of common intellectual\nand material wants; and, in compensation, men who served the State freed\nthemselves from taking part in the struggle for life. And the State\'s\nservants, as soon as they were able to utilize other men\'s labour, acted\nin the same way as the ministers of the Church.\n\nThey had not in view the people; but, from kings down to the lowest\nstate functionaries, in Rome, as well as in France, England, Russia, and\nAmerica, they gave themselves over to idleness and depravity. Now men\nhave lost their faith in the state, and anarchy is now seriously\nadvocated as an ideal. The state has lost its prestige among men, only\nbecause its ministers have claimed the right of utilizing the people\'s\nlabour for themselves.\n\n_Science and art_ have done the same, assisted by the state power which\nthey took upon themselves to sustain. They also have claimed and\nobtained for themselves the right of idleness and of utilizing other\nmen\'s labour, and also have been false to their calling. And their\nerrors, too, proceeded only from the fact that their ministers, pointing\nto a falsely conceived principle of the division of labour, claimed for\nthemselves the right to utilize the work of the people, and so lost the\nmeaning of their calling, making the aim of their activity, not the\nutility of the people, but some mysterious activity of science and art;\nand also, like their forerunners, they have given themselves over to\nidleness and depravity, though not so much to a fleshly as to an\nintellectual corruption.\n\nIt is said that science and art have done much for mankind.\n\nThat is quite true.\n\nChurch and State have given much to humanity, not because they abused\ntheir power, or because their ministers forsook the common life of men,\nand the eternal duty of labour for life--but in spite of this.\n\nThe Roman Republic was powerful, not because its citizens were able to\nlead a life of depravity, but because it could number among them men who\nwere virtuous.\n\nThis is the case with science and art.\n\nScience and art have effected much for mankind, not because their\nministers had sometimes formerly, and have always at present, the\npossibility of freeing themselves from labour, but because men of\ngenius, not utilizing these rights, have forwarded the progress of\nmankind.\n\nThe class of learned men and artists who claim, on account of a false\ndivision of labour, the right of utilizing other men\'s labour, cannot\ncontribute to the progress of true science and true art, because a lie\ncan never produce a truth.\n\nWe are so accustomed to our pampered or debilitated representatives of\nintellectual labour, that it would seem very strange if a learned man or\nan artist were to plough, or cart manure. We think that, were he to do\nso, all would go to ruin; that all his wisdom would be shaken out of\nhim, and that the great artistic images he carries in his breast would\nbe soiled by the manure: but we are so accustomed to our present\nconditions that we do not wonder at our ministers of science, that is,\nministers and teachers of truth, compelling other people to do for them\nthat which they could very well do themselves, passing half their time\neating, smoking, chattering in "liberal" gossip, reading newspapers,\nnovels, visiting theatres; we are not surprised to see our philosopher\nin an inn, in a theatre, at a ball; we do not wonder when we learn that\nthose artists who delight and ennoble our souls, pass their lives in\ndrunkenness, in playing cards, in company with loose women, or do things\nstill worse.\n\nScience and art are fine things: but just because they are fine things\nmen ought not to spoil them by associating them with depravity;--by\nfreeing themselves from man\'s duty to serve by labour his own life and\nthe lives of other men.\n\nScience and art have forwarded the progress of mankind. Yes; but not\nbecause men of science and art, under the pretext of a division of\nlabour, taught men by word, and chiefly by deed, to utilize by violence\nthe misery and sufferings of the people in order to free themselves from\nthe very first and unquestionable human duty of labouring with their\nhands in the common struggle of mankind with nature.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\n"But," you say, "it is this very division of labour, the freeing men of\nscience and of art from the necessity of earning their bread, that has\nrendered possible the extraordinary success in science which we see\nto-day.\n\n"If everybody were to plough, these enormous results would not be\nattained; you would not have those astonishing successes which have so\nenlarged man\'s power over nature; you would not have those discoveries\nin astronomy which so strike the minds of men and promote navigation;\nthere would be no steamers, railways, wonderful bridges, tunnels,\nsteam-engines, telegraphs, photographs, telephones, sewing-machines,\nphonographs, electricity, telescopes, spectroscopes, microscopes,\nchloroform, Lister bandages, carbolic acid."\n\nI will not attempt to enumerate all the things of which our century is\nproud. This enumeration, and the ecstasy of the contemplation of\nourselves and of our great deeds you can find in almost every newspaper\nand popular book. And these raptures are so often repeated, and we are\nso seldom tired of praising ourselves, that we really have come to\nbelieve, with Jules Verne, that science and art never made such progress\nas in our time. And as all this is rendered possible only by division of\nlabour, how can we avoid countenancing it?\n\nLet us suppose that the progress of our century is really striking,\nastonishing, extraordinary; let us suppose, too, that we are\nparticularly lucky in living at such an extraordinary time: but let us\ntry to ascertain the value of these successes, not by our own\nself-contentment, but by the very principle of the division of labour;\nthat is, by the intellectual labour of scientists for the advantage of\nthe people which has to compensate for the freedom of its servants from\nmanual toil.\n\nThis progress is very striking indeed; but owing to some bad luck,\nrecognized, too, by the men of science, this progress has not yet\nameliorated, but has rather deteriorated, the condition of working men.\n\nThough a working man, instead of walking, can use the railway, it is\nthis very railway which has caused his forest to be burned and has\ncarried away his bread from under his very nose, and put him into a\ncondition which is next door to slavery to the railway proprietor.\n\nIf, thanks to steam-engines and machines, a workman can buy cheap and\nbad calico, it is these very engines and machines which have deprived\nhim of his livelihood and brought him to a state of entire slavery to\nthe manufacturer.\n\nIf there are telegraphs, which he is not forbidden to use but which he\ndoes not use because he cannot afford it, still each of his productions,\nthe value of which rises, is bought up at low prices before his very\neyes by capitalists, thanks to that telegraph, before he has even become\naware that the article is in demand.\n\nIf there are telephones and telescopes, novels, operas,\npicture-galleries, and so on, the life of the workman is not at all\nimproved by any of them, because all, owing to the same unlucky chance,\nare beyond his reach.\n\nSo that, after all, these wonderful discoveries and productions of art,\nif they have not made the life of working-people worse, have by no means\nimproved it: and on this the men of science are agreed.\n\nSo that, if we apply, not our self-contemplating rapture, but the very\nstandard on which the ground of the division of labour is\ndefended,--utility to the working-world,--to the question as to the\nreality of the successes attained by the sciences and arts, we shall see\nthat we have not yet any sound reason for the self-contentment to which\nwe consign ourselves so willingly.\n\nA peasant uses the railway; a peasant\'s wife buys calico; in the cottage\na lamp, and not a pine-knot, burns; and the peasant lights his pipe with\na match,--all this is comfortable; but what right have I from this to\nsay that railways and factories have done good to the people?\n\nIf a peasant uses the railway, and buys a lamp, calico, and matches, he\ndoes it only because we cannot forbid his doing so: but we all know very\nwell that railways and factories were not built for the use of the\npeople; and why, then, should the casual comfort a workman obtains by\nchance be brought forward as a proof of the usefulness of these\ninstitutions to the people?\n\nWe all know very well that if the engineers and capitalists who build a\nrailway or a factory thought about the working-people, they thought only\nhow to make the most possible use of them. And we see they have fully\nsucceeded in doing so in Europe and America, as well as in Russia.\n\nIn every hurtful thing there is something useful. After a house has been\nburned down we can sit and warm ourselves, and light our pipes from one\nof the fire-brands; but should we therefore say that a conflagration is\nbeneficial?\n\nWhatever we do, do not let us deceive ourselves. We all know very well\nthe motives for building railways and factories, and for producing\nkerosene and matches. An engineer builds a railway for the government,\nto facilitate wars, or for the capitalists for their financial purposes.\nHe makes machines for manufacturers for his own advantage and for the\nprofit of capitalists. All that he makes or plans he does for the\npurpose of the government, the capitalists, and other rich people. His\nmost skilful inventions are either directly harmful to the people, such\nas guns, torpedoes, solitary prisons, and so on; or they are not only\nuseless but quite inaccessible to them, such as electric light,\ntelephones, and the innumerable improvements of comfort; or lastly, they\ndeprave the people and rob them of their last kopek, that is, their last\nlabour, for spirits, wine, beer, opium, tobacco, finery, and all sorts\nof trifles.\n\nBut if it happens sometimes that the inventions of men of science and\nthe works of engineers, are of use to the people, as, for instance,\nrailways, calicoes, steel, scythes, it only proves that in this world of\nours everything is mutually connected, and that out of every hurtful\nactivity there may arise an accidental good for those to whom the\nactivity was hurtful.\n\nMen of science and of art could say that their activity was useful for\nthe people, only if in their activity they have aimed at serving the\npeople, as they now aim to serve the government and capitalists.\n\nWe could have said that, only if the men of science and art made the\nwants of the people their object; but such is not the case.\n\nAll learned men are occupied with their sacred businesses, which lead to\nthe investigation of protoplasms, the spectrum analysis of stars, and so\non: but concerning investigations as to how to set an axe, or with what\nkind it is more advantageous to hew; which saw is the most handy; with\nwhat flour bread shall be made, how it may best be kneaded, how to set\nit to rise; how to heat and to build stoves; what food, drink or\ncrockery-ware it is best to use; what mushrooms may be eaten, and how\nthey may be prepared more conveniently,--science never troubles itself,\nor does so very slightly.\n\nYet all this is the business of science.\n\nI know that, according to its own definition, science must be useless;\nbut this is only an excuse, and a very impudent one.\n\nThe business of science is to serve people. We have invented telegraphs,\ntelephones, phonographs, but what improvements have we made in the life\nof the people? We have catalogued two millions of insects! but have we\ndomesticated a single animal since biblical times, when all our animals\nhad long been domesticated, and still the elk and the deer, and the\npartridge and the grouse and the wood-hen, are wild?\n\nBotanists have discovered the cells, and in the cells protoplasms and in\nprotoplasms something else, and in this something else again.\n\nThese occupations will go on for a long time and evidently never end,\nand therefore learned men have no time to do anything useful. Hence from\nthe times of the ancient Egyptians and Hebrews, when wheat and lentils\nwere already cultivated, down to the present time, not a single plant\nhas been added for the nourishment of the people except potatoes, and\nthese were not discovered by science. We have invented torpedoes and\nhouse-drains; but the spinning-wheel, weaving-looms, ploughs and\naxe-handles, flails and rakes, buckets and well-sweeps, are still the\nsame as in the time of Rurik. If some things have been improved, it is\nnot the learned who have improved them, but the unlearned.\n\nThe same is the case with art. Many people are acclaimed as great\nwriters. We have carefully analyzed their works, have written mountains\nof critiques and criticisms upon criticisms, and still more criticisms\non criticisms; we have collected pictures in galleries, and thoroughly\nstudied in detail different schools of art; and we possess symphonies\nand operas that it is with great difficulty we ourselves can listen to;\nbut what have we added to the folk-lore, legends, tales, songs for the\npeople? what pictures, what music, have we created for the people?\n\nBooks and pictures are published, and harmoniums are made for the\npeople, but we did not participate in either.\n\nWhat is most striking and obvious is the false tendency of our science\nand art, which manifests itself in those departments which, according to\ntheir own propositions, would seem to be useful to people, but which,\nowing to this tendency, appear rather pernicious than useful. An\nengineer, a surgeon, a teacher, an artist, an author, seem by their very\nprofessions to be obliged to serve the people, but what do we see? With\nthe present tendency, they can bring to the people nothing but harm. An\nengineer and a mechanic must work with capital: without capital they are\ngood for nothing.\n\nAll their training is of such a nature that, in order to make use of it,\nthey need capital and the employment of work-people on a large scale, to\nsay nothing of the fact that they themselves are accustomed to spend\nfrom fifteen hundred to a thousand rubles a year on themselves, and\ntherefore cannot go to live in a village, since no one there can give\nthem any such remuneration: from their very occupations they are not fit\nfor the service of the people.\n\nThey understand how to calculate the arch of a bridge by means of the\nhigher mathematics, how to calculate power and the transfer of power in\nan engine, and so on: but they are at a loss to meet the plain\nrequirements of common labour; they do not know how to improve the\nplough or the cart; or how to make a brook passable, taking into\nconsideration the conditions of a workman\'s life.\n\nThey know and understand nothing of all this, less even than the poorest\npeasant does. Give them workshops, and plenty of people, order engines\nfrom abroad, and then they will arrange these matters. But to find out\nhow to ease the labour of the millions of the people in their present\nconditions, they do not know, and cannot do it; and therefore, by their\nknowledge and habits and wants, they are not at all fit for this\nbusiness.\n\nA surgeon is in a still worse condition. His imaginary science is of\nsuch a nature that he understands how to cure those only who have\nnothing to do and who can utilize other men\'s labour. He requires a\ncountless number of expensive accessories, instruments, medicines,\nsanitary dwellings, food, and drains, in order that he may act\nscientifically: besides his fee he demands such expenses that, in order\nto cure one patient, he must kill with starvation hundreds of those who\nbear this expense.\n\nHe has studied under eminent persons in the capital cities, who attended\nonly to those patients whom they may take into hospitals, or who can\nafford to buy all the necessary medicines and machines, and even go at\nonce from north to south, to these or those mineral waters, as the case\nmay be.\n\nTheir science is of such a kind that every country surgeon complains\nthat there is no possibility of attending to the work-people who are so\npoor that they cannot afford sanitary accommodations, and that there are\nno hospitals, and that he cannot attend to the business alone, that he\nrequires help and assistant-surgeons.\n\nWhat does this really mean?\n\nIt means this,--that the want of the necessaries of life is the chief\ncause of people\'s misfortunes, and the source of diseases as well as of\ntheir spreading and incurability. Now science, under the banner of "the\ndivision of labour," calls its champions to help the people. Science has\nsettled satisfactorily about the rich classes, and seeks how to cure\nthose who can get everything necessary for the purpose; and it sends\npersons to cure in the same way those who have nothing to spare. But\nthere are no means; and therefore they must be raised from the people,\nwho become ill and catch diseases, and cannot be cured for want of\nmeans.\n\nThe advocates of the healing art for the people say, that, up to the\npresent time, this business has not been sufficiently developed.\n\nEvidently it is not yet developed, because if (which God forbid!) it\nwere developed among our people, and, instead of two doctors and\nmid-wives and two assistant-surgeons in the district, there should be\ntwenty sent, as they want, then there would soon be no one left to\nattend to. The scientific co-operation for the benefit of the people\nmust be of quite a different kind. And this, which ought to exist, has\nnot yet begun.\n\nIt will begin when a man of science, an engineer, or a surgeon, ceases\nto consider lawful that division of labour, or rather that taking away\nother men\'s labour, which now exists, and when he no longer considers\nthat he has the right to take,--I do not say hundreds of thousands,--but\neven a moderate sum of one thousand or five hundred rubles as\ncompensation for his services; but when such a man comes to live among\nlabouring-people in the same condition and in the same way as they, and\napplies his information in mechanics, technics or hygiene, to cure them.\n\nBut at present, scientific men, who are fed at the expense of the\nworkman, have quite forgotten the conditions of the life of these men:\nthey ignore (as they say) these conditions, and are quite seriously\noffended that their imaginary knowledge does not find application among\nthe people.\n\nThe departments of the healing art as well as of the mechanical have not\nyet been touched: the questions how best to divide the period of labour,\nhow and upon what it is best to feed, how best to dress, how to\ncounteract dampness and cold, how best to wash, to suckle, and swaddle\nchildren, and so on, and all these applied to the conditions in which\nthe workers now exist,--all these questions have not yet been faced.\n\nThe same applies to the activity of scientific teachers,--the\npedagogues. Science has arranged this business, too, in such a way, that\nteaching according to science is possible only for those who are rich;\nand the teachers, like the engineers and surgeons, are involuntarily\ndrawn towards money, and among us in Russia especially towards the\ngovernment.\n\nAnd this cannot be otherwise, because a school properly arranged (and\nthe general rule is that the more scientifically a school is arranged\nthe more expensive it is), with convertible benches, globes, maps,\nlibraries, and manuals for teachers and pupils, is just such a school to\nmaintain which it is necessary to double the taxes of the people. So\nscience wants to have it. The children are necessary for work, and the\nmore so with the poorer people. The advocates of science say, "Pedagogy\nis even now of use for the people; but let it develop, then it will be\nstill better." But if it will develop till instead of 20 schools in a\ndistrict there will be 100--all of them scientific,--and the parents\nforced to keep up these schools? Then they will be still poorer, and\nwill want the labour of their children still more urgently.\n\nWhat is to be done then?\n\nTo this they will reply, "The government will establish schools, and\nwill make education obligatory as it is in the rest of Europe." But the\nmoney will still have to be raised from the people, and labour will be\nstill harder for them, and they will have less time to spare from their\nlabour, and there will then be no obligatory education at all.\n\nThere is, again, only one escape,--for a teacher to live in the\nconditions of a workman, and to teach for that compensation which will\nbe freely offered him.\n\nSuch is the false tendency of science which deprives it of the\npossibility to fulfil its duty in serving the people. But this false\ntendency of our educated class is still more obvious in art-activity,\nwhich, for the sake of its very meaning ought to be accessible to the\npeople.\n\nScience may point to its stupid excuse that "science is acting for\nscience," and that, when fully developed it will become accessible to\nthe people; but art, if it is art indeed, ought to be accessible to all,\nespecially to those for whose sake it is created. But our art strikingly\ndenounces its factors in that they do not wish, and do not understand,\nand are not able to be of use to the people. A painter, in order to\nproduce his great works, must have a large studio, in which at least\nforty joiners or boot-makers might work, who are now freezing or\nsuffocating in wretched lodgings. But this is not all: he requires\nmodels, costumes, journeys from place to place. The Academy of Art has\nspent millions of rubles, collected from the people, for the\nencouragement of art; and the productions of this art are hung in\npalaces, and are neither intelligible to the people nor wanted by them.\n\nMusicians, in order to express their great ideas, must gather about two\nhundred men with white neckties or in special costumes, and spend\nhundreds of thousands of rubles arranging operas. But this\nart-production would never appear to the people (even if they could\nafford to use it) as anything but perplexing or dull.\n\nThe authors, writers, would seem not to need any particular\naccommodations, studios, models, orchestras, or actors; but here also it\nturns out that an author, a writer, in order to prepare his great works,\nwants travelling, palaces, cabinets, enjoyments of art, theatres,\nconcerts, mineral waters, and so on; to say nothing of all the comforts\nof his dwelling and all the comforts of his life. If he himself has not\nsaved up enough money for this purpose he is given a pension in order\nthat he may compose better. And, again, these writings, which we value\nso highly, remain for the people, rubbish, and are not at all necessary\nto them.\n\nWhat if, according to the wish of men of science and art, such producers\nof mental food should so multiply, that, in every village it would be\nnecessary to build a studio, provide an orchestra, and keep an author in\nthe conditions which men of art consider indispensable to them? I dare\nsay working-people would make a vow never to look at a picture, or\nlisten to a symphony, or read poetry and novels, in order only not to be\ncompelled to feed all these good-for-nothing parasites.\n\nAnd why should not men of art serve the people? In every cottage there\nare holy images and pictures; each peasant, each woman of the people,\nsings; many have instruments of music; and all can relate stories,\nrepeat poetry; and many of them read. How came it to pass that these two\nthings, which were as much made for one another as a key for a lock,\nwere separated, and why are they so separated that we cannot imagine how\nto re-unite them?\n\nTell a painter to paint without a studio, models, costumes, and to draw\npenny pictures, and he will say that this would be a denial of art as he\nunderstands it. Tell a musician to play on a harmonium and to teach\ncountry-women to sing songs; tell a poet to throw aside writing poems\nand novels and satires, and to compose song-books for the people, and\nstories and tales which might be intelligible to illiterate\npersons,--they will say you are cracked.\n\nBut is it not being worse than cracked when the men who have freed\nthemselves from labour because they promised to provide mental food for\nthose who have brought them up, and are feeding and clothing them, have\nafterwards so forgotten their promise that they have ceased to\nunderstand how to make food fit for the people? Yet this very forsaking\nof their promises they consider dignifies them.\n\nSuch is the case everywhere, they say. Then everywhere the case is very\nunreasonable. And it will be so while men, under the pretext of division\nof labour, promise to provide mental food for the people, but only\nswallow up the labour of the people. Men will serve the people with\nscience and art only when living among them and in the same way as the\npeople do, putting forth no claims whatever, they offer to the people\ntheir scientific and artistic services, leaving it to the free will of\nthe people to accept or refuse them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nTo say that the activities of the arts and sciences have co-operated in\nforwarding the progress of mankind, and by these activities to mean that\nwhich is now called by this name, is as to say that an awkward moving of\nthe oars, hindering the progress of a boat going down the stream, is\nforwarding the progress of the boat; while it only hinders it. The\nso-called division of labour--that is, the violation of other men\'s\nlabour which has become in our time a condition of the activity of men\nof art and science--has been, and still remains, the chief cause of the\nslowness of the progress of mankind.\n\nThe proof of it we have in the acknowledgement that the acquisitions of\nart and science are not accessible to the working-classes because of a\nwrong distribution of wealth. And the incorrectness of this distribution\ndoes not diminish in proportion to the progress of art and science, but\nrather increases. Nor is it astonishing that such is the case; because\nthe incorrect distribution of wealth proceeds solely from the theory of\nthe division of labour, preached by men of art and science for selfish\npurposes.\n\nScience, defending the division of labour as an unchangeable law, sees\nthat the distribution of wealth based upon this division is incorrect\nand pernicious, and asserts that its activity, which recognizes the\ndivision of labour, will set all right again, and lead men to happiness.\n\nIt appears, then, that some men utilize the labour of others; but if\nthey will only continue to do this for a long time, and on a still\nlarger scale, then this incorrect distribution of wealth, that is,\nutilizing of other men\'s labour, will vanish.\n\nMen are standing by an ever-increasing spring of water, and are busy\nturning it aside from thirsty men, and then they assert that it is they\nwho produce this water, and that soon there will be so much of it that\neverybody will have enough and to spare. And this water, which has been\nrunning unceasingly, and nourishing all mankind, is not only not the\nresult of the activity of those who, standing at its source, turn it\naside, but it runs and spreads itself in spite of the endeavours to stop\nit from doing so.\n\nThere has always existed a true church,--in other words, men united by\nthe highest truth accessible to them at a certain epoch,--but it has\nnever been that church which gave herself out for such; and there have\nalways been real art and science, but they were not those which call\nthemselves now by these names.\n\nMen who consider themselves to be the representatives of art and science\nin a given period of time, always imagine that they have been doing, are\ndoing, and the important fact is that they are on the point of making\nwonderful things, and that beyond them there has never been any art or\nscience. Thus it seemed to the sophists, to the scholiasts, alchemists,\ncabalists, Talmudists, and to our own scientific science and to our\nartistic art.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\n"But science! art! You repudiate science, art; that is, you repudiate\nthat by which mankind live."\n\nI am always hearing this: people choose this way to put aside my\narguments altogether without analyzing them. "He repudiates science and\nart; he wishes to turn men back again to the savage state; why, then,\nshould we listen to him, or argue with him?"\n\nBut this is unjust. Not only do I not repudiate science--human\nreasonable activity--and art,--the expression of this reasonable\nactivity,--but it is actually in the name of this reasonable activity\nand its expression that I speak what I do, in order that mankind may\navoid the savage state towards which they are rapidly moving, owing to\nthe false teaching of our time.\n\nScience and art are as necessary to men as food, drink, and\nclothes,--even still more necessary than these; but they become such,\nnot because we decide that what we call science and art are necessary,\nbut because they are truly necessary to men. Now, if I should prepare\nhay for the bodily food of men, my idea that hay is food would not make\nit to be so. I cannot say, Why do you not eat hay when it is your\nnecessary food? Food is, indeed, necessary, but perhaps what I offer is\nnot food at all.\n\nThis very thing has happened with our science and art. And to us it\nseems that when we add to a Greek word the termination _logy_, and call\nthis science, it will be science indeed; and if we call an indecency,\nlike the painting of naked women, by the Greek word "choreography," and\nterm it art, it will be art indeed.\n\nBut however much we may say this, the business which we are about, in\ncounting up the insects, and chemically analyzing the contents of the\nMilky Way, in painting water-nymphs and historical pictures, in writing\nnovels, and in composing symphonies, this, our business, will not become\nscience or art until it is willingly accepted by those for whom it is\nbeing done.\n\nTill now it has not been accepted. If some men only were allowed to\nprepare food, and all others were either forbidden to do it, or be\nrendered incapable of producing it, I daresay that the quality of the\nfood would deteriorate. If the men who had the exclusive privilege of\nproducing food were Russian peasants, then there would be no other food\nthan black bread, kvas, potatoes, and onions, which they are fond of,\nand which is agreeable to them. The same would be the case with that\nhighest human activity in art and science if their exclusive privilege\nwere appropriated by one caste, with this difference only, that in\nbodily food there cannot be too great digressions from the\nnatural;--bread as well as onions, though unsavoury food, is still\neatable:--but in mental food there may be great digressions; and some\nmen may for a very long time feed upon an unnecessary, or even hurtful\nand poisonous, mental food; they themselves may slowly kill themselves\nwith opium or with spirits, and this sort of food they may offer to the\nmasses of the people.\n\nThis very thing has happened to us. And it has happened because men of\nart and science are in privileged conditions; because art and science in\nour world are not that mental activity of all mankind, without any\nexception, who separate their best powers for the service of art and\nscience: but it is the activity of a small company of men having the\nmonopoly of these occupations, and calling themselves scientists and\nartists; and therefore they have perverted the very conceptions of art\nand science, and lost the sense of their own calling, and are merely\noccupied in amusing a small company of parasites and saving them from\nburdensome dulness.\n\nSince men have existed, they have always had science in the plainest and\nlargest sense of the word. Science, as the sum of all human information,\nhas always been in existence; and without it life is not conceivable,\nand there is no necessity whatever either to attack or to defend it.\n\nBut the fact is this, that the reason of this knowledge is so various,\nso much information of all kinds enters into it, from information how to\nobtain iron up to the knowledge about movements of the celestial bodies,\nthat man would be lost among all this varied information if he had no\nclew to help him to decide which of all these kinds of information is\nmore important, and which less.\n\nTherefore, the highest wisdom of men has always consisted in finding out\nthe clew whereby to arrange the information of men, and to decide what\nkinds of information are more, and what are less, important. This which\nhas directed all other knowledge, men have always called science in the\nstrictest sense of the word. Such science has always been, up to the\npresent time, in human societies which have left the savage state behind\nthem. Since mankind has existed teachers have appeared in every nation\nto form science in this strict sense,--the science about what it is most\nnecessary for men to know. The object of this science has always been\nthe inquiry as to what was the destiny, and therefore the true welfare,\nof each man and of all men. This science has served as a clew to\ndetermine the importance and the expression of all other sciences. Such\ninformation and art as co-operated with the science of man\'s destiny and\nwelfare were considered highest in public opinion.\n\nSuch was the science of Confucius, Buddha, Moses, Socrates, Christ,\nMohammed,--science such as it has been understood by all men save our\nown circle of so-called educated people.\n\nSuch a science has not only always occupied the first place, but it is\nthe one science which has determined the importance of other sciences.\nAnd this, not at all because so-called learned men of our time imagine\nthat it is only deceitful priests and teachers of this science who have\ngiven it such an importance, but because, as, indeed, everyone can learn\nby his own inward experience, without the science of man\'s destiny and\nwelfare, there cannot be any determining of other values, or any choice\nof art and science for man. And, therefore, there cannot be any study of\nscience, for there are _innumerable_ quantities of subjects to which\nscience may be applied. I italicize the word innumerable, as I use it in\nits exact value.\n\nWithout knowledge as to what constitutes the calling and welfare of all\nmen, all other arts and sciences become, as is really the case with us\nat present, only an idle and pernicious amusement. Mankind have been\nliving long, and they have never been living without a science relative\nto the calling and welfare of men: it is true that the science of the\nwelfare of men to a superficial observation appears to be different with\nBuddists, Brahmins, Hebrews, Christians, with the followers of Confucius\nand those of Laotse, though one need only reflect on these teachings in\norder to see their essential unity; where men have left the savage state\nbehind them, we find this science; and now of a sudden it turns out that\nmodern men have decided that this very science which has been till now\nthe guide of all human information, is the obstacle in the way of\neverything.\n\nMen build houses; one architect makes one estimate, another makes a\nsecond, and so on. The estimates are a little different, but they are\nseparately correct; and every one sees that, if each estimate is\nfulfilled, the house will be erected. Such architects are Confucius,\nBuddha, Moses, Christ. And now certain men come and assure us that the\nchief thing to come by is the absence of any estimate, and that men\nought to build anyhow according to eyesight. And this "anyhow" these men\ncall the most exact science, as the Pope terms himself the "most holy."\n\nMen deny every science, the most essential science of men\'s calling and\nwelfare; and this denial of science they call science. Since men have\nexisted, great intellects have always appeared, which, in the struggle\nwith the demands of their reason and conscience, have put to themselves\nquestions concerning the calling and welfare, not only of themselves\nindividually, but of every man. What does that Power, which created me,\nrequire from me and from each man? And what am I to do in order to\nsatisfy the craving ingrafted in me for a personal and a common welfare?\n\nThey have asked themselves, I am a whole and a part of something\nunfathomable, infinite: what are to be my relations to other parts\nsimilar to me,--to men and to the whole?\n\nAnd from the voice of conscience and from reason, and from consideration\non what men have said who lived before, and from contemporaries who have\nasked themselves the same questions, these great teachers have deduced\nteachings,--plain, clear, intelligible to all men, and always such as\ncan be put into practice.\n\nSuch men were of the first, second, third, and all magnitudes. The world\nis full of such men. All living men put to themselves the question, How\nam I to reconcile my own demands for personal life with conscience and\nreason, which demand the common good of all men? And out of this common\ntravail new forms of life are evolved slowly, but unceasingly,\nsatisfying more and more the demands of reason and conscience.\n\nAnd of a sudden a new caste of men appears, who say, All these are\nnonsense, and are to be left behind. This is the deductive way of\nthinking (though wherein lies the difference between the inductive and\nthe deductive way of thinking, nobody ever has been able to understand),\nand this is also the method of the theological and metaphysical periods.\n\nAll that men have understood by inward experience, and have related to\neach other concerning the consciousness of the law of their own life\n(functional activity, in their cant phrase); all that from the beginning\nof the world has been done in this direction by the greatest intellects\nof mankind,--all these are trifles, having no weight whatever.\n\nAccording to this new teaching, you are the cell of an organism, and the\nproblem of your reasonable activity consists in trying to ascertain your\nfunctional activity. In order to ascertain this, you must make\nobservations outside yourself.\n\nThe fact that you are a cell which thinks, suffers, speaks, and\nunderstands, and that for that very reason you can inquire of another\nsimilar speaking, suffering cell whether he or she suffers and rejoices\nin the same way as yourself, and that thus you may verify your own\nexperience; and the fact that you may make use of what the speaking\ncells, who lived and suffered before you wrote on the subject; and your\nknowledge that millions of cells agreeing with what the past cells have\nwritten, confirm your own experience, that you yourself are a living\ncell, who always, by a direct inward experience, apprehend the\ncorrectness or incorrectness of your own functional activity,--all this\nmeans nothing, we are told: it is all a false and evil method.\n\nThe true scientific method is this: If you wish to learn in what your\nfunctional activity consists, what is your destiny and welfare, and what\nthe destiny of mankind, and of the whole world, then first you must\ncease to listen to the voice and demands of your conscience and of your\nreason, which manifest themselves inwardly to you and to your\nfellow-men; you must leave off believing all that the great teachers of\nhumanity have said about their own conscience and reason, and you must\nconsider all this to be nonsense, and begin at the beginning.\n\nAnd in order to begin from the beginning, you have to observe through a\nmicroscope the movements of amoeb\xc3\xa6 and the cells of tape-worms; or,\nstill easier, you must believe everything that people with the diploma\nof infallibility may tell you about them. And observing the movements of\nthese amoeb\xc3\xa6 and cells, or reading what others have seen, you must\nascribe to these cells your own human feelings and calculations as to\nwhat they desire, what are their tendencies, their reflections and\ncalculations, their habits; and from these _observations_ (in which each\nword contains some mistake of thought or of expression), according to\nanalogy, you must deduce what is your own destiny, and what that of\nother cells similar to you.\n\nIn order to be able to understand yourself, you must study not merely\nthe tape-worm which you see, but also microscopic animalcules which you\ncannot see, and the transformation from one set of things into another,\nwhich neither you nor anybody else has ever seen, and which you\ncertainly will never see.\n\nThe same holds good with art. Wherever a true science has existed, it\nhas been expressed by art. Since men have existed they have always\nseparated out of all their activities, from their varied information,\nthe chief expression of science, the knowledge of man\'s destination and\nwelfare; and art, in the strict sense of the word, has been the\nexpression of this.\n\nSince men have existed, there have always been persons particularly\nsensitive to the teaching of man\'s welfare and destiny, who have\nexpressed in word, and upon psaltery and cymbals, their human struggle\nwith deceit which led them aside from their true destiny, and their\nsufferings in this struggle, their hopes about the victory of good,\ntheir despair about the triumph of evil, and their raptures in\nexpectation of coming welfare.\n\nSince men have existed, the true art, that which has been valued most\nhighly by men, had no other destiny than to be the expression of science\non man\'s destiny and welfare.\n\nAlways down to the present time art has served the teaching of life\n(afterwards called religion), and it has only been this art which men\nhave valued so highly.\n\nBut contemporaneously with the fact that in place of the science of\nman\'s destiny and welfare appears the science of universal\nknowledge,--since science lost its own sense and meaning, and true\nscience has been scornfully called religion,--true art, as an important\nactivity of men, has disappeared.\n\nAs long as the church existed, and taught men\'s calling and welfare, art\nserved the church, and was true; but from the moment it left the church,\nand began to serve a science which served everything it met, art lost\nits meaning, and, notwithstanding its old-fashioned claims, and a stupid\nassertion that art serves merely art itself, and nothing else, it has\nturned out to be a trade which procures luxuries for men, and\nunavoidably mixes itself with choreography, culinary art, hair-dressing,\nand cosmetics, the producers of which may call themselves artists with\nas much right as the poets, painters, and musicians of our day.\n\nLooking back, we see that during thousands of years, from among\nthousands of millions of men who have lived, there came forth a few like\nConfucius, Buddha, Solon, Socrates, Solomon, Homer, Isaiah, David. True\nartist-producers of spiritual food seem to appear seldom among men,\nnotwithstanding the fact that they appear, not from one caste only, but\nfrom among all men; and it is not without cause that mankind have always\nso highly valued them. And now it turns out that we have no longer any\nneed of all these former great factors of art and science.\n\nNow, according to the law of the division of labour, it is possible to\nmanufacture scientific and artistic factors almost mechanically; and in\nthe space of ten years we shall manufacture more great men of art and\nscience than have been born among all men from the beginning of the\nworld. Nowadays there is a trade corporation of learned men and artists,\nand by an improved way they prepare all the mental food which is wanted\nby mankind. And they have prepared so much of it, that there need no\nlonger be any remembrance of the old producers, not only of the very\nancient, but also of the more recent,--all their activity, we are told,\nwas the activity of the theological and metaphysical period: all had to\nbe destroyed, and the true, mental activity began some fifty years ago.\n\nAnd in these fifty years we have manufactured so many great men that in\na German university there are more of them than have been in the whole\nworld, and of sciences we have manufactured a great number too; for one\nneed only put to a Greek word the termination _logy_, and arrange the\nsubject according to ready-made paragraphs, and the science is created:\nwe have thus manufactured so many sciences that not only cannot one man\nknow them all, but he cannot even remember all their names,--these names\nalone would fill a large dictionary; and every day new sciences come\ninto existence.\n\nIn this respect we are like that Finnish teacher who taught the children\nof a land-owner the Finnish language instead of the French. He taught\nvery well; but there was one drawback,--that nobody, except himself,\nunderstood it. We have learned everything very well, but the pity of it\nis that nobody but ourselves understands it, and that everybody else\nconsiders it good-for-nothing nonsense.\n\nBut to this also there is an explanation: Men do not understand all the\nutility of the scientific science because they are still under the\ninfluence of the theological period of knowledge, that stupid period\nwhen all the people of the Hebrew race, as well as the Chinese and\nIndians and Greeks, understood everything spoken to them by their great\nteachers.\n\nBut whatever may be the cause, the fact is this,--that art and science\nhave always existed among mankind; and when they really existed, then\nthey were necessary and intelligible to all men.\n\nWe are busy about something which we call art and science, and it turns\nout that what we are busy about is neither necessary nor intelligible to\nmen. So that we have no right to give the name of art or science to our\ndoings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nBut it is said to me, "You only give another narrower definition of art\nand science, which science does not agree with; but even this does not\nexclude them, and notwithstanding all you say, there still remains the\nscientific and art activities of men like Galileo, Bruno, Homer, Michael\nAngelo, Beethoven, Wagner, and other learned men and artists of lesser\nmagnitude who have devoted all their lives to art and science."\n\nUsually this is said in the endeavour to establish a link, which in\nother cases they disown, to connect the activity of the former learned\nmen and artists with the modern ones, trying to forget that new\nprinciple of the division of labour by reason of which art and science\nnow occupy a privileged position.\n\nFirst of all, it is not possible to establish any such connection\nbetween the former factors and the modern ones, even as the holy life of\nthe first Christian has nothing in common with the lives of popes: thus,\nthe activity of men like Galileo, Shakespeare, Beethoven, has nothing in\ncommon with the activities of men like Tyndal, Hugo, and Wagner. As the\nHoly Fathers would have denied any connection with the Popes, so the\nancient factors of science would have denied any relationship with the\nmodern ones.\n\nSecondly, owing to that importance which art and science ascribe to\nthemselves, they have established a very clear standard by means of\nwhich we are able to determine whether they do, or do not, fulfil their\ndestiny; and we therefore decide, not without proofs, but according to\ntheir own standard, whether that activity which calls itself art and\nscience has, or has not, any right thus to call itself.\n\nThough the Egyptians or Greek priests performed mysteries known to none\nbut themselves, and said that these mysteries included all art and\nscience, I could not, on the ground of the asserted utility of these to\nthe people, ascertain the reality of their science, because this said\nscience, according to their _ipse dixit_, was a supernatural one: but\nnow we all have a very clear and plain standard, excluding everything\nsupernatural; art and science promise to fulfil the mental activity of\nmankind, for the welfare of society, or even of the whole of mankind.\nTherefore we have a right to call only such activity, art and science,\nwhich has this aim in view, and attains it. And therefore, however those\nlearned men and artists may call themselves, who excogitate the theory\nof penal laws, of state laws, and of the laws of nations, who invent new\nguns and explosive substances, who compose obscene operas and operettas,\nor similarly obscene novels, we have no right to call such activity the\nactivity of art and science, because this activity has not in view the\nwelfare of the society or of mankind, but on the contrary is directed to\nthe harm of men.\n\nIn like manner, however these learned men may call themselves, who in\ntheir simplicity are occupied during all their lives with the\ninvestigations of the microscopical animalcule and of telescopical and\nspectral phenomena; or those artists who, after having carefully\ninvestigated the monuments of old times, are busy writing historical\nnovels, making pictures, concocting symphonies and beautiful verses, all\nthese men, notwithstanding all their zeal, cannot, according to the\ndefinition of their own science, be called men of science or art, first\nbecause their activity in science for the sake of science, and of art\nfor art, has not in view man\'s welfare; and secondly, because we do not\nsee any results of these activities for the welfare of society or\nmankind.\n\nThe fact that sometimes something useful or agreeable for some men comes\nof their activities, by no means gives us any right, according to their\nown scientific definition, to consider them to be men of art and\nscience.\n\nIn like manner, however those men may call themselves who excogitate the\napplication of electricity to lighting, heating, and motion; or who\ninvent some new chemical combinations, producing dynamite or fine\ncolours; men who correctly play Beethoven\'s symphonies; who act on the\nstage, or paint portraits well, domestic pictures, landscapes, and other\npictures; who compose interesting novels, the object of which is merely\nto amuse rich people,--the activity of these men cannot be called art\nand science, because this activity is not directed, like the activity of\nthe brain in the organism, to the welfare of the whole, but is guided\nmerely by personal gain, privileges, money, which one obtains for the\ninventing and producing of so-called art. Therefore this activity cannot\npossibly be separated from other covetous, personal activity, which adds\nagreeable things to life, as the activity of innkeepers, jockeys,\nmilliners, prostitutes, and so on, because the activity of the first,\nthe second, and the last, do not come under the definition of art and\nscience, on the ground of the division of labour, which promises to\nserve for the welfare of all mankind.\n\nThe scientific definition of art and science is a correct one; but\nunluckily, the activity of modern art and science does not come under\nit. Some produce directly hurtful things, others useless things; and a\nthird party invents trifles fit only for the use of rich people. They\nmay all be very good persons, but they do not fulfil what they have\ntaken upon themselves to fulfil, according to their own definition; and\ntherefore they have as little right to call themselves men of art and\nscience as the modern clergy, who do not fulfil their duties, have right\nto consider themselves the bearers and teachers of divine truth.\n\nIt is not difficult to understand why the factors of modern art and\nscience have not fulfilled their calling, and cannot fulfil it. They do\nnot fulfil it, because they have converted their duty into a right. The\nscientific and art activities, in their true sense, are fruitful only\nwhen they ignore their rights, and know only their duties. Mankind value\nthis activity so highly, only because it is a self-denying one.\n\nIf men are really called to serve others by _mental_ labour, they will\nhave to suffer in performing this labour, because it is only by\nsuffering that spiritual fruit is produced. Selfdenying and suffering\nare the lot and portion of a thinker and an artist, because their object\nis the welfare of men. Men are wretched: they suffer and go to ruin. One\ncannot wait and lose one\'s time.\n\nA thinker and an artist will never sit on the heights of Olympus, as we\nare apt to imagine: he must suffer in company with men in order to find\nsalvation or consolation. He will suffer because he is constantly in\nanxiety and agitation; he might have found out and told what would give\nhappiness to men, might have saved them from suffering; and he has\nneither found it out nor said it, and to-morrow it may be too late--he\nmay die. And therefore suffering and self-sacrifice will always be the\nlot of the thinker and the artist.\n\nHe who is brought up in an establishment where learned men and artists\nare created (but, in reality, they create only destroyers of art and\nscience), and who obtains a diploma, and is well provided for, for life,\nwill not become a thinker or an artist, but he who would gladly abstain\nfrom thinking, and from expressing that which is ingrafted in his soul,\nbut which he dare not overlook, being drawn to it by two irresistible\npowers,--his own inward impulse and the wants of men.\n\nThinkers and artists cannot be sleek, fat men, enjoying themselves in\nself-conceit. Spiritual and mental activity and their expressions are\nreally necessary for others, and are the most difficult of men\'s\ncallings,--a cross, as it is called in the gospel.\n\nThe only one certain characteristic of the presence of a calling is this\nself-denying,--the sacrifice of one\'s self in order to manifest the\npower ingrafted in man for the benefit of others. To teach how many\ninsects there are in the world, and to observe the spots on the sun, to\nwrite novels and operas, can be done without suffering; but to teach men\ntheir welfare, which entirely consists in self denial and in serving\nothers, and to express this teaching powerfully, cannot be done without\nself-denial.\n\nThe Church existed in her purity as long as her teachers endured\npatiently and suffered; but as soon as they became fat and sleek, their\nteaching activity ended. "Formerly," say the people, "priests were of\ngold, and chalices of wood; now chalices are of gold, and priests of\nwood." It was not in vain that Jesus Christ died on a cross: it is not\nin vain that sacrifice and suffering conquer every thing.\n\nAs for our art and sciences, they are provided for: they have diplomas,\nand everybody only thinks about how to provide still better for them;\nthat is, to make it impossible for them to serve men. A true art and a\ntrue science have two unmistakable characteristics,--the first, an\ninterior one, that a minister of art or science fulfils his calling, not\nfor the sake of gain, but with self-denial; and the second, an exterior\none, that his productions are intelligible to all men, whose welfare he\nis aiming at.\n\nWhatever men may consider to be their destiny and welfare, science will\nbe the teacher of this destiny and welfare, and art the expression of\nthis teaching. The laws of Solon, of Confucius, are science; the\nteachings of Moses, of Christ, are science; the temples in Athens, the\npsalms of David, church worship, are art: but finding out the fourth\ndimension of matter, and tabulating chemical combinations, and so on,\nhave never been, and never will be, science.\n\nThe place of true science is occupied, in our time, by theology and law;\nthe place of true art is occupied by the church and state ceremonies, in\nwhich nobody believes, and which are not considered seriously by\nanybody; while that which with us is called art and science, is only the\nproduction of idle minds and feelings desirous to stimulate similarly\nidle minds and feelings, and unintelligible and dumb for the people,\nbecause they have not their welfare in view.\n\nSince we have known the lives of men, we have always and everywhere\nfound a ruling false doctrine, calling itself science, which does not\nshow men the true meaning of life, but rather hides it from them.\n\nSo it was among the Egyptians, the Indians, the Chinese, and partially\namong the Greeks (sophists); and among the mystics, Gnostics, and\ncabalists; in the Middle Ages, in theology, scholasticism, alchemy; and\nso on down to our days. How fortunate indeed we are to be living in such\na peculiar time, when that mental activity which calls itself science is\nnot only free from errors, but, we are assured, is in a state of\npeculiar progress! Does not this good fortune come from the fact that\nman can not and will not see his own deformities? While of the sciences\nof theologians, and that of cabalists, nothing is left but empty words,\nwhy should we be so particularly fortunate?\n\nThe characteristics of our times and of former times are quite similar;\nthere is the same self-conceit and blind assurance that we only are on\nthe true way, and that only with us true knowledge begins; there are the\nsame expectations that we shall presently discover something very\nwonderful; and there is the same exposure of our error, in the fact that\nall our wisdom remains with us, while the masses of the people do not\nunderstand it, and neither accept nor need it. Our position is a very\ndifficult one, but why should we not look it in the face?\n\nIt is time to come to our senses, and to look more closely to ourselves.\nWe are, indeed, nothing but scribes and Pharisees, who, sitting in\nMoses\' seat, and having the key of the kingdom of God, do not enter\nthemselves, and refuse entrance to others.\n\nWe, priests of art and science, are most wretched deceivers, who have\nmuch less right to our position than the most cunning and depraved\npriests ever had.\n\nFor our privileged position, there is no excuse whatever: we have taken\nup this position by a kind of swindling, and we retain it by deceit.\nPagan priests, the clergy, Russian as well as Roman Catholic, however\ndepraved they may have been, had rights to their position, because they\nprofessed to teach men about life and salvation. And we, who have cut\nthe ground from under their feet, and proved to men that they were\ndeceivers, we have taken their place, and not only do not teach men\nabout life, we even acknowledge that there is no necessity for them to\nlearn. We suck the blood of the people, and for this we teach our\nchildren Greek and Latin grammars so that they also may continue the\nsame parasitic life which we are living.\n\nWe say, There have been castes, we will abolish them. But what means the\nfact that some men and their children work, and other men and their\nchildren do not work?\n\nBring a Hindu who does not know our language, and show him the Russian\nand the European lives of many generations, and he will recognize the\nexistence of two important definite castes of working-people and of\nnon-working people as they are in existence in his own country. As in\nhis country, so also among us, the right of not working is acquired\nthrough a peculiar initiation which we call art and science, and\neducation generally.\n\nIt is this education, and the perversions of reason associated with it,\nthat have brought to us this wonderful folly, whence it has come to pass\nthat we do not see what is so plain and certain. We are eating up the\nlives of our brethren, and consider ourselves to be Christians, humane,\neducated, and quite in the right.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\nWhat is to be done? What must we do?\n\nThis question, which includes acknowledgment of the fact that our life\nis bad and unrighteous, and at the same time hints that there is no\npossibility of changing it,--this question I hear everywhere, and\ntherefore I chose it for the title of my work.\n\nI have described my own sufferings, my search, and the answer which I\nhave found to this question.\n\nI am a man like others; and if I distinguish myself from an average man\nof my own circle in any thing, it is chiefly in the fact that I, more\nthan this average man, have served and indulged the false teaching of\nour world, that I have been more praised by the men of the prevalent\nschool of teaching, and that therefore I am more depraved, and have gone\nfarther astray, than most of my fellows.\n\nTherefore I think that the answer to this question which I have found\nfor myself will do for all sincere persons who will put the same\nquestion to themselves. First of all, to the question, "What is to be\ndone?" I answer that I must neither deceive other men nor myself; that I\nmust not be afraid of the truth, whatever the result may be.\n\nWe all know what it is to deceive other men; and notwithstanding this,\nwe do deceive from morning to evening,--"Not at home," when I am in;\n"Very glad," when I am not at all glad; "Esteemed," when I do not\nesteem; "I have no money," when I have it, and so on.\n\nWe consider the deception of others to be evil, particularly a certain\nkind of deception, but we are not afraid to deceive ourselves: yet the\nworst direct lie to men, seeing its result, is nothing in comparison\nwith that lie to ourselves according to which we shape our lives. Now,\nthis very lie we must avoid if we wish to be able to answer the\nquestion, "_What is to be done?_"\n\nIndeed, how am I to answer the question as to what is to be done, when\nevery thing I do, all my life, is based upon a lie and I carefully give\nout this lie to others and to myself as truth? Not to lie in this sense\nmeans to be not afraid of truth; not to invent excuses, and not to\naccept excuses invented by others, in order to hide from one\'s self the\ndeductions of reason and conscience; not to be afraid of contradicting\nall our surroundings, and of being left alone with reason and\nconscience; not to be afraid of that condition to which truth and\nconscience lead us: however dreadful it may be, it cannot be worse than\nthat which is based upon deceit.\n\nTo avoid lying, for men in our privileged position of mental labour,\nmeans not to be afraid of truth. Perhaps we owe so much that we should\nnever be able to pay it all; but however much we may owe, we must make\nout our bill: however far we have gone astray, it is better to return\nthan to continue straying.\n\nLying to our fellows is always disadvantageous. Every business is always\nmore directly done by truth than by lies, and more quickly too. Lying to\nother men makes matters only more complicated, and retards the decision;\nbut lying to one\'s self, which is given out to be the truth, entirely\nruins the life of man.\n\nIf a man considers a wrong road to be a right one, then his every step\nleads him only farther from his aim: a man who has been walking for a\nlong time on a wrong road may find out for himself, or be told by\nothers, that his road is a wrong one; but if he, being afraid of the\nthought how far he has gone astray, tries to assure himself that he may,\nby following this wrong course, still come across the right one, then he\nwill certainly never find it. If a man becomes afraid of the truth, and,\non seeing it, will not acknowledge it, but accepts falsehood for truth,\nthen this man will never learn what is to be done.\n\nWe, not only rich men, but men in privileged position, so-called\neducated men, have gone so far astray that we require either a firm\nresolution or very great sufferings on our false way to bring us to our\nsenses again, and to recognize the lie by which we live.\n\nI became aware of the lie of our life, thanks to those sufferings to\nwhich my wrong road led me; and, having acknowledged the error of the\nway on which I was bent, I had the boldness to go, first in theory, then\nin reality, wherever my reason and conscience led me, without any\ndeliberation as to whither they were tending.\n\nI was rewarded for this boldness.\n\nAll the complex, disjointed, intricate, and meaningless phenomena of\nlife surrounding me became of a sudden clear; and my position among\nthese phenomena, formerly so strange and vile, became of a sudden\nnatural and easy.\n\nIn this new position my activity has exactly determined itself, but it\nis quite a different activity from that which appeared possible to me\nbefore: it is a new activity, far more quiet, affectionate, and joyous.\nThe very thing which frightened me before, now attracts me.\n\nTherefore, I think that every one who sincerely puts to himself the\nquestion, "What is to be done?" and in answering this question, does not\nlie or deceive himself, but goes wherever his reason _and conscience_\nmay lead him, that man has already answered the question.\n\nIf he will only avoid deceiving himself, he will find out what to do,\nwhere to go, and how to act. There is only one thing which may hinder\nhim in finding an answer,--that is too high an estimate of himself, and\nof his own position. So it was with me; and therefore the second answer\nto the question, "What is to be done?" resulting from the first,\nconsisted for me in repenting, in the full meaning of this word: that\nis, entirely changing the estimate of my own position and activity.\nInstead of considering such to be useful and of importance, we must come\nto acknowledge it to be harmful and trifling; instead of considering\nourselves educated, we must come to see our ignorance; instead of\nimagining ourselves to be kind and moral, we must acknowledge that we\nare immoral and cruel; instead of seeing our importance, we must see our\nown insignificance.\n\nI say, that besides avoiding lying to myself, I had moreover to\n_repent_, because, though the one results from the other, the wrong idea\nabout my great importance was so much a part of my own nature, that\nuntil I had sincerely repented, and had put aside that wrong estimate of\nmyself, I did not see the enormity of the lie of which I had been\nguilty.\n\nIt was only when I repented,--that is, left off considering myself to be\na peculiar man, and began to consider myself to be like _all_ other\nmen,--it was then that my way became clear to me. Before this I was not\nable to answer the question, "What is to be done?" because the very\nquestion itself was put incorrectly.\n\nBefore I repented, I had put the question thus: "What activity should I\nchoose, I, the man with the education and talents I have acquired? How\ncan I compensate by this education and these talents for what I have\nbeen taking away from the people?"\n\nThis question was a false one, because it included the wrong idea of my\nnot being like other men, but a peculiar man, called to serve other men\nwith those talents and that education which I had acquired in forty\nyears.\n\nI had put the question to myself, but in reality I had already answered\nit in advance by having determined beforehand that I was called upon to\nserve men by the kind of activity agreeable to myself. I really asked\nmyself, "How can I, so fine a writer, one so very well informed, and\nwith such talents, how can I utilize those talents for the benefit of\nmankind?"\n\nBut the question ought to have been put thus,--as it would have to be\nput to a learned rabbi who had studied all the Talmud, and knew the\nexact number of letters in the Holy Scripture, and all the subtleties of\nhis science:--"What can I do, who, from unlucky circumstances, have lost\nmy best years in study instead of accommodating myself to labour,--in\nlearning the French language, the piano, grammar, geography, law,\npoetry; in reading novels, romances, philosophical theories, and in\nperforming military exercises? what can I do, who have passed the best\nyears of my life in idle occupations, depraving the soul? what can I do,\nnotwithstanding these unlucky conditions of the past, in order to\nrequite those men, who, during all this time, have fed and clothed me,\nand who still continue to feed and to clothe me?"\n\nIf the question had been put thus, after I had repented, "What can I, so\nruined a man, do?" the answer would have been easy: First of all, I must\ntry to get my living honestly,--that is, learn not to live upon the\nshoulders of others; and while learning this, and after I have learned\nit, to try on every occasion to be of use to men with my hands and with\nmy feet, as well as with my brain and my heart, and with all of me that\nis wanted by men.\n\nTherefore I say that for one of my own circle, besides avoiding lying to\nothers and ourselves, it is further necessary to repent, to lay aside\npride about our education, refinement, and talents, not considering\nourselves to be benefactors of the people, advanced men, who are ready\nto share our useful acquirements with the people, but acknowledging\nourselves to be entirely guilty, ruined, good-for-nothing men, who\ndesire to turn over a new leaf, and not to be benefactors of the people,\nbut to cease to offend and to humiliate them.\n\nVery often good young people, who sympathise with the negative part of\nmy writings, put to me the question, "What must I do then? What have I,\nwho have finished my study in the university or in some other high\nestablishment,--what have I to do in order to be useful?"\n\nThese young people ask the question; but in the depths of their souls\nthey have already decided that the education which they have received is\ntheir great advantage, and that they wish to serve the people by this\nvery advantage.\n\nTherefore, there is one thing which they do not do,--honestly and\ncritically examine what they call their education, asking themselves\nwhether it is a good or a bad thing.\n\nIf they do this, they will be unavoidably led to decry their education,\nand to begin to learn anew; and this alone is what is wanted. They will\nnever be able to answer the question, as to what there is to be done,\nwhile they put it wrongly. The question should be put thus: "How can I,\na helpless, useless man, recognizing the misfortune of having lost my\nbest years in studying the scientific Talmud, pernicious for soul and\nbody, how can I rectify this mistake, and learn to serve men?" But the\nquestion is always put thus: "How can I, who have acquired so much fine\ninformation, how can I be useful to men with this my information?"\n\nTherefore, a man can never answer the question, "What is to be done?"\nuntil he leaves off deceiving himself and repents. And repentance is not\ndreadful, even as truth is not dreadful, but it is equally beneficent\nand fruitful of good. We need only accept the whole truth and fully\nrepent in order to understand that in life no one has any rights or\nprivileges, and that there is no end of duties, and no limits to them,\nand that the first and unquestionable duty of a man is to take part in\nthe struggle with nature for his own life and for the lives of other\nmen. And this acknowledgment of men\'s duty forms the essence of the\nthird answer to the question, "What is to be done?"\n\nI have tried to avoid deceiving myself. I have endeavoured to extirpate\nthe last remnant of the false estimate of the importance of my education\nand talents, and to repent; but before answering the question, _What is\nto be done?_ there stands a new difficulty.\n\nThere are so many things to be done, that one requires to know what is\nto be done in particular? And the answer to this question has been given\nme by the sincere repentance of the evil in which I have been living.\n\nWhat is to be done? What is there exactly to be done? everybody keeps\nasking; and I, too, kept asking this, while, under the influence of a\nhigh opinion of my own calling, I had not seen that my first and\nunquestionable business is to earn my living, clothing, heating,\nbuilding, and so forth, and in doing this to serve others as well as\nmyself, because, since the world has existed, the first and\nunquestionable duty of every man has been comprised in this.\n\nIn this one business, man receives,--if he has already begun to take\npart in it,--the full satisfaction of all the bodily and mental wants of\nhis nature; to feed, clothe, take care of himself and of his family,\nwill satisfy his bodily wants; to do the same for others, will satisfy\nhis spiritual.\n\nEvery other activity of man is only lawful when these have first been\nsatisfied. In whatever department a man thinks his calling lies, whether\nin governing the people, in protecting his countrymen, in officiating at\ndivine services, in teaching, in inventing the means of increasing the\ndelights of life, in discovering the laws of the universe, in\nincorporating eternal truths in artistic images, the first and most\nunquestionable duty of a reasonable man will always consist in taking\npart in the struggle with nature for preserving his own life and the\nlives of other men.\n\nThis duty must always rank first, because the most necessary thing for\nmen is life: and therefore, in order to protect and to teach men, and to\nmake their lives more agreeable, it is necessary to keep this very life;\nwhile by not taking part in the struggle, and by swallowing up the\nlabour of others, other lives are destroyed. And it is folly and\nimpossible to endeavour to serve men while destroying their lives.\n\nMan\'s duty to acquire the means of living through the struggle with\nnature will always be unquestionably the very first of all duties,\nbecause it is the law of life, the violation of which unavoidably brings\nwith it a punishment by destroying the bodily or mental life of man. If\na man, living alone, free himself from the duty of struggling with\nnature, he will be at once punished by the perishing of his body.\n\nBut if a man free himself from this duty by compelling other men to\nfulfil it for him, in ruining their lives, he will be at once punished\nby the destruction of his reasonable life; that is, of the life which\nhas a reasonable sense in it.\n\nI had been so perverted by my antecedents, and this first and\nunquestionable law of God or nature is so hidden in our present world,\nthat the fulfilling of it had seemed to me strange, and I was afraid and\nashamed of it, as if the fulfilment, and not the violation, of this\neternal and unquestionable law were strange, unnatural, and shameful. At\nfirst it seemed to me, that, in order to fulfil this law, some sort of\naccommodation was necessary, some established association of\nfellow-thinkers, the consent of the family, and life in the country (not\nin town): then I felt ashamed, as if I were putting myself forward in\nperforming things so unusual to our life as bodily labour, and I did not\nknow how to begin.\n\nBut I needed only to understand that this was not some exclusive\nactivity, which I have to invent and arrange, but that it was merely\nreturning from the false condition in which I had lived to a natural\none, merely rectifying that lie in which I had been living,--I had only\nto acknowledge all this, and all the difficulties vanished.\n\nIt was not at all necessary to arrange and accommodate any thing, nor to\nwait for the consent of other people, because everywhere, in whatever\ncondition I was, there were men who fed, dressed, and warmed me as well\nas themselves; and everywhere, under all circumstances, if I had\nsufficient time and strength, I was able to do these things for myself\nand for them.\n\nNor could I feel a false shame in performing actions unusual and strange\nto me, because, in not doing so, I already experienced, not a false, but\na real, shame.\n\nHaving come to this conclusion, and to the practical deduction from it,\nI have been fully rewarded for not having been afraid of the deductions\nof reason, and for having gone where they led me.\n\nHaving come to this practical conclusion, I was struck by the facility\nand simplicity of the solution of all those problems which had formerly\nseemed to me so difficult and complicated. To the question, "What have\nwe to do?" I received a very plain answer: Do first what is necessary\nfor yourself; arrange all you can do by yourself,--your tea-urn, stove,\nwater, and clothes.\n\nTo the question, "Would not this seem strange to those who had been\naccustomed to do all this for me?" it appeared that it was strange only\nfor about a week, and after a week it seemed more strange for me to\nreturn to my former condition.\n\nIn answer to the question, "Is it necessary to organize this physical\nlabour, to establish a society in a village upon this basis?" it\nappeared that it was not at all necessary to do all this; that if the\nlabour does not aim at rendering idleness possible, and at utilizing\nother men\'s labour,--as is the case with men who save up money,--but\nmerely the satisfying of necessities, then such labour will naturally\ninduce people to leave towns for the country, where this labour is most\nagreeable and productive.\n\nThere was also no need to establish a society, because a workingman will\nnaturally associate with other working-people. In answer to the\nquestion, "Would not this labour take up all my time, and would it not\ndeprive me of the possibility of that mental activity which I am so fond\nof, and to which I have become accustomed, and which in moments of doubt\nI consider to be useful?" the answer will be quite an unexpected one.\nThe energy of my mental activity increased in proportion to bodily\nexercise, being freed from all that was superfluous.\n\nIn fact, having spent eight hours in physical labour,--half a\nday,--which formerly I used to spend in endeavouring to struggle with\ndulness, there still remained for me eight hours, out of which in my\ncircumstances I required five for mental labour; and if I, a very\nprolific writer, who had been doing nothing but write during forty\nyears, and who had written three hundred printed sheets, then if during\nthese forty years I had been doing ordinary work along with\nworking-people, and, not taking into consideration winter evenings and\nholidays, had been reading and learning during the five hours a day, and\nhad written only on holidays two pages a day (and I have sometimes\nwritten sixteen pages a day), I should have written the same three\nhundred printed sheets in fourteen years.\n\nA wonderful thing: a most simple arithmetical calculation which every\nboy of seven years of age may do, but which I had never done. Day and\nnight have together twenty-four hours; we sleep eight hours; there\nremain sixteen hours. If any man labour mentally five hours a day, he\nwill do a vast amount of business; what do we, then, do during the\nremaining eleven hours?\n\nSo it appears that physical labour not only does not exclude the\npossibility of mental activity, but improves and stimulates it.\n\nIn answer to the question, whether this physical labour would deprive me\nof many innocent enjoyments proper to man, such as enjoyment of art,\nacquirement of knowledge, of social intercourse, and, generally, of the\nhappiness of life, it was really quite the reverse: the more intense my\nphysical labour, the more it approached that labour which is considered\nthe hardest, to wit, agricultural labour, the more I acquired\nenjoyments, and knowledge, and the closer and more affectionate was my\nintercourse with mankind, and the more happiness did I feel in life.\n\nIn answer to the question (which I hear so often from men who are not\nquite sincere), "What result can there be from such an awfully small\ndrop in the sea? what is all my personal physical labour in comparison\nwith the sea of labour which I swallow up?"\n\nTo this question I also received a very unexpected answer.\n\nIt appeared that as soon as I had made physical labour the ordinary\ncondition of my life, at once the greatest part of the false and\nexpensive habits and wants which I had while I had been physically idle,\nceased of themselves, without any endeavour on my part. To say nothing\nof the habit of turning day into night, and _vice versa_, of my bedding,\nclothes, my conventional cleanliness, which all became impossible and\nembarrassing when I began to labour physically, both the quantity and\nthe quality of my food was totally changed. Instead of the sweet, rich,\ndelicate, complicated, and highly spiced food, which I formerly liked, I\nnow required and obtained plain food as being the most agreeable,--sour\ncabbage soup, porridge, black bread, tea with a bit of sugar.\n\nSo that, apart from the example of common workingmen satisfied with\nlittle, with whom I came in closer intercourse, my very wants themselves\nwere gradually changed by my life of labour; so that in proportion to my\ngrowing accustomed to this labour and acquiring the ways of it, my drop\nof physical labour became indeed more perceptible in the ocean of common\nlabour; and in proportion as my labour grew more fruitful, my demands\nfor other men\'s labour grew less and less, and, without effort or\nprivation, my life naturally came nearer to that simple life of which I\ncould not even have dreamed without fulfilling the law of labour.\n\nIt became apparent that my former most expensive demands--the demands of\nvanity and amusement--were the direct result of an idle life. With\nphysical labour, there was no room for vanity, and no need for\namusement, because my time was agreeably occupied; and after weariness,\nsimple rest while drinking tea, or reading a book, or conversing with\nthe members of my family, was far more agreeable than the theatre,\nplaying at cards, concerts, or large parties.\n\nIn answer to the question, "Would not this unusual labour be hurtful to\nhealth, which is necessary in order that I may serve men?" it appeared\nthat, despite the positive assurance of eminent doctors that hard\nphysical labour, especially at my age, might have the worst results (and\nthat Swedish gymnastics, riding, and other expedients intended to supply\nthe natural conditions of man, would be far better), the harder I\nworked, the sounder, more cheerful, and kinder, I felt myself.\n\nIt became undoubtedly certain that even as all those inventions of the\nhuman mind, such as newspapers, theatres, concerts, parties, balls,\ncards, magazines, novels, are nothing but means to sustain the spiritual\nlife of men outside its natural condition of labour for others, so in\nthe same way all the hygienic and medical inventions of the human mind\nfor the provision of food, drink, dwelling, ventilation, warming of\nrooms, clothes, medicines, mineral water, gymnastics, electric and other\ncures, are all merely means to sustain the bodily life of man outside of\nits natural conditions of labour; and all these are nothing else than an\nestablishment hermetically closed, in which, by means of chemical\napparatus, the evaporation of water for the plants is arranged, when you\nneed only to open the window, and do that which is natural, not for men\nalone but to beasts too; in other words, having absorbed the food, and\nthus produced a charge of energy, to discharge it by muscular labour.\n\nAll the profound study of hygiene and of the art of healing for the men\nof our circle are like the efforts of a mechanic, who, having stopped\nall the valves of an overheated engine, should invent something to\nprevent this engine from bursting.\n\nWhen I had plainly understood all this, it seemed to me ridiculous, that\nI, through a long series of doubt, research, and much thinking, had\narrived at this extraordinary truth, that if man has eyes, they are to\nbe seen through; ears, to hear by; feet to walk with, and hands and back\nto work with,--and that if man will not use these, his members, for what\nthey are meant, then it will be the worse for him. I came to this\nconclusion, that with us, privileged people, the same thing has happened\nwhich happened to the horses of a friend of mine: The steward, who was\nnot fond of horses, and did not understand any thing about them, having\nreceived from his masters orders to prepare the best cobs for sale,\nchose the best out of the drove of horses, put them into the stable, fed\nthem upon oats; but being over-anxious, he trusted them to nobody,\nneither rode them himself, nor drove nor led them.\n\nOf course, all these horses became good for nothing.\n\nThe same has happened to us with this difference,--that you cannot\ndeceive horses, and, in order not to let them out, they must be fastened\nin; while we are kept in unnatural and hurtful conditions by all sorts\nof temptations, which fasten and hold us as with chains.\n\nWe have arranged for ourselves a life which is against the moral and\nphysical nature of man, and we use all the powers of our mind in order\nto assure men that this life is the real one. All that we call\nculture,--our science and arts for improving the delights of life,--all\nthese are only meant to deceive man\'s natural moral requirements: all\nthat we call hygiene, and the art of healing, are endeavours to deceive\nthe natural physical want of human nature.\n\nBut these deceits have their limits, and we are come to these limits.\n"If such be real human life, then it is better not to live at all," says\nthe fashionable philosophy of Schopenhauer and Hartman. "If such is\nlife, then it is better not to live at all," is the witness borne by the\nincreasing number of suicides among the privileged classes. "If such be\nlife, it is better for future generations, too, not to live," says the\nindulgent healing art, and invents means to destroy women\'s fecundity.\n\nIn the Bible the law to human beings is expressed thus: "In the sweat of\nthy face shalt thou eat bread," and "In sorrow thou shall bring forth\nchildren."\n\nThe peasant Bondaref, who wrote an article about this, threw great light\nupon the wisdom of this sentence. During the whole of my life, two\nthinking men--Russians--have exercised a great influence over me: they\nhave enriched my thoughts, and enlightened my contemplation of the\nworld.\n\nThese men were neither poets, nor learned men, nor preachers: they were\ntwo remarkable men, both now living, peasants,--Sutaief and Bondaref.\nBut "nous avons chang\xc3\xa9 tout \xc3\xa7a," as says one of Moli\xc3\xa8re\'s personages,\ntalking at random about the healing art, and saying that the liver is on\nthe left side, "we have changed all that." Men need not work,--all work\nwill be done by machines; and women need not bring forth children. The\nhealing art will teach different means of avoiding this, for there are\nalready too many people in the world.\n\nIn the Krapivensky district,[6] there wanders a ragged peasant, who\nduring the war was a purchaser of bread for a commissary of stores.\nHaving become acquainted with this functionary, and having seen his\ncomfortable life, he became mad, and now thinks that he, too, can live\nas gentlemen do, without work, being provided for by the Emperor.\n\n  [6] Tolstoy\'s village of Yasnaya Polyana is situated in this\n  district.--Ed.\n\nThis peasant now calls himself "the Most Serene Marshal Prince Blokhin,\npurveyor of war-stores of all kinds."\n\nHe says of himself that he has gone through all ranks, and for his\nservices during the war he has to receive from the Emperor an unlimited\nbank-account, clothes, uniforms, horses, carriages, tea, servants, and\nall kinds of provision. When anybody asks him whether he would like to\nwork a little, he only answers, "Thanks: the peasants will attend to all\nthat." When we say to him that the peasants also may not be disposed to\nwork, he answers, "Machines have been invented to ease the labour of\npeasants. They have no difficulty in their business." When we ask him\nwhat he is living for, he answers, "To pass away the time."\n\nI always consider this man as a mirror. I see in him myself and all my\nclass. To pass through all ranks in order to live to pass away the time,\nand to receive an unlimited bank-account, while peasants attend to every\nthing, and find it easy to do so, because of the invention of machines.\n\nThis is the exact form of the foolish belief of men of our class. When\nwe ask what have we particularly to do, we are in reality asking\nnothing, but only asserting--not so sincerely indeed as the Most Serene\nMarshal Prince Blokhin, who had passed through all ranks, and lost his\nmind--that we do not wish to do anything.\n\nHe who has come to his senses cannot ask this, because from one side all\nthat he makes use of has been done, and is being done, by the hands of\nmen; on the other side, as soon as a healthy man has got up and\nbreakfasted, he feels the inclination to work, as well with his feet as\nwith his hands and brain. In order to find work, he has only not to\nrestrain himself from labour. Only he who considers labour to be a\nshame,--like the lady who asked her guest not to trouble herself to open\nthe door, but to wait till she called a servant to do it,--only such\npersons can ask what is there to be done in particular.\n\nThe difficulty is not in inventing work,--every one has enough to do for\nhimself and for others,--but in losing this criminal view of life, that\nwe eat and sleep for our own pleasure, and in gaining that simple and\ncorrect view in which every working-person grows up, that man first of\nall is a machine which is charged with food, and that therefore it is\nshameful, difficult, and impossible to eat and not to work; that to eat\nand not to work is a most dangerous state, and as bad as incendiarism.\n\nIt is necessary only to have this consciousness, and we shall find work\nand this work will always be pleasant, and capable of satisfying all the\nwants of our soul and body.\n\nI picture to myself the whole matter thus: Every man\'s day is divided by\nhis meals into four parts, or four stages as it is called by the\npeasants: First, before breakfast; secondly, from breakfast to dinner;\nthirdly, from dinner to poldnik (a slight evening meal between dinner\nand supper); and fourthly, from poldnik to night. The activity of man to\nwhich he is drawn, is also divided into four kinds: First, the activity\nof the muscles, the labour of the hands, feet, shoulders, back,--hard\nlabour by which one perspires; secondly, the activity of the fingers and\nwrists, the activity of skill and handicraft; thirdly, the activity of\nthe intellect and imagination; fourthly, the activity of intercourse\nwith other men.\n\nThe goods which man makes use of may also be divided into four kinds:\nFirst, every man makes use of the productions of hard labour,--bread,\ncattle, buildings, wells, bridges, and so on; secondly, the productions\nof handicraft,--clothes, boots, hardware, and so on; thirdly, the\nproductions of mental activity,--science, art; and fourthly, the\nintercourse with men, acquaintanceship, societies.\n\nI thought that it would be the best thing so to arrange the occupations\nof the day that one might be able to exercise all these four faculties,\nand to return all the four kinds of production of labour, which one\nmakes use of; so that the four parts of the day were devoted, first, to\nhard labour; secondly, to mental labour; thirdly, to handicraft;\nfourthly, to the intercourse with men. It would be good if one could so\narrange his labour; but if it is not possible to arrange thus, one thing\nis important,--to acknowledge the duty of labouring, the duty of making\na good use of each part of the day.\n\nI thought that it would be only then that the false division of labour\nwhich now rules our society would disappear, and a just division would\nbe established which should not interfere with the happiness of mankind.\n\nI, for instance, have all my life been busy with mental work. I had said\nto myself that I have thus divided the labour: that my special work is\nwriting; that is, mental labour: and all other works necessary for me, I\nleft to be done by other men, or rather compelled them to do it. But\nthis arrangement, seemingly so convenient for mental labour, though\nunjust, became most inconvenient, especially for mental labour. I have\nbeen writing all my life, have accommodated my food, sleep, amusements,\nwith reference to this special labour, and besides this work I did\nnothing.\n\nThe results of which were, first, that I had been narrowing the circle\nof my observation and information, and often I had not any object to\nstudy, and therefore, having had to describe the life of men (the life\nof men is a continual problem of every mental activity), I felt my\nignorance, and had to learn and to ask about such things, which everyone\nnot occupied with a special work knows; secondly, it happened that when\nI sat down to write, I often had no inward inclination to write, and\nnobody wanted my writing for itself, that is, for my thoughts, but\npeople merely wanted my name for profits in the magazines.\n\nI made great efforts to write what I could; sometimes I did not succeed\nat all; sometimes succeeded in writing something very bad, and I felt\ndissatisfied and miserable. So often and often weeks passed, during\nwhich I would eat, drink, sleep, warm myself, and do nothing--or do\nsomething of no use to anybody--i.e., commit the worst and meanest\ncrime, scarcely ever committed by a man of the working class. But since\nI have acknowledged the necessity of physical labour as well as hard\nlabour, and also that of handicraft, everything is quite different: my\ntime is occupied however humbly, but certainly in a useful way, and\npleasantly and instructively for me.\n\nTherefore I, for the sake of my speciality, leave off this undoubtedly\nuseful and pleasant occupation, only when I feel an inward want, or see\na direct demand for my literary work. And this caused the quality, and\ntherefore the usefulness and pleasantness, of my special labour to\nimprove.\n\nThus it has happened that my occupation with those physical works, which\nare necessary for me as well as for every man, not only do not interfere\nwith my special activity, but are a necessary condition of the utility,\nquality, and pleasantness of this activity.\n\nA bird is so created that it is necessary for it to fly, to walk, to\npeck, to consider; and when it does all this, it is satisfied and happy;\nthen it is a bird. Exactly so with a man when he walks, turns over heavy\nthings, lifts them up, carries them, works with his fingers, eyes, ears,\ntongue, brain, then only is he satisfied, then only is he _a man_.\n\nA man who has come to recognise his calling to labour will be naturally\ninclined to that change of labour which is proper for him for the\nsatisfying of his outward and inward wants, and he will reverse this\norder only when he feels an irresistible impulse to some special labour,\nand when other men require this labour from him. The nature of labour is\nsuch that the satisfying of all men\'s wants requires that very\nalternation of different kinds of labour which renders labour easy and\npleasant.\n\nOnly the erroneous idea that labour is a curse could lead men to free\nthemselves from some kinds of labour, that is, to seize other men\'s\nlabour, requiring from other men that forced occupation with a special\nlabour which is called nowadays the division of labour.\n\nWe have become so accustomed to our false conception of the arrangement\nof labour that it seems to us that for a boot-maker, a machinist, a\nwriter, a musician, it would be better to be freed from the labour\nproper to man. Where there is no violence over other men\'s labour, nor a\nfalse belief in the pleasure of idleness, no man will for the sake of\nhis special labour free himself from physical labour necessary for the\nsatisfying of his wants, because special occupation is not a privilege,\nbut a sacrifice to a man\'s inclination and for the sake of his brethren.\n\nA boot-maker in a village having torn himself from his usual pleasant\nlabour in the field, and having begun his labour of mending or making\nboots for his neighbours, deprives himself of a pleasant, useful labour\nin the field for the sake of others, only because he is fond of sewing,\nand knows that nobody will do it better than he does, and that people\nwill be thankful to him.\n\nBut he cannot wish to deprive himself of the pleasant alternation of\nlabour for all his life. The same with the starosta, the machinist, the\nwriter, the learned man.\n\nIt is only to our perverted ideas, that it seems, when the master sends\nhis clerk to be a peasant, or government sentences one of its ministers\nto deportation, that they are punished and have been dealt with hardly.\nIn reality they have had a great good done to them; that is, they have\nexchanged their heavy special work for a pleasant alternation of labour.\n\nIn a natural society all is different. I know a commune where the people\nearn their living themselves. One of the members of this community was\nmore educated than the rest; and they require him to deliver lectures,\nfor which he has to prepare himself during the day, that he may be able\nto deliver them in the evening. He does it joyfully, feeling that he is\nuseful to others, and that he can do it well. But he grows tired of the\nexclusive mental labour, and his health suffers accordingly. The members\nof the community therefore pity him, and ask him to come and labour in\nthe field again.\n\nFor men who consider labour to be the essential thing and the joy of\nlife, the ground, the basis, of it will always be the struggle with\nnature,--not only in agricultural labour, but also in that of\nhandicraft, mental work, and intercourse with men.\n\nThe divergence from one or many of these kinds of labour, and\nspecialities of labour, will be performed only when a man of special\ngifts, being fond of this work, and knowing that he performs it better\nthan anybody else, will sacrifice his own advantage in order to fulfil\nthe demands which others put directly to him.\n\nOnly with such a view of labour and the natural division of labour\nresulting from it, will that curse disappear which in our imagination we\nhave put upon labour; and every labour will always be a joy, because man\nwill do either an unquestionably useful, pleasant, and easy work, or\nwill be conscious that he makes a sacrifice by performing a more\ndifficult special labour for the good of others.\n\nBut the division of labour is, it is said, more advantageous.\nAdvantageous for whom? Is it more advantageous to make with all speed as\nmany boots and cotton-prints as possible? But who will make these boots\nand cotton-prints? Men who from generation to generation have been\nmaking only pin-heads? How, then, can it be more advantageous for\npeople? If the object were to make as many cotton-prints and pins as\npossible, it would be so; but the question is, how to make people happy?\n\nThe happiness of men consists in life. And life is in labour.\n\nHow, then, can the necessity of painful, oppressing work be advantageous\nfor men? If the question were only for the advantage of some men without\nany consideration of the welfare of all, then it might be most\nadvantageous for some men to eat others. They say it is savoury!\n\nThe thing most advantageous for all men is what I wish for myself,--the\ngreatest welfare and the satisfying of all my wants which are ingrafted\nin me, those of body as well as those of soul, of conscience, and of\nreason.\n\nNow, for myself I have found, that for my welfare and for the satisfying\nof these wants, I need only to be cured of the folly in which I (as well\nas the Krapivensky madman) have lived, consisting in the idea that\ngentlefolk need not work, and that all must be done for them by others,\nand that, producing nothing, I have to do only what is proper to\nman,--satisfy my own wants.\n\nHaving discovered this, I became persuaded that this labour for the\nsatisfying of my own wants, is divisible into various kinds of labour,\neach of which has its own charm, and is not only no burden, but serves\nas rest after some other labour.\n\nI have roughly divided labour, not in the least insisting on the\npropriety of such a division, into four parts parallel to the four parts\nof the labourer\'s day\'s work, divided by his meals; and thus I try to\nsatisfy my wants.\n\nThese are, then, the answers to the question, "What shall we do?" which\nI have found for myself.\n\n_First_, Not to lie to myself. However far I have gone astray from that\nroad of life which my reason shows to me, I must not be afraid of the\ntruth.\n\n_Secondly_, To renounce my own righteousness, my own advantages,\npeculiarities, distinguishing me from others, and to own my guilt.\n\n_Thirdly_, To fulfil the eternal, unquestionable law of man,--by\nlabouring with all my being to struggle with nature, to sustain my own\nlife, and the lives of others.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nI have now finished, having said all that concerns myself; but I cannot\nrestrain my desire to say that which concerns every one, and to verify\nmy own deductions by several considerations.\n\nI wish to explain why I think that a great many of my own class must\narrive where I myself am, and I must also speak of what will result if\neven a few men arrive there; in the first place, if men of our circle,\nour caste, will only seriously think the matter out themselves, the\nyounger generation, who seek their own personal happiness, will become\nafraid of the ever-increasing misery of lives which obviously lead them\nto ruin; scrupulous persons among us (if they would examine themselves\nmore closely) will be terrified at the cruelty and unlawfulness of their\nown lives, and timid persons will be frightened at the danger of their\nmode of life.\n\n_The misery of our lives!_ However we, rich men, may try to mend and to\nsupport, with the assistance of science and art, this our false life, it\nmust become weaker every day, unhealthier, and more and more painful:\nwith each year, suicide, and the sin against the unborn babe, increase;\nwith each year the new generations of our class grow weaker, with each\nyear we feel more and more the increasing misery of our lives.\n\nIt is obvious that on this road, with all its increase of the comforts\nand delights of life, of cures, artificial teeth and hair, and so on,\nthere can be no salvation.\n\nThis truth has become such a truism, that in newspapers advertisements\nare printed about stomach powder for rich people, under the title\n"Blessings of the poor," where they say that only poor people have a\ngood digestion, and the rich need help, and among other things this\npowder. You cannot ameliorate this matter by any kind of amusements,\ncomforts, powders, but only by turning over a new leaf.\n\n_The contradiction of our life with our conscience._ However we may try\nto justify to ourselves our treason against mankind, all our\njustification falls to pieces before evidence: around us, people are\ndying from overwork and want; and we destroy the food, clothes, and\nlabour of men merely to amuse ourselves. Therefore the conscience of a\nman of our circle, though he may have but a small remainder of it in his\nbreast, cannot be stifled, and poisons all these comforts and charms of\nlife which our suffering and perishing brethren procure for us. Not only\ndoes every conscientious man feel this himself, but he must feel it more\nacutely at present, because the best part of art and science, that part\nwhich still retains a sense of its high calling, constantly reminds him\nof his cruelty, and of the unlawfulness of his position.\n\nThe old secure justifications are all destroyed; and the new ephemeral\njustifications of the progress of science for science\'s sake, and art\nfor art\'s sake, will not bear the light of plain common sense.\n\nThe conscience of men cannot be calmed by new devices: it can be calmed\nonly by turning over a new leaf, when there will be no longer any need\nfor justification.\n\n_The danger to our lives!_ However much we may try to hide from\nourselves the plain and obvious danger of exhausting the patience of\nthose whom we oppress; however much we may try to counteract this danger\nby all sorts of deceit, violence and flattery,--it grows day by day,\nhour by hour,--it has long been threatening us, but now it is so ready\nthat we are scarcely able to hold our course,--as in a vessel tossed by\na roaring and overflowing sea,--a sea which will presently swallow us up\nin wrath.\n\nThe workman\'s revolution, with its terrors of destruction and murder,\nnot only threatens us, but we have already lived above it for the last\nthirty years, and it is only by various cunning devices that we have\npostponed the explosion.\n\nSuch is the state in Europe: such is the state in Russia, and still\nworse there, because we have no safety-valves. The classes who oppress\nthe people, with the exception of the Tsar, have no longer any\njustification in the eyes of our people; they all keep up their position\nmerely by violence, cunning, and expediency, i.e., skill; but the hatred\ntowards us of the worst representatives of the people, and the contempt\nof us from the best, increases every hour.\n\nAmong the Russian people a new word full of significance has been\ncirculating during the last three or four years: by this word, which I\nnever heard before, people are swearing in the streets, and by it they\ngive us a definition--"parasites."\n\nThe hatred and contempt of the oppressed people are increasing, and the\nphysical and moral strength of the richer classes are decreasing: the\ndeceit which supports all is wearing out, and the rich classes have\nnothing wherewith to comfort themselves in this mortal danger. To return\nto the old order of things is impossible, to restore the old prestige is\nimpossible. It only remains for those who are not willing to change the\ncourse of their lives, and to turn over a new leaf,--to hope that,\nduring their lives, they may fare well enough, after which the people\nmay do as they like. So think the blind crowd of the rich; but the\ndanger ever increases, and the awful catastrophe comes nearer and\nnearer.\n\nThere are three reasons which should prove to rich people the necessity\nof turning over a new leaf: First, desire for their own personal welfare\nand that of their families, which is not secured by the way in which\nrich people are living; secondly, the inability to satisfy the voice of\nconscience, which is obviously impossible in the present condition of\nthings; and thirdly, the threatening and constantly increasing danger to\nlife, which cannot be met by any outward means. All these together ought\nto induce rich people to change their mode of life. This change alone\nwould satisfy the desire of welfare and conscience, and would remove the\ndanger. There is but one means of making such change,--to leave off\ndeceiving ourselves, to repent, and to acknowledge labour to be, not a\ncurse, but the joyful business of life.\n\nTo this it is replied, "What will come out of the fact of my physical\nlabour during ten, eight, or five hours, while thousands of peasants\nwould gladly do it for the money which I have?"\n\nThe first good result would be, that you will become livelier,\nhealthier, sounder, kinder; and you will learn that real life from which\nyou have hidden yourself, or which was hidden from you.\n\nThe second good result will be, that, if you have a conscience, it will\nnot only cease to suffer as it now suffers when looking at the labour of\nmen,--the importance of which we always, from our ignorance, either\nincrease or diminish,--but you will constantly experience a joyful\nacknowledgment that with each day you are satisfying more and more the\ndemands of your conscience, and are leaving behind you that awful state\nin which so much evil is accumulated in our lives that we feel that we\ncannot possibly do any good in the world; you will experience the joy of\nfree life, with the possibility of doing good to others; you will open\nfor yourself a way into regions of the world of morality which have\nhitherto been shut to you.\n\nThe third good result will be this, that, instead of constant fear of\nrevenge upon your evil deeds, you will feel that you are saving others\nfrom this revenge, and are principally saving the oppressed from the\ncruel feeling of rancour and resentment.\n\nBut it is generally said, that it would be ridiculous if we, men of our\nstamp, with deep philosophical, scientific, political, artistic,\necclesiastical, social questions before us, we, state ministers,\nsenators, academists, professors, artists, singers, we, whose\nquarter-hours are valued so highly by men, should spend our time in\ndoing--what? Cleaning our boots, washing our shirts, digging, planting\npotatoes, or feeding our chickens and cows, and so on,--in business\nwhich not only our house-porter, or our cook, but thousands of men\nbesides who value our time, would be very glad to do for us.\n\nBut why do we dress, wash, and comb our hair ourselves? Why do we walk,\nhand chairs to ladies, to our guests, open and shut the door, help\npeople into carriages, and perform hundreds of actions which were\nformerly performed for us by our slaves?\n\nBecause we consider that such may be done by ourselves; that they are\ncompatible with human dignity; that is, human duty. The same holds good\nwith physical labour. Man\'s dignity, his sacred duty, is to use his\nhands, his feet, for the purpose for which they were given him, to spend\nthe swallowed food in work, which produces the food, and not to be\nwasted by disuse, not merely that he may wash and clean them and use\nthem only for the purpose of stuffing food and cigarettes into his\nmouth.\n\nSuch is the meaning of physical labour for every man in every society.\nBut in our class, with the divergence from this law of nature came the\nmisery of a whole circle of men; and for us, physical labour receives\nanother meaning,--the meaning of a preaching and a propaganda which\ndivert the terrible evil which threatens mankind.\n\nTo say that for an educated man, physical labour is a trifling\noccupation, is the same as to say, in the building of a temple, "What\nimportance can there be in putting each stone exactly in its place?"\nEvery great act is done under the conditions of quietness, modesty, and\nsimplicity. One can neither plough, nor feed cattle, nor think, during a\ngreat illumination, or amid thundering of guns, nor while in uniform.\n\nIllumination, the roar of cannon, music, uniforms, cleanliness,\nbrilliancy, which we usually connect with the idea of the importance of\nany act, are, on the contrary, tokens of the absence of importance in\nthat act. Great, true deeds are always simple and modest. Such is also\nthe greatest deed which is left to us to do,--the solution of those\nawful contradictions in which we are living. The acts which solve these\ncontradictions are modest, imperceptible, seemingly ridiculous acts,\nsuch as helping ourselves by physical labour, and, if possible, helping\nothers too: this is what we rich people have to do, if we understand the\nmisery, wrong, and danger of the position in which we live.\n\nWhat will result from the circumstance that I, and another, and a third,\nand a tenth man, do not despise physical labour, but consider it\nnecessary for our happiness, for the calming of our consciences, and for\nour safety? This will result from it,--that one, two, three, ten men,\ncoming into conflict with no one, without violence either of government\nor of revolution, will solve for themselves the problem which is before\nall the world, and which has appeared unsolvable; and they will solve it\nin such a way that life will become for them a good thing: their\nconsciences will be calm, and the evil which oppresses them will cease\nto be dreadful to them.\n\nAnother effect will be this: other men, too, will see that the welfare,\nwhich they have been looking for everywhere, is quite near them, that\nseemingly unsolvable contradictions between conscience and the order of\nthe world are solved in the easiest and pleasantest way, and that,\ninstead of being afraid of the men surrounding them, they must have\nintercourse with them, and love them.\n\nThe seemingly unsolvable economical and social questions are like the\nproblem of Krilof\'s casket. The casket opened of itself, without any\ndifficulty: but it will not open until men do the simplest and most\nnatural thing; that is, open it. The seemingly unsolvable question is\nthe old question of the utilizing some men\'s labour by others: this\nquestion, in our time, has found its expression in property.\n\nFormerly, other men\'s labour was used simply by violence, by slavery: in\nour time it is being done by the means of property. In our time,\nproperty is the root of all evil and of the sufferings of men who\npossess it, or are without it, and of all the remorse of conscience of\nthose who misuse it, and of the danger from the collision between those\nwho have it, and those who have it not.\n\nProperty is the root of all evil, and, at the same time, property is\nthat towards which all the activity of our modern society is directed,\nand that which directs the activity of the world. States and governments\nintrigue, make wars, for the sake of property, for the possession of the\nbanks of the Rhine, of land in Africa, China, the Balkan Peninsula.\nBankers, merchants, manufacturers, land-owners, labourers, use cunning,\ntorment themselves, torment others, for the sake of property; government\nfunctionaries, artisans, struggle, deceive, oppress, suffer, for the\nsake of property; courts of justice and police protect property; penal\nservitude, prisons, all the terrors of so-called punishments,--all is\ndone for the sake of property.\n\nProperty is the root of all evil; and now all the world is busy with the\ndistribution and protecting of wealth.\n\nWhat, then, is property? Men are accustomed to think that property is\nsomething really belonging to man, and for this reason they have called\nit property. We speak indiscriminately of our own house and our own\nland. But this is obviously an error and a superstition. We know, and if\nwe do not, it is easy to perceive, that property is only the means of\nutilizing other men\'s labour. And another\'s labour can by no means\nbelong to me. It has nothing in common with the conception of\nproperty,--a conception very exact and precise.\n\nMan has been, and will always call his own that which is subject to his\nown will and joined with his own consciousness. As soon as a man calls\nhis own something which is not his body, but which he should like to be\nsubject to his will as his body is, then he makes a mistake, and gets\ndisappointment, and suffering, and compels other people to suffer as\nwell. Man calls his wife his own, his children, his slaves, his\nbelongings, his own too; but the reality always shows him his error: and\nhe must either get rid of this superstition, or suffer, and make others\nsuffer.\n\nNow we, having nominally renounced the possessing of slaves, owing to\nmoney (and to its exactment by the government), claim our right also to\nmoney; that is, to the labour of other men.\n\nBut as to our claiming our wives as our property, or our sons, our\nslaves, our horses,--this is pure fiction contradicted by reality, and\nwhich only makes those suffer who believe in it; because a wife or a son\nwill never be so subject to my will as my body is; therefore my own body\nwill always remain the only thing I can call my true property; so also\nmoney, property,--will never be real property, but only a self-deception\nand a source of suffering, and it is only my own body which will be my\nproperty, that which always obeys me, and is connected with my\nconsciousness.\n\nIt is only to us, who are so accustomed to call other things than our\nbody our own, that such a wild superstition can appear to be useful for\nus, and without evil results; but we have only to reflect upon the\nnature of the matter to see how this, like every other superstition,\nbrings with it only dreadful consequences.\n\nLet us take the most simple example. I consider myself my own, and\nanother man like myself I consider my own too. I must understand how to\ncook my dinner: if I were free from the superstition of considering\nanother man as my property, I should have been taught this art as well\nas every other necessary to my real property (that is, my body); but now\nI have it taught to my imaginary property, and the result is that my\ncook does not obey me, does not wish to humour me, and even runs away\nfrom me, or dies, and I remain with an unsatisfied want, and have lost\nthe habit of learning, and recognize that I have spent as much time in\nworry about this cook as I should have spent in learning the art of\ncooking for myself.\n\nThe same is the case with property in buildings, clothes, wares; with\nproperty in the land; with property in money. Every imaginary property\ncalls forth in me a non-corresponding want which cannot always be\ngratified, and deprives me of the possibility of acquiring for my true\nand sure property--my own body--that information, that skill, those\nhabits, improvements, which I might have acquired.\n\nThe result is always that I have spent (without gain to myself,--to my\ntrue property) strength, sometimes my whole life, on that which never\nhas been, and never could be, my property.\n\nI provide myself with an imaginary "private" library, a "private"\npicture gallery, "private" apartments, clothes; acquire my "own" money\nin order to purchase with it every thing I want, and the matter stands\nthus,--that I, being busy about this imaginary property, which is not,\nand cannot be my property, however I may call it, and which is no object\nfor activity, leave quite out of sight that which is my true property,\nupon which I may really labour, and which really may serve me, and which\nalways remains in my power.\n\nWords have always a definite meaning until we purposely give them a\nfalse signification.\n\nWhat does property mean?\n\nProperty means that which is given to me alone, which belongs to me\nalone, exclusively; that with which I may always do everything I like,\nwhich nobody can take away from me, which remains mine to the end of my\nlife, and which I ought to use in order to increase and to improve it.\nFor every man such property is only himself.\n\nIt is in this very sense that imaginary property is understood, that\nvery property for sake of which (making it impossible for this imaginary\nproperty to become a real one) all the sufferings of this world\nexist,--wars, executions, judgments, prisons, luxury, depravity,\nmurders, and the ruin of mankind.\n\nWhat, then, will result from the circumstance that ten men plough, hew\nwood, make boots, not from necessity, but in acknowledgment that man\nneeds work, and that the more he works, the better it will be for him?\n\nThis will come out of it: that ten men, or even one single man, by\nthought and in deed, will show men that this fearful evil from which\nthey are suffering, is not the law of their destiny, nor the will of\nGod, nor any historical necessity, but is a superstition not at all\nstrong or overpowering, but weak and null, which one need only leave off\nbelieving in, as in idols, in order to get rid of, and to destroy it\neven as a frail cobweb is swept away.\n\nMen who begin to work in order to fulfil the pleasant law of their\nlives, who work for the fulfilment of the law of labour, will free\nthemselves from this superstition of property which is so full of\nmisery, and then all these worldly establishments which exist in order\nto protect this imaginary property outside of one\'s own body, will\nbecome not only unnecessary for them, but burdensome; and it will become\nclear to all that these institutions are not necessary, but pernicious,\nimaginary, and false conditions of life.\n\nFor a man who considers labour not a curse, but a joy, property outside\nhis own body--that is, the right or possibility of utilizing other men\'s\nlabour--will be not only useless, but an impediment. If I am fond of\ncooking my dinner, and accustomed to do it, then the fact that another\nman will do it for me, will deprive me of my usual business, and will\nnot satisfy me so well as I have satisfied myself; and further, the\nacquirement of imaginary property will not be necessary for such a man:\na man who considers labour to be his very life, fills up all his life\nwith it, and therefore requires less and less the labour of others,--in\nother words, as property to fill up his unoccupied time, and to\nembellish his life.\n\nIf the life of a man is occupied by labour, he does not require many\nrooms, much furniture, various fine clothes: he does not require so much\nexpensive food, or locomotion, or amusements. Especially a man who\nconsiders labour to be the business and the joy of his life, will not\nseek to ease his own labour by utilizing that of others.\n\nA man who considers life to consist in labour, will aim, in proportion\nas he acquires more skill, craft, and endurance, at having more and more\nwork to do, to occupy all his time. For such a man, who sees the object\nof his life in labour, and not in the results of his labour in\nacquirement of property, there cannot be even a question about the\ninstruments of labour. Though such a man will always choose the most\nproductive instrument of labour, he will have the same satisfaction in\nworking with the most unproductive.\n\nIf he has a steam-plough, he will plough with it; if he has not such, he\nwill plough with a horse-plough; if he has not this, he will plough with\nthe plain Russian sokh\xc3\xa1; if he has not even this, he will use a spade:\nand under any circumstances, he will attain his aim; that is, will pass\nhis life in labour useful to man, and therefore will have fullest\nsatisfaction. The position of such a man, in exterior and interior\ncircumstances, will be happier than the condition of a man who gives his\nlife away to acquire property.\n\nAccording to exterior circumstances, he will never want, because men,\nseeing that he does not shirk work, will always try to make his labour\nmost productive to them, as they arrange a mill by running water; and\nthat his labour may be more productive, they will provide for his\nmaterial existence, which they will never do for men who aim at\nacquiring property. The providing for material wants, is all that a man\nrequires.\n\nAccording to interior conditions, such a man will be always happier than\nhe who seeks for property, because the latter will never get what he is\naiming at, and the former in proportion to his strength (even the weak,\nold, dying, according to the proverb, with a Kored in his hands), will\nalways receive full satisfaction, and the love and sympathy of men.\n\nOne of the consequences of this will be, that certain odd, half-insane\npersons will plough, make boots, and so on, instead of smoking, playing\ncards, and riding about, carrying their dulness with them, from one\nplace to another, during the ten hours which every brain worker has at\nhis command.\n\nAnother result will be, that these silly people will demonstrate in\ndeed, that that imaginary property for the sake of which men suffer, and\ntorment themselves and others, is not necessary for happiness, and even\nimpedes it, and is but a superstition; and that true property is only\none\'s own head, hands, feet; and that, in order to utilize this true\nproperty usefully and joyfully, it is necessary to get rid of that false\nidea of property outside one\'s own body, on which we waste the best\npowers of our life.\n\nAnother result will be, that these men will demonstrate, that, when a\nman leaves off believing in imaginary property, then only will he make\nreal use of his true property,--his own body, which will yield him fruit\nan hundred-fold, together with happiness such as we have no idea as yet;\nand he will be a useful, strong, kind man, who will everywhere stand on\nhis own feet, will be always a brother to everybody, will be\nintelligible to all, desired by all, and dear to all.\n\nThen men, looking at one,--at ten such "silly" men will understand what\nthey have all to do to unfasten that dreadful knot in which they have\nall been tied by the superstition respecting property, and to get rid of\nthe miserable condition under which they are now groaning, and from\nwhich they do not know how to free themselves.\n\nThere is no reasoning which can so plainly demonstrate the\nunrighteousness of those who employ it as does this. The boatmen are\ndragging vessels against the stream. Is it possible that there could be\nfound a stupid boatman who would refuse to do his part in dragging,\nbecause he alone cannot drag the boat up against the stream? He who,\nbesides his rights of animal life,--to eat and to sleep,--acknowledges\nany human duty, knows very well wherein such duty consists: just in the\nsame way as a boatman knows that he has only to get into his\nbreast-collar, and to walk in the given direction. He will only seek to\nknow what to do and how to do it after having fulfilled his duty.\n\nAs with the boatmen, and with all men who do any labour in common, so\nwith the labour of all mankind; each man need only keep on his\nbreast-collar, and go in the given direction. And for this purpose one\nand the same reason is given to all men that this direction may always\nbe the same.\n\nThat this direction _is_ given to us, is obvious and certain from the\nlives of those who surround us, as well as in the conscience of every\nman, and in all the previous expressions of human wisdom; so that only\nhe who does not want work, can say that he does not see it.\n\nWhat, then, will come out of this?\n\nThis, that first one man, then another, will drag; looking at them, a\nthird will join; and so one by one the best men will join, until the\nbusiness will be set a-going, and will move as of itself, inducing those\nalso to join who do not yet understand why and wherefore it is being\ndone.\n\nFirst, to the number of men who conscientiously work in order to fulfil\nthe law of God, will be added those who will accept half conscientiously\nand half upon faith; then to these a still greater number of men, only\nupon faith in the foremost men; and lastly the majority of people: and\nthen it will come to pass that men will cease to ruin themselves, and\nwill find out happiness.\n\nThis will happen (and it will happen soon) when men of our circle, and\nafter them all the great majority of working-people, will no longer\nconsider it shameful to clean sewers, but will consider it shameful to\nfill them up in order that other men, _our brethren_, may carry their\ncontents away; they will not consider it shameful to go visiting in\ncommon boots, but they will consider it shameful to walk in goloshes\nbeside barefooted people; they will not think it shameful not to know\nFrench, nor about the last novel, but they will consider it shameful to\neat bread, and not to know how it is prepared; they will not consider it\nshameful not to have a starched shirt or a clean dress, but that it is\nshameful to wear a clean coat as a token of one\'s idleness; they will\nnot consider it shameful to have dirty hands, but shameful not to have\ncallouses on their hands.\n\nAll this will come to pass when public opinion demands it. Public\nopinion will demand it, when men get rid of those snares which hide the\ntruth from them. Great changes in this direction have taken place within\nmy memory. These changes occurred only as public opinion changed. Within\nmy memory has happened this, that whereas rich men were ashamed if they\ncould not drive out with a team of four horses, with two men-servants,\nand that it was considered shameful not to have a man-servant or a maid,\nto dress one, wash one, attend the chamber, and so on; now of a sudden\nit has become shameful not to dress and to wash oneself, without help,\nor to drive out with men-servants. All these changes have been\naccomplished by public opinion.\n\nCan we not see the changes which public opinion is now preparing?\nTwenty-five years ago it sufficed to destroy the snare which justified\nserfdom, and public opinion changed its attitude as to what is\npraiseworthy, and what is shameful, and life changed. It would suffice\nto destroy the snares justifying the power of money over men, and public\nopinion will change its view, concerning things praiseworthy and things\nshameful, and life will change.\n\nBut the destroying of the snare justifying the power of money and the\nchange of public opinion in this direction is already quickly taking\nplace. This snare is already transparent and but slightly veils the\ntruth. One needs only to look more attentively to see clearly that\nchange of public opinion, which not only must take place, but which has\nbeen already accomplished, only not yet consciously acknowledged, not\nyet named. Let a slightly educated man of our time think of the\nconsequences ensuing from those views he holds concerning the universe,\nand he will see, that the unconscious estimate of good and evil, of\npraiseworthy and shameful, by which he is guided in life, directly\ncontradicts all his conceptions of life.\n\nLet a man of our times dismiss himself, if only for a minute, from his\nown inert life, and looking at it, as an outsider, subject it to that\nvery estimate, resulting from his conception of life, and he will stand\naghast before the definition of his life, which results from his\nconception of the world.\n\nLet us take as an example, a young man (in young people the life energy\nis stronger and the self-consciousness is more vague) of the wealthy\nclasses, and of any shade of opinions. Every decent youth considers it a\nshame not to help an old man, a child, a woman; he considers it a shame\nto risk the life and health of another in common work while avoiding the\ndanger for himself. Everybody considers it shameful and barbarous to do\nwhat Skyler tells about the Kirghiz: who during storms sent out their\nwives and old women to hold the corners of the tent, while they remained\ninside drinking their koumis; everybody considers it a shame to force a\nweak man to work for him and still more shameful when in such danger,\nas, say, on a ship on fire, for the strongest to push aside the weak and\ngo first into the life-boat, and so on. Men consider all this shameful\nand would by no means act so under certain exceptional circumstances;\nbut in everyday life the same actions and even worse,--being hidden by\nsnares,--are constantly committed by them.\n\nOne need only think of it earnestly to recognize the horror of it.\n\nA young man changes his shirts daily. Who washes them? A woman, whatever\nher state may be, very often old enough to be his mother or grandmother,\noften unwell. How would this young man call another who out of whim,\nchanges his clean shirt and sends it to be washed by a woman old enough\nto be his mother?\n\nA young man, that he may be smart, provides himself with horses and an\nold man, fit to be his father or grandfather, is set to training them,\nthus endangering his very life, and the young man rides on the horse\nwhen danger is over. What would the young man say about a man who,\navoiding a dangerous situation for himself, puts another into it and for\nhis pleasure allows such a risk?\n\nYet the whole life of the well-to-do classes consists of a chain of such\nactions. The overtaxing labour of old men, children and women, and work\nconnected with danger to life done by others, not to help us to work but\nto satisfy our whims--these fill up our life. The fisherman gets drowned\nwhile catching fish for us, the washerwomen catch colds and die, the\nsmith grows blind, those who work in factories get ill and injured by\nmachinery, woodcutters are crushed by falling trees, workmen fall from\nroofs and are killed, needlewomen pine away. All real work is done with\nwaste and danger to life. To hide this and refuse to see it is\nimpossible. There is one salvation, one issue out of this situation, to\nwit--that if a man of our time is not to be obliged--according to his\nown principles--to call himself a scoundrel and a coward, who burdens\nothers with work and danger to life--he must take from men only what is\nnecessary for his life, and submit himself also to true labour\nassociated with waste and danger to life.\n\nWithin my memory, more striking changes have taken place. I remember\nthat at table, a servant stood with a plate, behind each chair. Men made\nvisits accompanied by two footmen. A Cossack boy and a girl stood in a\nroom to give people their pipes, and to clean them, and so on. Now this\nseems to us strange and remarkable. But is it not equally strange that a\nyoung man or woman, or even an elderly man, that he may visit a friend,\nshould order his horses to be harnessed, and that well-fed horses are\nkept only for this purpose? Is it not as strange that one man lives in\nfive rooms, or that a woman spends tens, hundreds, thousands of rubles\nfor her dress when she only needs some flax and wool wherewith to spin\ndresses for herself, and clothes for her husband and children?\n\nIs it not strange that men live doing nothing, riding to and fro,\nsmoking and playing, and that a battalion of people are busy feeding and\nwarming them?\n\nIs it not strange that old people quite gravely talk and write in\nnewspapers about theatres and music, and other insane people drive to\nlook at musicians or actors?\n\nIs it not strange that tens of thousands of boys and girls are brought\nup so as to make them unfit for every work (they return home from\nschool, and their two books are carried for them by a servant)?\n\nThere will soon come a time,--and it is already drawing near,--when it\nwill be shameful to dine on five courses served by footmen, and cooked\nby any but the masters themselves; it will be shameful not only to ride\nthoroughbreds or to drive in a coach when one has feet to walk on; to\nwear on week-days dress, shoes, gloves, in which it is impossible to\nwork; it will be shameful to play on a piano which costs one hundred and\nfifty pounds, or even ten pounds, while others work for one; to feed\ndogs upon milk and white bread, when there are men who have neither milk\nnor bread, and to burn lamps and candles without working by their light;\nto heat stoves in which no meal is cooked, while there are men who have\nneither light nor fuel. Then it will be impossible to think about giving\nopenly not merely one pound, but even six pence, for a place in a\nconcert or in a theatre. All this will be when the law of labour becomes\npublic opinion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n\nAs it is said in the Bible, there is a law given unto man and woman,--to\nman, the law of labour; to woman, the law of child-bearing. Although\nwith our science, "_nous avons chang\xc3\xa9 tout \xc3\xa7a_," the law of man as well\nas of woman remains as immutable as the liver in its place; and the\nbreach of it is inevitably punished by death. The only difference is,\nthat for man, the breach of law is punished by death in such a near\nfuture that it can almost be called present; but for woman, the breach\nof law is punished in a more distant future.\n\nA general breach, by all men, of the law, destroys men immediately: the\nbreach by women destroys the men of the following generation. The\nevasion of the law by a few men and women does not destroy the human\nrace, but deprives the offender of rational human nature.\n\nThe breach of this law by men began years ago in the classes which could\nuse violence with others; and, spreading on its way, it has reached our\nday, and has now attained madness, the ideal contained in a breach of\nthe law, the ideal expressed by Prince Blokhin, and shared by Renan and\nthe whole educated world: work will be done by machines, and men will be\nbundles of nerves enjoying themselves.\n\nThere has been scarcely any breach of the law by women. It has only\nmanifested itself in prostitution, and in private cases of crime\ndestroying progeny. Women of the wealthy classes have fulfilled their\nlaw, while men did not fulfil theirs; and therefore women have grown\nstronger, and have continued to govern, and will govern, men, who have\ndeviated from their law, and who, consequently, have lost their reason.\nIt is generally said that women (the women of Paris, especially those\nwho are childless) have become so bewitching, using all the means of\ncivilization, that they have mastered man by their charms.\n\nThis is not only wrong, but it is just the reverse of the truth. It is\nnot the childless woman who has mastered man, it is the mother, the one\nwho has fulfilled her duty, while man has not fulfilled his.\n\nAs to the woman who artificially remains childless, and bewitches man by\nher shoulders and curls, she is not a woman, mastering man, but a woman\ncorrupted by him, reduced to the level of the corrupted man, who, as\nwell as he, has deviated from her duty, who, as well as he, has lost\nevery reasonable sense of life.\n\nThis mistake also produces the astounding nonsense which is called\n"woman\'s rights." The formula of these rights is as follows:--\n\n"You men," says woman, "have deviated from your law of true labour, and\nwant us to carry the load of ours. No: if so, we also, as well as you,\nwill make a pretence of labour, as you do in banks, ministries,\nuniversities, and academies; we wish, as well as you, by the pretence of\ndivision of work, to profit by other people\'s work, and to live, only to\nsatisfy our lust." They say so, and in deed show that they can make that\npretence of labour not at all worse, but even better, than men do it.\n\nThe so-called question of women\'s rights arose, and could only arise,\namong men who had deviated from the law of real labour. One has only to\nreturn to it, and that question must cease to exist. A woman who has her\nown particular, inevitable labour will never claim the right of sharing\nman\'s labour,--in mines, or in ploughing fields. She claims her share\nonly in the sham labour of the wealthy classes.\n\nThe woman of our class was stronger than man, and is now still stronger,\nnot through her charms, not through her skill in performing the same\npharisaic similitude of work as man, but because she has not stepped\noutside of the law; because she has borne that true labour with danger\nof life, with uttermost effort; true labour, from which the man of the\nwealthy classes has freed himself.\n\nBut within my memory has begun also the deviation from the law by\nwoman,--that is to say, her fall; and within my memory, it has proceeded\nfarther and farther. A woman who has lost the law, believes that her\npower consists in the charms of her witchery, or in her skill at a\npharisaic pretence of intellectual labour. Children hinder the one and\nthe other. Therefore, with the help of science (science is always\nhelpful to everything wicked) within my memory it has come to pass that\namong the wealthy classes, scores of means of destroying progeny have\nappeared, and these means become a common attribute of the toilet. And\nbehold,--women, mothers, some of them of the wealthy classes, who held\ntheir power in their hands, let it slip away, and place themselves on a\nlevel with women of the street. The evil has spread far, and spreads\nfarther every day, and will soon grasp all the women of the wealthy\nclasses; and then they will be on a level with the men, and together\nwith them will lose every reasonable sense of life. There will be no\nreturn for this class then. But there is yet time. For there still\nremain more women than men who accomplish the law of their life,\ntherefore there are still reasonable beings among them,--and thus some\nof the women of our class hold in their hands the possibility of\nsalvation.\n\nIf only women would understand their worth, their power, and would use\nthese for the work of salvation of their husbands, brothers, and\nchildren,--the salvation of all men!\n\nWomen, mothers of the wealthy classes, in your hands is the salvation of\nmen of our world from the evils from which it suffers.\n\nNot those women who are occupied by their figures, bustles,\nhead-dresses, and their charms for men, and who, against their will, by\naccident and in despair, bear children, and then give them over to\nwet-nurses; nor yet those who go to different lectures, and talk of\npsychometrical centres of differentiation, and who also try to free\nthemselves from bearing children not to hinder their folly, which they\ncall development,--but those women and mothers who, having the power of\nfreeing themselves from child-bearing, hold strictly and consciously to\nthat eternal, immutable law, knowing that the weight and labour of that\nsubmission is the aim of their life. These women and mothers of our\nwealthy classes are those in whose hands, more than in any others, lies\nthe salvation of the men of our sphere in life, from the calamities\nwhich oppress them.\n\nYou women and mothers who submit consciously to the law of God, you are\nthe only ones who,--in our miserable, mutilated circle, which has lost\nall semblance of humanity,--know the whole true meaning of life\naccording to the law of God; and you are the only ones who, by your\nexample, can show men the happiness of that submission to God\'s law, of\nwhich they rob themselves.\n\nYou are the only ones who know the joy and happiness which takes\npossession of one\'s whole being,--the bliss which is the share of every\nman who does not deviate from God\'s law. You know the joy of love to\nyour husband,--a joy never ending, never destroyed, like all other joys,\nbut forming the beginning of another new joy--love to your child. You\nare the only ones, when you are simple and submissive to God\'s law, who\nknow, not the farcical pretence of labour, which men of your world call\nlabour, but that true labour which is imposed by God upon men, and you\nknow the rewards for it,--the bliss which it gives.\n\nYou know it, when after the joys of love, you expect with emotion, fear,\nand hope, the torturing state of pregnancy, which makes you ill for nine\nmonths, and brings you to the brink of death and to unbearable\nsufferings and pains: you know the conditions of true labour, when with\njoy you expect the approach and increase of the most dreadful\nsufferings, after which comes the bliss, known to you only.\n\nYou know it when, directly after those sufferings, without rest, without\ninterruption, you undertake another series of labours and\nsufferings,--those of nursing; for the sake of which you subjugate to\nyour feeling, and renounce, the strongest human necessity,--that of\nsleep, which, according to the saying, is sweeter than father and\nmother. For months and years you do not sleep two nights running, and\noften you do not sleep whole nights; walking alone to and fro, rocking\nin your wearied arms an ailing baby, whose sufferings tear your heart.\nWhen you do all this, unapproved and unseen by anybody, not expecting\nany praise or reward for it; when you do this, not as a great deed, but\nas the labourer of the gospel parable, who came from the field,\nconsidering that you are only doing your duty,--you know then what is\nfalse, fictitious labour,--for human fame; and what is true labour,--the\nfulfilment of God\'s will, the indication of which you feel in your\nheart. You know, if you are a true mother, that not only has nobody seen\nand praised your labour, considering that it is only what ought to be,\nbut even those for whom you toiled are not only ungrateful to you, but\noften torment and reproach you. With the next child you do the\nsame,--again you suffer, again you bear unseen, terrible toil, and again\nyou do not expect any reward from anybody, and feel the same\nsatisfaction.\n\nIf you are such, in your hands must lie the power over men, and in your\nhands lies the salvation. Your number is decreasing every day: some busy\nwith practising their charms over men, become prostitutes; others are\nengaged in competition with men in their artificial, ludicrous\noccupations; the third, who have not yet renounced their vocation, begin\nto repudiate it in their minds: they perform all the deeds of women and\nmothers, but accidentally, with grumblings and envy of the free women,\nnot bearing children,--and so deprive themselves of the only reward for\nthem--the inner consciousness of the fulfilment of God\'s will--and\ninstead of being satisfied they suffer from what is really their\nhappiness.\n\nWe are so confused by our false life, we, men of our circle, have all of\nus so utterly lost the sense of life, that we do not differ from one\nanother. Having loaded others with all the burdens and dangers of life,\nwe dare not call ourselves by the true names deserved by those who force\nothers to perish in providing life for them--scoundrels, cowards.\n\nBut among women a distinction still exists. There are women,--human\nbeings, women,--presenting the highest manifestation of a human being;\nand there are women--prostitutes. This discrimination will be made by\nsucceeding generations, and we, too, cannot help making it.\n\nEvery woman, however she dresses, however she calls herself, however\nrefined she may be, if being married she abstains from bearing children,\nis a prostitute.\n\nHowever low a lost woman may be, if she consciously devotes herself to\nbearing children, she does the best and highest work of life in\nfulfilling the will of God, and she has no superior.\n\nIf you are such, you will not say, after two or after twenty children,\nthat you have borne children enough; as a fifty-year old workman will\nnot say that he has worked enough, while he still eats and sleeps, and\nhis muscles demand work. If you are such, you will not cast the trouble\nof nursing and care on a strange mother,--any more than a workman will\ngive the work which he has begun, and nearly finished, to another\nman,--because in that work you put your life, and because, the more you\nhave of that work, the fuller and happier is your life.\n\nBut when you are like this,--and, happily for men, there are yet such\nwomen,--the same law of fulfilment of God\'s will, by which you guide\nyour own life, you will also apply to the life of your husband, of your\nchildren, and of men near to you. If you are such, and if you know by\nexperience that only self-denied, unseen, unrewarded labour with danger\nof life, and uttermost effort for the life of others, is the mission of\nman which gives satisfaction, you will claim the same from others, you\nwill encourage your husband to do the same labour, you will value and\nappreciate the worth of men by this same labour, and for it you will\nprepare your children.\n\nOnly that mother who looks on child-bearing as a disagreeable accident,\nand upon the pleasures of love, comfort, education, sociability, as the\nmeaning of life, will bring up her children so that they shall have as\nmany pleasures, and enjoy them as much as possible; will feed them\nluxuriously, dress them smartly, will artificially divert them, and will\nteach them, not that which will make them capable of self-sacrificing\nman\'s and woman\'s labour with danger of life and uttermost effort, but\nthat which will deliver them from that labour,--which will give them\ndiplomas and idleness. Only such a woman, who has lost the significance\nof her life, will sympathize with that false, sham man\'s labour, by\nmeans of which her husband, freeing himself from man\'s duty, may profit,\ntogether with her, by the labour of others. Only such a woman will\nchoose a similar husband for her daughter, and will value men, not for\nwhat they are in themselves, but for what is attached to\nthem,--position, money, the art of profiting by the labour of others.\n\nA true mother, who really knows God\'s law, will prepare her children for\nthe fulfilment of it. For such a mother it will be suffering to see her\nchild overfed, pampered, overdressed, because all this, she knows, will\nhinder it in the fulfilment of God\'s law, experienced by herself. Such a\nwoman will not teach that which will give her son or daughter the\npossibility of delivering themselves from labour, but that which will\nhelp them to bear the labour of life.\n\nShe will not want to ask what to teach her children, or for what to\nprepare them, knowing what it is and in what consists the mission of\nmen, and consequently knowing what to teach her children, and for what\nto prepare them. Such a woman will not only discourage her husband from\nfalse, sham labour, the only aim of which is to profit by other people\'s\nwork, but will view with disgust and dread an activity that will serve\nas a double temptation for her children. Such a woman will not choose\nher daughter\'s husband according to the whiteness of his hands, and the\nrefinement of his manners, but, knowing thoroughly what is labour and\nwhat deceit, will always and everywhere, beginning with her husband,\nrespect and appreciate men, in claiming from them true labour with waste\nand danger of life, and will scorn that false, sham labour which has for\nits aim the delivering of one\'s self from true labour.\n\nAnd let not those women say,--who, while renouncing the vocation of\nwomen, desire to profit by its rights,--that such a view of life is\nimpossible for a mother, that a mother is too intimately connected by\nlove to her children to deprive them of sweets, smart dresses, or\nentertainments, or not to fear their being unprovided for, if the\nhusband has no fortune or secure position, or not to be afraid for the\nfuture of the marrying daughters and sons, who have not got an\n"education."\n\nAll this is a lie, a burning lie!\n\nA true mother will never say this: "You cannot keep yourself from the\ndesire to give them sweets, toys, to take them to the circus?"\n\nBut surely you don\'t give them poisonous berries to eat, you do not let\nthem go out alone in a boat, you do not take them to a caf\xc3\xa9 chantant?\nWhy then can you restrain yourselves in this case and not in that?\nBecause you do not tell the truth. You say that you love the children so\nmuch that you fear for their life, you are so afraid of hunger, and\ncold, and that is why you appreciate so much the security, which your\nhusband\'s position provides for you, though you consider it unlawful.\n\nYou are so afraid of future eventualities, calamities for your children\nwhich are very distant and doubtful,--and you therefore encourage your\nhusband to do things unjustifiable in your opinion; but what are you\ndoing now to secure your children in their present conditions of life\nfrom the unfortunate eventualities of the present life?\n\nDo you spend much of your time during the day with your children? You do\nwell if you spend one-tenth of the day!\n\nThe remaining time they are under the care of strangers, hired people,\noften taken from the street, or they are in institutions, open to the\ndangers of moral and physical infection.\n\nYour children eat, they are nourished. Who cooks their dinner and what\nfrom? Mostly you know nothing about it. Who instills moral principles\ninto them? Neither do you know that!\n\nThen do not say, that you are suffering evil for the good of your\nchildren--it is not true. You do evil because you like it.\n\nA true mother, the one who in bearing and bringing up children sees her\nself-sacrificing vocation of life and the fulfilment of God\'s will--will\nnot say it.\n\nShe will not say it, because she knows it is not her business to make of\nher children what she herself or current opinions require. She knows\nthat children, i.e., the following generations,--are the greatest and\nmost sacred thing which is given to men to behold in reality: and, to\nserve with all her being, this sacred cause is her life.\n\nShe knows herself,--being constantly between life and death and ever\nrearing the feebly flickering life,--that life and death are not her\nbusiness, her business is to serve life, and she will not therefore\nsearch for distant paths of this service but will only endeavour not to\navoid the near one.\n\nSuch a mother _will bring forth and nurse her children herself_, and,\nabove all things else, will feed and provide for them, will work for\nthem, wash and teach them, will sleep and talk with them, because she\nmakes that her life-work. Only such a mother will not seek for her\nchildren external security through her husband\'s money, or her\nchildren\'s diplomas, but she will exercise in them the same capacity of\nself-sacrificing fulfilment of God\'s will which she knows in herself,\nthe capacity for bearing labour with waste and danger of life, because\nshe knows that only in that lie the security and welfare of life. Such a\nmother will not have to ask others what is her duty: she will know every\nthing, and will fear nothing, for she will always know that she has done\nwhat she was called to do.\n\nIf there can be doubts for a man or for a childless woman about the way\nto fulfil God\'s will, for a mother that way is firmly and clearly drawn;\nand if she fulfils it humbly, with a simple heart, standing on the\nhighest point of good, which it is only given to a human being to\nattain, she becomes the guiding-star for all men, tending to the same\ngood. Only a mother can before her death say to Him who sent her into\nthis world, and to Him whom she has served by bearing and bringing up\nchildren, beloved by her more than herself,--only she can peacefully\nsay, after having served Him in her appointed service,--\n\n"\'Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.\'"\n\nAnd this is that highest perfection, to which, as to the highest good,\nmen aspire.\n\nSuch women who fulfil their mission, are those who reign over reigning\nmen, and serve as a guiding-star to humanity,--those who prepare new\ngenerations of men and form public opinion: and therefore in the hands\nof these women lies the highest power of men\'s salvation from the\nexisting and threatening evils of our time.\n\nYes, women, mothers, in your hands, more than in those of any others,\nlies the salvation of the world!\n\n\n\n\nNOTE TO CHAPTER XL\n\n\nThe vocation of every man and woman is to serve other people. With this\ngeneral proposition, I think all who are not immoral people will agree.\nThe difference between men and women in the fulfilment of that vocation,\nis only in the means by which they attain it; that is to say, by which\nthey serve men.\n\nMan serves others by physical work,--procuring food; by intellectual\nwork,--studying the laws of nature in order to master it; and by social\nwork,--instituting forms of life, and establishing mutual relationships\nbetween people.\n\nThe means of serving others are various for men. The whole activity of\nmankind, with the exception of bearing children and rearing them, is\nopen for his service to men. A woman, in addition to the possibility of\nserving men by all the means open to man is, by the construction of her\nbody, called and inevitably attracted, to serve others by that which\nalone is excepted from the domain of the service of man.\n\nThe service of mankind is divided into two parts,--one, the augmentation\nof the welfare of mankind; the other, the continuation of the race. Men\nare called chiefly to the first, as they are deprived of the possibility\nof fulfilling the second. Women are called exclusively to the second, as\nthey only are fitted for it. This difference one should not, one can\nnot, forget or destroy; and it would be sinful to do so. From this\ndifference proceed the duties of each,--duties not invented by men, but\nwhich are in the nature of things. From the same difference proceeds the\nestimation of virtue and vice for woman and man,--the estimation which\nhas existed in every century, which exists now, and which will never\ncease to exist while reason exists in men.\n\nIt always has been the case, and it always will be, that a man who\nspends a great part of his life in the various physical and mental\nlabours which are natural to him, and a woman who spends a great part of\nher life in the labour of bearing, nursing, and rearing children, which\nis her exclusive prerogative, will alike feel that they are doing their\nduty, and will alike rise in the esteem and love of other people,\nbecause they both fulfil what is appointed because such is the substance\nof the matter.\n\nThe vocation of man is broader and more varied; the vocation of woman\nmore uniform and narrower, but more profound: and therefore it has\nalways been, and always will be, the case, that man, having hundreds of\nduties, will be neither a bad nor a pernicious man, even when he has\nbeen false to one or ten out of them, if he fulfils the greater part of\nhis vocation; while woman, as she has a smaller number of duties, if she\nis false to one of them, instantly falls lower than a man, who has been\nfalse to ten out of his hundreds of duties. Such has always been the\ngeneral opinion, and such it will always remain,--because such is the\nsubstance of the matter.\n\nA man, in order to fulfil God\'s will, must serve him in the domain of\nphysical work, thought and morality: in all these ways he can fulfil his\nvocation. Woman\'s service to God consists chiefly and almost exclusively\nin bearing children (because no one except herself can render it). Only\nby means of work, is man called to serve God and his fellow-men: only by\nmeans of her children, is a woman called to serve them.\n\nTherefore, that love to her own children which is inborn in woman, that\nexclusive love against which it is quite vain to strive by reasoning,\nwill always be, and ought to be, natural to a woman and a mother. That\nlove to a child in its infancy is not egotism, it is the love of a\nworkman for the work which he is doing while it is in his hands. Take\naway that love for the object of one\'s work, and the work becomes\nimpossible. While I am making a boot, I love it above everything. If I\ndid not love it, I could not work at it. If anybody spoils it for me, I\nam in despair; but I only love it thus while I am working at it. When it\nis completed, there remains an attachment, a preference, which is weak\nand illegitimate.\n\nIt is the same with a mother. A man is called to serve others by\nmultifarious labours, and he loves those labours while he is\naccomplishing them. A woman is called to serve others by her children,\nand she cannot help loving those children of hers while she is rearing\nthem to the age of three, seven, or ten years.\n\nIn the general vocation of serving God and others, man and woman are\nentirely equal, notwithstanding the difference of the form of that\nservice. The equality consists in the equal importance of one service\nand of the other,--that the one is impossible without the other, that\nthe one depends upon the other, and that for efficient service, as well\nfor man as for woman, the knowledge of truth is equally necessary.\n\nWithout this knowledge, the activity of man and woman becomes not useful\nbut pernicious for mankind. Man is called to fulfil his multifarious\nlabour; but his labour is only useful, and his physical, mental, and\nsocial labour is only fruitful, when it is fulfilled in the name of\ntruth and the welfare of others.\n\nA man can occupy himself as zealously as he will to increase his\npleasures by vain reasoning and with social activity for his own\nadvantage: his labour will not be fruitful. It will be so only when it\nis directed towards lessening the suffering of others through want and\nignorance and from false social organization.\n\nThe same with woman\'s vocation: her bearing, nursing, and bringing up\nchildren will only be useful to mankind when she gives birth to children\nnot only for her own pleasure, but when she prepares future servants of\nmankind; when the education of those children is done in the name of\ntruth and for the welfare of others,--that is to say, when she will\neducate her children in such a manner that they shall be the very best\nmen possible, and the very best labourers for others.\n\nThe ideal woman, in my opinion, is the one who,--appropriating the\nhighest view of life of the time in which she lives, yet gives herself\nto her feminine mission, which is irresistibly placed in her,--that of\nbringing forth, nursing and educating, the greatest possible number of\nchildren, fitted to work for people according to the view which she has\nof life.\n\nIn order to appropriate the highest view of life, I think there is no\nneed of visiting lectures: all that she requires is to read the gospel,\nand not to shut her eyes, ears, and, most of all, her heart.\n\nWell, and if you ask what those are to do who have no children, who are\nnot married, or who are widows, I answer that those will do well to\nshare man\'s multifarious labour. But one cannot help feeling sorry that\nsuch a precious tool as woman is, should be bereft of the possibility of\nfulfilling the great vocation which it is given to her alone to fulfil.\n\nEspecially as every woman, when she has finished bearing children, if\nshe has strength left, will have time to occupy herself with help in\nman\'s labour. Woman\'s help in that labour is very precious; but it will\nalways be a pity to see a young woman fit for child-bearing occupied by\nman\'s labour.\n\nTo see such a woman, is the same as to see precious vegetable soil\ncovered with stones as a place of parade or as a walking-ground. Still\nmore a pity, because the earth could only produce bread, and a woman\ncould produce that for which there cannot be any equivalent, than which\nthere is nothing higher,--man. And only she is able to do this.\n\n    THE END\n\n\n\n\nJUST PUBLISHED, PRICE 6d.\n\n\n  NEW STORIES by LEO TOLSTOY.\n\n  King Assarhadon,\n  and other Two Stories.\n\n  With Introduction, including quotations from the Letters of Leo Tolstoy.\n\n  Authorized Translation\n  BY\n  V.
