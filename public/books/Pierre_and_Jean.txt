Simon the Warrior earned a high rank for himself and an estate and\nmarried a nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. He had a large income and a large estate,\nbut he could never make both ends meet, for, what he managed to gather\nin, his wife managed to squander; thus it was that he never had any\nmoney.\n\nAnd Simon the Warrior went to his estate one day to collect his income,\nand his steward said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to squeeze money out of;\nwe have neither cattle, nor implements, nor horses, nor cows, nor\nploughs, nor harrows; we must get all these things first, then there\nwill be an income.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen Simon the Warrior went to his father and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are rich,\nfather; and have given me nothing, let me have a third of your\npossessions and I will set up my estate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I? You have brought nothing to the\nhome. It would be unfair to Ivan and the girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Simon said, \xe2\x80\x9cIvan is a fool and Malania is deaf and dumb; they do\nnot need much, surely.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIvan shall decide,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said.\n\nAnd Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind; let him take what he wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimon took a portion of his father\xe2\x80\x99s goods and moved them to his\nestate, and once more he set out to serve the King.\n\nTaras the Pot-bellied made a great deal of money and married a\nmerchant\xe2\x80\x99s widow, but still, it seemed to him that he had not enough, so\nhe too went to his father and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me my portion, father.\xe2\x80\x9d And\nthe old man was loath to give Taras his portion, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\nbrought us nothing; everything in the home has been earned by Ivan; it\nwould be unfair to him and the girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Taras said, \xe2\x80\x9cIvan is a fool, what does he need? He cannot marry, for\nno one would have him, and the girl is deaf and dumb and does not need\nmuch either.\xe2\x80\x9d And turning to Ivan, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me have half the corn,\nIvan. I will not take any implements, and as for the cattle, I only want\nthe grey cob; he is of no use to you for the plough.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall have what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Taras was given his portion, and he carted the corn off to the town\nand took away the grey cob, and Ivan was left with only the old mare to\nwork the farm and support his father and mother.\n\n\nII\n\nThe old Devil was annoyed that the three brothers had not quarrelled\nover the matter and had parted in peace. He summoned three little\nDevilkins.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are three brothers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSimon the Warrior, Taras the\nPot-bellied, and Ivan the Fool. I want them all to quarrel and they live\nin peace and goodwill. It is the Fool\xe2\x80\x99s fault. Go to these three\nbrothers, the three of you, and confound them so that they will scratch\nout each others\xe2\x80\x99 eyes. Do you think you can do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will ruin them first,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cso that they have nothing to eat,\nthen we will put them all together and they will begin to fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you know your work,\xe2\x80\x9d the old Devil said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo then, and do not\nreturn to me until you have confounded the whole three, or else I will\nskin you alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkins set out to a bog to confer on the matter, and they\nargued and argued, for each wanted the easiest work, and they decided to\ncast lots and each to take the brother that fell to him, and whichever\nfinished his work first was to help the others. And the Devilkins cast\nlots and fixed a day when they should meet again in the bog, in order to\nfind out who had finished his work and who was in need of help.\n\nThe day arrived and the Devilkins gathered together in the bog. They\nbegan to discuss their work. The first to give his account was the one\nwho had undertaken Simon the Warrior. \xe2\x80\x9cMy work is progressing well,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow Simon will return to his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you manage it?\xe2\x80\x9d the others asked him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI gave Simon so much courage that he promised\nthe King to conquer the whole world. And the King made him the head of\nhis army and sent him to make war on the King of India. That same night\nI damped the powder of Simon\xe2\x80\x99s troops and I went to the King of India\nand made him numberless soldiers out of straw. And when Simon saw\nhimself surrounded by the straw soldiers, a fear came upon him and he\nordered the guns to fire, but the guns and cannon would not go off. And\nSimon\xe2\x80\x99s troops were terrified and ran away like sheep, and the King of\nIndia defeated them. Simon was disgraced. He was deprived of his rank\nand estate and to-morrow he is to be executed. I have only one day left\nin which to get him out of the dungeon and help him to escape home.\nTo-morrow I shall have finished with him, so I want you to tell me which\nof you two is in need of help.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen the second Devilkin began to tell of his work with Taras. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not\nwant help,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cmy work is also going well. Taras will not live in\nthe town another week. The first thing I did was to make his belly grow\nbigger and fill him with greed. He is now so greedy for other people\xe2\x80\x99s\ngoods that whatever he sees he must buy. He has bought up everything he\ncould lay his eyes on, and spent all his money, and is still buying with\nborrowed money. He has taken so much upon himself, and become so\nentangled that he will never pull himself out. In a week he will have to\nrepay the borrowed money, and I will turn his wares into manure so that\nhe cannot repay, then he will go to his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is your work getting on?\xe2\x80\x9d they asked the third Devilkin about\nIvan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy work is going badly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing I did was to spit\ninto Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s jug of kvas to give him a stomach-ache and then I went into\nhis fields and made the soil as hard as stones so that he could not move\nit. I thought he would not plough it, but the fool came with his plough\nand began to pull. His stomach-ache made him groan, yet still he went on\nploughing. I broke one plough for him and he went home and repaired\nanother, and again persisted in his work. I crawled beneath the ground\nand clutched hold of his ploughshares, but I could not hold them--he\npressed upon the plough so hard, and the shares were sharp and cut my\nhands. He has finished it all but one strip. You must come and help me,\nmates, for singly we shall never get the better of him, and all our\nlabour will be wasted. If the fool keeps on tilling his land, the other\ntwo brothers will never know what need means, for he will feed them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe first Devilkin offered to come and help to-morrow when he had\ndisposed of Simon the Warrior, and with that the three Devilkins parted.\n\n\nIII\n\nIvan had ploughed all the fallow but one strip, and he went to finish\nthat. His stomach ached, yet he had to plough. He undid the harness\nropes, turned over the plough and set out to the fields. He drove one\nfurrow, but coming back, the ploughshares caught on something that\nseemed like a root.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange thing!\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were no roots here, yet\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s a root!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe put his hand into the furrow and clutched hold of something soft. He\npulled it out. It was a thing as black as a root and it moved. He looked\nclosely and saw that it was a live Devilkin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou horrid little wretch, you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan raised his hand to dash its head against the plough, but the\nDevilkin squealed, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t kill me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever you want me to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan scratched his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy stomach aches,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9ccan you make it well?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo it, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Devilkin bent down, rummaged about with his nails in the furrow and\npulled out three little roots, grown together.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cif any one swallows a single one of these roots all\npain will pass away from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took the three roots, separated them and swallowed one. His\nstomach-ache instantly left him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go now,\xe2\x80\x9d the Devilkin begged once more. \xe2\x80\x9cI will dive through the\nearth and never bother you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said; \xe2\x80\x9cgo, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the mention of God the Devilkin plunged into the ground like a stone\nthrown into water, and there was nothing but the hole left. Ivan thrust\nthe two remaining little roots into his cap and went on with his\nploughing. He finished the strip, turned over his plough and set off\nhome. He unharnessed and went into the house, and there was his brother,\nSimon the Warrior, sitting at table with his wife, having supper. His\nestate had been taken from him; he had escaped from prison and come back\nto live with his father.\n\nAs soon as Simon the Warrior saw Ivan, he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI have come with\nmy wife to live with you; will you keep us both until I find another\nplace?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can live here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Ivan sat down by the table, the smell of him was displeasing to the\nlady and she said to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot sup together with a\nstinking peasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Simon the Warrior said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady says you do not smell sweet; you\nhad better eat in the passage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time for bed anyway, and I must feed the\nmare.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took some bread and his coat and went out for the night.\n\n\nIV\n\nThat night, having freed himself of Simon the Warrior, the first little\nDevilkin set out to seek Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s Devilkin, to help him plague the Fool as\nthey had agreed. He came to the fields, looked all round for his mate,\nbut he was nowhere to be seen; he only found a hole. \xe2\x80\x9cI see some\nmisfortune has happened to my mate; I must take his place. The ploughing\nis all finished; I must upset the Fool at the mowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin went to the meadow and flooded it and trampled the hay\nin the mud.\n\nIvan awoke at daybreak, put his scythe in order and set out to the\nmeadow to mow the hay. Ivan swung the scythe once, he swung it twice,\nbut the scythe grew blunt and would not cut; he had to sharpen it. Ivan\nstruggled and struggled and struggled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI must go home and bring a whetstone and a\nhunk of bread. If it takes me a week I\xe2\x80\x99ll not give up until I\xe2\x80\x99ve mowed\nit every bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin grew pensive when he heard these words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Fool has a temper,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t catch him this way; I must\nthink of something else.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan returned, sharpened his scythe and began to mow. The Devilkin crept\ninto the grass, caught hold of the scythe by the heel and pushed the\npoint into the ground. It was hard for Ivan, but he mowed all the grass,\nexcept a little piece in the swamp.\n\nThe Devilkin crept into the swamp, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cEven if I have to cut my\nhands I won\xe2\x80\x99t let him mow that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan came to the swamp. The grass was not thick, but the scythe could\nnot cut through it. Ivan grew angry and began to mow with all his might.\nThe Devilkin began to lose hold, seeing that he was in a bad plight,\nbut he had no time to get away and took refuge in a bush. Ivan swung the\nscythe near the bush and cut off half the Devilkin\xe2\x80\x99s tail. He finished\nmowing the grass, told the old maid to rake it up and went away to mow\nthe rye.\n\nHe came to the field with his sickle, but the Devilkin with the clipped\ntail was there before him. He had entangled the rye, so that the sickle\ncould not take it. Ivan went back for his reaping-hook and reaped the\nwhole field of rye. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must tackle the oats.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt these words the Devilkin with the clipped tail thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not\ntrip him up with the rye, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll do so with the oats. If only the\nmorrow would come!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the morning the Devilkin hurried off to the field of oats, but the\noats were all harvested. Ivan had reaped them overnight so that less of\nthe grain should be wasted. The Devilkin lost his temper at that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has mutilated and exhausted me, the fool! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had such\ntrouble on the battlefield even. The wretch doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep and you can\xe2\x80\x99t\nget ahead of him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll creep into the stacks of sheaves and rot the\ngrain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin crept into a stack of sheaves, and began to rot them.\nHe heated them, grew warm himself and fell asleep.\n\nIvan harnessed the mare and set out with his sister to gather in the\nsheaves. He stopped by the stack and began to throw the sheaves into the\ncart. He had thrown up two sheaves and was going to take up a third,\nwhen the fork dug into the Devilkin\xe2\x80\x99s back. He looked at the prongs and\nsaw a live Devilkin with his tail clipped, wriggling and writhing and\ntrying to get away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou horrid little wretch! You here again!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not the same one,\xe2\x80\x9d the Devilkin pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other was my brother.\nI belong to your brother Simon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever you are you shall share the same fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan was about to dash it against the cart, when the Devilkin cried out,\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll not worry you again, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever you want me\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make soldiers out of anything you choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can make them do anything you like. Soldiers can do everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan they play songs?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; make some, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin said, \xe2\x80\x9cTake a sheaf of rye and bump it upright on the\nground, saying,--\n\n    My slave bids you be a sheaf no more.\n    Every straw contained in you,\n    Must turn into a soldier true.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took the sheaf and banged it on the ground and repeated the\nDevilkin\xe2\x80\x99s words. And the sheaf burst asunder and every straw turned\ninto a soldier and at their head the drummer and bugler were playing.\nIvan laughed aloud.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was clever of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will amuse Malania.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go now,\xe2\x80\x9d the Devilkin begged.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall want to make the soldiers out of chaff so\nas not to waste the grain. Show me first how to turn the soldiers into a\nsheaf again, so that I can thrash it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin said, \xe2\x80\x9cRepeat the words--\n\n    My slave bids every soldier be a straw\n    And turn into a sheaf once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan repeated the Devilkin\xe2\x80\x99s words, and the soldiers turned into a sheaf\nagain.\n\nAnd again the Devilkin pleaded, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, taking him off the prongs. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the mention of God the Devilkin plunged into the ground like a stone\nthrown into water, and there was nothing but the hole left.\n\nWhen Ivan reached home, his other brother, Taras, and his wife were\nsitting at table and having supper. Taras could not pay his debts; he\nfled from his creditors and came home to his father. As soon as he saw\nIvan he said, \xe2\x80\x9cUntil I can make some more money, will you keep me and my\nwife?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can live here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took off his coat and sat down to table.\n\nAnd Taras\xe2\x80\x99 wife said, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot sup with a fool; he smells of sweat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaras the Pot-bellied said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not smell sweet, Ivan; go and eat in\nthe passage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s time for bed, anyhow, and I must feed the\nmare.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took his coat and a piece of bread, and went out.\n\n\nV\n\nThat night, having disposed of Taras, the third little Devilkin came to\nhelp his mates plague Ivan, as they had agreed. He came to the ploughed\nfield and looked and looked, but could see no one; he only found the\nhole. Then he went to the meadow and found a piece of tail in the swamp,\nand in the rye-stubble field he found another hole.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see some misfortune has happened to my mates. I must take their\nplaces and tackle the Fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Devilkin set out to find Ivan.\n\nIvan had finished his work in the fields and had gone into the copse to\ncut wood.\n\nThe brothers found it too crowded to live together in their father\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse and they ordered Ivan to fell timber to build themselves new\nhouses.\n\nThe Devilkin rushed into the wood and crept into the knots of the trees\nto prevent Ivan from felling them.\n\nIvan had cut a tree in the right way so that it should fall on to a\nclear space, but the tree seemed to be possessed, and fell over where it\nwas not wanted, and got entangled among the branches. Ivan lopped them\noff with his bill-hook and at last, with great difficulty, brought down\nthe tree. He began to fell another and the same thing was repeated. He\nstruggled and struggled and succeeded only after great exertion. He\nbegan on a third and the same thing happened. Ivan had intended to fell\nfifty trees at least, and he had not managed more than ten, and night\nwas coming on. Ivan was exhausted, and the steam rose from him and\nfloated through the wood like a mist; yet still he would not give up. He\nfelled another tree and his back began to ache so that he could not go\non. He stuck his axe into the trunk of a tree and sat down to rest.\n\nWhen the Devilkin realized that Ivan had ceased to work, he rejoiced.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is worn out at last,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cnow I can rest too.\xe2\x80\x9d And he sat\nhimself astride on a branch, exulting.\n\nIvan rose, took out his axe, flourished it aloft, and brought it down so\nheavily that the tree came down with a crash. The Devilkin had no time\nto disentangle his legs; the branch broke and pinned down his paw.\n\nIvan began to clear the tree and behold! there was a live Devilkin. Ivan\nwas amazed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou horrid little wretch! You here again!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not the same one,\xe2\x80\x9d the Devilkin said. \xe2\x80\x9cI belong to your brother\nTaras.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever you may be, you shall share the same fate.\xe2\x80\x9d And Ivan raised\nthe axe to bring it down on its head, but the Devilkin began to plead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t kill me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever you want me to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make as much money as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said; \xe2\x80\x9cmake it, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin taught him what to do.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake some leaves from this oak and rub them in your hands and gold will\nfall to the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took the leaves and rubbed them in his hand and gold rained down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9con holidays it will amuse the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go,\xe2\x80\x9d the Devilkin begged.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, and taking up his axe, he freed the Devilkin\nof the branch. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the mention of God the Devilkin plunged into the ground like a stone\nthrown into water and there was nothing but the hole left.\n\n\nVI\n\nThe brothers built themselves houses and began to live apart. Ivan\nfinished his work in the fields, brewed some beer and invited his\nbrothers to a feast. The brothers did not accept his invitation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not go to feast with peasants,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\nIvan treated the peasants and the peasant-women and drank himself until\nhe got tipsy, and he went into the street and joined the dancers and\nsingers. He approached the women, and bade them sing his praises.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give you something you have never seen in your lives,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe women laughed and began to sing his praises, and when they had\nfinished, they said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, give us what you promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bring it in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, and he took his seed-basket\nand ran into the wood.\n\nThe women laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d they said, and forgot all about him,\nwhen behold! Ivan returned, his basket full of something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I share it out?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took up a handful of gold and threw it to the women. Heavens! The\nwomen rushed to pick it up, the peasants after them, snatching it out of\neach others\xe2\x80\x99 hands. One old woman was nearly killed in the fray.\n\nIvan laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fools!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you hurt Granny? If you are not so rough\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe scattered more gold. The whole village came up. Ivan emptied his\nbasket. The people asked for more, but he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNot now; another time\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you more. Now let us dance. You play some songs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe women began to play.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like your songs,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know any better ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see in a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan went into a barn, took up a sheaf, thrashed it, stood it up, and\nbanged it on the floor, and said--\n\n    My slave bids you be a sheaf no more.\n    Every straw contained in you\n    Must turn into a soldier true.\n\nAnd the sheaf burst asunder and turned into soldiers, and the drummers\nand buglers played at their head. Ivan asked the soldiers to play some\nsongs, and led them into the street. The people were amazed.\n\nWhen the soldiers had played their songs Ivan took them back into the\nbarn, forbidding any one to follow. He turned the soldiers into a sheaf\nagain and threw it on a pile of straw, then he went home and lay down to\nsleep in the stables.\n\n\nVII\n\nSimon the Warrior heard of these things next morning, and went to his\nbrother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere did you get the soldiers from, and where did\nyou take them to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter, indeed! With soldiers one can do anything. One can conquer a\nkingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally! Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me before?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will make you\nas many soldiers as you like. It is well Malania and I have threshed so\nmuch straw.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took his brother to the barn and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, if I make the\nsoldiers you must take them away at once, for if we have to feed them\nthey will eat up the whole village in a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimon the Warrior promised to take the soldiers away, and Ivan began to\nmake them. He banged a sheaf on the threshing-floor and a company\nappeared. He banged another sheaf and a second company appeared. He made\nso many soldiers that they filled the whole field.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there enough now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nSimon was overjoyed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat will do, Ivan, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. If you want more, come back and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make them for you.\nThere is plenty of straw this year.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimon the Warrior soon put his troops in order, and went away to make\nwar.\n\nHe had no sooner gone than Taras the Pot-bellied came along. He, too,\nhad heard of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s affair and he said to his brother, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me\nwhere you get gold money from. If only I could get hold of some I could\nmake it bring in money from the whole world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me before? I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you as much as\nyou like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaras was overjoyed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be satisfied with three baskets full,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; come into the wood,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I had better harness\nthe mare, for you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to carry it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey rode into the wood. Ivan began to rub the oak leaves, and made a\nheap of gold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it enough?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nTaras was overjoyed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will do for the present, thank you, Ivan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said; \xe2\x80\x9cif you want more, come back and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it\nfor you. There are plenty of leaves left.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaras the Pot-bellied gathered up a whole cartload of money, and went\noff to trade.\n\nBoth brothers had gone--Simon to make war and Taras to trade. And Simon\nthe Warrior conquered a kingdom, and Taras the Pot-bellied made much\nmoney in trade.\n\nWhen the two brothers met they told each other how they had come by\ntheir soldiers and money.\n\nSimon the Warrior said to his brother, \xe2\x80\x9cI have conquered a kingdom for\nmyself and live well, only I have not enough money to feed my soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Taras the Pot-bellied said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have made a heap of money, only\nunfortunately I have no one to guard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Simon the Warrior said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to our brother Ivan. I will ask\nhim to make more soldiers and give them to you to guard your money, and\nyou must ask him to make more money and give it to me to feed my\nsoldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd they came to Ivan.\n\nAnd Simon said, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t enough soldiers, brother. Will you make\nanother couple of sheaves for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan shook his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t make you any more soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you promised you would.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I promised, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t make any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, you fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause your soldiers killed a man. I will not let you have any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he was obstinate, and would not make any more soldiers.\n\nThen Taras the Pot-bellied asked Ivan the Fool to make him more golden\nmoney.\n\nIvan shook his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t make any more money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I promised, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t make any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, you fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause your money took a cow away from a woman in the village.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman had a cow. The children used to drink the milk, but the\nother day they came to beg a little milk of me. \xe2\x80\x98But where\xe2\x80\x99s your cow?\xe2\x80\x99\nI asked them, and they said, \xe2\x80\x98Taras\xe2\x80\x99 bailiff came and gave mother three\ngolden coins and she gave him the cow; now we have no milk to drink.\xe2\x80\x99 I\nthought you only wanted to play with the golden coins, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken\naway the cow from the children; I won\xe2\x80\x99t give you any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Fool was obstinate and kept to his word.\n\nAnd the brothers went away and deliberated over their difficult\nsituation in order to find a way out.\n\nSimon said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what we must do. You give me some of your money to\nfeed my soldiers, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you half my kingdom and soldiers to\nguard your money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaras agreed. The brothers divided their possessions, and both became\nkings and both were rich.\n\n\nVIII\n\nAnd Ivan lived at home, supporting his father and mother and working in\nthe fields with his deaf and dumb sister.\n\nOne day Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s yard-dog fell sick. He grew mangy, and was near dying.\nIvan pitied it. He took a piece of bread from his sister, put it in his\ncap, carried it out and threw it to the dog. The creases in his cap\nparted and out rolled one of the little roots with the bread. The dog\nate it up. As soon as it had swallowed the root it began to jump about\nand bark and play and wag its tail. It was quite well again.\n\nThe father and mother were amazed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you cure the dog?\xe2\x80\x9d they asked.\n\nAnd Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cI had two little roots that could cure any pain, and the\ndog swallowed one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt happened at the time that the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter fell ill, and the King\nproclaimed to every town and village that he would reward any man who\ncould cure her, and that if he were an unmarried man he should have her\nfor his wife. The news came to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s village.\n\nAnd the father and mother summoned Ivan and said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard\nof the King\xe2\x80\x99s promise? You told us you had a little root that could cure\nany sickness; go, cure the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, you will then be happy for\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Ivan prepared himself for the journey, and they dressed him in his\nbest clothes. When he came out on the doorstep he saw a beggar-woman\nwith a crippled hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard that you can cure the sick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCure my hand, for I\ncannot even put on my own shoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said. And he took the little root out of his cap, gave\nit to the beggar-woman and told her to swallow it. As soon as she\nswallowed it, she recovered, and began to wave her hand.\n\nThe father and mother came out to bid good-bye to Ivan, and they heard\nthat he had given away his last root and had nothing left with which to\ncure the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and they began to scold him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pity a beggar-woman, yet have no pity for the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthey reproached him.\n\nBut Ivan was sorry for the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. He harnessed the mare, threw\nsome straw into the cart and got in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to, you fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo cure the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have nothing to cure her with now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and drove away.\n\nHe came to the King\xe2\x80\x99s palace, and as soon as he stepped over the\nthreshold the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter got well.\n\nThe King was overjoyed. He ordered Ivan to be brought to him, and\ndressed him in fine clothes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be my son-in-law,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said.\n\nAnd Ivan married the princess. Her father died soon after, and Ivan\nbecame King.\n\nAll three brothers were now kings.\n\n\nIX\n\nThe three brothers lived and reigned.\n\nThe elder brother Simon the Warrior lived well. With his straw soldiers\nhe gathered together real soldiers. Throughout the whole of his kingdom\nhe ordered a levy of one soldier for every ten houses, and each soldier\nhad to be tall and whole of body and clean of face. In this way he\ngathered many soldiers and trained them. If any one opposed him he sent\nhis soldiers off at once and imposed his will, and people began to fear\nhim. His life was a very goodly one. Whatever he saw and wanted was his.\nHe sent his soldiers and they brought him all he wanted.\n\nTaras the Pot-bellied also lived well. He did not lose the money Ivan\nhad given him, but increased it a hundredfold. He introduced law and\norder into his kingdom. He stowed his money away in coffers and levied\ntaxes on the people. There was a poll-tax, and tolls for walking and\ndriving, and a tax on shoes and stockings and frills. He got whatever he\nwanted. For money people brought him everything, and even worked for\nhim, for every one wanted money.\n\nIvan the Fool, too, did not live badly. As soon as his father-in-law was\ndead he took off his royal robes and gave them to his wife to stow away\nin a chest. And he put on his coarse linen shirt and breeches and\npeasant shoes and began to work once more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so dull for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got fat, lost my appetite and\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe brought his father and mother and sister to live with him, and began\nto work as of old.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are a king,\xe2\x80\x9d people remonstrated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven a king must eat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nOne of his ministers came to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no money to pay\nsalaries.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t pay them, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no one will serve us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter? They needn\xe2\x80\x99t. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have more time for work.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s the manure to cart; heaps of it lying about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen people came to Ivan for justice and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat man stole my\nmoney,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; he must have wanted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd all realized that Ivan was a fool. And his wife said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\nsay you are a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said.\n\nHis wife reflected awhile, but she was also a fool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I go against my husband?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the needle goes,\nthe thread follows.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo she took off her royal robes, put them away in a chest and went to\nMalania to learn to work. When she knew how, she began to help her\nhusband.\n\nAll the wise left Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom, and only the fools remained.\n\nNobody had money. They lived and worked, fed themselves and others.\n\n\nX\n\nThe old Devil waited and waited for news of the Devilkins. He was\nexpecting to hear that they had ruined the three brothers, but no news\ncame. He set out himself to find them. He searched and searched, and\nfound nothing but three holes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve not been able to manage it, evidently,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI must\ntackle the job myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe went to look for the brothers, but they were no longer in their old\nplaces. He found them in their different kingdoms. All three lived and\nreigned. The old Devil was annoyed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I can do!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nFirst of all he went to King Simon.\n\nHe did not go in his own shape, but disguised himself as a general. In\nthat guise he appeared before King Simon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard that you are a great warrior, King Simon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\nwell versed in these things and want to serve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd King Simon began to ask him all manner of questions, and seeing that\nhe was a clever man, he took him into his service.\n\nThe new commander instructed King Simon how to collect a large army.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must get more soldiers. There are many idle\npeople in your kingdom. We must conscript all the young men without\nexception, then you will have an army five times as large as the one you\nhave now. Secondly, we must get new guns and cannons. I will get guns\nthat will fire a hundred bullets at one shot; they will rain out like\npeas. And I will get cannons that will consume with fire either man or\nhorse or wall; they will burn everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKing Simon listened to the new commander, and enrolled all the young men\nas soldiers and built new factories where he manufactured new guns and\ncannons, then he made war on a neighbouring king. As soon as he was\nfaced by the opposing army, King Simon ordered his soldiers to rain\nbullets against it and shoot fire from their cannons, in this way wiping\nout half the hostile troops. The neighbouring king was alarmed; he\nsurrendered and gave up his kingdom. King Simon rejoiced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will make war on the King of India.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the King of India heard of King Simon\xe2\x80\x99s doings. He adopted all his\nmethods, and invented some improvements of his own. He not only enrolled\nall the young men as soldiers, but the unmarried women as well, and in\nconsequence had a larger army than King Simon. And he made guns and\ncannons like King Simon\xe2\x80\x99s, and invented machines to fly in the air and\ndrop explosive bombs from above.\n\nAnd King Simon set out to make war on the King of India, thinking he\nwould beat him as easily as he had beaten the other king, but the scythe\nthat had cut so well had lost its edge. The King of India did not give\nSimon time to open fire, for he sent his women to fly in the air and\ndrop explosive bombs on Simon\xe2\x80\x99s troops. And the women rained down bombs\nfrom above like borax upon cockroaches and Simon\xe2\x80\x99s troops scattered and\nfled, and Simon was left alone.\n\nThe King of India took possession of Simon\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom, and Simon the\nWarrior escaped as best he could.\n\nHaving disposed of this brother, the old Devil went to King Taras.\n\nHe changed himself into a merchant and settled in Taras\xe2\x80\x99 kingdom, where\nhe opened establishments and began to circulate money freely. He paid\nhigh prices for everything, and the people flocked to him for the sake\nof the extra profit. And the people came to have so much money that they\nwere able to settle all their arrears and to pay their taxes at the\nproper time. King Taras rejoiced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks to the merchant,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI have more money than ever, and\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to live better than I used to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he began making all sorts of new plans, and decided to have a new\npalace built for himself. He proclaimed to the people that he wanted\ntimber and stone and labour, for which he was prepared to pay a high\nprice. King Taras thought that for his money people would flock to work\nfor him as of old. But lo! all the timber and stone was taken to the\nmerchant, and all the labourers flocked to work for him. King Taras\nraised his price, and the merchant raised his. King Taras had much\nmoney, but the merchant had more and beat the King. The King\xe2\x80\x99s palace\ncould not be built.\n\nKing Taras had arranged to make a new garden. When the autumn came he\nproclaimed that he wanted men to come and plant his garden, but no one\ncame, for the people were all digging for the merchant.\n\nWinter came. King Taras wanted to buy some sable skins for a new coat.\nHe sent a messenger to buy it, but the messenger returned empty-handed,\nand said that there were no sable skins, for the merchant had bought\nthem all at a higher price, and made himself a sable carpet.\n\nKing Taras wanted to buy some stallions. He sent a messenger, but the\nmessenger returned and said that the merchant had all the good\nstallions; they were carting water for him to make a pond.\n\nAnd the King\xe2\x80\x99s plans fell to pieces, for no one would work for him. All\nworked for the merchant, and only brought him the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s money to\npay the taxes.\n\nAnd the King came to have so much money that he did not know where to\nput it all, but he lived badly. The King gave up making plans; he would\nhave been contented to live quietly somehow, but even that was\ndifficult. He was hampered on all sides. His cook and coachman and\nservants left him to go to the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s. He even went short of food.\nWhen he sent to the market to buy some provisions there were none left,\nfor the merchant had bought up everything, and the people only brought\nthe King money for their taxes.\n\nKing Taras lost patience and banished the merchant from his kingdom. The\nmerchant settled on the very border, and did exactly the same as before,\nand for his money the people dragged everything away from the King and\nbrought it to the merchant. Life became very hard for the King. For\nwhole days he did not eat, and to make matters worse a rumour went\nabroad that the merchant had boasted that he would buy the King\nhimself. King Taras lost courage, and did not know what to do.\n\nSimon the Warrior came to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you support me? I have\nbeen beaten by the King of India.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKing Taras himself was in a sad plight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t eaten anything myself for two days,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\nXI\n\nHaving disposed of the two brothers, the old Devil went to Ivan. He\nchanged himself into a general and came to Ivan, and began to persuade\nhim to set up a large army.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA king should not live without an army,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me the power,\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll collect soldiers from among your people and organize an army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan listened to all he had to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9corganize one, then; only teach the soldiers to\nsing nice songs, for I like singing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old Devil went through Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom to collect a voluntary\narmy. To each recruit who should offer himself he promised a bottle of\nvodka and a red cap.\n\nThe fools laughed at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have plenty of drink,\xe2\x80\x9d they said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe brew it ourselves, and as for\ncaps, our women can make us any kind we like--embroidered ones and even\nones with fringes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd no one offered himself.\n\nThe old Devil went back to Ivan and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour fools won\xe2\x80\x99t enlist of\ntheir own accord; we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to force them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; force them, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old Devil proclaimed throughout the kingdom that every man must\nenlist as a soldier, and if he fails to do so Ivan will have him put to\ndeath.\n\nThe fools came to the Devil and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell us that if we won\xe2\x80\x99t\nenlist as soldiers the King will have us put to death, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t say\nwhat will happen to us when we become soldiers. People say that soldiers\nare killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t get over that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen the fools heard this they kept to their decision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d sooner die at home since we have to die\nin either case.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fools you are!\xe2\x80\x9d the old Devil said. \xe2\x80\x9cA soldier may or may not be\nkilled, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go King Ivan will have you put to death for\ncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fools reflected over this; then went to Ivan the Fool and said, \xe2\x80\x9cA\ngeneral has appeared among us who orders us all to enlist as soldiers.\n\xe2\x80\x98If you go as a soldier,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98you may or you may not be killed,\nbut if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go, King Ivan will have you put to death for certain.\xe2\x80\x99\nIs it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I alone have you all put to death? Had I not been a fool I\nwould have explained it to you, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we won\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d the fools said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fools went to the general and refused to enlist as soldiers.\n\nThe old Devil saw that his plan would not work, so he went to the King\nof Tarakan and wormed himself into his favour.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet us go and make war on King Ivan. He has no money,\nbut grain and cattle and all manner of good things he has in abundance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King of Tarakan prepared to make war. He gathered together a large\narmy, repaired his guns and cannons and marched across the border on his\nway to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom.\n\nPeople came to Ivan and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe King of Tarakan is marching on us\nwith his army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; let him,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said.\n\nWhen the King of Tarakan crossed the border he sent his vanguard to find\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s troops. They searched and searched, but no troops were to be\nfound anywhere. Should they wait and see if they showed themselves? But\nthere was no sign of any troops and no one to fight with. The King of\nTarakan sent men to seize the villages. The soldiers came to one village\nand the fools--men and women alike--rushed out and stood gaping at them\nin wonder. The soldiers began to take away their corn and cattle and\nthe fools let them have what they wanted, making no resistance. The\nsoldiers went to another village and the same thing was repeated. And\nthey marched one day and another, and still the same thing happened.\nEverything was given up without any resistance and the fools even\ninvited the soldiers to stay with them. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you find it hard to live in\nyour parts, good fellows, come and settle with us altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d And the\nsoldiers marched from village to village and no troops were to be found\nanywhere; the people lived, fed themselves and others; no one offered\nany resistance and every one invited them to settle there.\n\nAnd the soldiers grew weary of the job and they went back to their King\nof Tarakan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t fight here,\xe2\x80\x9d they said; \xe2\x80\x9ctake us to another place. This is not\nwar; this is child\xe2\x80\x99s-play. We can\xe2\x80\x99t fight here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King of Tarakan grew angry. He ordered his soldiers to go over the\nwhole kingdom and lay waste the villages and burn the corn and kill the\ncattle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t do what I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will punish you all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers were frightened and began to carry out the King\xe2\x80\x99s commands.\nThey burnt the houses and corn and killed the cattle. The fools made no\nresistance, they only wept. The old men wept and the old women and the\nlittle children.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you treat us like this?\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you waste the good\nthings? If you want them, why not take them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the soldiers grew to loathe their work. They refused to go further\nand the troops dispersed.\n\n\nXII\n\nAnd the old Devil went away, having failed to bring Ivan to reason by\nmeans of the soldiers.\n\nThe old Devil changed himself into a clean gentleman and came to live in\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom, hoping to ruin Ivan by money, as he had done Taras.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to do you good and teach you common sense,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will\nbuild myself a house in your midst and open an establishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d the people said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can live here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe clean gentleman spent the night and in the morning he went out to\nthe square with a bag of gold and a bundle of papers and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou all\nlive like swine. I want to teach you how you ought to live. Build me a\nhouse according to this plan. You will work for me and I will teach you\nand pay you in golden money.\xe2\x80\x9d And he showed them the gold.\n\nThe fools marvelled. They had no money in circulation, but exchanged\nthing for thing, or paid by labour. And they began to exchange things\nwith the gentleman and to work for his golden coins. And the old Devil,\nas in Taras\xe2\x80\x99 kingdom, began to circulate gold, and people brought him\nthings and worked for him.\n\nThe old Devil rejoiced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last my plan is beginning to work!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI will ruin him as\nI ruined Taras, and will get him completely in my power.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fools collected the golden coins and gave them to the women to make\nthemselves necklaces and to the girls to plait into their hair; the\nchildren even played with the coins in the street. After a while every\none had enough and refused to take more. And the clean gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s house\nwas not half finished, and the corn and cattle had not yet been stored\nup for the year. And the gentleman invited people to come and work for\nhim to bring him corn and rear his cattle, offering to pay many golden\ncoins for everything brought and every piece of work done.\n\nBut no one would come and work, and no one would bring him anything,\nunless a chance boy or girl brought him an egg in exchange for a golden\ncoin; and no one else came and he was left without any food. And the\nclean gentleman was hungry and went through the village to buy himself\nsomething for dinner. He went into one house and offered a golden coin\nfor a chicken, but the mistress would not take it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have many such coins,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nHe went into another place to buy a salt herring, offering a golden\npiece. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want it, my good man,\xe2\x80\x9d the mistress said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no\nchildren to play with them, and have three of these pieces already as\ncuriosities.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe went into a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s for some bread. The peasant too would not take\nthe money.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you want the bread in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name,\nthen wait, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell my old woman to cut you some.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old Devil spat on the ground and fled from the peasant. To hear the\nword Christ was worse than a knife to him, let alone to take anything in\nHis name.\n\nAnd so he got no bread. All had gold; wherever the old Devil went no one\nwould give him anything for money, and every one said, \xe2\x80\x9cBring us\nsomething else instead, or come and work, or take it in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd the Devil had nothing to offer but money and had no liking for work,\nand he could not take anything in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name. He lost his temper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat more do you want when I offer you money?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can buy\nanything you like for gold and employ any kind of labour.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the fools did not heed him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t need money,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe exchange everything in kind and\nhave no taxes to pay; what good would it be to us?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old Devil went supperless to bed.\n\nThe story reached Ivan the Fool. People came to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nshall we do? A clean gentleman has appeared in our midst who likes to\neat and drink well, and dress in fine clothes, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t work and\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t take anything in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name; he only offers us golden coins.\nPeople gave him what he wanted until they had enough of these coins, and\nnow no one gives him anything. What are we to do with him? He may die of\nhunger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan listened to what they had to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be fed, certainly. Let him act as a shepherd to you all in\nturn.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSince there was no way out, the old Devil had to go about shepherding.\nHe went from house to house until it came to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s turn. The old Devil\ncame in to dinner and the deaf and dumb girl was getting it ready. She\nhad often been deceived by lazy folk who came in early to dinner without\nhaving done their share of work and ate up all the porridge, so she\ninvented a means of finding out the sluggards by their hands. Those who\nhad horny hands were put at the table; the others were given the\nleavings. The old Devil sat down by the table, but the deaf and dumb\ngirl seized him by the hands and looked at them to see if they had any\nblisters, but they were clean and smooth and the finger nails were long.\nThe girl grunted and pulled the old Devil away from the table.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s wife said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be offended, fine gentleman. My\nsister-in-law never lets any one sit at the table who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t horny\nhands. In good time, when the others have finished, you shall get what\nis left.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old Devil was hurt that in the King\xe2\x80\x99s house they should want to\nfeed him with the pigs. And he said to Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a stupid custom there\nis in your kingdom that all people must work with their hands! I\nsuppose you were too stupid to think of anything else. Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s\nonly with the hands people work? Do you know what wise men work with?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow are we fools to know; we work only with our hands\nand backs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is because you are fools. I will teach you how to work with the\nhead, then you will know that it is more profitable than to work with\nthe hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally! No wonder people call us fools!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old Devil said, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to work with the head. You\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t give me any dinner because my hands are smooth, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s a hundred times harder to work with the head. Sometimes one\xe2\x80\x99s\nhead nearly splits.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan grew thoughtful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you torture yourself so, my good man? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better\nto do the easier work with your hands and back?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devil said, \xe2\x80\x9cI torture myself because I pity you fools. If I\nwere not to torture myself you would remain fools for ever. I have\nworked with the head and now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to teach you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeach us, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso that when our hands are tired we can work\nwith the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Devil promised to teach them.\n\nAnd Ivan proclaimed throughout his kingdom that a clean gentleman had\nappeared among them who would teach every one to work with his head and\nthat it was more profitable to work with the head than with the hands,\nand he bade every man come and hear him.\n\nThere was a high tower in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom and a steep staircase leading\nup to it and there was a turret on the top. And Ivan took the gentleman\nup the tower, so that he might be seen by all.\n\nAnd the gentleman took his place on the top of the tower and began to\nspeak, and the fools flocked to look at him. They thought that the\ngentleman would really show them how to work with the head instead of\nthe hands, but he merely told them in words how they could live without\nworking at all. The fools did not understand him. They stared and\nstared, then went home to attend to their own affairs.\n\nThe old Devil stood on top of the tower one day and another, speaking\nall the time. He was hungry, but it never occurred to the fools to bring\nhim some bread up the tower. They thought that if he could work with the\nhead better than with the hands, he could easily make himself some\nbread. The old Devil stood on the tower for another day, still speaking.\nThe people came and stared at him for a while; then went their ways.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, has the gentleman begun to work with his head?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet; he is still jabbering.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Devil stood on the tower for another day and began to grow faint. He\nswayed and knocked his head against a pillar. One of the fools saw him\nand told Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who hastened to Ivan at the ploughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say the gentleman has begun to work with\nhis head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and turning his horse round, he went to the tower.\nWhen he got there, the old Devil, who was quite faint with hunger by\nthis time, was staggering and knocking his head against the pillars, and\nwhen Ivan came up he fell with a crash down the stairs, counting each\nstep on the way with a knock of his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe clean gentleman spoke truly when he said that\nthe head splits sometimes. Blisters on the hands are nothing to this;\nafter such work there will be bumps on the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old Devil fell to the bottom of the stairs and thumped his head\nagainst the ground. Ivan was about to go up and see how much work he had\ndone, when suddenly the earth opened and the old Devil fell through.\nOnly a hole was left.\n\nIvan scratched his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou horrid wretch! One of those devils again! The father of the others,\nno doubt. What a huge one too!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan is living to this day and people flock to his kingdom. His own\nbrothers have come to him and he supports them. When any one comes and\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cFeed me,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan says, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, you can live with us; we have\nplenty of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Only there is a special custom in his\nkingdom--whoever has horny hands comes to table; whoever has smooth ones\neats the leavings.\n\n[Illustration: WHERE THERE IS LOVE, THERE IS GOD ALSO.\n\n_To face page 56._]\n\n\n\n\nWHERE THERE IS LOVE, THERE IS GOD ALSO\n\n\nIn the town there was a shoemaker by the name of Martin, who lived in a\nbasement with a tiny little window looking out into the street. Martin\ncould see the people pass, and though he only got a glimpse of their\nfeet, he still knew every one, for Martin could recognize people by\ntheir boots. Martin had lived in that basement for many a long year and\nhad numbers of acquaintances. There were not many pairs of boots in the\nneighbourhood that had not been through his hands at least once or\ntwice--some for new soles, others for a patch or a stitch, or a second\ntime for new tops, perhaps. Martin had plenty of work, for he always did\nit well; he gave good leather, did not overcharge, and kept true to his\nword. If he could do a piece of work for the time it was required, he\ntook it; if not, he would not deceive his customers and told them so\nbeforehand. And all knew Martin and he had no lack of work.\n\nMartin had always been a good man, but as he grew older he began to\nthink the more about his soul and to draw nearer to God. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s wife\nhad died when he had still worked for a master, and he was left with a\nboy of three years old. Their children never survived; the eldest were\nall dead. At first Martin wanted to send his little son to a sister in\nthe country, but he felt sorry for the child, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be hard\nfor the poor boy to grow up in a strange family; I will keep him with\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Martin left his master and went into lodgings with his little son.\nBut God had not ordained Martin to be happy in his children. The boy had\nno sooner grown up and become a help and a comfort to his father than he\nfell sick, tossed about with fever for a week and died. Martin buried\nhis son and gave himself up to despair. His despair was so great that he\neven began to complain against God. Martin was so lonely that many were\nthe times he prayed to God to let him die, reproaching Him for having\nspared an old man like himself and taken his only beloved son. Martin\ngave up going to church.\n\nOne day an old countryman came to visit him, who had been on a\npilgrimage for eight years. Martin opened his heart to the old man and\ncomplained about his sorrow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no desire to live even,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI only want to die. That is\nall I pray to God about. I am a desperate man now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not well what you say, Martin; we\ncannot judge the ways of God; they are beyond our understanding. He has\njudged it fitting to take away your son and to let you live, so it must\nbe for the best. You despair because you want to live only for your own\npersonal pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what else should I live for?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked.\n\nAnd the old man said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must live for God, Martin. He gave you life\nand you must live for Him. When you begin to live for Him and cease to\nworry about anything, then all will become easy for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin was silent a while; then asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can one live for God?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must live for God as Christ taught us. You can\nread, can you not? Then buy the Gospels and read them and you will find\nout how to live for God. The Gospels tell us everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin took these words to heart. That very day he bought a copy of the\nNew Testament, printed in large type, and began to read it.\n\nMartin had intended to read only on holidays, but when he once began he\ngrew so light-hearted that he read every day. Sometimes he got so\nabsorbed in his reading that the oil in the lamp burnt low and still he\ncould not tear himself away.\n\nMartin read every evening, and the more he read the more clearly he\nunderstood what God required of him and how he was to live for God. And\nhis heart grew lighter than ever. At one time when he went to bed he\nwould sigh and moan and think of his boy; now he only said to himself,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory to Thee, glory to Thee, God! Thy will be done!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd a change came into Martin\xe2\x80\x99s life. On holidays he used to hang about\nthe public-houses to drink a cup of tea and did not refuse vodka even\nwhen it came his way. He would drink, as it happened, with some\nacquaintance, and though not exactly drunk, would come out of the\npublic-house in an excited mood and speak vain words, giving back rough\nword for rough word.\n\nBut now this had all left him. His life became a peaceful and happy one.\n\nIn the morning he would sit down to his work and keep on for the\nnecessary time, then he would take the lamp off the wall, put it on the\ntable, fetch the Bible from a shelf, open it, and sit down to read. And\nthe more he read, the more he understood, and the serener and lighter\ngrew his heart.\n\nOne day Martin sat reading until late into the night. He was reading\nLuke\xe2\x80\x99s Gospel and had come to the sixth chapter and the verses, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nunto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also the other; and\nhim that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also. Give to\nevery man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask\nthem not again. And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to\nthem likewise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he also read the verses where our Lord says, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why call ye me,\nLord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? Whosoever cometh to me\nand heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is\nlike. He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid\nthe foundation on a rock; and when the flood arose, the stream beat\nvehemently upon that house, and could not shake it; for it was founded\nupon a rock. But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that\nwithout a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the\nstream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of\nthat house was great.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Martin read these words a feeling of joy entered his heart. He took\noff his spectacles, laid them on the Bible, then resting his elbows on\nthe table, he began to ponder over what he had read. He compared his own\nlife to the light of these words. \xe2\x80\x9cIs my house built on a rock or on\nsand?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIf on a rock it is well. It seems so easy when one\nsits alone here, and one thinks one has done all that God commands, but\nno sooner does one cease to be on one\xe2\x80\x99s guard than one falls into sin. I\nmust persevere; it brings such happiness! Help me, oh God!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith this thought in his mind, he was about to go to bed, but was loath\nto leave his Bible, and went on reading the seventh chapter. He read\nabout the centurion, the widow\xe2\x80\x99s son, and the answer to John\xe2\x80\x99s\ndisciples, and he came to the passage where a rich Pharisee invited the\nLord to his house; and about the woman who was a sinner and anointed His\nfeet and washed them with her tears, and how the Lord comforted her. And\nhe came to the forty-fourth verse and began to read the words, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\nturned to the woman and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I\nentered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she\nhath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her\nhead. Thou gavest me no kiss, but this woman since the time I came in,\nhath not ceased to kiss my feet; my head with oil thou didst not anoint,\nbut this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin read these verses and thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHe gave no water for His feet,\nand no kiss, and he did not anoint His head with oil.\xe2\x80\x9d Once more Martin\ntook off his spectacles and laid them on the Bible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been like me, that Pharisee. Like me he thought only of\nhimself--how to get a cup of tea, how to live in warmth and comfort. He\ncared only for himself, with never a thought about his guest. And the\nLord Himself was his guest! I wonder if I would act like that if He came\nto visit me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Martin rested his elbows on the table and his head on his hands and\nfell into a doze.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartin!\xe2\x80\x9d Some one suddenly breathed into his ear.\n\nMartin started. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, half asleep.\n\nHe turned and looked at the door, but no one was there. He called again\nand this time he heard a voice say clearly, \xe2\x80\x9cMartin! Martin! Look out\nfor me in the street to-morrow; I am coming to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin roused himself, got up from the chair and began to rub his eyes.\nHe did not know whether he had heard the words in a dream or when awake.\nHe turned out the lamp and went to bed.\n\nAt daybreak next morning Martin arose, lit the stove, prepared some soup\nand porridge, got the samovar ready, put on his apron and sat down at\nthe window to his work. As he worked he thought of what had happened\nyesterday. Now it seemed to him that he had heard the voice in his\ndreams, now that he had really heard it when awake.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings like that have happened before,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\nMartin sat at the window and did not work so much as peer out into the\nstreet, and when an unfamiliar pair of boots came along, he would stoop\ndown and look up to catch a glimpse of the person to whom they belonged.\nA yard-porter passed in new felt boots and a water-carrier; then an old\nsoldier of Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 reign came alongside the window, spade in hand.\nMartin recognized him by his felt boots. The old man was called Stepan\nand a merchant who lived near by kept him out of charity. His duties\nwere to help the yard-porter. He stopped opposite Martin\xe2\x80\x99s window to\nclear away the snow. Martin looked at him and again went on with his\nwork.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool I am getting in my old age,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin thought, amused at his\nown fancies. \xe2\x80\x9cStepan is shovelling away the snow and I thought it was\nChrist come to visit me. Old dotard that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYet after a dozen stitches or so Martin was again drawn to the window.\nHe looked out and saw that Stepan had leaned his spade against the wall\nand was resting and trying to warm himself. The man was old and broken\nand had no strength even to clear away the snow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not give him a\ncup of tea while the samovar is still on the boil?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin thought. And\nhe put down his awl, rose, brought the samovar to the table, poured out\na cup of tea and tapped on the window. Stepan turned and came up. Martin\nbeckoned to him and went to open the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in and get warm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be quite frozen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrist save us! but my bones do ache,\xe2\x80\x9d Stepan said. Stepan came in,\nshook the snow off himself and began to wipe his boots so as not to\ndirty the floor, reeling as he did so.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother to wipe your feet,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said; \xe2\x80\x9cI will wipe the floor\nafterwards; I am used to that. Come in and sit down. Here is a cup of\ntea.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Martin poured out two cups, gave one to his guest, poured some of\nhis own into a saucer and began to blow on it in order to cool it.\n\nStepan finished his cup, turned it upside down in the saucer, put the\nremaining bit of sugar on top and began to thank Martin, who could see\nthat the old man wanted some more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave another cup,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said and poured out more tea for his guest\nand for himself, and as he drank, he kept peering out of the window.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you expecting some one?\xe2\x80\x9d Stepan asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I hardly like to tell you whom I expect. But I wait and wait. A\ncertain word took possession of my heart. Was it a dream or not, I\ncannot tell. It was like this, brother; I was reading the Gospels last\nnight about Christ our Father and how He suffered on earth. You have\nheard tell of it, I daresay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Stepan said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we are ignorant folk and cannot read.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was reading how the Lord walked on earth, how He went to visit\na Pharisee who did not receive Him well. And I wondered, as I read, how\nany man could receive the Lord without due honour. \xe2\x80\x98Supposing such a\nthing were to happen to me,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought, \xe2\x80\x98what would I not do to receive\nHim? And the Pharisee did nothing!\xe2\x80\x99 Thinking thus I fell asleep, and as\nI slept I heard a voice call to me. I rose; the voice seemed to whisper\n\xe2\x80\x98Expect me; I am coming to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99 I heard it twice. Well, would you\nbelieve it? the idea took hold of my mind, and though I upbraid myself,\nI keep on expecting the Lord to come to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStepan shook his head, but made no remark. He finished his cup of tea\nand laid it down on its side in the saucer, but Martin took it up and\nfilled it again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some more, bless you! I was thinking, too, that our Lord despised\nno one when He walked on earth; He was mostly with common folk. He went\nabout with plain people and chose His disciples from men of our\nkind--simple workmen and sinners like ourselves. \xe2\x80\x98He who raises\nhimself,\xe2\x80\x99 He said, \xe2\x80\x98shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall\nbe raised. You call Me Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and I will wash your feet. He\nwho would be first,\xe2\x80\x99 He said, \xe2\x80\x98let him be the servant of all, because,\xe2\x80\x99\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x98blessed are the poor, the humble, the meek, the merciful.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStepan forgot his tea. He was an old man and easily moved to tears; and\nas he listened the tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some more,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, but Stepan crossed himself, thanked\nMartin, pushed away his cup and rose.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you Martin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have nourished my body and my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are welcome another time. I shall always be pleased to see you;\ncome again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStepan went out; Martin poured himself out a last cup of tea, drank it,\ncleared away the dishes and sat down again by the window to work,\nstitching the back seam of a boot. As he stitched he peered out of the\nwindow to see if Christ was coming, and he kept on thinking of Him and\nHis doings and recalling His words.\n\nTwo soldiers passed; one in Government boots, the other in boots of his\nown; then the owner of the next house went by in clean goloshes, and a\nbaker with a basket. All these passed on; then a woman came up in\nwoollen stockings and coarse country shoes. She went by the window and\nstopped by the wall. Martin looked up and saw that she was a stranger,\npoorly clad, with a baby in her arms. She was standing with her back to\nthe wind, trying to wrap up the baby, but there was nothing to wrap it\nin. Her garments were summer ones and ragged, too. Through the window\nMartin heard the baby crying; the woman tried to comfort it but could\nnot.\n\nMartin rose and going out at the door and up the steps, he called to\nher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome this way, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman turned to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stand in the cold there with the baby; come inside in the warm;\nyou can make him more comfortable here. Come along!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman was surprised to see an old man in an apron and spectacles on\nhis nose inviting her to his room, but she followed him. They descended\nthe stairs and entered the room. Martin led her to the bed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit here, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is nearer to the stove; you\ncan warm yourself and feed the baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t any milk; I have eaten nothing myself since morning,\xe2\x80\x9d the\nwoman said, yet putting the child to the breast.\n\nMartin shook his head. He got some bread and a cup, opened the oven door\nand filled the cup with soup. He then took the porridge-pot out of the\noven, but the porridge was not quite done. He spread a cloth and put the\nsoup and bread on the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down and have something to eat, my dear. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look after the baby.\nI have had children of my own and know how to nurse them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman crossed herself, sat down by the table and began to eat, and\nMartin sat on the bed with the baby. He clucked and clucked, but having\nno teeth he could not do it well, and the baby would not stop its\ncrying. And Martin tried to amuse him with his finger. He poked the\nfinger straight at the baby\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, then drew it back again. He would\nnot let the child take the finger in its mouth because it was black with\ncobbler\xe2\x80\x99s wax. The child looked at the finger, stopped crying and began\nto laugh. Martin was pleased.\n\nAs the woman ate she told him about herself, saying who she was and\nwhere she was going.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is now eight months that my\nhusband has been taken away and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard a word from him. I had a\nplace as a cook when the child was born, but they would not keep me\nafter that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been without a place for three months now and eaten\neverything I possessed. I wanted to go as a wet-nurse, but no one would\nhave me because they said I was too thin. I went to a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s wife\nwith whom our grandmother is in service and she promised to take me. I\nthought she meant at once, but she told me to come next week, and she\nlives a long way. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite worn out, and the baby is half-starved. If\nour landlady did not take pity on us, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how we should live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin sighed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you no warm clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I have warm clothes! I pawned my last shawl yesterday for\nsixpence!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman went up to the bed and took the child. Martin rummaged about\namong the things hanging on the wall and brought out an old coat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough it isn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a thing, it will do to wrap up in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe woman looked at the coat; then at the old man. She took the coat and\nburst into tears. Martin turned away, crawled under the bed and pulled\nout a box. He rummaged about in it and once more sat down facing the\nwoman.\n\nAnd the woman said, \xe2\x80\x9cChrist save you, Grandfather. It must have been He\nwho sent me to your window, otherwise the child and I would have been\nstarved to death. It was mild when I started, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very cold now.\nThe dear Lord made you look out of the window and caused you to pity\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin smiled and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe did make me, indeed! I was not gazing idly\nout of the window, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Martin told the woman his dream and how he had heard a voice and how\nthe voice had promised him that the Lord should come and visit him this\nday.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll things are possible,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said, and she rose, put on the\ncoat, wrapped the child in it and began to take her leave, thanking\nMartin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, thrusting a sixpence into her\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will do to take out your shawl.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman crossed herself, Martin did likewise, then accompanied her to\nthe door.\n\nWhen she had gone Martin ate some soup, cleared the table, and again sat\ndown to work. But he did not forget the window. As soon as a shadow fell\nacross it, he looked up to see who it was. Acquaintances passed and\nstrangers, and nothing particular happened. Suddenly Martin saw an old\napple-woman stop by his window. She was carrying a basket of apples. She\nmust have sold nearly all, for only a few remained. Over her shoulders\nwas a bag of chips and shavings, she had collected no doubt in\nhalf-finished houses, and was taking home. The bag made her shoulder\nache it seemed and she wanted to change it over to the other shoulder.\nShe let it down on the pavement, placed her basket of apples on a post\nand shook the bag. As she was doing so a boy in a ragged cap appeared\nfrom somewhere, snatched an apple out of the basket and was about to\nslip away when the old woman saw him and caught him by the sleeve. The\nboy struggled to get away, but the old woman held him fast with both\nhands. She had knocked off his cap and clutched him by the hair. The boy\nscreamed, the woman cursed. Martin did not wait to put the awl in its\nplace, but dropped it on the floor and rushed out at the door and\nstumbled up the stairs, dropping his spectacles on the way. He ran out\ninto the street. The old woman was pulling the boy by the hair, cursing\nand threatening to take him to the policeman; the boy struggled and\nresisted her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you strike me?\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t take\nanything!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin tried to part them; he took the boy by the hand and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\nhim go, Granny. Forgive him for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive him so that he won\xe2\x80\x99t forget it for a long time! I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\nthe rascal to the police-station!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin began to plead with her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him go, Granny; he won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again. Let him go for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s\nsake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman released the boy, who was about to run away when Martin\nstopped him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Granny to forgive you and don\xe2\x80\x99t do it again in future; I saw you\ntake the apple.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe boy burst into tears and begged the old woman to forgive him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, here\xe2\x80\x99s an apple for you,\xe2\x80\x9d and Martin took an apple from the\nbasket and gave it to the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for it, Granny,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t spoil the rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to give\nhim something he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget in a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Granny, Granny!\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is how we judge, but God does\nnot judge like that. If the boy is to be whipped for an apple what do\nyou suppose we deserve for our sins?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman was silent.\n\nAnd Martin told her the parable of the Lord who forgave his servant a\nlarge debt and how the servant then seized his own debtor by the throat.\nThe old woman listened; the boy, too, stood and listened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bade us forgive,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we may be forgiven. Forgive\nevery one, even a thoughtless boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman shook her head with a sigh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut boys get very spoilt nowadays.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we old folk must teach them better,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I said,\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI had seven of my\nown, but now I\xe2\x80\x99ve only a daughter left.\xe2\x80\x9d And the old woman began to tell\nhim where and how she lived with her daughter and how many grandchildren\nshe had. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m old now, yet still I work, for the\nsake of the grandchildren. And nice children they are, too. No one is so\nkind to me as they. The youngest won\xe2\x80\x99t leave me for any one. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nnothing but Granny dear, Granny darling all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman had quite softened by now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren will be children,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Martin in reference to the boy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord bless them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe was about to raise her bag on to her shoulder when the boy rushed up\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me carry it, Granny; I\xe2\x80\x99m going your way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman shook her head and put the bag on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. And\nthey walked down the street side by side. The old woman had forgotten to\nask Martin to pay for the apple. Martin stood and watched them,\nlistening to their voices as they talked together.\n\nWhen they were out of sight he turned in, found his spectacles on the\nstairs quite whole, took up his awl and sat down to his work once more.\nAfter a while he could not see to pass the thread through the holes and\nhe noticed the lamplighter lighting the street lamps. \xe2\x80\x9cI must light up,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe thought. And he trimmed the lamp, hung it up and went on with his\nwork. He finished the boot he was doing and turned it over to examine\nit. He then put away his tools, cleared up the bits of leather and\nthread and awls, took down the lamp, put it on the table and took the\nBible down from the shelf. He wanted to open it at the place he had\nmarked with a piece of morocco, but it opened at another place. And as\nhe opened the Gospels Martin recalled his dream of last night. And no\nsooner had he thought of it than he seemed to hear some one move behind\nhim, as though some one were coming towards him. He turned, and it\nseemed to him that people were standing in the dark corner, but he could\nnot make out who they were. And a voice whispered into his ear, \xe2\x80\x9cMartin,\nMartin, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said.\n\nAnd Stepan stepped out of the dark corner, smiling, and vanished like a\ncloud, and he was no more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said again, and from out the dark corner stepped\nthe woman with the baby, and she smiled and the child smiled, and they\ntoo vanished.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice once more, and out stepped the old woman and\nboy with an apple in his hand, and both smiled and also vanished.\n\nAnd a feeling of gladness entered Martin\xe2\x80\x99s soul. He crossed himself, put\non his spectacles and began to read the Gospel just where it had opened.\nAt the top of the page were the words, \xe2\x80\x9cFor I was an hungered, and ye\ngave me meat; I was thirsty and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger and\nye took me in....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd at the bottom of the page he read, \xe2\x80\x9cInasmuch as ye have done it unto\none of the least of these brethren, ye have done it unto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Martin understood that his dream had come true and that his Saviour\nhad really come to him that day, and that he had welcomed Him.\n\n\n\n\nA PRISONER\n\n\nAn officer by the name of Jilin served in the army in the Caucasus.\n\nOne day he received a letter from home. It was from his mother, who\nwrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI am getting old now, and I want to see my beloved son before I\ndie. Come and say good-bye to me, and when you have buried me, with\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s grace, you can return to the Army. I have found a nice girl for\nyou to marry; she is clever and pretty, and has some property of her\nown. If you like her perhaps you will marry and settle down for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin pondered over the letter. It was true; his mother was really\nfailing fast, and it might be his only chance of seeing her alive. He\nwould go home, and if the girl was nice, he might even marry.\n\nHe went to his colonel and asked for leave, and bidding good-bye to his\n\n[Illustration: A PRISONER.\n\n_To face page_ 82.]\n\nfellow-officers, gave his men four bucketfuls of vodka as a farewell\ntreat, and got ready to go.\n\nThere was a war in the Caucasus at the time. The roads were not safe by\nday or by night. If a Russian ventured away from his fort, the Tartars\neither killed him or took him off to the hills. So it had been arranged\nthat a body of soldiers should march from fortress to fortress to convoy\nany person who wanted to travel. The soldiers marched in front and\nbehind; the travellers in between them.\n\nIt was summer. At daybreak the baggage-train was loaded behind the fort;\nthe convoy came out and started along the road. Jilin was on horseback;\nhis things were on a cart with the baggage-train.\n\nThey had about twenty miles to go. The baggage-train moved along slowly;\nnow the soldiers would stop, now a wheel came off a cart, now a horse\nwould refuse to go on, and then everybody had to wait.\n\nIt was already past noon and they had not covered half the distance. It\nwas hot, dusty, the sun scorching and no shade at all--bare steppe,\nwith not a tree or a bush the whole way.\n\nJilin rode on ahead and stopped to wait until the baggage-train should\ncatch him up. He heard the signal-horn sounded; the company had stopped\nagain. Jilin thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I go on alone without the soldiers?\nI have a good horse, and if I come across any Tartars I can easily\ngallop away. I wonder if it would be safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs he stood there thinking it over, another officer, by the name of\nKostilin, rode up with a rifle and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go on alone, Jilin. I\xe2\x80\x99m\ndreadfully hungry, and the heat\xe2\x80\x99s unbearable. My shirt is wringing wet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin was a big man and stout; his face was burning red, and the\nperspiration poured from his brow.\n\nJilin deliberated for a moment and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs your rifle loaded?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; come along. Only the condition is to be that we don\xe2\x80\x99t\npart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd they set off down the road alone. They were riding along the steppe\ntalking together and keeping a sharp look-out from side to side. They\ncould see a long way round them. When they left the steppe they came to\na road running down a valley between two hills. And Jilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s\ngo up on that hill and look about; some Tartars might easily spring out\nfrom the hills and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use?\xe2\x80\x9d Kostilin said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d better go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin paid no heed to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wait down here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go up and have a look.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd he turned his horse to the left up the hill. Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s horse was a\nhunter and carried him up the hill as though it had wings. He had bought\nit for a hundred roubles as a colt, and broken it in himself. When he\nreached the top of the hill he saw some thirty Tartars a few paces ahead\nof him. He turned hastily, but the Tartars had seen him and gave chase\ndown the hill, getting their rifles out as they went. Jilin bounded\ndown as fast as the horse\xe2\x80\x99s legs would carry him, crying out to\nKostilin, \xe2\x80\x9cGet your rifle ready!\xe2\x80\x9d And in thought he said to his horse,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet me out of this, my beauty; don\xe2\x80\x99t stumble, or I\xe2\x80\x99m lost. Once I reach\nthe rifle, they shan\xe2\x80\x99t take me alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Kostilin, instead of waiting when he saw the Tartars, set off full\ngallop in the direction of the fortress, lashing his horse now on one\nside, now on the other, and the horse\xe2\x80\x99s switching tail was all that\ncould be seen of him in the clouds of dust.\n\nJilin saw that it was all up with him. The rifle was gone; with a sword\nalone he could do nothing. He turned his horse in the direction of the\nconvoy, hoping to escape, but six Tartars rushed ahead to cut him off.\nHis horse was a good one, but theirs were better, and they were trying\nto cross his path. He wanted to turn in another direction, but his horse\ncould not pull up and dashed on straight towards the Tartars. A\nred-bearded Tartar on a grey horse caught Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He was yelling\nand showing his teeth and pointing his rifle at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what devils you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you take me alive,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll put me in a pit and have me flogged. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be taken alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Jilin was a little man, he was brave. He drew his sword and\ndashed at the red-bearded Tartar, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll either ride him down\nor kill him with my sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut he had no time to reach the Tartar; he was fired at from behind and\nhis horse was hit. It fell to the ground full weight, pinning Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s\nleg. He attempted to rise, but two evil-smelling Tartars were already\nsitting on him, twisting his arms behind him. He struggled, flung the\nTartars off, but three others leapt from their horses and fell on him,\nbeating him on the head with the butt ends of their rifles. A mist rose\nbefore his eyes and he staggered. The Tartars seized him, and taking\nspare girths from their saddles twisted his hands behind him and tied\nthem with a Tartar knot and dragged him to the saddle. They knocked off\nhis cap, pulled off his boots, searched him all over, took his money and\nwatch and tore his clothes. Jilin looked round at his horse. The poor\ncreature lay on its side just as it had fallen, struggling with its legs\nin the air and unable to get them to the ground. There was a hole in its\nhead from which the dark blood was oozing, laying the dust for a yard\naround.\n\nOne of the Tartars approached it and took off the saddle. As it was\nstill struggling, he drew a dagger and cut its windpipe. A whistling\nsound came from its throat; the horse gave a shudder and died.\n\nThe Tartars took off the saddle and strappings. The red-bearded Tartar\nmounted his horse, the others lifted Jilin into the saddle behind him,\nand, to prevent his falling off, they strapped him to the Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s\ngirdle, and took him off to the hills.\n\nJilin sat behind the Tartar, rocking from side to side, his face\ntouching the evil-smelling Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s back. All he could see was the\nman\xe2\x80\x99s broad back and sinewy neck, the closely-shaven bluish nape peeping\nout from beneath his cap. Jilin had a wound in his head, from which the\nblood poured and congealed over his eyes, but he could not shift his\nposition on the saddle, nor wipe off the blood. His arms were twisted so\nfar behind his back that his collar-bones ached. They rode over the\nhills for some time, then they came to a river which they forded and got\nout on to a road running down a valley. Jilin wanted to see where they\nwere going, but his eyes were matted with blood and he could not move.\n\nIt began to get dark; they forded another river and rode up a rocky\nhill; there was a smell of smoke and a barking of dogs. They had reached\na Tartar village. The Tartars got off their horses; the Tartar children\ngathered round Jilin, yelling and throwing stones at him. A Tartar drove\nthem away, took Jilin off the horse and called his servant. A man with\nhigh cheek-bones came up, clad in nothing but a shirt, and that so torn\nthat his breast was bare. The Tartar gave him some order. The man\nbrought some shackles, two blocks of oak with iron rings attached, and a\nclasp and lock was fixed to one of the rings.\n\nThey untied Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s arms, put on the shackles, took him to a shed,\npushed him in and locked the door. Jilin fell on to a dung heap. He\ngroped about in the darkness to find a softer place and lay down.\n\n\nII\n\nJilin did not sleep the whole of that night. The nights were short.\nThrough a chink he saw that it was getting light. He got up, made the\nchink a little bigger and peeped out.\n\nHe saw a road at the foot of a hill, to the right of which was a Tartar\nhut with two trees near it. A black dog lay on the threshold and a goat\nand kids were moving about and swishing their tails. Then he saw a young\nTartar woman coming from the direction of the hill. She wore a coloured\nblouse and trousers with a girdle round her waist, high boots on her\nfeet and a kerchief on her head, on which she was carrying a tin pitcher\nof water. Her back moved gracefully as she walked; she was leading a\nclosely-shaven Tartar boy, who wore nothing but a shirt. The Tartar\nwoman went into the hut with the water; the red-bearded Tartar of\nyesterday came out in a silken tunic, a silver-hilted knife stuck in his\ngirdle and slippers on bare feet. A high, black sheepskin cap was pushed\nfar back on his head. He stretched himself as he came out and stroked\nhis red beard. He gave some order to his servant and went away.\n\nThen two boys rode past. They had been to water their horses and the\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 noses were still wet. Some more closely-shaven boys came out,\ndressed only in shirts with no trousers. A whole group of them came up\nto the shed, and taking up a piece of stick, they thrust it through the\nchink. Jilin grunted at them and the boys ran off, yelling, their little\nwhite knees gleaming as they went.\n\nJilin was thirsty; his throat was parched. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only some one would\ncome,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. Soon the door of the shed opened and the red-bearded\nTartar entered with another, shorter than he, and dark. He had bright\nblack eyes, a ruddy complexion and a short beard. He had a jolly face,\nand was always laughing. This man was dressed better than the first, in\na blue silken tunic, trimmed with braid. The knife in his broad girdle\nwas of silver, the shoes on his feet were of red morocco, embroidered in\nsilver thread, and over these he wore a thicker pair of shoes. His cap\nwas high and of white sheepskin.\n\nThe red-bearded Tartar entered, muttering some angry words. He leant\nagainst the doorpost, playing with his dagger and looking askance at\nJilin, like a wolf. The dark man, quick and lively and moving as if on\nsprings, came up to Jilin and squatted down in front of him, showing his\nteeth. He clapped Jilin on the shoulder and began to jabber something in\nhis own language, blinking his eyes and clacking his tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cGood\nRuss! Good Russ!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nJilin understood nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cI am thirsty; give me some water,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe dark man laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Russ!\xe2\x80\x9d he kept on saying.\n\nJilin made signs with his lips and hands that he wanted some water. The\ndark man laughed, and putting his head out at the door, he called to\nsome one \xe2\x80\x9cDina!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA little girl came up. She was about thirteen, slight and thin, her face\nresembling the dark man\xe2\x80\x99s. She was obviously his daughter. She, too, had\nbright, black eyes and a rosy complexion. She was clad in a long blue\nblouse with broad sleeves, and loose at the waist--the hem and front and\nsleeves were embroidered in red. She wore trousers and slippers and\nshoes with high heels over them; she had a necklace round her throat\nmade out of Russian coins. Her head was bare. Her black plait was tied\nwith a ribbon, the ends of which were trimmed with silver roubles.\n\nHer father said something to her. She ran away and came back again with\na tin jug of water. She gave it to Jilin and also squatted down in front\nof him, huddled up, so that her shoulders came lower than her knees. She\nsat staring at Jilin as he drank, as at some strange animal.\n\nJilin handed her back the jug. She took it and bounded out like a wild\ngoat. Even her father could not help laughing. He sent her off somewhere\nelse. She ran away with the jug and brought back some unleavened bread\non a round wooden platter, and huddling down in front of him once more,\nshe again stared at him open-eyed.\n\nThe Tartars went out and locked the door.\n\nAfter a while the red-bearded man\xe2\x80\x99s servant came up and called to Jilin.\nHe too, did not know Russian, only Jilin understood that he wanted him\nto go somewhere.\n\nJilin followed him limping, for the shackles impeded his walking. He\nfollowed the servant. They came to a Tartar village, consisting of\nabout ten houses, a Tartar church with a dome on top in the midst of\nthem. In front of one house stood three saddled horses; some boys were\nholding them by their bridles. The dark little Tartar rushed out of this\nhouse and beckoned to Jilin to come to him. He laughed, jabbered\nsomething in his own tongue and went in again. Jilin came to the house.\nThe room was large, the mud walls smoothly plastered. Near the front\nwall lay a pile of brightly coloured feather beds, on the side walls\nhung rich rugs with rifles and pistols and swords fastened to them, all\ninlaid in silver. At one wall was a small stove on a level with the\nearthen floor, which was beautifully clean. In the near corner a felt\ncarpet was spread on which were rich rugs and down cushions. On these\nrugs, in slippers only, sat some Tartars--the dark one, the red-bearded\none and three guests. All had down cushions at their backs. In front of\nthem, on a wooden platter, were some millet pancakes, some melted butter\nin a cup and a jug of Tartar beer. They took the pancakes up with their\nfingers, and their hands were all greasy with the butter.\n\nThe dark Tartar jumped up and bade Jilin sit down, not on the rugs, but\non the bare floor. Then he sat down on his rug again, and treated his\nguests to more pancakes and beer. The servant made Jilin sit down in the\nplace assigned to him, took off his overshoes, which he placed by the\ndoor where the other shoes were standing, and sat down on the felt\ncarpet, nearer to his master. He watched the others eating, his mouth\nwatering. When the Tartars had finished, a woman came in dressed like\nthe girl in trousers and a kerchief on her head. She cleared away the\nremains, and brought a basin and a narrow-necked jug of water. The\nTartars washed their hands, laid them together, fell on their knees and\nsaid their prayers in their own tongue. When they had finished one of\nthe guests turned to Jilin and addressed him in Russian.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were captured by Kasi-Mohammed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, indicating the\nred-bearded Tartar, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he has given you to Abdul-Murat.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\nindicated the dark Tartar. \xe2\x80\x9cAbdul-Murat is now your master.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin was silent.\n\nAbdul-Murat now began to speak, pointing at Jilin and laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nsoldier Russ, a good Russ,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nAnd the interpreter said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants you to write home asking your people\nto send a ransom for you. When the money comes, he will let you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin reflected and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow much does he want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tartars deliberated among themselves; the interpreter said, \xe2\x80\x9cThree\nthousand roubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t pay as much as that,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said.\n\nAbdul leapt up and began to gesticulate violently. He was saying\nsomething to Jilin, thinking that he would understand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much will you give?\xe2\x80\x9d the interpreter asked.\n\nAfter reflection Jilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cFive hundred roubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt this the Tartars all began talking together. Abdul shouted at the\nred-bearded Tartar, jabbering away till he foamed at the mouth. The\nred-bearded Tartar merely frowned and clacked his tongue.\n\nThey grew silent and the interpreter said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe master thinks a ransom\nof five hundred roubles is not enough. He himself paid two hundred\nroubles for you. Kasi-Mohammed was in his debt, and he took you in\npayment. He wants three thousand roubles and refuses to let you go for\nless. If you won\xe2\x80\x99t pay the money you\xe2\x80\x99ll be flung into a pit and\nflogged.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more you show you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of them, the worse it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin\nthought. He leapt to his feet and said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell the dog that if he begins\nto threaten me, he shan\xe2\x80\x99t have a farthing! I won\xe2\x80\x99t write home at all! I\nwas never afraid of you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be now, you dogs!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe interpreter conveyed his words, and again the Tartars began to speak\nall at once.\n\nThey jabbered for a long time, then the dark one sprang up and came to\nJilin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9c_djigit, djigit_ Russ!\xe2\x80\x9d (Djigit in their tongue means\nbrave.) He laughed and said a few words to the interpreter, who turned\nto Jilin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give a thousand roubles?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin stuck to his own.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t give more than five hundred, not if you kill me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tartars conferred together, and sent the servant off somewhere, and\nwhen he was gone they stared now at Jilin, now at the door.\n\nThe servant returned, followed by a stout, bare-footed man, in torn\nclothes. On his feet were also shackles. Jilin gave an exclamation of\nsurprise. It was Kostilin. He, too, had been captured then. The Tartars\nsat them down side by side, and they began to tell each other of their\nexperiences, the Tartars looking on in silence. Jilin told Kostilin what\nhad happened to him, and Kostilin told Jilin that his horse had got\ntired, his rifle missed fire, and that this same Abdul had caught him up\nand captured him.\n\nAbdul jumped up and began to speak, pointing at Kostilin. The\ninterpreter explained that they both belonged to the same master, and\nthat the one who would produce the money first would be the first to be\nset free.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how quiet your comrade is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Jilin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get angry and he\nhas written home asking to have five thousand roubles sent him. He will\nbe well fed, and no one will do him any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Jilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy comrade can do what he likes. He may be rich, and I\nam not. I won\xe2\x80\x99t go back on my word. You can kill me if you like, but you\nget no advantage by that; I won\xe2\x80\x99t write for more than five hundred\nroubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tartars were silent. Suddenly Abdul sprang up, took out a pen, ink\nand a scrap of paper from a little box, put them in Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s hands and\nslapping him on the shoulder, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWrite.\xe2\x80\x9d He had agreed to the five\nhundred roubles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said to the interpreter; \xe2\x80\x9ctell him that he must feed\nand clothe us well, and that he must put us together so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t\nfeel so lonely, and he must remove our shackles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked at Abdul as he spoke and smiled. Abdul too smiled and said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have the best of clothes--coats and boots fit to be married\nin, and you shall be fed like princes, and you can be together in the\nshed if you like, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t take off the shackles because you might\nescape. You shall have them removed at night.\xe2\x80\x9d He rushed up to Jilin and\nslapped him on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cFine fellow! fine fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nJilin wrote the letter, but did not address it correctly, so that it\nshould not reach home. \xe2\x80\x9cI will escape, somehow,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\nJilin and Kostilin were taken back to the shed. They were given some\nstraw, a jug of water and bread, two old coats and some worn boots,\nevidently taken from the bodies of dead soldiers. At night their\nshackles were removed and they were locked in the shed.\n\n\nIII\n\nThus Jilin and his comrade lived for a month. Their master was always\ncheerful. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, good fellow, Ivan! I, Abdul, good fellow, too!\xe2\x80\x9d But he\nfed them badly. All the food they got was some unleavened bread of\nmillet flour, or millet cakes, and sometimes nothing but raw dough.\n\nKostilin sent another letter home and did nothing but mope and wait for\nthe money to arrive. He would sit in the barn day after day, either\ncounting the days for the letter to come or sleeping. Jilin knew that\nhis letter would not reach home, but he never wrote another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere on earth could mother get so much money from?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\nlived mostly on what I used to send her, and if she has to procure five\nhundred roubles she\xe2\x80\x99ll be quite ruined. With God\xe2\x80\x99s help I\xe2\x80\x99ll get away\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo he kept his eyes open, planning how to run away.\n\nHe would walk about the village whistling, or doing something with his\nhands, such as modelling dolls out of clay, or plaiting baskets out of\ntwigs. Jilin was very clever with his hands.\n\nOne day he modelled a doll with a nose, arms and legs and in a Tartar\nshirt, and he put this doll on the roof of the shed. The Tartar girls\nwent to fetch water. The master\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Dina caught sight of the\ndoll, and called to the others. They put down their pitchers and looked\nup laughing. Jilin took down the doll and held it out to them. They\nlaughed, but dared not take it. He left the doll and went into the shed\nto see what would happen.\n\nDina ran up, looked about her, snatched up the doll and ran off with it.\n\nThe following morning, at daybreak, Dina came out on the threshold with\nthe doll. She had bedecked it in bits of red stuff, and was rocking it\nto and fro like a baby and singing a lullaby. An old woman came out and\nbegan to scold her. She snatched the doll away from the child and broke\nit, and sent Dina off to her work.\n\nJilin made another doll--a better one this time--and gave it to Dina.\n\nOne day Dina brought Jilin a jug, and sitting down, she looked up at\nhim, laughing and pointing to the jug.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is she so pleased about?\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought. He took up the jug to\nhave a drink, thinking it was full of water, but it turned out to be\nmilk. \xe2\x80\x9cHow nice!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and finished it. Dina was overjoyed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice, nice, Ivan!\xe2\x80\x9d She jumped up and clapped her hands in glee, then\nshe seized the jug and ran away.\n\nAfter that she brought Jilin milk in secret every day. When the Tartar\nwomen used to make cheese cakes out of goat\xe2\x80\x99s milk, which they baked on\nthe roof, she would steal some and bring them to him. Once the master\nkilled a sheep, and Dina brought Jilin a piece of the flesh hidden in\nher sleeve. She would throw the things down and run away.\n\nOne day there was a terrible storm; the rain poured down in torrents for\na whole hour. The rivers became turbid. At the ford, the water rose till\nit was seven feet high and the current was so strong that it moved the\nstones along. Rivulets flowed everywhere and there was a roar in the\nhills. After the storm streams flowed down the village everywhere.\nJilin asked his master for a knife, and with it he shaped a small\ncylinder and made a wheel out of a piece of board, to which he fixed two\ndolls, one on each side. The little girls brought him some bits of stuff\nwith which he dressed the dolls--one as a peasant, the other as a\npeasant woman. He made them fast and set the wheel so that the stream\nshould work it. When the wheel began to whirl the dolls danced.\n\nThe whole village gathered round--boys and girls and women and men came\nto look on, the latter clacking their tongues.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Russ! Ah, Ivan!\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\nAbdul had a Russian watch which was broken. He called Jilin and showed\nit to him. Jilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me and I\xe2\x80\x99ll mend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took it to pieces with the knife, sorted the pieces out, put them\ntogether again and the watch went quite well.\n\nThe master was pleased and presented him with one of his old tunics, all\nin holes. Jilin had to take it, besides, it would come in useful to\ncover up with at night.\n\nFrom that day Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s fame as a man skilled in handiworks spread fast.\nPeople began to flock to him from distant villages, one bringing the\nlock of a rifle or a pistol that wanted mending; another a watch or a\nclock. The master gave him some tools--pincers, gimlets and a file.\n\nOne day a Tartar fell ill, and they came to Jilin, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome and\nheal him.\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin did not know how to heal the sick, but he went just the\nsame thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cThe man will recover of his own accord.\xe2\x80\x9d He disappeared\ninto the shed and mixed up some sand and water. In the presence of the\nTartars he mumbled some words over the mixture, and gave it to the sick\nman to drink. Fortunately the Tartar got well.\n\nJilin began to understand a little of their tongue. Some of the Tartars\ngot quite used to him, and when they wanted him would call \xe2\x80\x9cIvan, Ivan!\xe2\x80\x9d\nOthers again looked at him askance as at some wild beast.\n\nThe red-bearded Tartar did not like Jilin. He frowned when he saw him,\nand either turned away or cursed. There was another old man, who did\nnot live in the village, but somewhere at the foot of a hill. He came to\nthe village only sometimes. Jilin saw him when the man went to the\nMosque to say his prayers. He was short and had a white towel wound\nround his cap. His beard and moustaches were clipped and white as down;\nhis face was wrinkled and brick-red. He had a hooked nose like a hawk\xe2\x80\x99s,\nand cruel grey eyes. He had no teeth, but two tusks in front. He would\npass with his turban on his head, leaning on his staff, and peering\nround like a wolf. When he saw Jilin he snorted and turned away.\n\nOne day Jilin went to the hills to find out where the old man lived. He\nstrolled down a path and saw a little garden and a stone wall; within\nthe stone wall were wild cherry trees and peaches and a hut with a flat\nroof. He came a little closer and saw some hives made of plaited straw\nand humming bees flying hither and thither. The old man was on his\nknees, doing something to the hives. Jilin stood on tiptoe in order to\nget a better view; his shackles rattled. The old man turned and gave a\nyell and pulling a pistol out of his belt he aimed at Jilin, who just\nmanaged to shield himself behind the stone wall.\n\nThe old man came to the master to complain. The master summoned Jilin\nand laughing, asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you go to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s place?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to do him any harm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI only wanted to see how\nhe lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe master conveyed his words to the old man.\n\nBut the old man was angry. He jabbered away, showing his tusks, and\nshook his fists menacingly at Jilin.\n\nJilin could not understand all he said, but he gathered that the old man\nwas warning the master not to keep any Russians about the place, but to\nhave them all killed.\n\nThe old man went away.\n\nJilin asked the master who the old man was, and the master said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\na great man! He was the bravest of us all, and killed many Russians,\nand he was rich, too. He had three wives and eight sons, who all lived\nin the same village. The Russians came, destroyed the village, and\nkilled seven of his sons. One son only remained, and he surrendered to\nthe Russians. The old man followed them, and also gave himself up. He\nlived with the Russians for three months, when he found his son. With\nhis own hand he killed him and escaped. After that he gave up fighting.\nHe went to Mecca to pray to God; that is why he wears a turban. Any man\nwho has been to Mecca is called a _Hadji_ and has to wear a turban. He\ndoes not like you Russians. He wanted me to kill you, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t kill\nyou because I paid money for you. Besides, I have taken a fancy to you,\nIvan; I would not let you go at all, if I had not given my word.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nlaughed and added in Russian, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a good fellow, Ivan, and I,\nAbdul, am a good fellow too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIV\n\nJilin lived in this way for a month. During the day he wandered about\nthe village or busied himself with some handicraft, and at night he dug\nin his shed. The digging was difficult because of the stones, but he\nworked away at them with his file and at last made a hole beneath the\nwall big enough to crawl through. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only I knew the neighbourhood well\nand which way to turn,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Tartars would not tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe chose a day when the master was away, left the village after dinner\nand went up a hill, hoping to find out the lie of the land from there.\nBut before the master departed he told one of his boys to look after\nJilin and not let him out of his sight. The boy ran after Jilin, crying,\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go away! My father told you not to! I\xe2\x80\x99ll call for help!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin tried to soothe him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going far,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI only want to go to the top of that hill\nto find a certain herb with which to cure your people when they are\nsick. Come with me; I can\xe2\x80\x99t run away with the shackles on my feet. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nmake you a bow and some arrows to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter some persuasion the boy went with him. The hill did not seem very\nfar off, but it was difficult to get there shackled as he was. He\nstruggled and struggled until he got to the top. Jilin sat down and\nbegan to look about him. To the south, beyond the shed, a herd of horses\ncould be seen in a valley, and at the bottom of the valley was another\nvillage. Beyond the village was a steep hill and another hill beyond\nthat. Between the two hills was a dark patch that looked like a wood;\nhill upon hill rose beyond it, and higher than all rose the snow-capped\nmountains as white as sugar, the peak of one standing out above the\nrest. To the east and west were other such hills; here and there were\nvillages in the valleys from which the smoke curled up. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is all\nTartar country,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He looked in the direction of Russia--below\nwas a river, and the village he lived in, surrounded by gardens. On the\nriver bank, looking as tiny as dolls, sat Tartar women, washing clothes.\nBeyond the village was a hill, lower than the one to the south and\nbeyond that two wooded hills. Between these two hills was a plain and\naway in the distance on this plain smoke seemed to rise. Jilin tried to\nrecollect where the sun rose and set when he lived in the fort. He came\nto the conclusion that the fortress must lie in that very valley.\nBetween these two hills would he have to make his way when he escaped.\n\nThe sun began to set. The snow-clad mountains turned from white to red;\nthe dark mountains grew darker still; a vapour rose from the valley, and\nthe plain where he supposed the fortress to be seemed on fire with the\nsunset\xe2\x80\x99s glow. Jilin gazed intently; something seemed to quiver in that\nplain, like smoke rising from a chimney, and Jilin felt sure that the\nRussian fortress was there.\n\nIt was getting late. The Mullah\xe2\x80\x99s cry was heard. The flocks and herds\nwere driven home; the cows were lowing. The boy kept on begging \xe2\x80\x9cCome\nhome,\xe2\x80\x9d but Jilin had no desire to move.\n\nThey returned home. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that I know the place I must lose no time in\nrunning away,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought. He wanted to escape that very night, for\nthe nights were dark then; the moon had waned, but as luck would have\nit, the Tartars returned that evening. Sometimes when they brought\ncattle home they would come back in a jolly mood, but this time there\nwere no cattle, and on the saddle of his horse they brought back the\nred-bearded Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s brother who had been killed. They returned in a\ngloomy mood and gathered the village together for the burial. Jilin,\ntoo, came out to look on. They wrapped the body in a sheet and without a\ncoffin carried it out and laid it on the grass beneath some plane-trees.\nThe Mullah arrived and the old men; they wrapped towels around their\ncaps, took off their shoes, and squatted down on their heels before the\nbody. In front was the Mullah, behind him three old men in turbans, and\nbehind them three other Tartars. They sat silent, eyes downcast, for a\nlong time, then the Mullah raised his head and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAllah!\xe2\x80\x9d (meaning\nGod). After this word he again bowed his head, and there was another\nlong silence. They all sat motionless. Again the Mullah raised his head\nand said \xe2\x80\x9cAllah!\xe2\x80\x9d All repeated \xe2\x80\x9cAllah!\xe2\x80\x9d and again there was silence. The\ndead man lay on the grass motionless and the others, too, seemed dead.\nNot a single man moved. The only sound to be heard was the rustling of\nthe leaves on the plane-trees. After a while the Mullah said a prayer;\nall rose, and raising the dead man with their hands they carried him\naway. They brought him to a pit. It was not an ordinary pit, but\nhollowed out under the ground like a vault. They lifted the dead man\nunder the arms, bent him into a sitting posture and let him down into\nthe pit, gently, his hands folded in front of him.\n\nThe master\xe2\x80\x99s servant brought some green rushes which they stuffed into\nthe pit, then they hastily covered it with earth, levelled the ground\nproperly and placed a stone, upright, at the head of the grave. They\nstamped down the soil and once more sat down round the grave side by\nside. For a long time they were silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah! Allah!\xe2\x80\x9d they sighed and rose.\n\nThe red-bearded Tartar gave some money to the old men, then he took a\nwhip, struck himself three times on the forehead and went home.\n\nIn the morning Jilin saw the red-bearded Tartar leading a mare out of\nthe village, followed by three other Tartars. When they left the village\nbehind them the red-bearded Tartar took off his coat, rolled up his\nsleeves--his arms were strong and muscular--and taking out a dagger, he\nsharpened it on a whetstone. The other Tartars raised the mare\xe2\x80\x99s head\nand he cut her throat. The mare dropped down and he began to skin her\nwith his big hands. Women and girls came up and washed the entrails. The\nmare was cut up and the pieces carried to the red Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s hut, where\nthe whole village gathered for a funeral feast.\n\nFor three days they ate the mare\xe2\x80\x99s flesh and drank beer in honour of the\ndead man. All the Tartars were at home. On the fourth day, about dinner\ntime, Jilin saw that they were preparing to go away somewhere. The\nhorses were brought out, they got ready, and about ten of the Tartars,\nthe red one among them, went away, Abdul remaining at home. There was a\nnew moon and the nights were still dark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night we must escape,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought, and he unfolded his plan to\nKostilin. But Kostilin was afraid.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can we run away? We don\xe2\x80\x99t know the way even.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get there in one night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we can\xe2\x80\x99t, we can hide in the wood. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some cakes here for us\nto eat. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of sitting here? If they send your ransom, well\nand good, but supposing they can\xe2\x80\x99t raise the money? The Tartars are\ngetting vicious because our people have killed one of their men. They\nwill probably kill us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin reflected.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; let us go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\nV\n\nJilin went down the hole and made it a little bigger so that Kostilin\ncould crawl through, then they sat down to wait till all grew quiet in\nthe village.\n\nWhen the Tartars had all retired to rest Jilin crawled under the wall\nand got outside. \xe2\x80\x9cFollow me,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to Kostilin.\n\nKostilin crept into the hole, but his foot hit against a stone and made\na clatter. The master had a speckled watch-dog--a vicious creature it\nwas, called Ulashin. The dog growled and rushed forward, followed by\nother dogs. Jilin gave a low whistle and threw it a cake. Ulashin\nrecognized him, wagged his tail and ceased his growling.\n\nThe master heard the dog and called from the hut, \xe2\x80\x9c_Hait, hait_,\nUlashin!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Jilin stroked the dog by the ears and it did not move. It rubbed\nitself against Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s legs and wagged its tail.\n\nThey sat crouching round the corner. All grew quiet; only a sheep was\nheard to cough in a barn, and below, the water rippled over the stones.\nIt was dark; the stars were high in the sky and the new moon looked red\nas it set behind the hill, horns upwards. A mist as white as milk lay\nover the valley.\n\nJilin got up and turning to Kostilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us come, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey set off, but they had no sooner done so than the Mullah intoned\nfrom the roof \xe2\x80\x9cAllah Besmilla! Ilrachman!\xe2\x80\x9d That meant that the people\nwould be going to the Mosque. They sat down again, crouching behind the\nwall. For a long time they sat there waiting till the people went past.\nAll grew quiet again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then; with God\xe2\x80\x99s help we must get away,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said.\n\nThey crossed themselves and started. They went through the yard and\ndownhill to the river which they forded and came out into the valley.\nThe mist hung low and dense; above, the stars were visible. By the stars\nJilin could tell the direction they had to take. It was cool in the mist\nand walking was easy, only their boots were uncomfortable, being old and\nworn out. Jilin cast his off and went bare-foot. He leapt over the\nstones, gazing up at the stars. Kostilin began to lag behind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlower, please,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthese cursed boots hurt my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake them off and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it easier.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin too went barefoot, but that was still worse. The stones cut his\nfeet and he lagged behind more than ever.\n\nJilin said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cThe cuts on your feet will heal up soon enough, but\nif the Tartars catch us it will be much more serious; they will kill\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin did not say anything, but walked along, groaning.\n\nThey walked along the valley for a long time, when suddenly they heard\nthe barking of dogs. Jilin stopped and looked about him. He climbed up\nthe hill on all fours.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe mistook our way, and turned to the right. Another Tartar village\nlies here; I saw it from the hill the other day. We must turn back and\ngo to the left up the hill. There must be a wood here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Kostilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us rest a while; my feet are all bleeding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll get better in good time, brother. Walk more lightly--like\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Jilin turned back and went up the hill to the left into the wood.\nKostilin kept on lagging behind and groaning. Jilin remonstrated with\nhim and walked on ahead.\n\nThey reached the top of the hill, where they found a wood, as Jilin had\nsurmised. They went into it. The brambles tore the last of their\nclothes. At last they found a path and followed it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said. There was a trampling of hoofs on the path. They\nlistened. It sounded like the trampling of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs, but the sound\nceased. They moved on and again they heard the trampling. They stopped\nagain, and the sound ceased. Jilin crept nearer and in a patch of light\non the path he saw something standing. It seemed like a horse, yet not\nlike a horse, and it had something queer on its back that was not a man.\nThe creature snorted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange thing!\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought, and gave a\nlow whistle. The animal bounded off the path into the thicket and there\nwas a sound of cracking branches as though a storm had swept through the\nwood.\n\nKostilin fell to the ground in terror; Jilin laughed, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\nstag. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you hear how it\xe2\x80\x99s breaking the branches with its antlers? We\nare afraid of him and he is afraid of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went on further. The Great Bear was already setting and the dawn\nwas not far off. They did not know whether they were going in the right\ndirection. It seemed to Jilin that the Tartars had brought him along\nthis path when they captured him and that it was still another seven\nmiles to the fortress, but he had nothing certain to go by, and at night\none could easily mistake the way.\n\nKostilin dropped to the ground and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo what you like, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\ngo any further. My legs won\xe2\x80\x99t carry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin attempted persuasion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good,\xe2\x80\x9d Kostilin said; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin grew angry and vented his disgust.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99m going alone--good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin jumped up and followed.\n\nThey walked another three miles. The mist grew denser; they could not\nsee ahead of them and the stars were no longer visible.\n\nThey suddenly heard a trampling of horses coming from the direction in\nwhich they were going. They could hear the horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs hit against the\nstones. Jilin lay flat down and put his ear to the ground to listen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is certainly a horseman coming towards us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. They ran off\nthe path into the thicket and sat down to wait. After a while Jilin\ncrept out into the path to look. A mounted Tartar was coming along,\ndriving a cow and humming softly to himself. When he had passed Jilin\nturned to Kostilin, \xe2\x80\x9cThank God the danger is over. Come, let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin attempted to rise, but dropped down again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t! I\xe2\x80\x99ve no more strength left.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe man was heavy and stout and had perspired freely. The heavy mist had\nchilled him, tired and bleeding as he was, and made him quite stiff.\nJilin tried to lift him, but Kostilin cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it hurts!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin turned to stone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you shout? The Tartar is still near; he will have heard you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe remonstrated, while to himself he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cThe man is evidently\nexhausted; what shall I do with him? I can\xe2\x80\x99t desert him.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cclimb on to my back, then, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry you if you really can\xe2\x80\x99t\nwalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe helped Kostilin up, put his arms under his thighs and carried him on\nto the path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t put your arms round my neck or you\xe2\x80\x99ll throttle\nme. Hold on to my shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was hard work for Jilin; his feet, too, were bleeding and tired. He\nbent down now and then to get him in a more comfortable position, or\njerked him up so that he sat higher up, and went on his weary way.\n\nThe Tartar had evidently heard Kostilin\xe2\x80\x99s cry. Jilin heard some one\nfollowing behind, calling out in the Tartar tongue. Jilin rushed into\nthe thicket. The Tartar seized his gun and aimed; the shot missed; the\nTartar yelled and galloped down the path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we\xe2\x80\x99re lost,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll collect the Tartars to hunt\nus down. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t cover a couple of miles before they\xe2\x80\x99ve time to set\nout, nothing will save us.\xe2\x80\x9d To himself he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the devil did I\nsaddle myself with this block? I should have got there long ago had I\nbeen alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you be caught because of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go alone; it would be mean to desert a comrade.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain he raised Kostilin on to his shoulders and went on. They walked\nalong for another half-mile. They were still in the wood and could not\nsee the end of it. The mist had dispersed; the clouds seemed to gather;\nthe stars were no longer visible. Jilin was worn out. They came to a\nspring walled in by stones. He stopped and put Kostilin down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us rest a minute or two and have a drink and a bite of this cake.\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t be very far off now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had no sooner lain down to take a drink from the spring than he heard\nthe stamping of horses behind him. Again they rushed into the thicket to\nthe right and lay down on a slope.\n\nThey heard a sound of Tartar voices. The Tartars stopped at the very\nspot where they had turned off the path. They seemed to confer for a bit\nand then set a dog on the scent. There was a crackling among the bushes\nand a strange dog appeared. It stopped and began to bark. The Tartars\nfollowed it. They were also strangers. They bound Jilin and Kostilin and\ntook them off on their horses.\n\nWhen they had ridden for about two miles they were met by the master,\nAbdul, and two other Tartars. He exchanged some words with the strange\nTartars, after which Jilin and Kostilin were removed to his horses and\nhe took them back to the village.\n\nAbdul was no longer laughing, and did not say a word to them.\n\nThey reached the village at daybreak and were placed in the street. The\nchildren gathered round them and threw stones at them and lashed them\nwith whips, yelling all the time.\n\nAll the Tartars collected in a circle, the old man from the hills among\nthem. They began to talk; Jilin gathered that they were considering what\nwas to be done with him and Kostilin. Some said that they should be sent\ninto the hills, and the old man persisted that they should be killed.\nAbdul would not agree to either plan, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI paid money for them and\nmust get their ransom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man said, \xe2\x80\x9cThey will not pay the ransom; they\xe2\x80\x99ll only do a great\ndeal of harm. It is a sin to keep Russians. Kill them and have done with\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tartars dispersed. The master came to Jilin and said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nyour ransom does not come in two weeks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you flogged, and if\nyou attempt to run away again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you like a dog. Write home, and\nwrite to the point!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey brought them pen and paper and they wrote home. The shackles were\nput on them and they were taken behind the Mosque, where there was a\npit of about twelve feet deep, into which they were flung.\n\n\nVI\n\nLife was very hard for them now. Their shackles were never removed, and\nthey were never allowed out into the fresh air. Raw dough was thrown\ndown to them, as one throws a scrap to a dog, and water was let down in\na jug. The stench in the pit was awful and it was damp as well. Kostilin\ngrew quite ill; he swelled very much and every bone in his body ached.\nHe either groaned or slept all the time. Jilin, too, was depressed; he\nsaw that their position was hopeless and did not know how to get out of\nit.\n\nHe tried to make a tunnel but there was nowhere to throw the earth, and\nwhen the master saw it, he threatened to kill him.\n\nOne day when he was most downcast, squatting in the pit and thinking of\nhis freedom, a cake fell from above, then another, and some cherries\nrained down. Jilin looked up and saw Dina. She looked at him, laughed\nand ran away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if Dina would help us?\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought.\n\nHe cleared a space in the pit, dug a little clay and began to make some\ndolls. He moulded some men and horses and dogs, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Dina\ncomes, I will throw these up to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Dina did not come the next day. Jilin heard a stamping of horses;\nsome Tartars seemed to have come and all gathered at the Mosque,\nshouting and arguing. It was something about the Russians. The voice of\nthe old man was heard, too. Jilin could not understand all they said,\nbut he made out that the Russians were near, that the Tartars were\nafraid of them and did not know what to do with their prisoners.\n\nAfter a while they dispersed. Suddenly Jilin heard a rustling overhead\nand saw Dina crouching at the edge of the pit, her knees higher than her\nhead. She bent over so that the coins at the end of her plaits dangled\nover the pit. Her eyes were twinkling like two stars. From her sleeve\nshe took two cakes made of cheese and threw them down to him. Jilin\npicked them up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a long time it is since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to\nsee me! I\xe2\x80\x99ve made you some toys. Look, here they are!\xe2\x80\x9d He threw them up\nto her one by one. She shook her head and averted her gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant them, Ivan,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want to kill you, Ivan,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\npointing to her throat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho wants to kill me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father. The old man told him to, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are sorry for me, bring me a long pole.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe shook her head, as much as to say that it was impossible.\n\nHe put up his hands and implored her, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Dina! Be a dear and bring\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ll catch me at home.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she went away.\n\nIn the evening Jilin sat in the pit wondering what would happen. He kept\nlooking up; the stars were visible, but the moon had not yet risen. The\nMullah\xe2\x80\x99s call was heard, and all grew quiet. Jilin began to doze,\nthinking \xe2\x80\x9cThe child is afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d Suddenly some clay dropped on to his\nhead. He looked up, and saw a long pole poking into the opposite wall of\nthe pit; it began to slide down. Jilin took hold of it and lowered it\nwith a feeling of gladness at his heart. It was a stout, strong pole; he\nhad noticed it many times on the roof of the master\xe2\x80\x99s hut.\n\nHe looked up. The stars were shining high in the sky and above the pit\nDina\xe2\x80\x99s eyes gleamed in the darkness like a cat\xe2\x80\x99s. She leant her head\nover the pit and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cIvan, Ivan!\xe2\x80\x9d making signs to him to speak\nlow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve all gone but two.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Kostilin,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said; \xe2\x80\x9clet us try our luck for the last time;\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Kostilin would not listen to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit seems that I can\xe2\x80\x99t get away from here. How can I come\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly strength enough to move?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye, then. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think ill of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe kissed Kostilin, and seizing the pole, he asked Dina to hold it at\nthe top and swarmed up. Twice he fell back again; the shackles hindered\nhim. But Jilin persevered and got to the top somehow. Dina clutched hold\nof his shirt and pulled at him with all her might, unable to control her\nlaughter.\n\nWhen he clambered out Jilin handed her the pole, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cPut it back in\nits place, Dina, for if they notice its absence they\xe2\x80\x99ll beat you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDina dragged the pole away, and Jilin went down the hill. When he got to\nthe bottom he sat down under its shelter, took a sharp stone and tried\nto wrench the lock off the shackles. But the lock was a strong one and\nwould not give way, and it was difficult to get at it. Suddenly he heard\nsome one coming downhill, skipping lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be Dina again,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought.\n\nShe came up, took the stone and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me try.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe knelt down and tried to wrench the lock off, but her little hands\nwere as slender as little twigs and there was no strength in them. She\nthrew the stone down and burst into tears. Jilin made another attempt,\nwhile Dina squatted down beside him and put her hand on his shoulder.\n\nJilin looked round; to the left the sky was all red; the moon was\nbeginning to rise. \xe2\x80\x9cI must cross the valley and be under shelter of the\nwood before the moon rises,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He got up and threw away the\nstone. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go as I am in the shackles. Good-bye, Dina, dear; I shall\nalways remember you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDina seized hold of him and groped about his coat with her hand to find\na place to thrust some cakes into. Jilin took the cakes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, little one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere won\xe2\x80\x99t be any one to make you\ndolls when I am gone.\xe2\x80\x9d He stroked her head.\n\nDina burst into tears and, covering her face with her hands, she fled up\nthe hill, bounding along like a wild goat. The coins in her plait could\nbe heard jingling in the darkness.\n\nJilin crossed himself, took the lock of his shackles in his hand to\nprevent a clatter and started on his way, dragging his shackled leg and\ngazing at the red in the sky where the moon was rising. This time he\nknew the way. He had to go straight on for six miles. If only he could\nreach the wood before the moon had quite risen! He forded the river. The\nred light over the hill had paled. He walked along the valley, looking\nback now and then; the moon was not yet visible. The light grew brighter\nand brighter; one side of the valley was quite light. The shadows crept\nalong the foot of the hill, drawing nearer to him.\n\nJilin kept in the shadow. He hurried, but the moon moved faster than he;\nthe hilltops on the right were already lit up. As he neared the wood,\nthe moon rose over the hills, all white, and it grew as light as day.\nAll the leaves on the trees could be seen distinctly. It was still and\nlight on the hills; there was a dead silence, except for the murmur of\nthe river below.\n\nHe reached the wood without meeting any one. He chose a dark spot and\nsat down to rest.\n\nWhen he had rested a while and eaten a cake, he found a stone and once\nmore tried to wrench the lock of the shackles. He cut his hands, but\ncould not manage it. He rose and went on his way. After a mile he was\nquite worn out and his feet ached terribly. At every dozen steps or so\nhe stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI must drag myself on so\nlong as my strength holds out, for if I once sit down I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be able\nto get up again. I can\xe2\x80\x99t reach the fortress to-night, that is obvious;\nas soon as it gets light I\xe2\x80\x99ll hide in the wood and go on again when it\ngets dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe walked the whole night, meeting only two Tartars, but Jilin heard\nthem from a distance and took refuge behind a tree.\n\nThe moon began to pale; the dew fell; it was near dawn, but Jilin had\nnot yet reached the end of the wood. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll walk another thirty steps or\nso then I\xe2\x80\x99ll creep into the thicket and sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He\ncovered the thirty steps and saw that he had come to the edge of the\nwood. When he came out it was quite light. Before him stretched the\nsteppe and to the left, near the foot of a hill, he saw a dying fire\nfrom which the smoke rose and men were sitting about it.\n\nHe looked intently; there was a flash of guns--they were soldiers,\nCossacks!\n\nJilin was overjoyed. He summoned his remaining strength and began to\ndescend the hill, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid that any mounted Tartar should\nsee me now in the open field; though near my own people, I could not\nescape.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe thought had no sooner crossed his mind than he saw three Tartars\nstanding on a hill, not more than a few yards away. They had seen him\nand dashed down towards him. His heart gave a great bound. He waved his\narms and shouted with all his might, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp, help, brothers!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers heard him; a few Cossacks sprang upon their horses and\ndashed forward to cut across the Tartars\xe2\x80\x99 path.\n\nThe Cossacks were far off and the Tartars were near, but Jilin made one\nlast effort; lifting the shackles with his hand, he ran towards the\nCossacks. He hardly knew what he was doing and crossed himself wildly,\ncrying, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp, brothers, help!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Cossacks numbered about fifteen.\n\nThe Tartars grew afraid and stopped in hesitation before they reached\nhim. Jilin managed to get to the Cossacks. They surrounded him, asking\nwho he was and where he came from, but Jilin was quite beside himself\nand could only repeat, through his tears, \xe2\x80\x9cBrothers, brothers!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers came up and crowded round him, one giving him bread,\nanother porridge, another some vodka to drink, another gave him his\ncloak to cover him, and another wrenched off the shackles.\n\nThe officers recognized him and took him to the fortress. His men were\ndelighted to see him; his fellow-officers gathered about him.\n\nJilin told them all that had happened to him and ended by saying,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how I went home and got married. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to marry,\nevidently.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Jilin remained in the army in the Caucasus. It was not until a month\nlater that Kostilin was released, after paying a ransom of five thousand\nroubles. He was brought back in a half-dead condition.\n\n\n\n\nEMELIAN AND THE EMPTY DRUM\n\n\nEmelian was a labourer and worked for a master. He was walking through a\nfield one day on his way to work, when a frog hopped in front of him and\nhe just missed crushing it by stepping across. Suddenly some one called\nto him from behind. He turned, and there stood a beautiful maiden, who\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you marry, Emelian?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I, dear maiden? I possess nothing but the clothes I stand up\nin, and who would have a husband like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry me,\xe2\x80\x9d the maiden said.\n\nEmelian looked at her in admiration.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would with pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut how should we live?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a thing to trouble about,\n\n[Illustration: EMELIAN AND THE EMPTY DRUM.]\n\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x9d the maiden said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne has only to work the more and sleep the\nless and one can always be clothed and fed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; let us marry, then,\xe2\x80\x9d Emelian said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall we live?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the town.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian and the maiden went to the town. She took him to a little house\non the very edge and they married and set up housekeeping.\n\nOne day the King went for a drive beyond the town, and when passing\nEmelian\xe2\x80\x99s gate, Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s wife came out to look at him. When the King\nsaw her he marvelled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He stopped the carriage and called her to\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmelian the peasant\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came a beauty like you to marry a peasant?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should\nhave been a queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for your kind words,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9ca peasant husband is good\nenough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King talked to her a while and went on his way. When he returned to\nthe palace Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s wife did not go out of his head for a moment. The\nwhole night he could not sleep and kept on thinking how he could take\nher away from Emelian, but no possible way occurred to him. He summoned\nhis servants and asked them to think of a way.\n\nAnd the servants said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGet Emelian to come and be a labourer in\nthe palace. We will wear him out with work, then his wife will become a\nwidow and you can have her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King followed their advice. He sent a messenger to tell Emelian that\nhe was to come and be a yard-porter in the palace and bring his wife to\nlive with him there.\n\nThe messenger came to Emelian and repeated the King\xe2\x80\x99s words. And\nEmelian\xe2\x80\x99s wife said to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped; you must go.\nYou can work there in the day and return to me at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian went away. When he came to the palace the King\xe2\x80\x99s steward said to\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you come without your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I drag her about with me? She has a home of her own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the King\xe2\x80\x99s yard Emelian was given enough work for two men. Emelian\nset about it, not expecting to get it all finished, but behold! before\nevening came it was all done. The steward, seeing that he had got\nthrough the work, gave him four times as much for the morrow.\n\nEmelian went home. The house was scrubbed and cleaned, the fire lighted,\nthe bread baked, the supper cooked. His wife was sitting at the table\nsewing, waiting for him. She flew to the door to meet him, then laid the\nsupper and fed him well; afterwards she began to ask him about his work.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthey set me tasks beyond my strength; they\nwear me out with too much work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think about the work,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t look back to see how\nmuch you have done, nor look ahead to see how much there is left. Just\nkeep straight on and all will be done in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian went to bed. In the morning he again set out to the palace. He\nbegan his work and did not look round once, and behold! by evening it\nwas all finished; he went home when it was still light.\n\nAgain they increased Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s work, but Emelian finished it all in time\nand went home for the night as usual. A week passed. The King\xe2\x80\x99s servants\nsaw that they could not get the better of Emelian by giving him rough\nwork so they gave him difficult work instead, but even that did not\nhelp. No matter what they set him to do--carpentering, stone-cutting,\nthatching--he got everything done in time and went home for the night to\nhis wife. Another week passed.\n\nThe King summoned his servants and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it for nothing that I keep\nyou? Two weeks have passed and still I do not see the fruits of your\nwork. You promised to wear Emelian out with work and each night from my\nwindow I see him going home singing to himself. Are you making sport of\nme, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King\xe2\x80\x99s servants began to excuse themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are doing the best\nwe can. We thought at first to wear him out with rough work, but you\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get him anyhow. We set him all kinds of tasks, such as sweeping,\nbut he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it means to be tired. Then we gave him\ndifficult work, thinking that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have brains enough to do it,\nyet still, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the better of him. No matter what the work,\nhe tackles it and gets it all done in time. He must either be\nextraordinarily strong or his wife must be a witch. We are sick of him\nourselves. We want to set him such a task that he cannot possibly do. We\nthought of asking him to build a temple in a single day. You must send\nfor him and command him to build a temple opposite the palace in a\nsingle day, and if he fails to do it, we can cut off his head for\ndisobedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King sent for Emelian.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuild me a new temple in the square opposite the palace; by to-morrow\nevening it must all be finished. If you do it, I will reward you; if\nnot, I will cut off your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian listened to the King\xe2\x80\x99s words; then turned and went his way home.\nWhen he got there he said to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cMake yourself ready, wife; we\nmust run away or else we are both lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chave you grown so faint-hearted that you want to run\naway?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help it when the King commanded me to build a temple\nto-morrow before nightfall? If I fail to do it, he will have my head cut\noff. There is only one way out. We must run away while there is yet\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe wife did not approve of his words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King has many soldiers; we shall not be able to escape them. And\nwhile you have strength enough you must obey the King\xe2\x80\x99s command.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I obey if it\xe2\x80\x99s beyond my strength?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t get excited. Have your supper and go to bed; get up\nearly in the morning and you\xe2\x80\x99ll manage in good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian went to bed. His wife woke him in the morning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cmake haste and finish the temple. Here are nails and a\nhammer. There is still a day\xe2\x80\x99s work for you left to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian set out. When he came to the square, there in the middle stood a\nnew temple not quite finished. Emelian set to work to finish it and by\nthe evening it was all done.\n\nThe King awoke and looking out of the palace window he saw a new temple\nin the square. Emelian was busy around, knocking a nail in here and\nthere. The King was not pleased with the temple; he was annoyed that he\nhad no pretext for cutting off Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s head and taking his wife for\nhimself.\n\nAgain the King summoned his servants.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmelian has done this task too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have no reason for\ncutting off his head. This was not difficult enough; we must give him\nsomething more difficult still. You decide what it shall be, or else\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have your heads cut off first.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the servants bethought them to set Emelian to make a river that was\nto wind round the palace and have ships sailing on it.\n\nThe King summoned Emelian and set him the new task.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you could make a temple in a single night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can do\nthis too. See that it is all finished by to-morrow, or else I shall cut\noff your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian\xe2\x80\x99s spirits fell lower than ever and he went home to his wife in a\nsad mood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so sad?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cHas the King set you a new task?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian told her what it was.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must run away,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\n\nAnd the wife said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot escape the soldiers. You must obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Have your supper and go to bed. Get up early in\nthe morning and all will be ready in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian went to bed. In the morning his wife woke him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the palace,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is finished. Only by the\nharbour, opposite the palace, there is a little mound that wants\nlevelling; take the spade and level it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian set out. He came to the town and there around the palace a river\nflowed with ships sailing on it. Emelian went up to the harbour opposite\nthe palace and he saw an uneven place and began to level it.\n\nThe King awoke and looking out of his palace window he saw a river where\nthere was not one before and ships were sailing on it and Emelian was\nlevelling a little mound with his spade. And the King was alarmed. He\ntook no pleasure in the river or the ships, he was only annoyed that he\ncould not cut off Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s head. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no task he cannot do,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the King summoned his servants and conferred with them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of a task,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will be beyond Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s strength, for\nso far he has done everything we have thought of and I cannot take away\nhis wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the courtiers thought for a long time, then came to the King and\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must summon Emelian and say to him, \xe2\x80\x98Go to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nwhere, and bring me--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\xe2\x80\x99 He won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to escape you\nthen, for wherever he goes you can say it was not the right place and\nwhatever he brings was not the right thing. Then you can cut off his\nhead and take away his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King was pleased with the idea. He sent for Emelian and said to him,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where, and bring me--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. And if you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut off your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian went back to his wife and told her what the King had said. The\nwife reflected.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBe it on the King\xe2\x80\x99s own head what his courtiers have\ntaught him. We must act with cunning now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe sat and thought it over for a while; then said to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nmust go a long way to our old grandmother, a peasant soldier\xe2\x80\x99s mother,\nand ask her to help you. She will give you something which you must take\nstraight to the palace and I will be there already. I cannot escape them\nnow; they will take me by force, but only for a short while. If you do\nwhat grandmother tells you, you will soon set me free.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the wife prepared Emelian for the journey and gave him a bundle and\na spindle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive grandmother this spindle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cby this she will know that\nyou are my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the wife showed him the way. Emelian left the town and saw some\nsoldiers drilling. He stopped and watched them. The soldiers finished\ntheir drill and sat down to rest. Emelian approached them and asked,\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me, mates, how to get to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where and bring\nback--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers were perplexed at his words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho sent you?\xe2\x80\x9d they asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe too,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9csince the day we became soldiers want to go to--we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know where and find--we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve never been able\nto find it and so cannot help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian sat with the soldiers awhile then went on his way. He wandered\nand wandered till he came to a wood. In the wood was a cottage and in\nthe cottage sat an old woman, a peasant soldier\xe2\x80\x99s mother, spinning at\nher wheel, and she wept as she spun and moistened her fingers with the\ntears that flowed from her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried in anger when she saw Emelian.\n\nEmelian gave her the spindle and said that his wife had sent him. The\nold woman instantly softened and began to ask him questions. And Emelian\ntold her his whole story of how he had married the maiden and gone to\nlive in the town, and how he had been taken to the King\xe2\x80\x99s as a\nyard-porter, and of the work he had done in the palace, and the temple\nhe had built in a night, and the river and ships he had made, and that\nnow the King had sent him to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to bring back--I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow what.\n\nThe old woman listened to what he had to say and ceased her weeping. She\nbegan to mutter to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cThe time has come, I see. Very well,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid aloud; \xe2\x80\x9csit down, my son, and have something to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian had something to eat and the old woman said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cHere is a\nball of thread; roll it before you and follow wherever it leads. You\nwill have to go a long way, to the very sea. When you come to the sea\nyou will see a large town. Ask to be allowed to stay the night in the\noutermost house and look for what you want there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut by what signs shall I know it, grandmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see that which men listen to more than to father or mother,\nthat will be the thing you want. Seize it and take it to the King. He\nwill tell you you haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought the right thing, and you must say to\nhim, \xe2\x80\x98If it is not the right thing then I must break it.\xe2\x80\x99 Then strike\nthis thing; carry it out to the river; break it and throw it into the\nwater. Then you will get back your wife and dry up my tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian took leave of the grandmother and went where the ball of thread\ntook him to. The ball rolled and rolled till it brought him to the sea,\nwhere there was a large town. Emelian knocked at a house and asked to be\nallowed to stay the night. The people let him in. He went to bed. In the\nmorning he woke early and heard the father of the house trying to wake\nhis son to chop some wood. The son would not listen to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is early\nyet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he heard the mother near the stove say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo go, my son. Your\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s bones ache; surely you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him go? Get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe son only smacked his lips and went to sleep again. He had no sooner\nfallen asleep than there was a banging and a rumbling in the street. The\nson jumped up, dressed and ran out. Emelian ran out after him to see\nwhat it was that a son obeyed more than father or mother.\n\nWhen Emelian got outside he saw a man coming up the street carrying some\nround object on his belly that he was beating with sticks. It was this\nthing that had made the noise and that the son had obeyed. Emelian\napproached and examined it. The thing was round like a small tub with\nskin drawn tightly on either side of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this thing called?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA drum,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it empty?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\nEmelian wondered and asked the people to give him the thing, but they\nwould not. Emelian gave up asking and followed the drummer. He walked\nabout the whole day and when the drummer went to bed at night, Emelian\nseized the drum and ran away with it. He ran and ran until he came to\nhis own town. He wanted to give his wife a surprise, but she was not at\nhome. She had been taken to the King the day after Emelian had left.\n\nEmelian went to the palace and asked to be announced as the man who had\ngone to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where and brought back--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. The\nKing was informed of his return and he ordered Emelian to come to him on\nthe morrow. Emelian again demanded to see the King, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI have\nbrought back what I was ordered to; let the King come out to me, or I\nwill go in to him myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King came out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nEmelian told him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was not the place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have you brought?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian wanted to show him, but the King would not even look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was not the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is not the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Emelian said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must break it and let it go\nto the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian came out of the palace and struck the drum. He had no sooner\ndone so than all the King\xe2\x80\x99s troops gathered around him. They saluted\nEmelian and waited for his commands. From the window of his palace the\nKing called to the troops, forbidding them to follow Emelian, but the\ntroops would not listen to the King and followed Emelian. When the King\nsaw this he ordered Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s wife to be given back to him and he begged\nEmelian to give him the drum.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Emelian said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was told to break it and throw the bits into\nthe river.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian took the drum to the river and the soldiers followed him.\nEmelian struck the drum and broke it into little bits which he threw\ninto the water and the troops all scattered and dispersed. And Emelian\ntook his wife back home.\n\nFrom that day the King left off worrying him and Emelian and his wife\nlived happily ever after.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT BEAR\n\n\nA long, long time ago there was a big drought on the earth. All the\nrivers dried up and the streams and wells, and the trees withered and\nthe bushes and grass, and men and beasts died of thirst.\n\nOne night a little girl went out with a pitcher to find some water for\nher sick mother. She wandered and wandered everywhere, but could find no\nwater, and she grew so tired that she lay down on the grass and fell\nasleep. When she awoke and took up the pitcher she nearly upset the\nwater it contained. The pitcher was full of clear, fresh water. The\nlittle girl was glad and was about to put it to her lips, but she\nremembered her mother and ran home with the pitcher as fast as she\ncould. She hurried so much that she did not notice a little dog in her\npath; she stumbled over it and dropped the pitcher. The dog whined\npitifully; the little girl seized the pitcher.\n\nShe thought the water would have been upset, but the pitcher stood\nupright and the water was there as before. She poured a little into the\npalm of her hand and the dog lapped it and was comforted. When the\nlittle girl again took up the pitcher, it had turned from common wood to\nsilver. She took the pitcher home and gave it to her mother.\n\nThe mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall die just the same; you had better drink it,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand she handed the pitcher to the child. In that moment the pitcher\nturned from silver to gold. The little girl could no longer contain\nherself and was about to put the pitcher to her lips, when the door\nopened and a stranger entered who begged for a drink. The little girl\nswallowed her saliva and gave the pitcher to him. And suddenly seven\nlarge diamonds sprang out of the pitcher and a stream of clear, fresh\nwater flowed from it. And the seven diamonds began to rise, and they\nrose higher and higher till they reached the sky and became the Great\nBear.\n\n\n\n\nTHREE QUESTIONS\n\n\nIt once occurred to a King that if he knew the right moment when to\nbegin on any work and the right kind of people to have or not to have\ndealings with and the thing to do that was more important than any other\nthing, he would always be successful.\n\nAnd he proclaimed throughout his kingdom that he would give a great\nreward to any one who could tell him what was the right moment for any\naction, and who were the most essential of all people, and what was the\nmost essential thing of all to do.\n\nMany learned men came to the King and answered his questions in\ndifferent ways.\n\nIn answer to the first question some said that to know the right time\nfor any action, one must draw up a time-table of all the days, months\nand years and observe it\n\n[Illustration: THREE QUESTIONS.\n\n_To face page_ 158.]\n\nstrictly, then one could do everything at the proper time. Others said\nthat it was impossible to decide beforehand the proper time for any\naction; the only thing one could do was to waste no time in vain\namusements, but to pay attention to what was going on around one, and to\ndo the thing that came to hand. A third said that however attentive the\nKing might be to what went on around him, one man alone could not decide\nthe proper time for every action and that he needed a council of wise\nmen to advise him. Still a fourth maintained that as certain action had\nto be decided at once and could not wait a council the proper thing to\ndo was to find out beforehand what was going to happen so as to be\nalways prepared. But as only magicians knew what was going to happen,\nthen it followed that in order to find out the proper time for any\naction one must consult the magicians.\n\nThe second question, too, was answered in various ways. Some said that\nthe most essential people to the King were his helpers and ministers;\nothers said priests; still others that the most essential people to the\nKing were doctors; a fourth party said that the most essential people to\nthe King were soldiers.\n\nTo the third question about the most important occupation, some declared\nit was science, others, the art of war, and others, divine worship.\n\nThe answers being different, the King agreed with none of them and gave\nno man the promised reward. But still wishing to find out the answers to\nhis questions, he resolved to consult a hermit who was famous throughout\nthe land for his wisdom.\n\nThe hermit lived in a wood which he never left, and received none but\ncommon folk. For this reason the King put on simple garments, and,\ndismissing his body-guard before he reached the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s cell, he\nclimbed down from his horse and went the rest of the way alone and on\nfoot.\n\nHe found the hermit digging a bed in front of the hermitage. When the\nhermit saw the King, he greeted him and went on with his digging. He was\nfrail and thin and each time he dug his spade into the ground and\nturned over a little soil, he gasped for breath.\n\nThe King approached him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have come, oh, wise hermit, to ask\nyou to give me the answers to these three questions--what hour must one\nremember and not allow to slip by, so as not to regret it afterwards?\nWhat people are the most essential and with whom should one or should\none not have dealings? What things are the most essential to do and\nwhich of those things must one do first of all?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe hermit heard what the King had to say, but made no reply. He spat on\nhis hand and went on with his digging.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are tired,\xe2\x80\x9d the King said; \xe2\x80\x9cgive me the spade and I will do the\ndigging for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King took the spade and began to dig, but after a while he stopped\nand repeated his question. The hermit made no reply, but stretched out\nhis hand for the spade.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou rest now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the King would not give up the spade and went on with the digging.\nOne hour passed and another; the sun began to set behind the trees when\nthe King stuck his spade into the ground and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI came to you, wise\nman, to find the answers to my three questions. If you cannot answer\nthem, then tell me and I will go my way home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one is running hither,\xe2\x80\x9d the hermit said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us see who it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King turned and saw a bearded man running towards them. The man\xe2\x80\x99s\nhands were clasped over his stomach and the blood flowed from beneath\nthem. He fell at the King\xe2\x80\x99s feet and lay motionless, rolling his eyes\nand moaning faintly.\n\nThe King and the hermit unfastened the man\xe2\x80\x99s clothes. He had a large\nwound in his stomach. The King bathed it as well as he could with his\nhandkerchief and bandaged it with the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s towel. The blood did not\ncease to flow, and several times the King had to remove the bandages,\nsoaked with warm blood, and rebathe and rebandage the wound.\n\nWhen the blood ceased to flow, the wounded man came to himself and\nasked for some water. The King brought some fresh water and raised it\nto the wounded man\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\n\nThe sun had quite set meanwhile and it began to get cold. The King, with\nthe hermit\xe2\x80\x99s help, carried the wounded man into the cell and put him on\nthe bed. The wounded man shut his eyes and went to sleep. The King was\nso tired with the walk and the work that he curled up by the door and\nfell into a sound sleep. He slept through the whole mild summer night,\nand when he awoke in the morning he could not make out where he was and\nwho was the strange bearded man staring at him from the bed with\nglistening eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d the bearded man said in a faint voice, when he saw that\nthe King was awake and observing him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know you and have nothing to forgive you for,\xe2\x80\x9d the King said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, but I know you. I am your enemy who vowed to be\nrevenged on you for having executed my brother and taken away my\nproperty: I knew that you went alone to the hermit and resolved to kill\nyou on your way back. But the day passed and you did not come. I lost\npatience and came out to find you, when I stumbled upon your body-guard.\nThey recognized me and wounded me. I escaped from them, but would have\ndied from loss of blood had you not bound my wound. I wanted to kill you\nand you saved my life. If I continue to live I will serve you as your\nmost faithful slave should you desire it, and I will order my sons to do\nlikewise. Forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King was very glad that he had been able to make peace with his\nenemy so easily, and not only forgave him but promised to return his\nproperty and to send him his own servants and physician.\n\nTaking leave of the wounded man the King came out of the cell and sought\nfor the hermit with his eyes. Before going away he wanted to ask him for\nthe last time to answer his three questions. The hermit was on his knees\nby the beds they had dug yesterday, sowing vegetable seeds.\n\nThe King approached him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the last time, wise man, I ask\nyou to answer my questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are answered already,\xe2\x80\x9d the hermit said, squatting on his\nemaciated legs and looking at up the King, who stood before him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d the King asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d the hermit began; \xe2\x80\x9chad you not pitied my weakness\nyesterday and dug these beds for me and gone back alone, the man would\nhave attacked you and you would have regretted that you had not stayed\nwith me. The important hour at the time was when you dug these beds, and\nI was the most essential person to you, and the most essential act was\nto do me a kindness. And later, when the man ran up, the most important\nhour was when you looked after him, for, had you not bandaged his wound,\nhe would have died without making his peace with you. He was the most\nessential man to you at that time, and what you did for him was the most\nessential thing to be done. Always bear in mind that the most important\ntime is _now_, for it is the only time we have any power over\nourselves; the most essential man is the one with whom you happen to be\nat the moment, because you can never be sure whether you will ever have\nrelations with any one else, and the most essential thing to do is a\nkindness to that man, for it was for this purpose we were sent into the\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n[Illustration: THE GODSON.\n\n_To face page_ 167.]\n\n\n\n\nTHE GODSON\n\n\nI\n\nA son was born to a poor peasant. He rejoiced and went to a neighbour to\nask him to stand as godfather to the boy. The neighbour refused. He did\nnot want to be godfather to a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s son. So the peasant went to\nanother neighbour and he, too, refused. He walked from house to house,\nbut could find no one who would be godfather to his son, so he set out\nto another village. On his way he met a stranger, who stopped him and\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cGood day, peasant; where are you going to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod has given me a child,\xe2\x80\x9d the peasant said, \xe2\x80\x9cto gladden my sight in my\nyouth, to comfort me in my old age and to pray for my soul when I die.\nNo one in our village will be godfather to him, so I am going to seek\none elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me be his godfather,\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger said.\n\nThe peasant rejoiced. He thanked the stranger and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut whom shall\nI ask to be his godmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo into the town,\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger said; \xe2\x80\x9cin the square you will see a\nstone house with shop windows; go in and ask the merchant to let his\ndaughter stand as godmother to your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe peasant was doubtful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I ask a rich merchant? He will be too proud to let his\ndaughter come to a poor man like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t be your fault; go and ask him. Have everything ready by the\nmorning and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the christening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe peasant went home, then drove into the town to the merchant. He had\nno sooner stopped in the yard than the merchant came out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod has given me a child,\xe2\x80\x9d the peasant said, \xe2\x80\x9cto gladden my sight in my\nyouth, to comfort me in my old age and to pray for my soul when I die.\nWill you be kind enough to let your daughter come and be godmother to\nthe child?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is the christening?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; go, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name. To-morrow my daughter will be at the\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe next day the godmother and godfather came; the child was christened,\nbut directly after the christening the godfather disappeared. No one\nknew who he was and no one saw him from that day.\n\n\nII\n\nThe child grew up to the parents\xe2\x80\x99 great joy; and he was strong and\nindustrious and clever and humble. When he was ten years old the parents\nsent him to school, and what it took others five years to learn the boy\nlearnt in one. And there was no one in the village who could teach him\nmore.\n\nEaster came round and the boy went to his godmother to give her the\nEaster greeting. When he returned home he said, \xe2\x80\x9cFather and mother,\nwhere does my godfather live? I should like to give him the Easter\ngreeting, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the father said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know where your godfather lives, dear\nson. We, too, have worried over that. We have not seen him since you\nwere christened. We have not heard of him and don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he lives,\nnor whether he is alive at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe boy bowed to his father and mother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto seek my godfather. I want to find him and give\nhim the Easter greeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe father and mother gave their consent and the boy set out to find his\ngodfather.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe boy left the house and set out on his way. About midday he met a\nstranger and the stranger stopped and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood day to you, boy. Where\nare you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the boy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI went to my godmother to give her the Easter\ngreeting and when I returned home I asked my parents where my godfather\nlived, because I wanted to give him the greeting too, but my parents\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98We don\xe2\x80\x99t know where your godfather lives, dear son. We have not\nheard of him since you were christened and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about\nhim, or whether he is alive at all.\xe2\x80\x99 And I wanted to see my godfather,\nso I am going to find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am your godfather,\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger said.\n\nThe boy rejoiced and gave him the Easter greeting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to, godfather? If you are going in our direction\ncome in to us, or if you are going home, may I come with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the stranger said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no time to come to you now, because I\nhave some business in the villages. I shall not be home until to-morrow,\nthen you can come to me if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how shall I find you, godfather?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk straight towards the east until you come to a wood in the midst of\nwhich you will find a clearing. Sit down to rest in that clearing and\nlook about you to see what is happening. When you come out of the wood\nyou will see a garden and in the garden is a house with a golden roof.\nThat is my house. Go in at the gate; I will meet you there myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSaying these words the godfather vanished from the godson\xe2\x80\x99s sight.\n\n\nIV\n\nThe boy followed the godfather\xe2\x80\x99s directions. He wandered and wandered\ntill he came to a wood and found the clearing, and in the midst of the\nclearing stood a pine tree to a branch of which a heavy block of oak was\nattached with string, and beneath the block was a trough of honey. As\nthe boy was wondering why the honey and the block were there, a\ncrackling was heard among the trees and out came a family of bears. The\nmother came in front and a yearling and some cubs followed behind. The\nmother, sniffing the air, went straight to the trough, the cubs\nfollowing. She thrust her muzzle into the honey and called to the cubs\nto do the same. They scampered up and thrust in their muzzles. The block\nswung back a little and returning, hit against the cubs. When the mother\nsaw this, she shoved the block away with her paw. The block swung back\nfurther, and returning more forcibly struck one cub on the back, another\non the head. The cubs jumped away, howling with pain. The mother bear\ngrowled, and seizing the block in her fore-paws, flung it away from her\nviolently. The block flew up high. The yearling ran up to the trough,\nthrust his muzzle into the honey, the other cubs followed him, but no\nsooner had they got there than the block swung back, struck the yearling\non the head and killed him. The mother-bear growled more angrily as she\nseized the block and flung it away with all her might. The block flew\nhigher than the branch, the string it was tied to even slackened; the\nmother-bear and the cubs came up to the trough; the block flew higher\nand higher, then stopped and began to descend; the lower it got the\nswifter became its course. It crashed down on the mother-bear\xe2\x80\x99s head.\nShe fell over; her legs twitched and she died. The cubs ran away into\nthe wood.\n\n\nV\n\nThe boy wondered and went on further. He came to a large garden and in\nthe garden was a high house with a golden roof. At the gate stood his\ngodfather, smiling. He greeted his godson, made him come inside the gate\nand took him round the garden. He had never even dreamt of such beauty\nand joy as there was in that garden.\n\nThe godfather took the boy into the house and he found that more\nwonderful still. The godfather showed him all the rooms--one more\nbeautiful than the other--then he brought him to a sealed door. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\nsee this door?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not locked, only sealed. It can be\nopened, but I forbid you to do it. You can live here and go where you\nlike and do what you like; taste of every pleasure; I forbid you only\none thing--to pass that door. But if it should happen that you do go in,\nremember what you saw in the wood.\xe2\x80\x9d With these words the godfather went\naway, and the godson was left alone. His life was so full of pleasure\nand such a happy one that when he had been there thirty years it seemed\nto him no more than three hours. Thus the thirty years passed and the\ngodson came to the sealed door, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why my godfather\nforbade me to go into this room? I will go in and see what is there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe pushed the door; the seal gave way and the door opened. The godson\nwent in and saw that the room was large and more beautiful than all the\nothers, and in the middle of it stood a golden throne. The godson\nwandered and wandered over the room; then he stopped by the throne,\nmounted the steps and sat down. He saw a sceptre by the throne and he\ntook it up in his hand. He had no sooner touched the sceptre than the\nwalls of the room rolled asunder. The godson looked about and saw the\nwhole world and everything people were doing in it. Straight before him\nwas the sea and ships sailing on it. To the right were foreign lands,\nwhere heathens lived. To the left were Christians, but not Russians. On\nthe fourth side were our own Russian people.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will look and see what is happening at home,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if\nthe corn is good this year?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked at his father\xe2\x80\x99s fields and saw the sheaves standing in them.\nHe began to count the sheaves to see if the harvest had been good, when\nhe saw a cart coming over the field with a peasant sitting in it. He\nlooked closer and saw that it was Vasily, a thief. Vasily stopped by the\nsheaves and began putting them into the cart. The godson could not\nendure this and cried aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cFather, they are stealing your sheaves!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe father awoke in the night. \xe2\x80\x9cI dreamt that some one was stealing my\nsheaves,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI will go and see.\xe2\x80\x9d He got upon his horse and rode\nout.\n\nWhen he got to the fields he saw Vasily and called aloud for help. Some\npeasants came up. Vasily was beaten, bound and taken to prison.\n\nThe godson then looked towards the town where his godmother lived and\nsaw that she had married a merchant. She was lying in bed and her\nhusband got up to leave her to go to another woman. And the godson\ncried aloud to his godmother, \xe2\x80\x9cGet up! Your husband is going to do\nsomething wicked!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godmother jumped up, dressed and set out to find her husband. She\nbrought him to shame, beat the other woman and would not take her\nhusband back again.\n\nThe godson looked again towards his home and saw his mother lying in the\nhouse and that a robber had stolen in and was breaking open a trunk. The\nmother awoke and cried out in terror. The robber raised his axe, and was\nabout to kill her, but the godson could endure no more; he thrust the\nsceptre straight into the robber\xe2\x80\x99s temple and killed him on the spot.\n\n\nVI\n\nHe had no sooner slain the robber than the walls rose up again and the\nroom became as before.\n\nThe door opened and the godfather entered. He approached the godson,\ntook him by the hand, led him from the throne and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou did not\nobey my commands. You did one wrong thing in opening the forbidden\ndoor, another when you mounted the throne and took my sceptre into your\nhand, and a third wrong, which has added to the evil in the world. Had\nyou sat on the throne an hour longer, you would have ruined half\nmankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godfather once more led the godson up to the throne and he took\nthe sceptre in his hand and the walls rolled asunder.\n\nAnd the godfather said, \xe2\x80\x9cSee what you have done to your father. Vasily\nsat in prison for a year and learnt every kind of wickedness and came\nout completely corrupted. See, he has driven off two of your father\xe2\x80\x99s\nhorses and is now setting fire to his barns. This is what you have done\nto your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs soon as the godson saw his father\xe2\x80\x99s barns burst into flame the\ngodfather hid the view from his sight and bade him look in another\ndirection.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit is now a year since your godmother\xe2\x80\x99s husband left\nher, and he goes after other women and his wife has taken to drink and\nhis former mistress has fallen to still lower depths. This is what you\nhave done to your godmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis sight, too, he hid from the godson\xe2\x80\x99s gaze and bade him look towards\nhis own home. His mother was weeping and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been\nbetter if the robber had killed me than that I should have so many sins\non my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what you have done to your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis sight, too, the godfather shut out and bade the godson look below.\nAnd he saw two keepers guarding the robber in a dungeon.\n\nAnd the godfather said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis man has killed nine people. He should have\natoned for his sins himself, but in killing him you have taken them upon\nyour own soul. Now you must answer for all his sins. This is what you\nhave done to yourself. When the mother-bear first pushed the block aside\nshe merely disturbed her cubs; when she pushed it a second time, she\nkilled her yearling; when she pushed it a third time, she was killed\nherself. You have done exactly the same. I give you a term of thirty\nyears. Go into the world and atone for the robber\xe2\x80\x99s sins; if you fail to\ndo so, you will have to take his place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how shall I atone for his sins?\xe2\x80\x9d the godson asked.\n\nAnd the godfather said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have rid the world of as much evil as\nyou brought into it, then you will have atoned for your own and the\nrobber\xe2\x80\x99s sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I rid the world of evil?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godfather said, \xe2\x80\x9cWalk straight towards the east until you come\nto some fields on which you will find some people. Take note of what\nthey are doing and teach them what you know, then go on further,\nobserving everything on the way. On the fourth day you will come to a\nwood in which you will find a cell, and in this cell a hermit lives.\nTell this hermit all that has happened and he will instruct you in what\nyou are to do. When you have done all that the hermit has told you, you\nwill have atoned for your own and the robber\xe2\x80\x99s sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith these words the godfather put the godson out at the gate.\n\n\nVII\n\nAnd the godson set out, thinking as he walked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I rid the world\nof evil? People rid the world of evil by banishing evil men or putting\nthem in prison or executing them. But how can I rid the world of evil\nwithout taking other men\xe2\x80\x99s sins upon myself?\xe2\x80\x9d And the godson wondered\nand wondered, but could come to no decision.\n\nHe wandered and wandered till he came to a field on which tall rich corn\nwas growing, ready to be harvested. And the godson saw a calf that had\nstrayed in among the corn and he saw men on horseback chasing the calf\nthis way and that and trampling down the corn. Each time the calf was\nabout to come out of the corn some one rode up and the calf got\nfrightened and ran back again, the men after it. In the road stood a\nwoman, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cThey will chase my calf to death!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson said to the men, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing? Come out of the\ncorn and let the woman call to her calf.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe men did so. The woman came up to the edge of the field and called to\nthe calf, who pricked up its ears, listening awhile, then it ran towards\nher and buried its nose in her skirts, nearly knocking her down. The men\nwere glad, and the woman was glad, and the calf, too, was glad.\n\nThe godson went on his way thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cI see that evil breeds evil. The\nmore people try to drive away evil, the more the evil grows, which shows\nthat it is impossible to drive out evil by evil. But how can one drive\nit out? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It is well that the calf obeyed its mistress; if\nit had not done so, how should we have got it out of the corn?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson wondered and wondered, but could come to no decision and\nwent on further.\n\n\nVIII\n\nHe wandered and wandered till he came to a village where he asked to be\nallowed to stay the night at the first house. The mistress let him in.\nBesides herself no one was in the house. The mistress was busy\ncleaning.\n\nWhen the godson came in he climbed on to the stove and began watching to\nsee what the mistress was doing. She had finished cleaning the floor and\nwas scrubbing the table. She scrubbed it and wiped it with a dirty\ncloth. She rubbed the cloth one way, but the table would not come clean.\nThe cloth left streaks of dirt. She rubbed it the other way--the first\nstreaks came out, new ones were made. She rubbed it lengthwise again and\nthe same thing happened. The dirty cloth rubbed out one streak of dirt\nand left another. The godson watched for some time and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nare you doing, mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see that I\xe2\x80\x99m cleaning the house for the festival? I can\xe2\x80\x99t get\nthe table clean, anyhow. The dirt will not come off and I\xe2\x80\x99m quite worn\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should rinse out the cloth, then wipe the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe mistress did as he told her and the table came clean. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor your lesson.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the morning the godson took leave of the mistress and went on\nfurther. He wandered and wandered till he came to a wood where he saw\nsome peasants making hoops. He approached them and saw them struggling\nand struggling, but they could not bend the wood. He looked closer and\nsaw that the block on which they were working was not firmly fixed. And\nthe godson said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing, brothers?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaking hoops, as you see. We have steamed the wood twice, yet cannot\nbend it. We are quite worn out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should fix the block more firmly, mates. It moves round with you as\nit is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe peasants did so and their work went smoothly afterwards.\n\nThe godson stayed the night with them, then went on his way. He walked\nthe whole of that day and the night and just before daybreak he came\nupon some shepherds encamped for the night, and joined them. They had\nsettled their cattle and were trying to light a fire. They took some dry\ntwigs and lighted them, and not giving them time to burn up, they put\nsome damp brushwood on top and smothered the fire. The shepherds took\nsome more dry twigs and lighted them, and again they smothered the fire\nwith damp brushwood. For a long time they struggled, but could get no\nfire.\n\nAnd the godson said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be in such a hurry to put on the brushwood,\nbut wait until the twigs have caught well. When the fire gets hot then\nyou can put on the brushwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe shepherds did as he told them. When the twigs had caught well, they\nput on the brushwood, and in a few minutes they had a blazing fire.\n\nThe godson stayed with them for a while then went on further. He\nwondered what these three things he had seen might mean, but could not\nunderstand, nor see the reason of them.\n\n\nIX\n\nThe godson wandered and wandered until nightfall, when he came to a\nwood, and in the wood was a cell. He went up to the cell and knocked at\nthe door.\n\nA voice from within asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great sinner. I have come to atone for the sins of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the hermit asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are these sins you have taken upon\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson told him everything about his godfather and the\nmother-bear and the cubs and about the throne in the sealed room, and\nabout his godfather\xe2\x80\x99s commands, and about the peasants who had trampled\nthe corn in the field, and the calf that had come to its mistress at her\ncall.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you cannot drive out evil by evil, but I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how it can be driven out and I want you to tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the hermit said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what else you have seen on the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson told him about the woman and how she had tried to clean the\ntable, and of the peasants who had tried to make the hoops, and the\nshepherds who had tried to light a fire.\n\nThe hermit waited until he had finished, then he went into his cell and\nbrought out a jagged axe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe hermit walked away from the cell and pointed to a tree. \xe2\x80\x9cCut it\ndown,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe godson felled it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChop it into three parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson chopped it into three parts. The hermit again went into his\ncell and brought out a light.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet fire to those three logs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe godson made a fire and burnt the three logs till only three pieces\nof charcoal were left.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow plant them half into the ground, like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson planted them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see a river there by that hill? Fetch some water in your mouth\nand water them. Water this one in the way you taught the woman to clean,\nthis one in the way you taught the hoopers, and this one in the way you\ntaught the shepherds. When the three pieces of charcoal grow into\napple-trees you will know how to rid the world of evil, and will then\nhave atoned for your sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith these words the hermit went into his cell. The godson pondered and\npondered and could not understand what the hermit had said, but he did\nwhat the hermit had told him.\n\n\nX\n\nThe godson went to the river, filled his mouth with water and watered\none piece of charcoal; then he went again and again, until he had\nwatered the other two. The godson was tired and hungry. He went to the\nhermit\xe2\x80\x99s cell to ask for some food. When he opened the door there was\nthe hermit lying dead on a bench. The godson looked about the cell and\nfound some rusks, which he ate; then he discovered a spade and went out\nto dig a grave for the old man. By night he carried water to water the\npieces of charcoal, and by day he dug the grave. He had no sooner\nfinished it and was about to bury the hermit, when some people came from\nthe village to bring the hermit food.\n\nWhen the people heard that the hermit was dead they asked the godson to\ntake his place. They buried the hermit, left the bread with the godson\nand went away, promising to bring him more food later on.\n\nAnd the godson fell into the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s place and he lived and nourished\nhimself with the food people brought him, and went on watering the\npieces of charcoal as the hermit had bidden him do.\n\nThe godson lived thus for a year and many people began to visit him. He\ngrew famous throughout the country as a saint who saved his soul by\ncarrying water in his mouth from beneath a hill, and watering stumps of\ncharcoal. People flocked to him. Rich merchants brought him gifts, but\nthe godson used nothing but what he needed, giving the rest to the poor.\n\nAnd the godson began to live thus--for half the day he carried water in\nhis mouth to water the pieces of charcoal, for the other half he rested\nand received people.\n\nAnd the godson came to think that he had been told to live thus and that\nin this way he would atone for his sins.\n\nThe godson lived thus for another year, not missing a single day for\nwatering the charcoal, yet not a single piece had begun to sprout.\n\nOne day when he was sitting in his cell he heard a horseman gallop past,\nsinging to himself. The hermit came out to see what manner of man he\nwas. And he saw that the man was young and strong and was dressed in\nfine clothes and seated on a spirited horse.\n\nThe godson stopped him and asked him who he was and where he was going.\nThe man pulled up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a robber,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI roam the highway and kill whomever I have a\nmind to. The more men I kill the merrier are my songs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson was horrified and thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can one destroy evil in such\na man? It is well to talk to the people who come to me; they repent of\ntheir own accord, but this man glories in the evil he does.\xe2\x80\x9d The godson\nsaid nothing to him and turned away, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do? If this\nrobber makes up his mind to stay here, he will scare away my people and\nno one will come to see me. They will lose some good thereby, and I\nshall have nothing to live on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson stopped and said to the robber, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople come to me not to\nboast of the evil they do, but to repent and pray for their sins to be\nforgiven them. You repent likewise, if you have the fear of God in your\nheart, and if you do not seek repentance, go away from this place and do\nnot come back again, so as not to hinder me or scare away my people. If\nyou fail to listen to my words God will punish you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid of your God and I won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to you. You are not my\nmaster to order me about. You live by your piety, I by my robbery. We\nmust all live. Teach the women who come to you, but let me alone. Since\nyou have dared to mention the name of God to me I will kill two extra\npeople to-morrow. I would kill you now, only I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to soil my\nhands, but take care never to cross my path again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber threatened him thus and rode away. He did not come again and\nthe godson lived in the hermitage as before for another eight years.\n\n\nXI\n\nOne night the godson set out to water his pieces of charcoal and when he\nhad finished he sat down in his cell to rest. He peered along the path\nnow and again to see if any visitor was coming, but no one came that\nday. The godson sat alone until evening and he grew lonesome and weary\nand began to think about his life. He recollected how the robber had\nreproached him for living by his piety. He began to look back upon his\nlife. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not living as the hermit told me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThe hermit\nimposed a penance on me and I have used it as a means of earning my\nbread and even gaining fame thereby. I have been so led astray over it\nthat I am even dull when people do not come to see me, and when they do\ncome, I rejoice when they praise my saintliness. This is not the way one\nmust live. I have been blinded by fame. Not only have I not atoned for\npast sins but have taken new ones upon myself. I will go away to\nanother place far into the wood, where the people will not find me, and\nI will live alone there and atone for my past sins, taking care not to\ncommit new ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThinking thus the godson took a bag of rusks and a spade, and he left\nthe cell and set out down a ravine to build himself a mud hut in the\nthicket and disappear from people\xe2\x80\x99s sight.\n\nThe godson was walking along with his bag and spade when the robber\njumped out upon him. The godson was afraid and would have run away, but\nthe robber stopped him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nThe godson told him that he wanted to go away from people and bury\nhimself in a wild part of the wood where no one would come to him.\n\nThe robber wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what will you live on if no one comes to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson had not thought of that, but now the robber had mentioned it\nhe remembered that he had to eat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what God gives,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe robber made no reply and went his way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say anything to him about his life?\xe2\x80\x9d the godson thought.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may be repentant now. He seemed softer of manner and did not\nthreaten to kill me to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d And he called to the robber saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\ntime you repented. You cannot get away from God.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber turned his horse round, seized a knife from his girdle and\nbrandished it aloft. The godson took fright and ran away into the wood.\n\nThe robber did not trouble to go after him, he merely said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have let\nyou off twice, old man; take care not to come my way a third time, or\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith these words the robber rode away.\n\nThat evening the godson went to water his pieces of charcoal and behold!\none of the pieces had sprouted! A young apple-tree had shot forth.\n\n\nXII\n\nThe godson hid himself from the eyes of men and began to live alone.\nHis rusks were all gone. \xe2\x80\x9cI must hunt for some roots,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, but\nhe had no sooner gone out than he saw a bag of rusks hanging on the\nbranch of a tree. He took the bag and began to eat.\n\nWhen that was all gone he found another bag in the very same place. Thus\nthe godson lived. He had only one care--his fear of the robber. When he\nheard him coming he hid himself, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he kills me I shall not\nbe able to atone for my sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother ten years passed. One apple-tree grew up, the other pieces of\ncharcoal remained as they were before.\n\nOne day the godson went out early to do his watering. He moistened the\nsoil around the stumps until he was tired and sat down to rest. As he\nrested he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI have sinned greatly in fearing death. If it be\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s will I will atone for my sins by death even.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe thought had no sooner occurred to him than he heard the robber come\nalong cursing at some one. And the godson thought, \xe2\x80\x9cBesides God no one\ncan do me either good or evil.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went to meet the robber. He saw\nthat the robber was not alone. On the saddle, behind him, was another\nman, and this man\xe2\x80\x99s hands were bound and his mouth was gagged. The man\nmade no sound and the robber kept on abusing him. The godson approached\nthe robber and stopped before his horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you taking this man to?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInto the wood. He is a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s son and won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me where his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s money is hidden. I will keep him prisoner until he tells me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber was about to go on, but the godson would not let him, seizing\nthe horse by the bridle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the man go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe robber grew angry and raised his arm to strike him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to share his fate? I told you I would kill you. Let go!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson was not afraid.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t let go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of you; I only fear God. He\ntells me not to let go. Set the man free.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber frowned; he seized the knife from his girdle, cut the cords\nand released the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe gone, the two of you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t come across my path a\nsecond time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe merchant\xe2\x80\x99s son fled. The robber was about to go, but the godson\nstopped him and once more beseeched him to abandon his wicked life. The\nrobber stood and listened without saying a word, then turned and rode\naway.\n\nIn the morning the godson went to water his pieces of charcoal. Behold!\nanother one had burst forth, another apple-tree had grown!\n\n\nXIII\n\nTen more years passed. The godson lived desiring nothing, afraid of\nnothing, and a feeling of gladness always at his heart. And he thought\none day, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat blessings the good Lord gives us! And we torment\nourselves for nothing. People should live in joy and happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\nremembered the evil men suffered and how they tormented themselves and\nhe grew to pity them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is in vain that I live as I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought;\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go among people and tell them what I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe thought had no sooner occurred to him than he heard the robber come\nalong, but he took no notice of him, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the use of\ntalking to that man? He will not understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis was his first thought, but in a little while he repented of it and\nwent out in the road. The robber sat on his horse, frowning and looking\nat the ground. When the godson saw him, a feeling of pity came over him;\nhe rushed up and seized the robber\xe2\x80\x99s knee.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctake pity on your soul! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that\nthe spirit of God is in you? You torment yourself and others, and as\ntime goes on your torments will grow worse, and God loves you and wants\nto heap His blessings upon you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t destroy yourself, brother; change\nyour way of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber frowned and turned away. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe godson clutched the robber\xe2\x80\x99s knee still firmer and the tears stood\nin his eyes. The robber raised his eyes to his, gazed into them for a\nlong time, then climbed down from his horse and fell on his knees before\nthe godson.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have subdued me, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor twenty years I struggled\nagainst you, but you have won. I am powerless before you. Do what you\nwant with me. When you spoke to me the first time, I grew more hardened\nstill. I only began to take your words to heart when you went away from\npeople and I knew that you needed nothing from them. It was then I began\nto supply you with rusks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson recollected that the woman had only managed to clean the\ntable after she had washed the cloth. When he ceased to care for himself\nand cleansed his heart, he was able to cleanse the hearts of others.\n\nAnd the robber continued, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my heart turned when I saw that you had\nno fear of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson remembered that the hoopers began to bend the hoops only\nwhen they had made the block firm. When he ceased to fear death and\nestablished his life firmly in God he had been able to subdue this man\xe2\x80\x99s\nwild heart.\n\nAnd the robber said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the heart in me melted altogether when I saw\nthat you pitied me and wept before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson rejoiced. He led the robber to the place where his pieces of\ncharcoal were planted and behold! a third apple-tree had grown. And the\ngodson remembered that when the shepherds had allowed their dry twigs to\ncatch well, a big fire blazed up. It was only when his heart grew warm\nthat he had been able to kindle the heart of another.\n\nAnd the godson rejoiced that he had now atoned for all his sins.\n\nHe told the robber everything and died. The robber buried him and began\nto live as the godson had told him, and to teach other men what he knew.\n\n                          Printed in England\n       by Butler & Tanner Selwood Printing Works Frome, Somerset\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    e-text transcriber note:\n\n    Information was cropped off when the book used as a scan\n    source was rebound.

Simon the Warrior earned a high rank for himself and an estate and\nmarried a nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. He had a large income and a large estate,\nbut he could never make both ends meet, for, what he managed to gather\nin, his wife managed to squander; thus it was that he never had any\nmoney.\n\nAnd Simon the Warrior went to his estate one day to collect his income,\nand his steward said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to squeeze money out of;\nwe have neither cattle, nor implements, nor horses, nor cows, nor\nploughs, nor harrows; we must get all these things first, then there\nwill be an income.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen Simon the Warrior went to his father and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are rich,\nfather; and have given me nothing, let me have a third of your\npossessions and I will set up my estate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I? You have brought nothing to the\nhome. It would be unfair to Ivan and the girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Simon said, \xe2\x80\x9cIvan is a fool and Malania is deaf and dumb; they do\nnot need much, surely.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIvan shall decide,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man said.\n\nAnd Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind; let him take what he wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimon took a portion of his father\xe2\x80\x99s goods and moved them to his\nestate, and once more he set out to serve the King.\n\nTaras the Pot-bellied made a great deal of money and married a\nmerchant\xe2\x80\x99s widow, but still, it seemed to him that he had not enough, so\nhe too went to his father and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me my portion, father.\xe2\x80\x9d And\nthe old man was loath to give Taras his portion, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\nbrought us nothing; everything in the home has been earned by Ivan; it\nwould be unfair to him and the girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Taras said, \xe2\x80\x9cIvan is a fool, what does he need? He cannot marry, for\nno one would have him, and the girl is deaf and dumb and does not need\nmuch either.\xe2\x80\x9d And turning to Ivan, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me have half the corn,\nIvan. I will not take any implements, and as for the cattle, I only want\nthe grey cob; he is of no use to you for the plough.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall have what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Taras was given his portion, and he carted the corn off to the town\nand took away the grey cob, and Ivan was left with only the old mare to\nwork the farm and support his father and mother.\n\n\nII\n\nThe old Devil was annoyed that the three brothers had not quarrelled\nover the matter and had parted in peace. He summoned three little\nDevilkins.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are three brothers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cSimon the Warrior, Taras the\nPot-bellied, and Ivan the Fool. I want them all to quarrel and they live\nin peace and goodwill. It is the Fool\xe2\x80\x99s fault. Go to these three\nbrothers, the three of you, and confound them so that they will scratch\nout each others\xe2\x80\x99 eyes. Do you think you can do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will ruin them first,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9cso that they have nothing to eat,\nthen we will put them all together and they will begin to fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you know your work,\xe2\x80\x9d the old Devil said. \xe2\x80\x9cGo then, and do not\nreturn to me until you have confounded the whole three, or else I will\nskin you alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkins set out to a bog to confer on the matter, and they\nargued and argued, for each wanted the easiest work, and they decided to\ncast lots and each to take the brother that fell to him, and whichever\nfinished his work first was to help the others. And the Devilkins cast\nlots and fixed a day when they should meet again in the bog, in order to\nfind out who had finished his work and who was in need of help.\n\nThe day arrived and the Devilkins gathered together in the bog. They\nbegan to discuss their work. The first to give his account was the one\nwho had undertaken Simon the Warrior. \xe2\x80\x9cMy work is progressing well,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow Simon will return to his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you manage it?\xe2\x80\x9d the others asked him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI gave Simon so much courage that he promised\nthe King to conquer the whole world. And the King made him the head of\nhis army and sent him to make war on the King of India. That same night\nI damped the powder of Simon\xe2\x80\x99s troops and I went to the King of India\nand made him numberless soldiers out of straw. And when Simon saw\nhimself surrounded by the straw soldiers, a fear came upon him and he\nordered the guns to fire, but the guns and cannon would not go off. And\nSimon\xe2\x80\x99s troops were terrified and ran away like sheep, and the King of\nIndia defeated them. Simon was disgraced. He was deprived of his rank\nand estate and to-morrow he is to be executed. I have only one day left\nin which to get him out of the dungeon and help him to escape home.\nTo-morrow I shall have finished with him, so I want you to tell me which\nof you two is in need of help.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen the second Devilkin began to tell of his work with Taras. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not\nwant help,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cmy work is also going well. Taras will not live in\nthe town another week. The first thing I did was to make his belly grow\nbigger and fill him with greed. He is now so greedy for other people\xe2\x80\x99s\ngoods that whatever he sees he must buy. He has bought up everything he\ncould lay his eyes on, and spent all his money, and is still buying with\nborrowed money. He has taken so much upon himself, and become so\nentangled that he will never pull himself out. In a week he will have to\nrepay the borrowed money, and I will turn his wares into manure so that\nhe cannot repay, then he will go to his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is your work getting on?\xe2\x80\x9d they asked the third Devilkin about\nIvan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy work is going badly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing I did was to spit\ninto Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s jug of kvas to give him a stomach-ache and then I went into\nhis fields and made the soil as hard as stones so that he could not move\nit. I thought he would not plough it, but the fool came with his plough\nand began to pull. His stomach-ache made him groan, yet still he went on\nploughing. I broke one plough for him and he went home and repaired\nanother, and again persisted in his work. I crawled beneath the ground\nand clutched hold of his ploughshares, but I could not hold them--he\npressed upon the plough so hard, and the shares were sharp and cut my\nhands. He has finished it all but one strip. You must come and help me,\nmates, for singly we shall never get the better of him, and all our\nlabour will be wasted. If the fool keeps on tilling his land, the other\ntwo brothers will never know what need means, for he will feed them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe first Devilkin offered to come and help to-morrow when he had\ndisposed of Simon the Warrior, and with that the three Devilkins parted.\n\n\nIII\n\nIvan had ploughed all the fallow but one strip, and he went to finish\nthat. His stomach ached, yet he had to plough. He undid the harness\nropes, turned over the plough and set out to the fields. He drove one\nfurrow, but coming back, the ploughshares caught on something that\nseemed like a root.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange thing!\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were no roots here, yet\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s a root!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe put his hand into the furrow and clutched hold of something soft. He\npulled it out. It was a thing as black as a root and it moved. He looked\nclosely and saw that it was a live Devilkin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou horrid little wretch, you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan raised his hand to dash its head against the plough, but the\nDevilkin squealed, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t kill me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever you want me to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan scratched his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy stomach aches,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9ccan you make it well?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo it, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Devilkin bent down, rummaged about with his nails in the furrow and\npulled out three little roots, grown together.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cif any one swallows a single one of these roots all\npain will pass away from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took the three roots, separated them and swallowed one. His\nstomach-ache instantly left him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go now,\xe2\x80\x9d the Devilkin begged once more. \xe2\x80\x9cI will dive through the\nearth and never bother you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said; \xe2\x80\x9cgo, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the mention of God the Devilkin plunged into the ground like a stone\nthrown into water, and there was nothing but the hole left. Ivan thrust\nthe two remaining little roots into his cap and went on with his\nploughing. He finished the strip, turned over his plough and set off\nhome. He unharnessed and went into the house, and there was his brother,\nSimon the Warrior, sitting at table with his wife, having supper. His\nestate had been taken from him; he had escaped from prison and come back\nto live with his father.\n\nAs soon as Simon the Warrior saw Ivan, he said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI have come with\nmy wife to live with you; will you keep us both until I find another\nplace?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can live here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Ivan sat down by the table, the smell of him was displeasing to the\nlady and she said to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot sup together with a\nstinking peasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Simon the Warrior said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady says you do not smell sweet; you\nhad better eat in the passage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time for bed anyway, and I must feed the\nmare.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took some bread and his coat and went out for the night.\n\n\nIV\n\nThat night, having freed himself of Simon the Warrior, the first little\nDevilkin set out to seek Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s Devilkin, to help him plague the Fool as\nthey had agreed. He came to the fields, looked all round for his mate,\nbut he was nowhere to be seen; he only found a hole. \xe2\x80\x9cI see some\nmisfortune has happened to my mate; I must take his place. The ploughing\nis all finished; I must upset the Fool at the mowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin went to the meadow and flooded it and trampled the hay\nin the mud.\n\nIvan awoke at daybreak, put his scythe in order and set out to the\nmeadow to mow the hay. Ivan swung the scythe once, he swung it twice,\nbut the scythe grew blunt and would not cut; he had to sharpen it. Ivan\nstruggled and struggled and struggled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI must go home and bring a whetstone and a\nhunk of bread. If it takes me a week I\xe2\x80\x99ll not give up until I\xe2\x80\x99ve mowed\nit every bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin grew pensive when he heard these words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Fool has a temper,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t catch him this way; I must\nthink of something else.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan returned, sharpened his scythe and began to mow. The Devilkin crept\ninto the grass, caught hold of the scythe by the heel and pushed the\npoint into the ground. It was hard for Ivan, but he mowed all the grass,\nexcept a little piece in the swamp.\n\nThe Devilkin crept into the swamp, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cEven if I have to cut my\nhands I won\xe2\x80\x99t let him mow that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan came to the swamp. The grass was not thick, but the scythe could\nnot cut through it. Ivan grew angry and began to mow with all his might.\nThe Devilkin began to lose hold, seeing that he was in a bad plight,\nbut he had no time to get away and took refuge in a bush. Ivan swung the\nscythe near the bush and cut off half the Devilkin\xe2\x80\x99s tail. He finished\nmowing the grass, told the old maid to rake it up and went away to mow\nthe rye.\n\nHe came to the field with his sickle, but the Devilkin with the clipped\ntail was there before him. He had entangled the rye, so that the sickle\ncould not take it. Ivan went back for his reaping-hook and reaped the\nwhole field of rye. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must tackle the oats.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt these words the Devilkin with the clipped tail thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI did not\ntrip him up with the rye, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll do so with the oats. If only the\nmorrow would come!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the morning the Devilkin hurried off to the field of oats, but the\noats were all harvested. Ivan had reaped them overnight so that less of\nthe grain should be wasted. The Devilkin lost his temper at that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has mutilated and exhausted me, the fool! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had such\ntrouble on the battlefield even. The wretch doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep and you can\xe2\x80\x99t\nget ahead of him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll creep into the stacks of sheaves and rot the\ngrain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin crept into a stack of sheaves, and began to rot them.\nHe heated them, grew warm himself and fell asleep.\n\nIvan harnessed the mare and set out with his sister to gather in the\nsheaves. He stopped by the stack and began to throw the sheaves into the\ncart. He had thrown up two sheaves and was going to take up a third,\nwhen the fork dug into the Devilkin\xe2\x80\x99s back. He looked at the prongs and\nsaw a live Devilkin with his tail clipped, wriggling and writhing and\ntrying to get away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou horrid little wretch! You here again!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not the same one,\xe2\x80\x9d the Devilkin pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other was my brother.\nI belong to your brother Simon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever you are you shall share the same fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan was about to dash it against the cart, when the Devilkin cried out,\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpare me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll not worry you again, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever you want me\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make soldiers out of anything you choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can make them do anything you like. Soldiers can do everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan they play songs?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; make some, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin said, \xe2\x80\x9cTake a sheaf of rye and bump it upright on the\nground, saying,--\n\n    My slave bids you be a sheaf no more.\n    Every straw contained in you,\n    Must turn into a soldier true.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took the sheaf and banged it on the ground and repeated the\nDevilkin\xe2\x80\x99s words. And the sheaf burst asunder and every straw turned\ninto a soldier and at their head the drummer and bugler were playing.\nIvan laughed aloud.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was clever of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will amuse Malania.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go now,\xe2\x80\x9d the Devilkin begged.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall want to make the soldiers out of chaff so\nas not to waste the grain. Show me first how to turn the soldiers into a\nsheaf again, so that I can thrash it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin said, \xe2\x80\x9cRepeat the words--\n\n    My slave bids every soldier be a straw\n    And turn into a sheaf once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan repeated the Devilkin\xe2\x80\x99s words, and the soldiers turned into a sheaf\nagain.\n\nAnd again the Devilkin pleaded, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, taking him off the prongs. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the mention of God the Devilkin plunged into the ground like a stone\nthrown into water, and there was nothing but the hole left.\n\nWhen Ivan reached home, his other brother, Taras, and his wife were\nsitting at table and having supper. Taras could not pay his debts; he\nfled from his creditors and came home to his father. As soon as he saw\nIvan he said, \xe2\x80\x9cUntil I can make some more money, will you keep me and my\nwife?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can live here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took off his coat and sat down to table.\n\nAnd Taras\xe2\x80\x99 wife said, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot sup with a fool; he smells of sweat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaras the Pot-bellied said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not smell sweet, Ivan; go and eat in\nthe passage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s time for bed, anyhow, and I must feed the\nmare.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took his coat and a piece of bread, and went out.\n\n\nV\n\nThat night, having disposed of Taras, the third little Devilkin came to\nhelp his mates plague Ivan, as they had agreed. He came to the ploughed\nfield and looked and looked, but could see no one; he only found the\nhole. Then he went to the meadow and found a piece of tail in the swamp,\nand in the rye-stubble field he found another hole.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see some misfortune has happened to my mates. I must take their\nplaces and tackle the Fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Devilkin set out to find Ivan.\n\nIvan had finished his work in the fields and had gone into the copse to\ncut wood.\n\nThe brothers found it too crowded to live together in their father\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse and they ordered Ivan to fell timber to build themselves new\nhouses.\n\nThe Devilkin rushed into the wood and crept into the knots of the trees\nto prevent Ivan from felling them.\n\nIvan had cut a tree in the right way so that it should fall on to a\nclear space, but the tree seemed to be possessed, and fell over where it\nwas not wanted, and got entangled among the branches. Ivan lopped them\noff with his bill-hook and at last, with great difficulty, brought down\nthe tree. He began to fell another and the same thing was repeated. He\nstruggled and struggled and succeeded only after great exertion. He\nbegan on a third and the same thing happened. Ivan had intended to fell\nfifty trees at least, and he had not managed more than ten, and night\nwas coming on. Ivan was exhausted, and the steam rose from him and\nfloated through the wood like a mist; yet still he would not give up. He\nfelled another tree and his back began to ache so that he could not go\non. He stuck his axe into the trunk of a tree and sat down to rest.\n\nWhen the Devilkin realized that Ivan had ceased to work, he rejoiced.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is worn out at last,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cnow I can rest too.\xe2\x80\x9d And he sat\nhimself astride on a branch, exulting.\n\nIvan rose, took out his axe, flourished it aloft, and brought it down so\nheavily that the tree came down with a crash. The Devilkin had no time\nto disentangle his legs; the branch broke and pinned down his paw.\n\nIvan began to clear the tree and behold! there was a live Devilkin. Ivan\nwas amazed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou horrid little wretch! You here again!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not the same one,\xe2\x80\x9d the Devilkin said. \xe2\x80\x9cI belong to your brother\nTaras.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever you may be, you shall share the same fate.\xe2\x80\x9d And Ivan raised\nthe axe to bring it down on its head, but the Devilkin began to plead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t kill me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever you want me to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make as much money as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said; \xe2\x80\x9cmake it, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devilkin taught him what to do.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake some leaves from this oak and rub them in your hands and gold will\nfall to the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took the leaves and rubbed them in his hand and gold rained down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9con holidays it will amuse the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go,\xe2\x80\x9d the Devilkin begged.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, and taking up his axe, he freed the Devilkin\nof the branch. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the mention of God the Devilkin plunged into the ground like a stone\nthrown into water and there was nothing but the hole left.\n\n\nVI\n\nThe brothers built themselves houses and began to live apart. Ivan\nfinished his work in the fields, brewed some beer and invited his\nbrothers to a feast. The brothers did not accept his invitation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not go to feast with peasants,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\nIvan treated the peasants and the peasant-women and drank himself until\nhe got tipsy, and he went into the street and joined the dancers and\nsingers. He approached the women, and bade them sing his praises.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give you something you have never seen in your lives,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe women laughed and began to sing his praises, and when they had\nfinished, they said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, give us what you promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bring it in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, and he took his seed-basket\nand ran into the wood.\n\nThe women laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d they said, and forgot all about him,\nwhen behold! Ivan returned, his basket full of something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I share it out?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took up a handful of gold and threw it to the women. Heavens! The\nwomen rushed to pick it up, the peasants after them, snatching it out of\neach others\xe2\x80\x99 hands. One old woman was nearly killed in the fray.\n\nIvan laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fools!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you hurt Granny? If you are not so rough\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe scattered more gold. The whole village came up. Ivan emptied his\nbasket. The people asked for more, but he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNot now; another time\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you more. Now let us dance. You play some songs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe women began to play.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like your songs,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know any better ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see in a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan went into a barn, took up a sheaf, thrashed it, stood it up, and\nbanged it on the floor, and said--\n\n    My slave bids you be a sheaf no more.\n    Every straw contained in you\n    Must turn into a soldier true.\n\nAnd the sheaf burst asunder and turned into soldiers, and the drummers\nand buglers played at their head. Ivan asked the soldiers to play some\nsongs, and led them into the street. The people were amazed.\n\nWhen the soldiers had played their songs Ivan took them back into the\nbarn, forbidding any one to follow. He turned the soldiers into a sheaf\nagain and threw it on a pile of straw, then he went home and lay down to\nsleep in the stables.\n\n\nVII\n\nSimon the Warrior heard of these things next morning, and went to his\nbrother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere did you get the soldiers from, and where did\nyou take them to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatter, indeed! With soldiers one can do anything. One can conquer a\nkingdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally! Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me before?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will make you\nas many soldiers as you like. It is well Malania and I have threshed so\nmuch straw.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan took his brother to the barn and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, if I make the\nsoldiers you must take them away at once, for if we have to feed them\nthey will eat up the whole village in a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimon the Warrior promised to take the soldiers away, and Ivan began to\nmake them. He banged a sheaf on the threshing-floor and a company\nappeared. He banged another sheaf and a second company appeared. He made\nso many soldiers that they filled the whole field.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there enough now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nSimon was overjoyed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat will do, Ivan, thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. If you want more, come back and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make them for you.\nThere is plenty of straw this year.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSimon the Warrior soon put his troops in order, and went away to make\nwar.\n\nHe had no sooner gone than Taras the Pot-bellied came along. He, too,\nhad heard of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s affair and he said to his brother, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me\nwhere you get gold money from. If only I could get hold of some I could\nmake it bring in money from the whole world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me before? I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you as much as\nyou like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaras was overjoyed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be satisfied with three baskets full,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; come into the wood,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I had better harness\nthe mare, for you won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to carry it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey rode into the wood. Ivan began to rub the oak leaves, and made a\nheap of gold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it enough?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nTaras was overjoyed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will do for the present, thank you, Ivan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said; \xe2\x80\x9cif you want more, come back and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it\nfor you. There are plenty of leaves left.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaras the Pot-bellied gathered up a whole cartload of money, and went\noff to trade.\n\nBoth brothers had gone--Simon to make war and Taras to trade. And Simon\nthe Warrior conquered a kingdom, and Taras the Pot-bellied made much\nmoney in trade.\n\nWhen the two brothers met they told each other how they had come by\ntheir soldiers and money.\n\nSimon the Warrior said to his brother, \xe2\x80\x9cI have conquered a kingdom for\nmyself and live well, only I have not enough money to feed my soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Taras the Pot-bellied said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have made a heap of money, only\nunfortunately I have no one to guard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Simon the Warrior said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to our brother Ivan. I will ask\nhim to make more soldiers and give them to you to guard your money, and\nyou must ask him to make more money and give it to me to feed my\nsoldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd they came to Ivan.\n\nAnd Simon said, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t enough soldiers, brother. Will you make\nanother couple of sheaves for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan shook his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t make you any more soldiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you promised you would.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I promised, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t make any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, you fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause your soldiers killed a man. I will not let you have any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he was obstinate, and would not make any more soldiers.\n\nThen Taras the Pot-bellied asked Ivan the Fool to make him more golden\nmoney.\n\nIvan shook his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t make any more money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I promised, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t make any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, you fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause your money took a cow away from a woman in the village.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman had a cow. The children used to drink the milk, but the\nother day they came to beg a little milk of me. \xe2\x80\x98But where\xe2\x80\x99s your cow?\xe2\x80\x99\nI asked them, and they said, \xe2\x80\x98Taras\xe2\x80\x99 bailiff came and gave mother three\ngolden coins and she gave him the cow; now we have no milk to drink.\xe2\x80\x99 I\nthought you only wanted to play with the golden coins, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken\naway the cow from the children; I won\xe2\x80\x99t give you any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Fool was obstinate and kept to his word.\n\nAnd the brothers went away and deliberated over their difficult\nsituation in order to find a way out.\n\nSimon said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what we must do. You give me some of your money to\nfeed my soldiers, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you half my kingdom and soldiers to\nguard your money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaras agreed. The brothers divided their possessions, and both became\nkings and both were rich.\n\n\nVIII\n\nAnd Ivan lived at home, supporting his father and mother and working in\nthe fields with his deaf and dumb sister.\n\nOne day Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s yard-dog fell sick. He grew mangy, and was near dying.\nIvan pitied it. He took a piece of bread from his sister, put it in his\ncap, carried it out and threw it to the dog. The creases in his cap\nparted and out rolled one of the little roots with the bread. The dog\nate it up. As soon as it had swallowed the root it began to jump about\nand bark and play and wag its tail. It was quite well again.\n\nThe father and mother were amazed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you cure the dog?\xe2\x80\x9d they asked.\n\nAnd Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cI had two little roots that could cure any pain, and the\ndog swallowed one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt happened at the time that the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter fell ill, and the King\nproclaimed to every town and village that he would reward any man who\ncould cure her, and that if he were an unmarried man he should have her\nfor his wife. The news came to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s village.\n\nAnd the father and mother summoned Ivan and said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard\nof the King\xe2\x80\x99s promise? You told us you had a little root that could cure\nany sickness; go, cure the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, you will then be happy for\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Ivan prepared himself for the journey, and they dressed him in his\nbest clothes. When he came out on the doorstep he saw a beggar-woman\nwith a crippled hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard that you can cure the sick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCure my hand, for I\ncannot even put on my own shoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said. And he took the little root out of his cap, gave\nit to the beggar-woman and told her to swallow it. As soon as she\nswallowed it, she recovered, and began to wave her hand.\n\nThe father and mother came out to bid good-bye to Ivan, and they heard\nthat he had given away his last root and had nothing left with which to\ncure the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and they began to scold him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou pity a beggar-woman, yet have no pity for the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthey reproached him.\n\nBut Ivan was sorry for the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. He harnessed the mare, threw\nsome straw into the cart and got in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to, you fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo cure the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have nothing to cure her with now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and drove away.\n\nHe came to the King\xe2\x80\x99s palace, and as soon as he stepped over the\nthreshold the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter got well.\n\nThe King was overjoyed. He ordered Ivan to be brought to him, and\ndressed him in fine clothes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be my son-in-law,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said.\n\nAnd Ivan married the princess. Her father died soon after, and Ivan\nbecame King.\n\nAll three brothers were now kings.\n\n\nIX\n\nThe three brothers lived and reigned.\n\nThe elder brother Simon the Warrior lived well. With his straw soldiers\nhe gathered together real soldiers. Throughout the whole of his kingdom\nhe ordered a levy of one soldier for every ten houses, and each soldier\nhad to be tall and whole of body and clean of face. In this way he\ngathered many soldiers and trained them. If any one opposed him he sent\nhis soldiers off at once and imposed his will, and people began to fear\nhim. His life was a very goodly one. Whatever he saw and wanted was his.\nHe sent his soldiers and they brought him all he wanted.\n\nTaras the Pot-bellied also lived well. He did not lose the money Ivan\nhad given him, but increased it a hundredfold. He introduced law and\norder into his kingdom. He stowed his money away in coffers and levied\ntaxes on the people. There was a poll-tax, and tolls for walking and\ndriving, and a tax on shoes and stockings and frills. He got whatever he\nwanted. For money people brought him everything, and even worked for\nhim, for every one wanted money.\n\nIvan the Fool, too, did not live badly. As soon as his father-in-law was\ndead he took off his royal robes and gave them to his wife to stow away\nin a chest. And he put on his coarse linen shirt and breeches and\npeasant shoes and began to work once more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so dull for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got fat, lost my appetite and\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe brought his father and mother and sister to live with him, and began\nto work as of old.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are a king,\xe2\x80\x9d people remonstrated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven a king must eat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nOne of his ministers came to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no money to pay\nsalaries.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t pay them, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no one will serve us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter? They needn\xe2\x80\x99t. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have more time for work.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s the manure to cart; heaps of it lying about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen people came to Ivan for justice and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat man stole my\nmoney,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; he must have wanted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd all realized that Ivan was a fool. And his wife said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\nsay you are a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said.\n\nHis wife reflected awhile, but she was also a fool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I go against my husband?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the needle goes,\nthe thread follows.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo she took off her royal robes, put them away in a chest and went to\nMalania to learn to work. When she knew how, she began to help her\nhusband.\n\nAll the wise left Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom, and only the fools remained.\n\nNobody had money. They lived and worked, fed themselves and others.\n\n\nX\n\nThe old Devil waited and waited for news of the Devilkins. He was\nexpecting to hear that they had ruined the three brothers, but no news\ncame. He set out himself to find them. He searched and searched, and\nfound nothing but three holes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve not been able to manage it, evidently,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI must\ntackle the job myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe went to look for the brothers, but they were no longer in their old\nplaces. He found them in their different kingdoms. All three lived and\nreigned. The old Devil was annoyed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I can do!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nFirst of all he went to King Simon.\n\nHe did not go in his own shape, but disguised himself as a general. In\nthat guise he appeared before King Simon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard that you are a great warrior, King Simon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\nwell versed in these things and want to serve you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd King Simon began to ask him all manner of questions, and seeing that\nhe was a clever man, he took him into his service.\n\nThe new commander instructed King Simon how to collect a large army.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must get more soldiers. There are many idle\npeople in your kingdom. We must conscript all the young men without\nexception, then you will have an army five times as large as the one you\nhave now. Secondly, we must get new guns and cannons. I will get guns\nthat will fire a hundred bullets at one shot; they will rain out like\npeas. And I will get cannons that will consume with fire either man or\nhorse or wall; they will burn everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKing Simon listened to the new commander, and enrolled all the young men\nas soldiers and built new factories where he manufactured new guns and\ncannons, then he made war on a neighbouring king. As soon as he was\nfaced by the opposing army, King Simon ordered his soldiers to rain\nbullets against it and shoot fire from their cannons, in this way wiping\nout half the hostile troops. The neighbouring king was alarmed; he\nsurrendered and gave up his kingdom. King Simon rejoiced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will make war on the King of India.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the King of India heard of King Simon\xe2\x80\x99s doings. He adopted all his\nmethods, and invented some improvements of his own. He not only enrolled\nall the young men as soldiers, but the unmarried women as well, and in\nconsequence had a larger army than King Simon. And he made guns and\ncannons like King Simon\xe2\x80\x99s, and invented machines to fly in the air and\ndrop explosive bombs from above.\n\nAnd King Simon set out to make war on the King of India, thinking he\nwould beat him as easily as he had beaten the other king, but the scythe\nthat had cut so well had lost its edge. The King of India did not give\nSimon time to open fire, for he sent his women to fly in the air and\ndrop explosive bombs on Simon\xe2\x80\x99s troops. And the women rained down bombs\nfrom above like borax upon cockroaches and Simon\xe2\x80\x99s troops scattered and\nfled, and Simon was left alone.\n\nThe King of India took possession of Simon\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom, and Simon the\nWarrior escaped as best he could.\n\nHaving disposed of this brother, the old Devil went to King Taras.\n\nHe changed himself into a merchant and settled in Taras\xe2\x80\x99 kingdom, where\nhe opened establishments and began to circulate money freely. He paid\nhigh prices for everything, and the people flocked to him for the sake\nof the extra profit. And the people came to have so much money that they\nwere able to settle all their arrears and to pay their taxes at the\nproper time. King Taras rejoiced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks to the merchant,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI have more money than ever, and\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to live better than I used to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he began making all sorts of new plans, and decided to have a new\npalace built for himself. He proclaimed to the people that he wanted\ntimber and stone and labour, for which he was prepared to pay a high\nprice. King Taras thought that for his money people would flock to work\nfor him as of old. But lo! all the timber and stone was taken to the\nmerchant, and all the labourers flocked to work for him. King Taras\nraised his price, and the merchant raised his. King Taras had much\nmoney, but the merchant had more and beat the King. The King\xe2\x80\x99s palace\ncould not be built.\n\nKing Taras had arranged to make a new garden. When the autumn came he\nproclaimed that he wanted men to come and plant his garden, but no one\ncame, for the people were all digging for the merchant.\n\nWinter came. King Taras wanted to buy some sable skins for a new coat.\nHe sent a messenger to buy it, but the messenger returned empty-handed,\nand said that there were no sable skins, for the merchant had bought\nthem all at a higher price, and made himself a sable carpet.\n\nKing Taras wanted to buy some stallions. He sent a messenger, but the\nmessenger returned and said that the merchant had all the good\nstallions; they were carting water for him to make a pond.\n\nAnd the King\xe2\x80\x99s plans fell to pieces, for no one would work for him. All\nworked for the merchant, and only brought him the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s money to\npay the taxes.\n\nAnd the King came to have so much money that he did not know where to\nput it all, but he lived badly. The King gave up making plans; he would\nhave been contented to live quietly somehow, but even that was\ndifficult. He was hampered on all sides. His cook and coachman and\nservants left him to go to the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s. He even went short of food.\nWhen he sent to the market to buy some provisions there were none left,\nfor the merchant had bought up everything, and the people only brought\nthe King money for their taxes.\n\nKing Taras lost patience and banished the merchant from his kingdom. The\nmerchant settled on the very border, and did exactly the same as before,\nand for his money the people dragged everything away from the King and\nbrought it to the merchant. Life became very hard for the King. For\nwhole days he did not eat, and to make matters worse a rumour went\nabroad that the merchant had boasted that he would buy the King\nhimself. King Taras lost courage, and did not know what to do.\n\nSimon the Warrior came to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you support me? I have\nbeen beaten by the King of India.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKing Taras himself was in a sad plight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t eaten anything myself for two days,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\nXI\n\nHaving disposed of the two brothers, the old Devil went to Ivan. He\nchanged himself into a general and came to Ivan, and began to persuade\nhim to set up a large army.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA king should not live without an army,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me the power,\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll collect soldiers from among your people and organize an army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan listened to all he had to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9corganize one, then; only teach the soldiers to\nsing nice songs, for I like singing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old Devil went through Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom to collect a voluntary\narmy. To each recruit who should offer himself he promised a bottle of\nvodka and a red cap.\n\nThe fools laughed at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have plenty of drink,\xe2\x80\x9d they said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe brew it ourselves, and as for\ncaps, our women can make us any kind we like--embroidered ones and even\nones with fringes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd no one offered himself.\n\nThe old Devil went back to Ivan and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYour fools won\xe2\x80\x99t enlist of\ntheir own accord; we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to force them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; force them, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old Devil proclaimed throughout the kingdom that every man must\nenlist as a soldier, and if he fails to do so Ivan will have him put to\ndeath.\n\nThe fools came to the Devil and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell us that if we won\xe2\x80\x99t\nenlist as soldiers the King will have us put to death, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t say\nwhat will happen to us when we become soldiers. People say that soldiers\nare killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t get over that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen the fools heard this they kept to their decision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d sooner die at home since we have to die\nin either case.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fools you are!\xe2\x80\x9d the old Devil said. \xe2\x80\x9cA soldier may or may not be\nkilled, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go King Ivan will have you put to death for\ncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fools reflected over this; then went to Ivan the Fool and said, \xe2\x80\x9cA\ngeneral has appeared among us who orders us all to enlist as soldiers.\n\xe2\x80\x98If you go as a soldier,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98you may or you may not be killed,\nbut if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go, King Ivan will have you put to death for certain.\xe2\x80\x99\nIs it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I alone have you all put to death? Had I not been a fool I\nwould have explained it to you, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we won\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d the fools said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fools went to the general and refused to enlist as soldiers.\n\nThe old Devil saw that his plan would not work, so he went to the King\nof Tarakan and wormed himself into his favour.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9clet us go and make war on King Ivan. He has no money,\nbut grain and cattle and all manner of good things he has in abundance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King of Tarakan prepared to make war. He gathered together a large\narmy, repaired his guns and cannons and marched across the border on his\nway to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom.\n\nPeople came to Ivan and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe King of Tarakan is marching on us\nwith his army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; let him,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said.\n\nWhen the King of Tarakan crossed the border he sent his vanguard to find\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s troops. They searched and searched, but no troops were to be\nfound anywhere. Should they wait and see if they showed themselves? But\nthere was no sign of any troops and no one to fight with. The King of\nTarakan sent men to seize the villages. The soldiers came to one village\nand the fools--men and women alike--rushed out and stood gaping at them\nin wonder. The soldiers began to take away their corn and cattle and\nthe fools let them have what they wanted, making no resistance. The\nsoldiers went to another village and the same thing was repeated. And\nthey marched one day and another, and still the same thing happened.\nEverything was given up without any resistance and the fools even\ninvited the soldiers to stay with them. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you find it hard to live in\nyour parts, good fellows, come and settle with us altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d And the\nsoldiers marched from village to village and no troops were to be found\nanywhere; the people lived, fed themselves and others; no one offered\nany resistance and every one invited them to settle there.\n\nAnd the soldiers grew weary of the job and they went back to their King\nof Tarakan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t fight here,\xe2\x80\x9d they said; \xe2\x80\x9ctake us to another place. This is not\nwar; this is child\xe2\x80\x99s-play. We can\xe2\x80\x99t fight here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King of Tarakan grew angry. He ordered his soldiers to go over the\nwhole kingdom and lay waste the villages and burn the corn and kill the\ncattle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t do what I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will punish you all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers were frightened and began to carry out the King\xe2\x80\x99s commands.\nThey burnt the houses and corn and killed the cattle. The fools made no\nresistance, they only wept. The old men wept and the old women and the\nlittle children.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you treat us like this?\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you waste the good\nthings? If you want them, why not take them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the soldiers grew to loathe their work. They refused to go further\nand the troops dispersed.\n\n\nXII\n\nAnd the old Devil went away, having failed to bring Ivan to reason by\nmeans of the soldiers.\n\nThe old Devil changed himself into a clean gentleman and came to live in\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom, hoping to ruin Ivan by money, as he had done Taras.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to do you good and teach you common sense,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will\nbuild myself a house in your midst and open an establishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d the people said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can live here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe clean gentleman spent the night and in the morning he went out to\nthe square with a bag of gold and a bundle of papers and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou all\nlive like swine. I want to teach you how you ought to live. Build me a\nhouse according to this plan. You will work for me and I will teach you\nand pay you in golden money.\xe2\x80\x9d And he showed them the gold.\n\nThe fools marvelled. They had no money in circulation, but exchanged\nthing for thing, or paid by labour. And they began to exchange things\nwith the gentleman and to work for his golden coins. And the old Devil,\nas in Taras\xe2\x80\x99 kingdom, began to circulate gold, and people brought him\nthings and worked for him.\n\nThe old Devil rejoiced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last my plan is beginning to work!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI will ruin him as\nI ruined Taras, and will get him completely in my power.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fools collected the golden coins and gave them to the women to make\nthemselves necklaces and to the girls to plait into their hair; the\nchildren even played with the coins in the street. After a while every\none had enough and refused to take more. And the clean gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s house\nwas not half finished, and the corn and cattle had not yet been stored\nup for the year. And the gentleman invited people to come and work for\nhim to bring him corn and rear his cattle, offering to pay many golden\ncoins for everything brought and every piece of work done.\n\nBut no one would come and work, and no one would bring him anything,\nunless a chance boy or girl brought him an egg in exchange for a golden\ncoin; and no one else came and he was left without any food. And the\nclean gentleman was hungry and went through the village to buy himself\nsomething for dinner. He went into one house and offered a golden coin\nfor a chicken, but the mistress would not take it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have many such coins,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nHe went into another place to buy a salt herring, offering a golden\npiece. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want it, my good man,\xe2\x80\x9d the mistress said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no\nchildren to play with them, and have three of these pieces already as\ncuriosities.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe went into a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s for some bread. The peasant too would not take\nthe money.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you want the bread in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name,\nthen wait, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell my old woman to cut you some.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old Devil spat on the ground and fled from the peasant. To hear the\nword Christ was worse than a knife to him, let alone to take anything in\nHis name.\n\nAnd so he got no bread. All had gold; wherever the old Devil went no one\nwould give him anything for money, and every one said, \xe2\x80\x9cBring us\nsomething else instead, or come and work, or take it in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd the Devil had nothing to offer but money and had no liking for work,\nand he could not take anything in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name. He lost his temper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat more do you want when I offer you money?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can buy\nanything you like for gold and employ any kind of labour.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the fools did not heed him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t need money,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe exchange everything in kind and\nhave no taxes to pay; what good would it be to us?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old Devil went supperless to bed.\n\nThe story reached Ivan the Fool. People came to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nshall we do? A clean gentleman has appeared in our midst who likes to\neat and drink well, and dress in fine clothes, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t work and\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t take anything in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name; he only offers us golden coins.\nPeople gave him what he wanted until they had enough of these coins, and\nnow no one gives him anything. What are we to do with him? He may die of\nhunger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan listened to what they had to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be fed, certainly. Let him act as a shepherd to you all in\nturn.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSince there was no way out, the old Devil had to go about shepherding.\nHe went from house to house until it came to Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s turn. The old Devil\ncame in to dinner and the deaf and dumb girl was getting it ready. She\nhad often been deceived by lazy folk who came in early to dinner without\nhaving done their share of work and ate up all the porridge, so she\ninvented a means of finding out the sluggards by their hands. Those who\nhad horny hands were put at the table; the others were given the\nleavings. The old Devil sat down by the table, but the deaf and dumb\ngirl seized him by the hands and looked at them to see if they had any\nblisters, but they were clean and smooth and the finger nails were long.\nThe girl grunted and pulled the old Devil away from the table.\n\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s wife said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be offended, fine gentleman. My\nsister-in-law never lets any one sit at the table who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t horny\nhands. In good time, when the others have finished, you shall get what\nis left.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old Devil was hurt that in the King\xe2\x80\x99s house they should want to\nfeed him with the pigs. And he said to Ivan, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a stupid custom there\nis in your kingdom that all people must work with their hands! I\nsuppose you were too stupid to think of anything else. Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s\nonly with the hands people work? Do you know what wise men work with?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow are we fools to know; we work only with our hands\nand backs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is because you are fools. I will teach you how to work with the\nhead, then you will know that it is more profitable than to work with\nthe hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally! No wonder people call us fools!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old Devil said, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to work with the head. You\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t give me any dinner because my hands are smooth, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s a hundred times harder to work with the head. Sometimes one\xe2\x80\x99s\nhead nearly splits.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan grew thoughtful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you torture yourself so, my good man? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better\nto do the easier work with your hands and back?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Devil said, \xe2\x80\x9cI torture myself because I pity you fools. If I\nwere not to torture myself you would remain fools for ever. I have\nworked with the head and now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to teach you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeach us, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso that when our hands are tired we can work\nwith the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Devil promised to teach them.\n\nAnd Ivan proclaimed throughout his kingdom that a clean gentleman had\nappeared among them who would teach every one to work with his head and\nthat it was more profitable to work with the head than with the hands,\nand he bade every man come and hear him.\n\nThere was a high tower in Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom and a steep staircase leading\nup to it and there was a turret on the top. And Ivan took the gentleman\nup the tower, so that he might be seen by all.\n\nAnd the gentleman took his place on the top of the tower and began to\nspeak, and the fools flocked to look at him. They thought that the\ngentleman would really show them how to work with the head instead of\nthe hands, but he merely told them in words how they could live without\nworking at all. The fools did not understand him. They stared and\nstared, then went home to attend to their own affairs.\n\nThe old Devil stood on top of the tower one day and another, speaking\nall the time. He was hungry, but it never occurred to the fools to bring\nhim some bread up the tower. They thought that if he could work with the\nhead better than with the hands, he could easily make himself some\nbread. The old Devil stood on the tower for another day, still speaking.\nThe people came and stared at him for a while; then went their ways.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, has the gentleman begun to work with his head?\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet; he is still jabbering.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Devil stood on the tower for another day and began to grow faint. He\nswayed and knocked his head against a pillar. One of the fools saw him\nand told Ivan\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who hastened to Ivan at the ploughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say the gentleman has begun to work with\nhis head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and turning his horse round, he went to the tower.\nWhen he got there, the old Devil, who was quite faint with hunger by\nthis time, was staggering and knocking his head against the pillars, and\nwhen Ivan came up he fell with a crash down the stairs, counting each\nstep on the way with a knock of his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe clean gentleman spoke truly when he said that\nthe head splits sometimes. Blisters on the hands are nothing to this;\nafter such work there will be bumps on the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old Devil fell to the bottom of the stairs and thumped his head\nagainst the ground. Ivan was about to go up and see how much work he had\ndone, when suddenly the earth opened and the old Devil fell through.\nOnly a hole was left.\n\nIvan scratched his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou horrid wretch! One of those devils again! The father of the others,\nno doubt. What a huge one too!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIvan is living to this day and people flock to his kingdom. His own\nbrothers have come to him and he supports them. When any one comes and\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cFeed me,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan says, \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, you can live with us; we have\nplenty of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Only there is a special custom in his\nkingdom--whoever has horny hands comes to table; whoever has smooth ones\neats the leavings.\n\n[Illustration: WHERE THERE IS LOVE, THERE IS GOD ALSO.\n\n_To face page 56._]\n\n\n\n\nWHERE THERE IS LOVE, THERE IS GOD ALSO\n\n\nIn the town there was a shoemaker by the name of Martin, who lived in a\nbasement with a tiny little window looking out into the street. Martin\ncould see the people pass, and though he only got a glimpse of their\nfeet, he still knew every one, for Martin could recognize people by\ntheir boots. Martin had lived in that basement for many a long year and\nhad numbers of acquaintances. There were not many pairs of boots in the\nneighbourhood that had not been through his hands at least once or\ntwice--some for new soles, others for a patch or a stitch, or a second\ntime for new tops, perhaps. Martin had plenty of work, for he always did\nit well; he gave good leather, did not overcharge, and kept true to his\nword. If he could do a piece of work for the time it was required, he\ntook it; if not, he would not deceive his customers and told them so\nbeforehand. And all knew Martin and he had no lack of work.\n\nMartin had always been a good man, but as he grew older he began to\nthink the more about his soul and to draw nearer to God. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s wife\nhad died when he had still worked for a master, and he was left with a\nboy of three years old. Their children never survived; the eldest were\nall dead. At first Martin wanted to send his little son to a sister in\nthe country, but he felt sorry for the child, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be hard\nfor the poor boy to grow up in a strange family; I will keep him with\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Martin left his master and went into lodgings with his little son.\nBut God had not ordained Martin to be happy in his children. The boy had\nno sooner grown up and become a help and a comfort to his father than he\nfell sick, tossed about with fever for a week and died. Martin buried\nhis son and gave himself up to despair. His despair was so great that he\neven began to complain against God. Martin was so lonely that many were\nthe times he prayed to God to let him die, reproaching Him for having\nspared an old man like himself and taken his only beloved son. Martin\ngave up going to church.\n\nOne day an old countryman came to visit him, who had been on a\npilgrimage for eight years. Martin opened his heart to the old man and\ncomplained about his sorrow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no desire to live even,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI only want to die. That is\nall I pray to God about. I am a desperate man now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not well what you say, Martin; we\ncannot judge the ways of God; they are beyond our understanding. He has\njudged it fitting to take away your son and to let you live, so it must\nbe for the best. You despair because you want to live only for your own\npersonal pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what else should I live for?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked.\n\nAnd the old man said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must live for God, Martin. He gave you life\nand you must live for Him. When you begin to live for Him and cease to\nworry about anything, then all will become easy for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin was silent a while; then asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can one live for God?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old man said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must live for God as Christ taught us. You can\nread, can you not? Then buy the Gospels and read them and you will find\nout how to live for God. The Gospels tell us everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin took these words to heart. That very day he bought a copy of the\nNew Testament, printed in large type, and began to read it.\n\nMartin had intended to read only on holidays, but when he once began he\ngrew so light-hearted that he read every day. Sometimes he got so\nabsorbed in his reading that the oil in the lamp burnt low and still he\ncould not tear himself away.\n\nMartin read every evening, and the more he read the more clearly he\nunderstood what God required of him and how he was to live for God. And\nhis heart grew lighter than ever. At one time when he went to bed he\nwould sigh and moan and think of his boy; now he only said to himself,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlory to Thee, glory to Thee, God! Thy will be done!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd a change came into Martin\xe2\x80\x99s life. On holidays he used to hang about\nthe public-houses to drink a cup of tea and did not refuse vodka even\nwhen it came his way. He would drink, as it happened, with some\nacquaintance, and though not exactly drunk, would come out of the\npublic-house in an excited mood and speak vain words, giving back rough\nword for rough word.\n\nBut now this had all left him. His life became a peaceful and happy one.\n\nIn the morning he would sit down to his work and keep on for the\nnecessary time, then he would take the lamp off the wall, put it on the\ntable, fetch the Bible from a shelf, open it, and sit down to read. And\nthe more he read, the more he understood, and the serener and lighter\ngrew his heart.\n\nOne day Martin sat reading until late into the night. He was reading\nLuke\xe2\x80\x99s Gospel and had come to the sixth chapter and the verses, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nunto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also the other; and\nhim that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also. Give to\nevery man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask\nthem not again. And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to\nthem likewise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he also read the verses where our Lord says, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why call ye me,\nLord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? Whosoever cometh to me\nand heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is\nlike. He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid\nthe foundation on a rock; and when the flood arose, the stream beat\nvehemently upon that house, and could not shake it; for it was founded\nupon a rock. But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that\nwithout a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the\nstream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of\nthat house was great.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Martin read these words a feeling of joy entered his heart. He took\noff his spectacles, laid them on the Bible, then resting his elbows on\nthe table, he began to ponder over what he had read. He compared his own\nlife to the light of these words. \xe2\x80\x9cIs my house built on a rock or on\nsand?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIf on a rock it is well. It seems so easy when one\nsits alone here, and one thinks one has done all that God commands, but\nno sooner does one cease to be on one\xe2\x80\x99s guard than one falls into sin. I\nmust persevere; it brings such happiness! Help me, oh God!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith this thought in his mind, he was about to go to bed, but was loath\nto leave his Bible, and went on reading the seventh chapter. He read\nabout the centurion, the widow\xe2\x80\x99s son, and the answer to John\xe2\x80\x99s\ndisciples, and he came to the passage where a rich Pharisee invited the\nLord to his house; and about the woman who was a sinner and anointed His\nfeet and washed them with her tears, and how the Lord comforted her. And\nhe came to the forty-fourth verse and began to read the words, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\nturned to the woman and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I\nentered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she\nhath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her\nhead. Thou gavest me no kiss, but this woman since the time I came in,\nhath not ceased to kiss my feet; my head with oil thou didst not anoint,\nbut this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin read these verses and thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHe gave no water for His feet,\nand no kiss, and he did not anoint His head with oil.\xe2\x80\x9d Once more Martin\ntook off his spectacles and laid them on the Bible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been like me, that Pharisee. Like me he thought only of\nhimself--how to get a cup of tea, how to live in warmth and comfort. He\ncared only for himself, with never a thought about his guest. And the\nLord Himself was his guest! I wonder if I would act like that if He came\nto visit me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Martin rested his elbows on the table and his head on his hands and\nfell into a doze.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartin!\xe2\x80\x9d Some one suddenly breathed into his ear.\n\nMartin started. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, half asleep.\n\nHe turned and looked at the door, but no one was there. He called again\nand this time he heard a voice say clearly, \xe2\x80\x9cMartin! Martin! Look out\nfor me in the street to-morrow; I am coming to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin roused himself, got up from the chair and began to rub his eyes.\nHe did not know whether he had heard the words in a dream or when awake.\nHe turned out the lamp and went to bed.\n\nAt daybreak next morning Martin arose, lit the stove, prepared some soup\nand porridge, got the samovar ready, put on his apron and sat down at\nthe window to his work. As he worked he thought of what had happened\nyesterday. Now it seemed to him that he had heard the voice in his\ndreams, now that he had really heard it when awake.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings like that have happened before,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\nMartin sat at the window and did not work so much as peer out into the\nstreet, and when an unfamiliar pair of boots came along, he would stoop\ndown and look up to catch a glimpse of the person to whom they belonged.\nA yard-porter passed in new felt boots and a water-carrier; then an old\nsoldier of Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 reign came alongside the window, spade in hand.\nMartin recognized him by his felt boots. The old man was called Stepan\nand a merchant who lived near by kept him out of charity. His duties\nwere to help the yard-porter. He stopped opposite Martin\xe2\x80\x99s window to\nclear away the snow. Martin looked at him and again went on with his\nwork.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool I am getting in my old age,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin thought, amused at his\nown fancies. \xe2\x80\x9cStepan is shovelling away the snow and I thought it was\nChrist come to visit me. Old dotard that I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYet after a dozen stitches or so Martin was again drawn to the window.\nHe looked out and saw that Stepan had leaned his spade against the wall\nand was resting and trying to warm himself. The man was old and broken\nand had no strength even to clear away the snow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not give him a\ncup of tea while the samovar is still on the boil?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin thought. And\nhe put down his awl, rose, brought the samovar to the table, poured out\na cup of tea and tapped on the window. Stepan turned and came up. Martin\nbeckoned to him and went to open the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in and get warm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be quite frozen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrist save us! but my bones do ache,\xe2\x80\x9d Stepan said. Stepan came in,\nshook the snow off himself and began to wipe his boots so as not to\ndirty the floor, reeling as he did so.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bother to wipe your feet,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said; \xe2\x80\x9cI will wipe the floor\nafterwards; I am used to that. Come in and sit down. Here is a cup of\ntea.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Martin poured out two cups, gave one to his guest, poured some of\nhis own into a saucer and began to blow on it in order to cool it.\n\nStepan finished his cup, turned it upside down in the saucer, put the\nremaining bit of sugar on top and began to thank Martin, who could see\nthat the old man wanted some more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave another cup,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said and poured out more tea for his guest\nand for himself, and as he drank, he kept peering out of the window.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you expecting some one?\xe2\x80\x9d Stepan asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I hardly like to tell you whom I expect. But I wait and wait. A\ncertain word took possession of my heart. Was it a dream or not, I\ncannot tell. It was like this, brother; I was reading the Gospels last\nnight about Christ our Father and how He suffered on earth. You have\nheard tell of it, I daresay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Stepan said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we are ignorant folk and cannot read.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was reading how the Lord walked on earth, how He went to visit\na Pharisee who did not receive Him well. And I wondered, as I read, how\nany man could receive the Lord without due honour. \xe2\x80\x98Supposing such a\nthing were to happen to me,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought, \xe2\x80\x98what would I not do to receive\nHim? And the Pharisee did nothing!\xe2\x80\x99 Thinking thus I fell asleep, and as\nI slept I heard a voice call to me. I rose; the voice seemed to whisper\n\xe2\x80\x98Expect me; I am coming to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99 I heard it twice. Well, would you\nbelieve it? the idea took hold of my mind, and though I upbraid myself,\nI keep on expecting the Lord to come to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStepan shook his head, but made no remark. He finished his cup of tea\nand laid it down on its side in the saucer, but Martin took it up and\nfilled it again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some more, bless you! I was thinking, too, that our Lord despised\nno one when He walked on earth; He was mostly with common folk. He went\nabout with plain people and chose His disciples from men of our\nkind--simple workmen and sinners like ourselves. \xe2\x80\x98He who raises\nhimself,\xe2\x80\x99 He said, \xe2\x80\x98shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall\nbe raised. You call Me Lord,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and I will wash your feet. He\nwho would be first,\xe2\x80\x99 He said, \xe2\x80\x98let him be the servant of all, because,\xe2\x80\x99\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x98blessed are the poor, the humble, the meek, the merciful.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStepan forgot his tea. He was an old man and easily moved to tears; and\nas he listened the tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some more,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, but Stepan crossed himself, thanked\nMartin, pushed away his cup and rose.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you Martin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have nourished my body and my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are welcome another time. I shall always be pleased to see you;\ncome again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStepan went out; Martin poured himself out a last cup of tea, drank it,\ncleared away the dishes and sat down again by the window to work,\nstitching the back seam of a boot. As he stitched he peered out of the\nwindow to see if Christ was coming, and he kept on thinking of Him and\nHis doings and recalling His words.\n\nTwo soldiers passed; one in Government boots, the other in boots of his\nown; then the owner of the next house went by in clean goloshes, and a\nbaker with a basket. All these passed on; then a woman came up in\nwoollen stockings and coarse country shoes. She went by the window and\nstopped by the wall. Martin looked up and saw that she was a stranger,\npoorly clad, with a baby in her arms. She was standing with her back to\nthe wind, trying to wrap up the baby, but there was nothing to wrap it\nin. Her garments were summer ones and ragged, too. Through the window\nMartin heard the baby crying; the woman tried to comfort it but could\nnot.\n\nMartin rose and going out at the door and up the steps, he called to\nher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome this way, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman turned to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stand in the cold there with the baby; come inside in the warm;\nyou can make him more comfortable here. Come along!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman was surprised to see an old man in an apron and spectacles on\nhis nose inviting her to his room, but she followed him. They descended\nthe stairs and entered the room. Martin led her to the bed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit here, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is nearer to the stove; you\ncan warm yourself and feed the baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t any milk; I have eaten nothing myself since morning,\xe2\x80\x9d the\nwoman said, yet putting the child to the breast.\n\nMartin shook his head. He got some bread and a cup, opened the oven door\nand filled the cup with soup. He then took the porridge-pot out of the\noven, but the porridge was not quite done. He spread a cloth and put the\nsoup and bread on the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down and have something to eat, my dear. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look after the baby.\nI have had children of my own and know how to nurse them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman crossed herself, sat down by the table and began to eat, and\nMartin sat on the bed with the baby. He clucked and clucked, but having\nno teeth he could not do it well, and the baby would not stop its\ncrying. And Martin tried to amuse him with his finger. He poked the\nfinger straight at the baby\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, then drew it back again. He would\nnot let the child take the finger in its mouth because it was black with\ncobbler\xe2\x80\x99s wax. The child looked at the finger, stopped crying and began\nto laugh. Martin was pleased.\n\nAs the woman ate she told him about herself, saying who she was and\nwhere she was going.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is now eight months that my\nhusband has been taken away and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard a word from him. I had a\nplace as a cook when the child was born, but they would not keep me\nafter that. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been without a place for three months now and eaten\neverything I possessed. I wanted to go as a wet-nurse, but no one would\nhave me because they said I was too thin. I went to a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s wife\nwith whom our grandmother is in service and she promised to take me. I\nthought she meant at once, but she told me to come next week, and she\nlives a long way. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite worn out, and the baby is half-starved. If\nour landlady did not take pity on us, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how we should live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin sighed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you no warm clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I have warm clothes! I pawned my last shawl yesterday for\nsixpence!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman went up to the bed and took the child. Martin rummaged about\namong the things hanging on the wall and brought out an old coat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough it isn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a thing, it will do to wrap up in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe woman looked at the coat; then at the old man. She took the coat and\nburst into tears. Martin turned away, crawled under the bed and pulled\nout a box. He rummaged about in it and once more sat down facing the\nwoman.\n\nAnd the woman said, \xe2\x80\x9cChrist save you, Grandfather. It must have been He\nwho sent me to your window, otherwise the child and I would have been\nstarved to death. It was mild when I started, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very cold now.\nThe dear Lord made you look out of the window and caused you to pity\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin smiled and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe did make me, indeed! I was not gazing idly\nout of the window, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Martin told the woman his dream and how he had heard a voice and how\nthe voice had promised him that the Lord should come and visit him this\nday.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll things are possible,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said, and she rose, put on the\ncoat, wrapped the child in it and began to take her leave, thanking\nMartin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, thrusting a sixpence into her\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will do to take out your shawl.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe woman crossed herself, Martin did likewise, then accompanied her to\nthe door.\n\nWhen she had gone Martin ate some soup, cleared the table, and again sat\ndown to work. But he did not forget the window. As soon as a shadow fell\nacross it, he looked up to see who it was. Acquaintances passed and\nstrangers, and nothing particular happened. Suddenly Martin saw an old\napple-woman stop by his window. She was carrying a basket of apples. She\nmust have sold nearly all, for only a few remained. Over her shoulders\nwas a bag of chips and shavings, she had collected no doubt in\nhalf-finished houses, and was taking home. The bag made her shoulder\nache it seemed and she wanted to change it over to the other shoulder.\nShe let it down on the pavement, placed her basket of apples on a post\nand shook the bag. As she was doing so a boy in a ragged cap appeared\nfrom somewhere, snatched an apple out of the basket and was about to\nslip away when the old woman saw him and caught him by the sleeve. The\nboy struggled to get away, but the old woman held him fast with both\nhands. She had knocked off his cap and clutched him by the hair. The boy\nscreamed, the woman cursed. Martin did not wait to put the awl in its\nplace, but dropped it on the floor and rushed out at the door and\nstumbled up the stairs, dropping his spectacles on the way. He ran out\ninto the street. The old woman was pulling the boy by the hair, cursing\nand threatening to take him to the policeman; the boy struggled and\nresisted her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you strike me?\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t take\nanything!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin tried to part them; he took the boy by the hand and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\nhim go, Granny. Forgive him for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive him so that he won\xe2\x80\x99t forget it for a long time! I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\nthe rascal to the police-station!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMartin began to plead with her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him go, Granny; he won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again. Let him go for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s\nsake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman released the boy, who was about to run away when Martin\nstopped him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Granny to forgive you and don\xe2\x80\x99t do it again in future; I saw you\ntake the apple.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe boy burst into tears and begged the old woman to forgive him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, here\xe2\x80\x99s an apple for you,\xe2\x80\x9d and Martin took an apple from the\nbasket and gave it to the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for it, Granny,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t spoil the rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to give\nhim something he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget in a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Granny, Granny!\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is how we judge, but God does\nnot judge like that. If the boy is to be whipped for an apple what do\nyou suppose we deserve for our sins?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman was silent.\n\nAnd Martin told her the parable of the Lord who forgave his servant a\nlarge debt and how the servant then seized his own debtor by the throat.\nThe old woman listened; the boy, too, stood and listened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bade us forgive,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we may be forgiven. Forgive\nevery one, even a thoughtless boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman shook her head with a sigh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut boys get very spoilt nowadays.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we old folk must teach them better,\xe2\x80\x9d Martin said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I said,\xe2\x80\x9d the old woman replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI had seven of my\nown, but now I\xe2\x80\x99ve only a daughter left.\xe2\x80\x9d And the old woman began to tell\nhim where and how she lived with her daughter and how many grandchildren\nshe had. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m old now, yet still I work, for the\nsake of the grandchildren. And nice children they are, too. No one is so\nkind to me as they. The youngest won\xe2\x80\x99t leave me for any one. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nnothing but Granny dear, Granny darling all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman had quite softened by now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren will be children,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Martin in reference to the boy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord bless them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe was about to raise her bag on to her shoulder when the boy rushed up\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me carry it, Granny; I\xe2\x80\x99m going your way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old woman shook her head and put the bag on the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. And\nthey walked down the street side by side. The old woman had forgotten to\nask Martin to pay for the apple. Martin stood and watched them,\nlistening to their voices as they talked together.\n\nWhen they were out of sight he turned in, found his spectacles on the\nstairs quite whole, took up his awl and sat down to his work once more.\nAfter a while he could not see to pass the thread through the holes and\nhe noticed the lamplighter lighting the street lamps. \xe2\x80\x9cI must light up,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe thought. And he trimmed the lamp, hung it up and went on with his\nwork. He finished the boot he was doing and turned it over to examine\nit. He then put away his tools, cleared up the bits of leather and\nthread and awls, took down the lamp, put it on the table and took the\nBible down from the shelf. He wanted to open it at the place he had\nmarked with a piece of morocco, but it opened at another place. And as\nhe opened the Gospels Martin recalled his dream of last night. And no\nsooner had he thought of it than he seemed to hear some one move behind\nhim, as though some one were coming towards him. He turned, and it\nseemed to him that people were standing in the dark corner, but he could\nnot make out who they were. And a voice whispered into his ear, \xe2\x80\x9cMartin,\nMartin, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Martin asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said.\n\nAnd Stepan stepped out of the dark corner, smiling, and vanished like a\ncloud, and he was no more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said again, and from out the dark corner stepped\nthe woman with the baby, and she smiled and the child smiled, and they\ntoo vanished.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice once more, and out stepped the old woman and\nboy with an apple in his hand, and both smiled and also vanished.\n\nAnd a feeling of gladness entered Martin\xe2\x80\x99s soul. He crossed himself, put\non his spectacles and began to read the Gospel just where it had opened.\nAt the top of the page were the words, \xe2\x80\x9cFor I was an hungered, and ye\ngave me meat; I was thirsty and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger and\nye took me in....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd at the bottom of the page he read, \xe2\x80\x9cInasmuch as ye have done it unto\none of the least of these brethren, ye have done it unto me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Martin understood that his dream had come true and that his Saviour\nhad really come to him that day, and that he had welcomed Him.\n\n\n\n\nA PRISONER\n\n\nAn officer by the name of Jilin served in the army in the Caucasus.\n\nOne day he received a letter from home. It was from his mother, who\nwrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI am getting old now, and I want to see my beloved son before I\ndie. Come and say good-bye to me, and when you have buried me, with\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s grace, you can return to the Army. I have found a nice girl for\nyou to marry; she is clever and pretty, and has some property of her\nown. If you like her perhaps you will marry and settle down for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin pondered over the letter. It was true; his mother was really\nfailing fast, and it might be his only chance of seeing her alive. He\nwould go home, and if the girl was nice, he might even marry.\n\nHe went to his colonel and asked for leave, and bidding good-bye to his\n\n[Illustration: A PRISONER.\n\n_To face page_ 82.]\n\nfellow-officers, gave his men four bucketfuls of vodka as a farewell\ntreat, and got ready to go.\n\nThere was a war in the Caucasus at the time. The roads were not safe by\nday or by night. If a Russian ventured away from his fort, the Tartars\neither killed him or took him off to the hills. So it had been arranged\nthat a body of soldiers should march from fortress to fortress to convoy\nany person who wanted to travel. The soldiers marched in front and\nbehind; the travellers in between them.\n\nIt was summer. At daybreak the baggage-train was loaded behind the fort;\nthe convoy came out and started along the road. Jilin was on horseback;\nhis things were on a cart with the baggage-train.\n\nThey had about twenty miles to go. The baggage-train moved along slowly;\nnow the soldiers would stop, now a wheel came off a cart, now a horse\nwould refuse to go on, and then everybody had to wait.\n\nIt was already past noon and they had not covered half the distance. It\nwas hot, dusty, the sun scorching and no shade at all--bare steppe,\nwith not a tree or a bush the whole way.\n\nJilin rode on ahead and stopped to wait until the baggage-train should\ncatch him up. He heard the signal-horn sounded; the company had stopped\nagain. Jilin thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I go on alone without the soldiers?\nI have a good horse, and if I come across any Tartars I can easily\ngallop away. I wonder if it would be safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs he stood there thinking it over, another officer, by the name of\nKostilin, rode up with a rifle and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go on alone, Jilin. I\xe2\x80\x99m\ndreadfully hungry, and the heat\xe2\x80\x99s unbearable. My shirt is wringing wet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin was a big man and stout; his face was burning red, and the\nperspiration poured from his brow.\n\nJilin deliberated for a moment and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs your rifle loaded?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; come along. Only the condition is to be that we don\xe2\x80\x99t\npart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd they set off down the road alone. They were riding along the steppe\ntalking together and keeping a sharp look-out from side to side. They\ncould see a long way round them. When they left the steppe they came to\na road running down a valley between two hills. And Jilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s\ngo up on that hill and look about; some Tartars might easily spring out\nfrom the hills and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use?\xe2\x80\x9d Kostilin said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d better go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin paid no heed to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wait down here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go up and have a look.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd he turned his horse to the left up the hill. Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s horse was a\nhunter and carried him up the hill as though it had wings. He had bought\nit for a hundred roubles as a colt, and broken it in himself. When he\nreached the top of the hill he saw some thirty Tartars a few paces ahead\nof him. He turned hastily, but the Tartars had seen him and gave chase\ndown the hill, getting their rifles out as they went. Jilin bounded\ndown as fast as the horse\xe2\x80\x99s legs would carry him, crying out to\nKostilin, \xe2\x80\x9cGet your rifle ready!\xe2\x80\x9d And in thought he said to his horse,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet me out of this, my beauty; don\xe2\x80\x99t stumble, or I\xe2\x80\x99m lost. Once I reach\nthe rifle, they shan\xe2\x80\x99t take me alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Kostilin, instead of waiting when he saw the Tartars, set off full\ngallop in the direction of the fortress, lashing his horse now on one\nside, now on the other, and the horse\xe2\x80\x99s switching tail was all that\ncould be seen of him in the clouds of dust.\n\nJilin saw that it was all up with him. The rifle was gone; with a sword\nalone he could do nothing. He turned his horse in the direction of the\nconvoy, hoping to escape, but six Tartars rushed ahead to cut him off.\nHis horse was a good one, but theirs were better, and they were trying\nto cross his path. He wanted to turn in another direction, but his horse\ncould not pull up and dashed on straight towards the Tartars. A\nred-bearded Tartar on a grey horse caught Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He was yelling\nand showing his teeth and pointing his rifle at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what devils you are!\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you take me alive,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll put me in a pit and have me flogged. I\xe2\x80\x99ll not be taken alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Jilin was a little man, he was brave. He drew his sword and\ndashed at the red-bearded Tartar, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll either ride him down\nor kill him with my sword.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut he had no time to reach the Tartar; he was fired at from behind and\nhis horse was hit. It fell to the ground full weight, pinning Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s\nleg. He attempted to rise, but two evil-smelling Tartars were already\nsitting on him, twisting his arms behind him. He struggled, flung the\nTartars off, but three others leapt from their horses and fell on him,\nbeating him on the head with the butt ends of their rifles. A mist rose\nbefore his eyes and he staggered. The Tartars seized him, and taking\nspare girths from their saddles twisted his hands behind him and tied\nthem with a Tartar knot and dragged him to the saddle. They knocked off\nhis cap, pulled off his boots, searched him all over, took his money and\nwatch and tore his clothes. Jilin looked round at his horse. The poor\ncreature lay on its side just as it had fallen, struggling with its legs\nin the air and unable to get them to the ground. There was a hole in its\nhead from which the dark blood was oozing, laying the dust for a yard\naround.\n\nOne of the Tartars approached it and took off the saddle. As it was\nstill struggling, he drew a dagger and cut its windpipe. A whistling\nsound came from its throat; the horse gave a shudder and died.\n\nThe Tartars took off the saddle and strappings. The red-bearded Tartar\nmounted his horse, the others lifted Jilin into the saddle behind him,\nand, to prevent his falling off, they strapped him to the Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s\ngirdle, and took him off to the hills.\n\nJilin sat behind the Tartar, rocking from side to side, his face\ntouching the evil-smelling Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s back. All he could see was the\nman\xe2\x80\x99s broad back and sinewy neck, the closely-shaven bluish nape peeping\nout from beneath his cap. Jilin had a wound in his head, from which the\nblood poured and congealed over his eyes, but he could not shift his\nposition on the saddle, nor wipe off the blood. His arms were twisted so\nfar behind his back that his collar-bones ached. They rode over the\nhills for some time, then they came to a river which they forded and got\nout on to a road running down a valley. Jilin wanted to see where they\nwere going, but his eyes were matted with blood and he could not move.\n\nIt began to get dark; they forded another river and rode up a rocky\nhill; there was a smell of smoke and a barking of dogs. They had reached\na Tartar village. The Tartars got off their horses; the Tartar children\ngathered round Jilin, yelling and throwing stones at him. A Tartar drove\nthem away, took Jilin off the horse and called his servant. A man with\nhigh cheek-bones came up, clad in nothing but a shirt, and that so torn\nthat his breast was bare. The Tartar gave him some order. The man\nbrought some shackles, two blocks of oak with iron rings attached, and a\nclasp and lock was fixed to one of the rings.\n\nThey untied Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s arms, put on the shackles, took him to a shed,\npushed him in and locked the door. Jilin fell on to a dung heap. He\ngroped about in the darkness to find a softer place and lay down.\n\n\nII\n\nJilin did not sleep the whole of that night. The nights were short.\nThrough a chink he saw that it was getting light. He got up, made the\nchink a little bigger and peeped out.\n\nHe saw a road at the foot of a hill, to the right of which was a Tartar\nhut with two trees near it. A black dog lay on the threshold and a goat\nand kids were moving about and swishing their tails. Then he saw a young\nTartar woman coming from the direction of the hill. She wore a coloured\nblouse and trousers with a girdle round her waist, high boots on her\nfeet and a kerchief on her head, on which she was carrying a tin pitcher\nof water. Her back moved gracefully as she walked; she was leading a\nclosely-shaven Tartar boy, who wore nothing but a shirt. The Tartar\nwoman went into the hut with the water; the red-bearded Tartar of\nyesterday came out in a silken tunic, a silver-hilted knife stuck in his\ngirdle and slippers on bare feet. A high, black sheepskin cap was pushed\nfar back on his head. He stretched himself as he came out and stroked\nhis red beard. He gave some order to his servant and went away.\n\nThen two boys rode past. They had been to water their horses and the\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 noses were still wet. Some more closely-shaven boys came out,\ndressed only in shirts with no trousers. A whole group of them came up\nto the shed, and taking up a piece of stick, they thrust it through the\nchink. Jilin grunted at them and the boys ran off, yelling, their little\nwhite knees gleaming as they went.\n\nJilin was thirsty; his throat was parched. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only some one would\ncome,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. Soon the door of the shed opened and the red-bearded\nTartar entered with another, shorter than he, and dark. He had bright\nblack eyes, a ruddy complexion and a short beard. He had a jolly face,\nand was always laughing. This man was dressed better than the first, in\na blue silken tunic, trimmed with braid. The knife in his broad girdle\nwas of silver, the shoes on his feet were of red morocco, embroidered in\nsilver thread, and over these he wore a thicker pair of shoes. His cap\nwas high and of white sheepskin.\n\nThe red-bearded Tartar entered, muttering some angry words. He leant\nagainst the doorpost, playing with his dagger and looking askance at\nJilin, like a wolf. The dark man, quick and lively and moving as if on\nsprings, came up to Jilin and squatted down in front of him, showing his\nteeth. He clapped Jilin on the shoulder and began to jabber something in\nhis own language, blinking his eyes and clacking his tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cGood\nRuss! Good Russ!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nJilin understood nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cI am thirsty; give me some water,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe dark man laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cGood Russ!\xe2\x80\x9d he kept on saying.\n\nJilin made signs with his lips and hands that he wanted some water. The\ndark man laughed, and putting his head out at the door, he called to\nsome one \xe2\x80\x9cDina!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA little girl came up. She was about thirteen, slight and thin, her face\nresembling the dark man\xe2\x80\x99s. She was obviously his daughter. She, too, had\nbright, black eyes and a rosy complexion. She was clad in a long blue\nblouse with broad sleeves, and loose at the waist--the hem and front and\nsleeves were embroidered in red. She wore trousers and slippers and\nshoes with high heels over them; she had a necklace round her throat\nmade out of Russian coins. Her head was bare. Her black plait was tied\nwith a ribbon, the ends of which were trimmed with silver roubles.\n\nHer father said something to her. She ran away and came back again with\na tin jug of water. She gave it to Jilin and also squatted down in front\nof him, huddled up, so that her shoulders came lower than her knees. She\nsat staring at Jilin as he drank, as at some strange animal.\n\nJilin handed her back the jug. She took it and bounded out like a wild\ngoat. Even her father could not help laughing. He sent her off somewhere\nelse. She ran away with the jug and brought back some unleavened bread\non a round wooden platter, and huddling down in front of him once more,\nshe again stared at him open-eyed.\n\nThe Tartars went out and locked the door.\n\nAfter a while the red-bearded man\xe2\x80\x99s servant came up and called to Jilin.\nHe too, did not know Russian, only Jilin understood that he wanted him\nto go somewhere.\n\nJilin followed him limping, for the shackles impeded his walking. He\nfollowed the servant. They came to a Tartar village, consisting of\nabout ten houses, a Tartar church with a dome on top in the midst of\nthem. In front of one house stood three saddled horses; some boys were\nholding them by their bridles. The dark little Tartar rushed out of this\nhouse and beckoned to Jilin to come to him. He laughed, jabbered\nsomething in his own tongue and went in again. Jilin came to the house.\nThe room was large, the mud walls smoothly plastered. Near the front\nwall lay a pile of brightly coloured feather beds, on the side walls\nhung rich rugs with rifles and pistols and swords fastened to them, all\ninlaid in silver. At one wall was a small stove on a level with the\nearthen floor, which was beautifully clean. In the near corner a felt\ncarpet was spread on which were rich rugs and down cushions. On these\nrugs, in slippers only, sat some Tartars--the dark one, the red-bearded\none and three guests. All had down cushions at their backs. In front of\nthem, on a wooden platter, were some millet pancakes, some melted butter\nin a cup and a jug of Tartar beer. They took the pancakes up with their\nfingers, and their hands were all greasy with the butter.\n\nThe dark Tartar jumped up and bade Jilin sit down, not on the rugs, but\non the bare floor. Then he sat down on his rug again, and treated his\nguests to more pancakes and beer. The servant made Jilin sit down in the\nplace assigned to him, took off his overshoes, which he placed by the\ndoor where the other shoes were standing, and sat down on the felt\ncarpet, nearer to his master. He watched the others eating, his mouth\nwatering. When the Tartars had finished, a woman came in dressed like\nthe girl in trousers and a kerchief on her head. She cleared away the\nremains, and brought a basin and a narrow-necked jug of water. The\nTartars washed their hands, laid them together, fell on their knees and\nsaid their prayers in their own tongue. When they had finished one of\nthe guests turned to Jilin and addressed him in Russian.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were captured by Kasi-Mohammed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, indicating the\nred-bearded Tartar, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he has given you to Abdul-Murat.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\nindicated the dark Tartar. \xe2\x80\x9cAbdul-Murat is now your master.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin was silent.\n\nAbdul-Murat now began to speak, pointing at Jilin and laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nsoldier Russ, a good Russ,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nAnd the interpreter said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants you to write home asking your people\nto send a ransom for you. When the money comes, he will let you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin reflected and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow much does he want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tartars deliberated among themselves; the interpreter said, \xe2\x80\x9cThree\nthousand roubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t pay as much as that,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said.\n\nAbdul leapt up and began to gesticulate violently. He was saying\nsomething to Jilin, thinking that he would understand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much will you give?\xe2\x80\x9d the interpreter asked.\n\nAfter reflection Jilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cFive hundred roubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt this the Tartars all began talking together. Abdul shouted at the\nred-bearded Tartar, jabbering away till he foamed at the mouth. The\nred-bearded Tartar merely frowned and clacked his tongue.\n\nThey grew silent and the interpreter said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe master thinks a ransom\nof five hundred roubles is not enough. He himself paid two hundred\nroubles for you. Kasi-Mohammed was in his debt, and he took you in\npayment. He wants three thousand roubles and refuses to let you go for\nless. If you won\xe2\x80\x99t pay the money you\xe2\x80\x99ll be flung into a pit and\nflogged.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe more you show you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of them, the worse it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin\nthought. He leapt to his feet and said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell the dog that if he begins\nto threaten me, he shan\xe2\x80\x99t have a farthing! I won\xe2\x80\x99t write home at all! I\nwas never afraid of you, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be now, you dogs!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe interpreter conveyed his words, and again the Tartars began to speak\nall at once.\n\nThey jabbered for a long time, then the dark one sprang up and came to\nJilin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9c_djigit, djigit_ Russ!\xe2\x80\x9d (Djigit in their tongue means\nbrave.) He laughed and said a few words to the interpreter, who turned\nto Jilin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give a thousand roubles?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin stuck to his own.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t give more than five hundred, not if you kill me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tartars conferred together, and sent the servant off somewhere, and\nwhen he was gone they stared now at Jilin, now at the door.\n\nThe servant returned, followed by a stout, bare-footed man, in torn\nclothes. On his feet were also shackles. Jilin gave an exclamation of\nsurprise. It was Kostilin. He, too, had been captured then. The Tartars\nsat them down side by side, and they began to tell each other of their\nexperiences, the Tartars looking on in silence. Jilin told Kostilin what\nhad happened to him, and Kostilin told Jilin that his horse had got\ntired, his rifle missed fire, and that this same Abdul had caught him up\nand captured him.\n\nAbdul jumped up and began to speak, pointing at Kostilin. The\ninterpreter explained that they both belonged to the same master, and\nthat the one who would produce the money first would be the first to be\nset free.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how quiet your comrade is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Jilin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get angry and he\nhas written home asking to have five thousand roubles sent him. He will\nbe well fed, and no one will do him any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Jilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy comrade can do what he likes. He may be rich, and I\nam not. I won\xe2\x80\x99t go back on my word. You can kill me if you like, but you\nget no advantage by that; I won\xe2\x80\x99t write for more than five hundred\nroubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tartars were silent. Suddenly Abdul sprang up, took out a pen, ink\nand a scrap of paper from a little box, put them in Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s hands and\nslapping him on the shoulder, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWrite.\xe2\x80\x9d He had agreed to the five\nhundred roubles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said to the interpreter; \xe2\x80\x9ctell him that he must feed\nand clothe us well, and that he must put us together so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t\nfeel so lonely, and he must remove our shackles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked at Abdul as he spoke and smiled. Abdul too smiled and said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have the best of clothes--coats and boots fit to be married\nin, and you shall be fed like princes, and you can be together in the\nshed if you like, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t take off the shackles because you might\nescape. You shall have them removed at night.\xe2\x80\x9d He rushed up to Jilin and\nslapped him on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cFine fellow! fine fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nJilin wrote the letter, but did not address it correctly, so that it\nshould not reach home. \xe2\x80\x9cI will escape, somehow,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\nJilin and Kostilin were taken back to the shed. They were given some\nstraw, a jug of water and bread, two old coats and some worn boots,\nevidently taken from the bodies of dead soldiers. At night their\nshackles were removed and they were locked in the shed.\n\n\nIII\n\nThus Jilin and his comrade lived for a month. Their master was always\ncheerful. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, good fellow, Ivan! I, Abdul, good fellow, too!\xe2\x80\x9d But he\nfed them badly. All the food they got was some unleavened bread of\nmillet flour, or millet cakes, and sometimes nothing but raw dough.\n\nKostilin sent another letter home and did nothing but mope and wait for\nthe money to arrive. He would sit in the barn day after day, either\ncounting the days for the letter to come or sleeping. Jilin knew that\nhis letter would not reach home, but he never wrote another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere on earth could mother get so much money from?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\nlived mostly on what I used to send her, and if she has to procure five\nhundred roubles she\xe2\x80\x99ll be quite ruined. With God\xe2\x80\x99s help I\xe2\x80\x99ll get away\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo he kept his eyes open, planning how to run away.\n\nHe would walk about the village whistling, or doing something with his\nhands, such as modelling dolls out of clay, or plaiting baskets out of\ntwigs. Jilin was very clever with his hands.\n\nOne day he modelled a doll with a nose, arms and legs and in a Tartar\nshirt, and he put this doll on the roof of the shed. The Tartar girls\nwent to fetch water. The master\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Dina caught sight of the\ndoll, and called to the others. They put down their pitchers and looked\nup laughing. Jilin took down the doll and held it out to them. They\nlaughed, but dared not take it. He left the doll and went into the shed\nto see what would happen.\n\nDina ran up, looked about her, snatched up the doll and ran off with it.\n\nThe following morning, at daybreak, Dina came out on the threshold with\nthe doll. She had bedecked it in bits of red stuff, and was rocking it\nto and fro like a baby and singing a lullaby. An old woman came out and\nbegan to scold her. She snatched the doll away from the child and broke\nit, and sent Dina off to her work.\n\nJilin made another doll--a better one this time--and gave it to Dina.\n\nOne day Dina brought Jilin a jug, and sitting down, she looked up at\nhim, laughing and pointing to the jug.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is she so pleased about?\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought. He took up the jug to\nhave a drink, thinking it was full of water, but it turned out to be\nmilk. \xe2\x80\x9cHow nice!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and finished it. Dina was overjoyed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice, nice, Ivan!\xe2\x80\x9d She jumped up and clapped her hands in glee, then\nshe seized the jug and ran away.\n\nAfter that she brought Jilin milk in secret every day. When the Tartar\nwomen used to make cheese cakes out of goat\xe2\x80\x99s milk, which they baked on\nthe roof, she would steal some and bring them to him. Once the master\nkilled a sheep, and Dina brought Jilin a piece of the flesh hidden in\nher sleeve. She would throw the things down and run away.\n\nOne day there was a terrible storm; the rain poured down in torrents for\na whole hour. The rivers became turbid. At the ford, the water rose till\nit was seven feet high and the current was so strong that it moved the\nstones along. Rivulets flowed everywhere and there was a roar in the\nhills. After the storm streams flowed down the village everywhere.\nJilin asked his master for a knife, and with it he shaped a small\ncylinder and made a wheel out of a piece of board, to which he fixed two\ndolls, one on each side. The little girls brought him some bits of stuff\nwith which he dressed the dolls--one as a peasant, the other as a\npeasant woman. He made them fast and set the wheel so that the stream\nshould work it. When the wheel began to whirl the dolls danced.\n\nThe whole village gathered round--boys and girls and women and men came\nto look on, the latter clacking their tongues.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Russ! Ah, Ivan!\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\nAbdul had a Russian watch which was broken. He called Jilin and showed\nit to him. Jilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me and I\xe2\x80\x99ll mend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took it to pieces with the knife, sorted the pieces out, put them\ntogether again and the watch went quite well.\n\nThe master was pleased and presented him with one of his old tunics, all\nin holes. Jilin had to take it, besides, it would come in useful to\ncover up with at night.\n\nFrom that day Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s fame as a man skilled in handiworks spread fast.\nPeople began to flock to him from distant villages, one bringing the\nlock of a rifle or a pistol that wanted mending; another a watch or a\nclock. The master gave him some tools--pincers, gimlets and a file.\n\nOne day a Tartar fell ill, and they came to Jilin, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome and\nheal him.\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin did not know how to heal the sick, but he went just the\nsame thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cThe man will recover of his own accord.\xe2\x80\x9d He disappeared\ninto the shed and mixed up some sand and water. In the presence of the\nTartars he mumbled some words over the mixture, and gave it to the sick\nman to drink. Fortunately the Tartar got well.\n\nJilin began to understand a little of their tongue. Some of the Tartars\ngot quite used to him, and when they wanted him would call \xe2\x80\x9cIvan, Ivan!\xe2\x80\x9d\nOthers again looked at him askance as at some wild beast.\n\nThe red-bearded Tartar did not like Jilin. He frowned when he saw him,\nand either turned away or cursed. There was another old man, who did\nnot live in the village, but somewhere at the foot of a hill. He came to\nthe village only sometimes. Jilin saw him when the man went to the\nMosque to say his prayers. He was short and had a white towel wound\nround his cap. His beard and moustaches were clipped and white as down;\nhis face was wrinkled and brick-red. He had a hooked nose like a hawk\xe2\x80\x99s,\nand cruel grey eyes. He had no teeth, but two tusks in front. He would\npass with his turban on his head, leaning on his staff, and peering\nround like a wolf. When he saw Jilin he snorted and turned away.\n\nOne day Jilin went to the hills to find out where the old man lived. He\nstrolled down a path and saw a little garden and a stone wall; within\nthe stone wall were wild cherry trees and peaches and a hut with a flat\nroof. He came a little closer and saw some hives made of plaited straw\nand humming bees flying hither and thither. The old man was on his\nknees, doing something to the hives. Jilin stood on tiptoe in order to\nget a better view; his shackles rattled. The old man turned and gave a\nyell and pulling a pistol out of his belt he aimed at Jilin, who just\nmanaged to shield himself behind the stone wall.\n\nThe old man came to the master to complain. The master summoned Jilin\nand laughing, asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you go to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s place?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to do him any harm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI only wanted to see how\nhe lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe master conveyed his words to the old man.\n\nBut the old man was angry. He jabbered away, showing his tusks, and\nshook his fists menacingly at Jilin.\n\nJilin could not understand all he said, but he gathered that the old man\nwas warning the master not to keep any Russians about the place, but to\nhave them all killed.\n\nThe old man went away.\n\nJilin asked the master who the old man was, and the master said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\na great man! He was the bravest of us all, and killed many Russians,\nand he was rich, too. He had three wives and eight sons, who all lived\nin the same village. The Russians came, destroyed the village, and\nkilled seven of his sons. One son only remained, and he surrendered to\nthe Russians. The old man followed them, and also gave himself up. He\nlived with the Russians for three months, when he found his son. With\nhis own hand he killed him and escaped. After that he gave up fighting.\nHe went to Mecca to pray to God; that is why he wears a turban. Any man\nwho has been to Mecca is called a _Hadji_ and has to wear a turban. He\ndoes not like you Russians. He wanted me to kill you, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t kill\nyou because I paid money for you. Besides, I have taken a fancy to you,\nIvan; I would not let you go at all, if I had not given my word.\xe2\x80\x9d He\nlaughed and added in Russian, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a good fellow, Ivan, and I,\nAbdul, am a good fellow too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIV\n\nJilin lived in this way for a month. During the day he wandered about\nthe village or busied himself with some handicraft, and at night he dug\nin his shed. The digging was difficult because of the stones, but he\nworked away at them with his file and at last made a hole beneath the\nwall big enough to crawl through. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only I knew the neighbourhood well\nand which way to turn,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cthe Tartars would not tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe chose a day when the master was away, left the village after dinner\nand went up a hill, hoping to find out the lie of the land from there.\nBut before the master departed he told one of his boys to look after\nJilin and not let him out of his sight. The boy ran after Jilin, crying,\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go away! My father told you not to! I\xe2\x80\x99ll call for help!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin tried to soothe him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going far,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI only want to go to the top of that hill\nto find a certain herb with which to cure your people when they are\nsick. Come with me; I can\xe2\x80\x99t run away with the shackles on my feet. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nmake you a bow and some arrows to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter some persuasion the boy went with him. The hill did not seem very\nfar off, but it was difficult to get there shackled as he was. He\nstruggled and struggled until he got to the top. Jilin sat down and\nbegan to look about him. To the south, beyond the shed, a herd of horses\ncould be seen in a valley, and at the bottom of the valley was another\nvillage. Beyond the village was a steep hill and another hill beyond\nthat. Between the two hills was a dark patch that looked like a wood;\nhill upon hill rose beyond it, and higher than all rose the snow-capped\nmountains as white as sugar, the peak of one standing out above the\nrest. To the east and west were other such hills; here and there were\nvillages in the valleys from which the smoke curled up. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is all\nTartar country,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He looked in the direction of Russia--below\nwas a river, and the village he lived in, surrounded by gardens. On the\nriver bank, looking as tiny as dolls, sat Tartar women, washing clothes.\nBeyond the village was a hill, lower than the one to the south and\nbeyond that two wooded hills. Between these two hills was a plain and\naway in the distance on this plain smoke seemed to rise. Jilin tried to\nrecollect where the sun rose and set when he lived in the fort. He came\nto the conclusion that the fortress must lie in that very valley.\nBetween these two hills would he have to make his way when he escaped.\n\nThe sun began to set. The snow-clad mountains turned from white to red;\nthe dark mountains grew darker still; a vapour rose from the valley, and\nthe plain where he supposed the fortress to be seemed on fire with the\nsunset\xe2\x80\x99s glow. Jilin gazed intently; something seemed to quiver in that\nplain, like smoke rising from a chimney, and Jilin felt sure that the\nRussian fortress was there.\n\nIt was getting late. The Mullah\xe2\x80\x99s cry was heard. The flocks and herds\nwere driven home; the cows were lowing. The boy kept on begging \xe2\x80\x9cCome\nhome,\xe2\x80\x9d but Jilin had no desire to move.\n\nThey returned home. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that I know the place I must lose no time in\nrunning away,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought. He wanted to escape that very night, for\nthe nights were dark then; the moon had waned, but as luck would have\nit, the Tartars returned that evening. Sometimes when they brought\ncattle home they would come back in a jolly mood, but this time there\nwere no cattle, and on the saddle of his horse they brought back the\nred-bearded Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s brother who had been killed. They returned in a\ngloomy mood and gathered the village together for the burial. Jilin,\ntoo, came out to look on. They wrapped the body in a sheet and without a\ncoffin carried it out and laid it on the grass beneath some plane-trees.\nThe Mullah arrived and the old men; they wrapped towels around their\ncaps, took off their shoes, and squatted down on their heels before the\nbody. In front was the Mullah, behind him three old men in turbans, and\nbehind them three other Tartars. They sat silent, eyes downcast, for a\nlong time, then the Mullah raised his head and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAllah!\xe2\x80\x9d (meaning\nGod). After this word he again bowed his head, and there was another\nlong silence. They all sat motionless. Again the Mullah raised his head\nand said \xe2\x80\x9cAllah!\xe2\x80\x9d All repeated \xe2\x80\x9cAllah!\xe2\x80\x9d and again there was silence. The\ndead man lay on the grass motionless and the others, too, seemed dead.\nNot a single man moved. The only sound to be heard was the rustling of\nthe leaves on the plane-trees. After a while the Mullah said a prayer;\nall rose, and raising the dead man with their hands they carried him\naway. They brought him to a pit. It was not an ordinary pit, but\nhollowed out under the ground like a vault. They lifted the dead man\nunder the arms, bent him into a sitting posture and let him down into\nthe pit, gently, his hands folded in front of him.\n\nThe master\xe2\x80\x99s servant brought some green rushes which they stuffed into\nthe pit, then they hastily covered it with earth, levelled the ground\nproperly and placed a stone, upright, at the head of the grave. They\nstamped down the soil and once more sat down round the grave side by\nside. For a long time they were silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllah! Allah!\xe2\x80\x9d they sighed and rose.\n\nThe red-bearded Tartar gave some money to the old men, then he took a\nwhip, struck himself three times on the forehead and went home.\n\nIn the morning Jilin saw the red-bearded Tartar leading a mare out of\nthe village, followed by three other Tartars. When they left the village\nbehind them the red-bearded Tartar took off his coat, rolled up his\nsleeves--his arms were strong and muscular--and taking out a dagger, he\nsharpened it on a whetstone. The other Tartars raised the mare\xe2\x80\x99s head\nand he cut her throat. The mare dropped down and he began to skin her\nwith his big hands. Women and girls came up and washed the entrails. The\nmare was cut up and the pieces carried to the red Tartar\xe2\x80\x99s hut, where\nthe whole village gathered for a funeral feast.\n\nFor three days they ate the mare\xe2\x80\x99s flesh and drank beer in honour of the\ndead man. All the Tartars were at home. On the fourth day, about dinner\ntime, Jilin saw that they were preparing to go away somewhere. The\nhorses were brought out, they got ready, and about ten of the Tartars,\nthe red one among them, went away, Abdul remaining at home. There was a\nnew moon and the nights were still dark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night we must escape,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought, and he unfolded his plan to\nKostilin. But Kostilin was afraid.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can we run away? We don\xe2\x80\x99t know the way even.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get there in one night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we can\xe2\x80\x99t, we can hide in the wood. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some cakes here for us\nto eat. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of sitting here? If they send your ransom, well\nand good, but supposing they can\xe2\x80\x99t raise the money? The Tartars are\ngetting vicious because our people have killed one of their men. They\nwill probably kill us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin reflected.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; let us go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\nV\n\nJilin went down the hole and made it a little bigger so that Kostilin\ncould crawl through, then they sat down to wait till all grew quiet in\nthe village.\n\nWhen the Tartars had all retired to rest Jilin crawled under the wall\nand got outside. \xe2\x80\x9cFollow me,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to Kostilin.\n\nKostilin crept into the hole, but his foot hit against a stone and made\na clatter. The master had a speckled watch-dog--a vicious creature it\nwas, called Ulashin. The dog growled and rushed forward, followed by\nother dogs. Jilin gave a low whistle and threw it a cake. Ulashin\nrecognized him, wagged his tail and ceased his growling.\n\nThe master heard the dog and called from the hut, \xe2\x80\x9c_Hait, hait_,\nUlashin!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Jilin stroked the dog by the ears and it did not move. It rubbed\nitself against Jilin\xe2\x80\x99s legs and wagged its tail.\n\nThey sat crouching round the corner. All grew quiet; only a sheep was\nheard to cough in a barn, and below, the water rippled over the stones.\nIt was dark; the stars were high in the sky and the new moon looked red\nas it set behind the hill, horns upwards. A mist as white as milk lay\nover the valley.\n\nJilin got up and turning to Kostilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us come, brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey set off, but they had no sooner done so than the Mullah intoned\nfrom the roof \xe2\x80\x9cAllah Besmilla! Ilrachman!\xe2\x80\x9d That meant that the people\nwould be going to the Mosque. They sat down again, crouching behind the\nwall. For a long time they sat there waiting till the people went past.\nAll grew quiet again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then; with God\xe2\x80\x99s help we must get away,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said.\n\nThey crossed themselves and started. They went through the yard and\ndownhill to the river which they forded and came out into the valley.\nThe mist hung low and dense; above, the stars were visible. By the stars\nJilin could tell the direction they had to take. It was cool in the mist\nand walking was easy, only their boots were uncomfortable, being old and\nworn out. Jilin cast his off and went bare-foot. He leapt over the\nstones, gazing up at the stars. Kostilin began to lag behind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlower, please,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthese cursed boots hurt my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake them off and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it easier.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin too went barefoot, but that was still worse. The stones cut his\nfeet and he lagged behind more than ever.\n\nJilin said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cThe cuts on your feet will heal up soon enough, but\nif the Tartars catch us it will be much more serious; they will kill\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin did not say anything, but walked along, groaning.\n\nThey walked along the valley for a long time, when suddenly they heard\nthe barking of dogs. Jilin stopped and looked about him. He climbed up\nthe hill on all fours.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe mistook our way, and turned to the right. Another Tartar village\nlies here; I saw it from the hill the other day. We must turn back and\ngo to the left up the hill. There must be a wood here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Kostilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us rest a while; my feet are all bleeding.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll get better in good time, brother. Walk more lightly--like\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Jilin turned back and went up the hill to the left into the wood.\nKostilin kept on lagging behind and groaning. Jilin remonstrated with\nhim and walked on ahead.\n\nThey reached the top of the hill, where they found a wood, as Jilin had\nsurmised. They went into it. The brambles tore the last of their\nclothes. At last they found a path and followed it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said. There was a trampling of hoofs on the path. They\nlistened. It sounded like the trampling of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs, but the sound\nceased. They moved on and again they heard the trampling. They stopped\nagain, and the sound ceased. Jilin crept nearer and in a patch of light\non the path he saw something standing. It seemed like a horse, yet not\nlike a horse, and it had something queer on its back that was not a man.\nThe creature snorted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange thing!\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought, and gave a\nlow whistle. The animal bounded off the path into the thicket and there\nwas a sound of cracking branches as though a storm had swept through the\nwood.\n\nKostilin fell to the ground in terror; Jilin laughed, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a\nstag. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you hear how it\xe2\x80\x99s breaking the branches with its antlers? We\nare afraid of him and he is afraid of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went on further. The Great Bear was already setting and the dawn\nwas not far off. They did not know whether they were going in the right\ndirection. It seemed to Jilin that the Tartars had brought him along\nthis path when they captured him and that it was still another seven\nmiles to the fortress, but he had nothing certain to go by, and at night\none could easily mistake the way.\n\nKostilin dropped to the ground and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo what you like, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\ngo any further. My legs won\xe2\x80\x99t carry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin attempted persuasion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good,\xe2\x80\x9d Kostilin said; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin grew angry and vented his disgust.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99m going alone--good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin jumped up and followed.\n\nThey walked another three miles. The mist grew denser; they could not\nsee ahead of them and the stars were no longer visible.\n\nThey suddenly heard a trampling of horses coming from the direction in\nwhich they were going. They could hear the horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs hit against the\nstones. Jilin lay flat down and put his ear to the ground to listen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is certainly a horseman coming towards us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. They ran off\nthe path into the thicket and sat down to wait. After a while Jilin\ncrept out into the path to look. A mounted Tartar was coming along,\ndriving a cow and humming softly to himself. When he had passed Jilin\nturned to Kostilin, \xe2\x80\x9cThank God the danger is over. Come, let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin attempted to rise, but dropped down again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t! I\xe2\x80\x99ve no more strength left.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe man was heavy and stout and had perspired freely. The heavy mist had\nchilled him, tired and bleeding as he was, and made him quite stiff.\nJilin tried to lift him, but Kostilin cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it hurts!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin turned to stone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you shout? The Tartar is still near; he will have heard you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe remonstrated, while to himself he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cThe man is evidently\nexhausted; what shall I do with him? I can\xe2\x80\x99t desert him.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cclimb on to my back, then, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry you if you really can\xe2\x80\x99t\nwalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe helped Kostilin up, put his arms under his thighs and carried him on\nto the path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t put your arms round my neck or you\xe2\x80\x99ll throttle\nme. Hold on to my shoulders.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was hard work for Jilin; his feet, too, were bleeding and tired. He\nbent down now and then to get him in a more comfortable position, or\njerked him up so that he sat higher up, and went on his weary way.\n\nThe Tartar had evidently heard Kostilin\xe2\x80\x99s cry. Jilin heard some one\nfollowing behind, calling out in the Tartar tongue. Jilin rushed into\nthe thicket. The Tartar seized his gun and aimed; the shot missed; the\nTartar yelled and galloped down the path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we\xe2\x80\x99re lost,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll collect the Tartars to hunt\nus down. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t cover a couple of miles before they\xe2\x80\x99ve time to set\nout, nothing will save us.\xe2\x80\x9d To himself he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the devil did I\nsaddle myself with this block? I should have got there long ago had I\nbeen alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKostilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you be caught because of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go alone; it would be mean to desert a comrade.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain he raised Kostilin on to his shoulders and went on. They walked\nalong for another half-mile. They were still in the wood and could not\nsee the end of it. The mist had dispersed; the clouds seemed to gather;\nthe stars were no longer visible. Jilin was worn out. They came to a\nspring walled in by stones. He stopped and put Kostilin down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us rest a minute or two and have a drink and a bite of this cake.\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t be very far off now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had no sooner lain down to take a drink from the spring than he heard\nthe stamping of horses behind him. Again they rushed into the thicket to\nthe right and lay down on a slope.\n\nThey heard a sound of Tartar voices. The Tartars stopped at the very\nspot where they had turned off the path. They seemed to confer for a bit\nand then set a dog on the scent. There was a crackling among the bushes\nand a strange dog appeared. It stopped and began to bark. The Tartars\nfollowed it. They were also strangers. They bound Jilin and Kostilin and\ntook them off on their horses.\n\nWhen they had ridden for about two miles they were met by the master,\nAbdul, and two other Tartars. He exchanged some words with the strange\nTartars, after which Jilin and Kostilin were removed to his horses and\nhe took them back to the village.\n\nAbdul was no longer laughing, and did not say a word to them.\n\nThey reached the village at daybreak and were placed in the street. The\nchildren gathered round them and threw stones at them and lashed them\nwith whips, yelling all the time.\n\nAll the Tartars collected in a circle, the old man from the hills among\nthem. They began to talk; Jilin gathered that they were considering what\nwas to be done with him and Kostilin. Some said that they should be sent\ninto the hills, and the old man persisted that they should be killed.\nAbdul would not agree to either plan, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI paid money for them and\nmust get their ransom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man said, \xe2\x80\x9cThey will not pay the ransom; they\xe2\x80\x99ll only do a great\ndeal of harm. It is a sin to keep Russians. Kill them and have done with\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tartars dispersed. The master came to Jilin and said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nyour ransom does not come in two weeks, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you flogged, and if\nyou attempt to run away again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you like a dog. Write home, and\nwrite to the point!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey brought them pen and paper and they wrote home. The shackles were\nput on them and they were taken behind the Mosque, where there was a\npit of about twelve feet deep, into which they were flung.\n\n\nVI\n\nLife was very hard for them now. Their shackles were never removed, and\nthey were never allowed out into the fresh air. Raw dough was thrown\ndown to them, as one throws a scrap to a dog, and water was let down in\na jug. The stench in the pit was awful and it was damp as well. Kostilin\ngrew quite ill; he swelled very much and every bone in his body ached.\nHe either groaned or slept all the time. Jilin, too, was depressed; he\nsaw that their position was hopeless and did not know how to get out of\nit.\n\nHe tried to make a tunnel but there was nowhere to throw the earth, and\nwhen the master saw it, he threatened to kill him.\n\nOne day when he was most downcast, squatting in the pit and thinking of\nhis freedom, a cake fell from above, then another, and some cherries\nrained down. Jilin looked up and saw Dina. She looked at him, laughed\nand ran away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if Dina would help us?\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin thought.\n\nHe cleared a space in the pit, dug a little clay and began to make some\ndolls. He moulded some men and horses and dogs, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Dina\ncomes, I will throw these up to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Dina did not come the next day. Jilin heard a stamping of horses;\nsome Tartars seemed to have come and all gathered at the Mosque,\nshouting and arguing. It was something about the Russians. The voice of\nthe old man was heard, too. Jilin could not understand all they said,\nbut he made out that the Russians were near, that the Tartars were\nafraid of them and did not know what to do with their prisoners.\n\nAfter a while they dispersed. Suddenly Jilin heard a rustling overhead\nand saw Dina crouching at the edge of the pit, her knees higher than her\nhead. She bent over so that the coins at the end of her plaits dangled\nover the pit. Her eyes were twinkling like two stars. From her sleeve\nshe took two cakes made of cheese and threw them down to him. Jilin\npicked them up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a long time it is since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to\nsee me! I\xe2\x80\x99ve made you some toys. Look, here they are!\xe2\x80\x9d He threw them up\nto her one by one. She shook her head and averted her gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant them, Ivan,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want to kill you, Ivan,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\npointing to her throat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho wants to kill me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father. The old man told him to, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJilin said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are sorry for me, bring me a long pole.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe shook her head, as much as to say that it was impossible.\n\nHe put up his hands and implored her, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Dina! Be a dear and bring\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ll catch me at home.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she went away.\n\nIn the evening Jilin sat in the pit wondering what would happen. He kept\nlooking up; the stars were visible, but the moon had not yet risen. The\nMullah\xe2\x80\x99s call was heard, and all grew quiet. Jilin began to doze,\nthinking \xe2\x80\x9cThe child is afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d Suddenly some clay dropped on to his\nhead. He looked up, and saw a long pole poking into the opposite wall of\nthe pit; it began to slide down. Jilin took hold of it and lowered it\nwith a feeling of gladness at his heart. It was a stout, strong pole; he\nhad noticed it many times on the roof of the master\xe2\x80\x99s hut.\n\nHe looked up. The stars were shining high in the sky and above the pit\nDina\xe2\x80\x99s eyes gleamed in the darkness like a cat\xe2\x80\x99s. She leant her head\nover the pit and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cIvan, Ivan!\xe2\x80\x9d making signs to him to speak\nlow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve all gone but two.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Kostilin,\xe2\x80\x9d Jilin said; \xe2\x80\x9clet us try our luck for the last time;\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Kostilin would not listen to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit seems that I can\xe2\x80\x99t get away from here. How can I come\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly strength enough to move?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-bye, then. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think ill of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe kissed Kostilin, and seizing the pole, he asked Dina to hold it at\nthe top and swarmed up. Twice he fell back again; the shackles hindered\nhim. But Jilin persevered and got to the top somehow. Dina clutched hold\nof his shirt and pulled at him with all her might, unable to control her\nlaughter.\n\nWhen he clambered out Jilin handed her the pole, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cPut it back in\nits place, Dina, for if they notice its absence they\xe2\x80\x99ll beat you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDina dragged the pole away, and Jilin went down the hill. When he got to\nthe bottom he sat down under its shelter, took a sharp stone and tried\nto wrench the lock off the shackles. But the lock was a strong one and\nwould not give way, and it was difficult to get at it. Suddenly he heard\nsome one coming downhill, skipping lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be Dina again,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought.\n\nShe came up, took the stone and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me try.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe knelt down and tried to wrench the lock off, but her little hands\nwere as slender as little twigs and there was no strength in them. She\nthrew the stone down and burst into tears. Jilin made another attempt,\nwhile Dina squatted down beside him and put her hand on his shoulder.\n\nJilin looked round; to the left the sky was all red; the moon was\nbeginning to rise. \xe2\x80\x9cI must cross the valley and be under shelter of the\nwood before the moon rises,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He got up and threw away the\nstone. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go as I am in the shackles. Good-bye, Dina, dear; I shall\nalways remember you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDina seized hold of him and groped about his coat with her hand to find\na place to thrust some cakes into. Jilin took the cakes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, little one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere won\xe2\x80\x99t be any one to make you\ndolls when I am gone.\xe2\x80\x9d He stroked her head.\n\nDina burst into tears and, covering her face with her hands, she fled up\nthe hill, bounding along like a wild goat. The coins in her plait could\nbe heard jingling in the darkness.\n\nJilin crossed himself, took the lock of his shackles in his hand to\nprevent a clatter and started on his way, dragging his shackled leg and\ngazing at the red in the sky where the moon was rising. This time he\nknew the way. He had to go straight on for six miles. If only he could\nreach the wood before the moon had quite risen! He forded the river. The\nred light over the hill had paled. He walked along the valley, looking\nback now and then; the moon was not yet visible. The light grew brighter\nand brighter; one side of the valley was quite light. The shadows crept\nalong the foot of the hill, drawing nearer to him.\n\nJilin kept in the shadow. He hurried, but the moon moved faster than he;\nthe hilltops on the right were already lit up. As he neared the wood,\nthe moon rose over the hills, all white, and it grew as light as day.\nAll the leaves on the trees could be seen distinctly. It was still and\nlight on the hills; there was a dead silence, except for the murmur of\nthe river below.\n\nHe reached the wood without meeting any one. He chose a dark spot and\nsat down to rest.\n\nWhen he had rested a while and eaten a cake, he found a stone and once\nmore tried to wrench the lock of the shackles. He cut his hands, but\ncould not manage it. He rose and went on his way. After a mile he was\nquite worn out and his feet ached terribly. At every dozen steps or so\nhe stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI must drag myself on so\nlong as my strength holds out, for if I once sit down I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be able\nto get up again. I can\xe2\x80\x99t reach the fortress to-night, that is obvious;\nas soon as it gets light I\xe2\x80\x99ll hide in the wood and go on again when it\ngets dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe walked the whole night, meeting only two Tartars, but Jilin heard\nthem from a distance and took refuge behind a tree.\n\nThe moon began to pale; the dew fell; it was near dawn, but Jilin had\nnot yet reached the end of the wood. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll walk another thirty steps or\nso then I\xe2\x80\x99ll creep into the thicket and sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He\ncovered the thirty steps and saw that he had come to the edge of the\nwood. When he came out it was quite light. Before him stretched the\nsteppe and to the left, near the foot of a hill, he saw a dying fire\nfrom which the smoke rose and men were sitting about it.\n\nHe looked intently; there was a flash of guns--they were soldiers,\nCossacks!\n\nJilin was overjoyed. He summoned his remaining strength and began to\ndescend the hill, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid that any mounted Tartar should\nsee me now in the open field; though near my own people, I could not\nescape.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe thought had no sooner crossed his mind than he saw three Tartars\nstanding on a hill, not more than a few yards away. They had seen him\nand dashed down towards him. His heart gave a great bound. He waved his\narms and shouted with all his might, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp, help, brothers!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers heard him; a few Cossacks sprang upon their horses and\ndashed forward to cut across the Tartars\xe2\x80\x99 path.\n\nThe Cossacks were far off and the Tartars were near, but Jilin made one\nlast effort; lifting the shackles with his hand, he ran towards the\nCossacks. He hardly knew what he was doing and crossed himself wildly,\ncrying, \xe2\x80\x9cHelp, brothers, help!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Cossacks numbered about fifteen.\n\nThe Tartars grew afraid and stopped in hesitation before they reached\nhim. Jilin managed to get to the Cossacks. They surrounded him, asking\nwho he was and where he came from, but Jilin was quite beside himself\nand could only repeat, through his tears, \xe2\x80\x9cBrothers, brothers!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers came up and crowded round him, one giving him bread,\nanother porridge, another some vodka to drink, another gave him his\ncloak to cover him, and another wrenched off the shackles.\n\nThe officers recognized him and took him to the fortress. His men were\ndelighted to see him; his fellow-officers gathered about him.\n\nJilin told them all that had happened to him and ended by saying,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how I went home and got married. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to marry,\nevidently.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Jilin remained in the army in the Caucasus. It was not until a month\nlater that Kostilin was released, after paying a ransom of five thousand\nroubles. He was brought back in a half-dead condition.\n\n\n\n\nEMELIAN AND THE EMPTY DRUM\n\n\nEmelian was a labourer and worked for a master. He was walking through a\nfield one day on his way to work, when a frog hopped in front of him and\nhe just missed crushing it by stepping across. Suddenly some one called\nto him from behind. He turned, and there stood a beautiful maiden, who\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you marry, Emelian?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I, dear maiden? I possess nothing but the clothes I stand up\nin, and who would have a husband like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry me,\xe2\x80\x9d the maiden said.\n\nEmelian looked at her in admiration.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would with pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut how should we live?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a thing to trouble about,\n\n[Illustration: EMELIAN AND THE EMPTY DRUM.]\n\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x9d the maiden said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne has only to work the more and sleep the\nless and one can always be clothed and fed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; let us marry, then,\xe2\x80\x9d Emelian said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall we live?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the town.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian and the maiden went to the town. She took him to a little house\non the very edge and they married and set up housekeeping.\n\nOne day the King went for a drive beyond the town, and when passing\nEmelian\xe2\x80\x99s gate, Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s wife came out to look at him. When the King\nsaw her he marvelled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He stopped the carriage and called her to\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmelian the peasant\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came a beauty like you to marry a peasant?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should\nhave been a queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for your kind words,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9ca peasant husband is good\nenough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King talked to her a while and went on his way. When he returned to\nthe palace Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s wife did not go out of his head for a moment. The\nwhole night he could not sleep and kept on thinking how he could take\nher away from Emelian, but no possible way occurred to him. He summoned\nhis servants and asked them to think of a way.\n\nAnd the servants said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cGet Emelian to come and be a labourer in\nthe palace. We will wear him out with work, then his wife will become a\nwidow and you can have her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King followed their advice. He sent a messenger to tell Emelian that\nhe was to come and be a yard-porter in the palace and bring his wife to\nlive with him there.\n\nThe messenger came to Emelian and repeated the King\xe2\x80\x99s words. And\nEmelian\xe2\x80\x99s wife said to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped; you must go.\nYou can work there in the day and return to me at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian went away. When he came to the palace the King\xe2\x80\x99s steward said to\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you come without your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I drag her about with me? She has a home of her own.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the King\xe2\x80\x99s yard Emelian was given enough work for two men. Emelian\nset about it, not expecting to get it all finished, but behold! before\nevening came it was all done. The steward, seeing that he had got\nthrough the work, gave him four times as much for the morrow.\n\nEmelian went home. The house was scrubbed and cleaned, the fire lighted,\nthe bread baked, the supper cooked. His wife was sitting at the table\nsewing, waiting for him. She flew to the door to meet him, then laid the\nsupper and fed him well; afterwards she began to ask him about his work.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthey set me tasks beyond my strength; they\nwear me out with too much work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think about the work,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t look back to see how\nmuch you have done, nor look ahead to see how much there is left. Just\nkeep straight on and all will be done in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian went to bed. In the morning he again set out to the palace. He\nbegan his work and did not look round once, and behold! by evening it\nwas all finished; he went home when it was still light.\n\nAgain they increased Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s work, but Emelian finished it all in time\nand went home for the night as usual. A week passed. The King\xe2\x80\x99s servants\nsaw that they could not get the better of Emelian by giving him rough\nwork so they gave him difficult work instead, but even that did not\nhelp. No matter what they set him to do--carpentering, stone-cutting,\nthatching--he got everything done in time and went home for the night to\nhis wife. Another week passed.\n\nThe King summoned his servants and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it for nothing that I keep\nyou? Two weeks have passed and still I do not see the fruits of your\nwork. You promised to wear Emelian out with work and each night from my\nwindow I see him going home singing to himself. Are you making sport of\nme, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King\xe2\x80\x99s servants began to excuse themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are doing the best\nwe can. We thought at first to wear him out with rough work, but you\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get him anyhow. We set him all kinds of tasks, such as sweeping,\nbut he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what it means to be tired. Then we gave him\ndifficult work, thinking that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have brains enough to do it,\nyet still, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the better of him. No matter what the work,\nhe tackles it and gets it all done in time. He must either be\nextraordinarily strong or his wife must be a witch. We are sick of him\nourselves. We want to set him such a task that he cannot possibly do. We\nthought of asking him to build a temple in a single day. You must send\nfor him and command him to build a temple opposite the palace in a\nsingle day, and if he fails to do it, we can cut off his head for\ndisobedience.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King sent for Emelian.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuild me a new temple in the square opposite the palace; by to-morrow\nevening it must all be finished. If you do it, I will reward you; if\nnot, I will cut off your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian listened to the King\xe2\x80\x99s words; then turned and went his way home.\nWhen he got there he said to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cMake yourself ready, wife; we\nmust run away or else we are both lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9chave you grown so faint-hearted that you want to run\naway?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help it when the King commanded me to build a temple\nto-morrow before nightfall? If I fail to do it, he will have my head cut\noff. There is only one way out. We must run away while there is yet\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe wife did not approve of his words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King has many soldiers; we shall not be able to escape them. And\nwhile you have strength enough you must obey the King\xe2\x80\x99s command.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I obey if it\xe2\x80\x99s beyond my strength?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t get excited. Have your supper and go to bed; get up\nearly in the morning and you\xe2\x80\x99ll manage in good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian went to bed. His wife woke him in the morning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cmake haste and finish the temple. Here are nails and a\nhammer. There is still a day\xe2\x80\x99s work for you left to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian set out. When he came to the square, there in the middle stood a\nnew temple not quite finished. Emelian set to work to finish it and by\nthe evening it was all done.\n\nThe King awoke and looking out of the palace window he saw a new temple\nin the square. Emelian was busy around, knocking a nail in here and\nthere. The King was not pleased with the temple; he was annoyed that he\nhad no pretext for cutting off Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s head and taking his wife for\nhimself.\n\nAgain the King summoned his servants.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmelian has done this task too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have no reason for\ncutting off his head. This was not difficult enough; we must give him\nsomething more difficult still. You decide what it shall be, or else\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have your heads cut off first.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the servants bethought them to set Emelian to make a river that was\nto wind round the palace and have ships sailing on it.\n\nThe King summoned Emelian and set him the new task.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you could make a temple in a single night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can do\nthis too. See that it is all finished by to-morrow, or else I shall cut\noff your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian\xe2\x80\x99s spirits fell lower than ever and he went home to his wife in a\nsad mood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so sad?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cHas the King set you a new task?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian told her what it was.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must run away,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\n\nAnd the wife said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot escape the soldiers. You must obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. Have your supper and go to bed. Get up early in\nthe morning and all will be ready in time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian went to bed. In the morning his wife woke him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the palace,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is finished. Only by the\nharbour, opposite the palace, there is a little mound that wants\nlevelling; take the spade and level it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian set out. He came to the town and there around the palace a river\nflowed with ships sailing on it. Emelian went up to the harbour opposite\nthe palace and he saw an uneven place and began to level it.\n\nThe King awoke and looking out of his palace window he saw a river where\nthere was not one before and ships were sailing on it and Emelian was\nlevelling a little mound with his spade. And the King was alarmed. He\ntook no pleasure in the river or the ships, he was only annoyed that he\ncould not cut off Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s head. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no task he cannot do,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the King summoned his servants and conferred with them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of a task,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will be beyond Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s strength, for\nso far he has done everything we have thought of and I cannot take away\nhis wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the courtiers thought for a long time, then came to the King and\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must summon Emelian and say to him, \xe2\x80\x98Go to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nwhere, and bring me--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\xe2\x80\x99 He won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to escape you\nthen, for wherever he goes you can say it was not the right place and\nwhatever he brings was not the right thing. Then you can cut off his\nhead and take away his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King was pleased with the idea. He sent for Emelian and said to him,\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where, and bring me--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. And if you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut off your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian went back to his wife and told her what the King had said. The\nwife reflected.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBe it on the King\xe2\x80\x99s own head what his courtiers have\ntaught him. We must act with cunning now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe sat and thought it over for a while; then said to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nmust go a long way to our old grandmother, a peasant soldier\xe2\x80\x99s mother,\nand ask her to help you. She will give you something which you must take\nstraight to the palace and I will be there already. I cannot escape them\nnow; they will take me by force, but only for a short while. If you do\nwhat grandmother tells you, you will soon set me free.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the wife prepared Emelian for the journey and gave him a bundle and\na spindle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive grandmother this spindle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cby this she will know that\nyou are my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the wife showed him the way. Emelian left the town and saw some\nsoldiers drilling. He stopped and watched them. The soldiers finished\ntheir drill and sat down to rest. Emelian approached them and asked,\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me, mates, how to get to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where and bring\nback--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers were perplexed at his words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho sent you?\xe2\x80\x9d they asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe too,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, \xe2\x80\x9csince the day we became soldiers want to go to--we\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know where and find--we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve never been able\nto find it and so cannot help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian sat with the soldiers awhile then went on his way. He wandered\nand wandered till he came to a wood. In the wood was a cottage and in\nthe cottage sat an old woman, a peasant soldier\xe2\x80\x99s mother, spinning at\nher wheel, and she wept as she spun and moistened her fingers with the\ntears that flowed from her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried in anger when she saw Emelian.\n\nEmelian gave her the spindle and said that his wife had sent him. The\nold woman instantly softened and began to ask him questions. And Emelian\ntold her his whole story of how he had married the maiden and gone to\nlive in the town, and how he had been taken to the King\xe2\x80\x99s as a\nyard-porter, and of the work he had done in the palace, and the temple\nhe had built in a night, and the river and ships he had made, and that\nnow the King had sent him to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to bring back--I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow what.\n\nThe old woman listened to what he had to say and ceased her weeping. She\nbegan to mutter to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cThe time has come, I see. Very well,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid aloud; \xe2\x80\x9csit down, my son, and have something to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian had something to eat and the old woman said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cHere is a\nball of thread; roll it before you and follow wherever it leads. You\nwill have to go a long way, to the very sea. When you come to the sea\nyou will see a large town. Ask to be allowed to stay the night in the\noutermost house and look for what you want there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut by what signs shall I know it, grandmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see that which men listen to more than to father or mother,\nthat will be the thing you want. Seize it and take it to the King. He\nwill tell you you haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought the right thing, and you must say to\nhim, \xe2\x80\x98If it is not the right thing then I must break it.\xe2\x80\x99 Then strike\nthis thing; carry it out to the river; break it and throw it into the\nwater. Then you will get back your wife and dry up my tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian took leave of the grandmother and went where the ball of thread\ntook him to. The ball rolled and rolled till it brought him to the sea,\nwhere there was a large town. Emelian knocked at a house and asked to be\nallowed to stay the night. The people let him in. He went to bed. In the\nmorning he woke early and heard the father of the house trying to wake\nhis son to chop some wood. The son would not listen to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is early\nyet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he heard the mother near the stove say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo go, my son. Your\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s bones ache; surely you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him go? Get up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe son only smacked his lips and went to sleep again. He had no sooner\nfallen asleep than there was a banging and a rumbling in the street. The\nson jumped up, dressed and ran out. Emelian ran out after him to see\nwhat it was that a son obeyed more than father or mother.\n\nWhen Emelian got outside he saw a man coming up the street carrying some\nround object on his belly that he was beating with sticks. It was this\nthing that had made the noise and that the son had obeyed. Emelian\napproached and examined it. The thing was round like a small tub with\nskin drawn tightly on either side of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this thing called?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA drum,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it empty?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.\n\nEmelian wondered and asked the people to give him the thing, but they\nwould not. Emelian gave up asking and followed the drummer. He walked\nabout the whole day and when the drummer went to bed at night, Emelian\nseized the drum and ran away with it. He ran and ran until he came to\nhis own town. He wanted to give his wife a surprise, but she was not at\nhome. She had been taken to the King the day after Emelian had left.\n\nEmelian went to the palace and asked to be announced as the man who had\ngone to--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where and brought back--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. The\nKing was informed of his return and he ordered Emelian to come to him on\nthe morrow. Emelian again demanded to see the King, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI have\nbrought back what I was ordered to; let the King come out to me, or I\nwill go in to him myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King came out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nEmelian told him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was not the place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have you brought?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian wanted to show him, but the King would not even look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was not the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is not the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Emelian said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must break it and let it go\nto the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian came out of the palace and struck the drum. He had no sooner\ndone so than all the King\xe2\x80\x99s troops gathered around him. They saluted\nEmelian and waited for his commands. From the window of his palace the\nKing called to the troops, forbidding them to follow Emelian, but the\ntroops would not listen to the King and followed Emelian. When the King\nsaw this he ordered Emelian\xe2\x80\x99s wife to be given back to him and he begged\nEmelian to give him the drum.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Emelian said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was told to break it and throw the bits into\nthe river.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEmelian took the drum to the river and the soldiers followed him.\nEmelian struck the drum and broke it into little bits which he threw\ninto the water and the troops all scattered and dispersed. And Emelian\ntook his wife back home.\n\nFrom that day the King left off worrying him and Emelian and his wife\nlived happily ever after.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT BEAR\n\n\nA long, long time ago there was a big drought on the earth. All the\nrivers dried up and the streams and wells, and the trees withered and\nthe bushes and grass, and men and beasts died of thirst.\n\nOne night a little girl went out with a pitcher to find some water for\nher sick mother. She wandered and wandered everywhere, but could find no\nwater, and she grew so tired that she lay down on the grass and fell\nasleep. When she awoke and took up the pitcher she nearly upset the\nwater it contained. The pitcher was full of clear, fresh water. The\nlittle girl was glad and was about to put it to her lips, but she\nremembered her mother and ran home with the pitcher as fast as she\ncould. She hurried so much that she did not notice a little dog in her\npath; she stumbled over it and dropped the pitcher. The dog whined\npitifully; the little girl seized the pitcher.\n\nShe thought the water would have been upset, but the pitcher stood\nupright and the water was there as before. She poured a little into the\npalm of her hand and the dog lapped it and was comforted. When the\nlittle girl again took up the pitcher, it had turned from common wood to\nsilver. She took the pitcher home and gave it to her mother.\n\nThe mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall die just the same; you had better drink it,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand she handed the pitcher to the child. In that moment the pitcher\nturned from silver to gold. The little girl could no longer contain\nherself and was about to put the pitcher to her lips, when the door\nopened and a stranger entered who begged for a drink. The little girl\nswallowed her saliva and gave the pitcher to him. And suddenly seven\nlarge diamonds sprang out of the pitcher and a stream of clear, fresh\nwater flowed from it. And the seven diamonds began to rise, and they\nrose higher and higher till they reached the sky and became the Great\nBear.\n\n\n\n\nTHREE QUESTIONS\n\n\nIt once occurred to a King that if he knew the right moment when to\nbegin on any work and the right kind of people to have or not to have\ndealings with and the thing to do that was more important than any other\nthing, he would always be successful.\n\nAnd he proclaimed throughout his kingdom that he would give a great\nreward to any one who could tell him what was the right moment for any\naction, and who were the most essential of all people, and what was the\nmost essential thing of all to do.\n\nMany learned men came to the King and answered his questions in\ndifferent ways.\n\nIn answer to the first question some said that to know the right time\nfor any action, one must draw up a time-table of all the days, months\nand years and observe it\n\n[Illustration: THREE QUESTIONS.\n\n_To face page_ 158.]\n\nstrictly, then one could do everything at the proper time. Others said\nthat it was impossible to decide beforehand the proper time for any\naction; the only thing one could do was to waste no time in vain\namusements, but to pay attention to what was going on around one, and to\ndo the thing that came to hand. A third said that however attentive the\nKing might be to what went on around him, one man alone could not decide\nthe proper time for every action and that he needed a council of wise\nmen to advise him. Still a fourth maintained that as certain action had\nto be decided at once and could not wait a council the proper thing to\ndo was to find out beforehand what was going to happen so as to be\nalways prepared. But as only magicians knew what was going to happen,\nthen it followed that in order to find out the proper time for any\naction one must consult the magicians.\n\nThe second question, too, was answered in various ways. Some said that\nthe most essential people to the King were his helpers and ministers;\nothers said priests; still others that the most essential people to the\nKing were doctors; a fourth party said that the most essential people to\nthe King were soldiers.\n\nTo the third question about the most important occupation, some declared\nit was science, others, the art of war, and others, divine worship.\n\nThe answers being different, the King agreed with none of them and gave\nno man the promised reward. But still wishing to find out the answers to\nhis questions, he resolved to consult a hermit who was famous throughout\nthe land for his wisdom.\n\nThe hermit lived in a wood which he never left, and received none but\ncommon folk. For this reason the King put on simple garments, and,\ndismissing his body-guard before he reached the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s cell, he\nclimbed down from his horse and went the rest of the way alone and on\nfoot.\n\nHe found the hermit digging a bed in front of the hermitage. When the\nhermit saw the King, he greeted him and went on with his digging. He was\nfrail and thin and each time he dug his spade into the ground and\nturned over a little soil, he gasped for breath.\n\nThe King approached him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have come, oh, wise hermit, to ask\nyou to give me the answers to these three questions--what hour must one\nremember and not allow to slip by, so as not to regret it afterwards?\nWhat people are the most essential and with whom should one or should\none not have dealings? What things are the most essential to do and\nwhich of those things must one do first of all?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe hermit heard what the King had to say, but made no reply. He spat on\nhis hand and went on with his digging.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are tired,\xe2\x80\x9d the King said; \xe2\x80\x9cgive me the spade and I will do the\ndigging for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King took the spade and began to dig, but after a while he stopped\nand repeated his question. The hermit made no reply, but stretched out\nhis hand for the spade.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou rest now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the King would not give up the spade and went on with the digging.\nOne hour passed and another; the sun began to set behind the trees when\nthe King stuck his spade into the ground and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI came to you, wise\nman, to find the answers to my three questions. If you cannot answer\nthem, then tell me and I will go my way home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome one is running hither,\xe2\x80\x9d the hermit said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us see who it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King turned and saw a bearded man running towards them. The man\xe2\x80\x99s\nhands were clasped over his stomach and the blood flowed from beneath\nthem. He fell at the King\xe2\x80\x99s feet and lay motionless, rolling his eyes\nand moaning faintly.\n\nThe King and the hermit unfastened the man\xe2\x80\x99s clothes. He had a large\nwound in his stomach. The King bathed it as well as he could with his\nhandkerchief and bandaged it with the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s towel. The blood did not\ncease to flow, and several times the King had to remove the bandages,\nsoaked with warm blood, and rebathe and rebandage the wound.\n\nWhen the blood ceased to flow, the wounded man came to himself and\nasked for some water. The King brought some fresh water and raised it\nto the wounded man\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\n\nThe sun had quite set meanwhile and it began to get cold. The King, with\nthe hermit\xe2\x80\x99s help, carried the wounded man into the cell and put him on\nthe bed. The wounded man shut his eyes and went to sleep. The King was\nso tired with the walk and the work that he curled up by the door and\nfell into a sound sleep. He slept through the whole mild summer night,\nand when he awoke in the morning he could not make out where he was and\nwho was the strange bearded man staring at him from the bed with\nglistening eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d the bearded man said in a faint voice, when he saw that\nthe King was awake and observing him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know you and have nothing to forgive you for,\xe2\x80\x9d the King said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, but I know you. I am your enemy who vowed to be\nrevenged on you for having executed my brother and taken away my\nproperty: I knew that you went alone to the hermit and resolved to kill\nyou on your way back. But the day passed and you did not come. I lost\npatience and came out to find you, when I stumbled upon your body-guard.\nThey recognized me and wounded me. I escaped from them, but would have\ndied from loss of blood had you not bound my wound. I wanted to kill you\nand you saved my life. If I continue to live I will serve you as your\nmost faithful slave should you desire it, and I will order my sons to do\nlikewise. Forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe King was very glad that he had been able to make peace with his\nenemy so easily, and not only forgave him but promised to return his\nproperty and to send him his own servants and physician.\n\nTaking leave of the wounded man the King came out of the cell and sought\nfor the hermit with his eyes. Before going away he wanted to ask him for\nthe last time to answer his three questions. The hermit was on his knees\nby the beds they had dug yesterday, sowing vegetable seeds.\n\nThe King approached him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the last time, wise man, I ask\nyou to answer my questions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they are answered already,\xe2\x80\x9d the hermit said, squatting on his\nemaciated legs and looking at up the King, who stood before him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d the King asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d the hermit began; \xe2\x80\x9chad you not pitied my weakness\nyesterday and dug these beds for me and gone back alone, the man would\nhave attacked you and you would have regretted that you had not stayed\nwith me. The important hour at the time was when you dug these beds, and\nI was the most essential person to you, and the most essential act was\nto do me a kindness. And later, when the man ran up, the most important\nhour was when you looked after him, for, had you not bandaged his wound,\nhe would have died without making his peace with you. He was the most\nessential man to you at that time, and what you did for him was the most\nessential thing to be done. Always bear in mind that the most important\ntime is _now_, for it is the only time we have any power over\nourselves; the most essential man is the one with whom you happen to be\nat the moment, because you can never be sure whether you will ever have\nrelations with any one else, and the most essential thing to do is a\nkindness to that man, for it was for this purpose we were sent into the\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n[Illustration: THE GODSON.\n\n_To face page_ 167.]\n\n\n\n\nTHE GODSON\n\n\nI\n\nA son was born to a poor peasant. He rejoiced and went to a neighbour to\nask him to stand as godfather to the boy. The neighbour refused. He did\nnot want to be godfather to a poor man\xe2\x80\x99s son. So the peasant went to\nanother neighbour and he, too, refused. He walked from house to house,\nbut could find no one who would be godfather to his son, so he set out\nto another village. On his way he met a stranger, who stopped him and\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cGood day, peasant; where are you going to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod has given me a child,\xe2\x80\x9d the peasant said, \xe2\x80\x9cto gladden my sight in my\nyouth, to comfort me in my old age and to pray for my soul when I die.\nNo one in our village will be godfather to him, so I am going to seek\none elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me be his godfather,\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger said.\n\nThe peasant rejoiced. He thanked the stranger and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut whom shall\nI ask to be his godmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo into the town,\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger said; \xe2\x80\x9cin the square you will see a\nstone house with shop windows; go in and ask the merchant to let his\ndaughter stand as godmother to your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe peasant was doubtful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I ask a rich merchant? He will be too proud to let his\ndaughter come to a poor man like me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t be your fault; go and ask him. Have everything ready by the\nmorning and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the christening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe peasant went home, then drove into the town to the merchant. He had\nno sooner stopped in the yard than the merchant came out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod has given me a child,\xe2\x80\x9d the peasant said, \xe2\x80\x9cto gladden my sight in my\nyouth, to comfort me in my old age and to pray for my soul when I die.\nWill you be kind enough to let your daughter come and be godmother to\nthe child?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen is the christening?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; go, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name. To-morrow my daughter will be at the\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe next day the godmother and godfather came; the child was christened,\nbut directly after the christening the godfather disappeared. No one\nknew who he was and no one saw him from that day.\n\n\nII\n\nThe child grew up to the parents\xe2\x80\x99 great joy; and he was strong and\nindustrious and clever and humble. When he was ten years old the parents\nsent him to school, and what it took others five years to learn the boy\nlearnt in one. And there was no one in the village who could teach him\nmore.\n\nEaster came round and the boy went to his godmother to give her the\nEaster greeting. When he returned home he said, \xe2\x80\x9cFather and mother,\nwhere does my godfather live? I should like to give him the Easter\ngreeting, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the father said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know where your godfather lives, dear\nson. We, too, have worried over that. We have not seen him since you\nwere christened. We have not heard of him and don\xe2\x80\x99t know where he lives,\nnor whether he is alive at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe boy bowed to his father and mother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto seek my godfather. I want to find him and give\nhim the Easter greeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe father and mother gave their consent and the boy set out to find his\ngodfather.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe boy left the house and set out on his way. About midday he met a\nstranger and the stranger stopped and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood day to you, boy. Where\nare you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the boy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI went to my godmother to give her the Easter\ngreeting and when I returned home I asked my parents where my godfather\nlived, because I wanted to give him the greeting too, but my parents\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98We don\xe2\x80\x99t know where your godfather lives, dear son. We have not\nheard of him since you were christened and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about\nhim, or whether he is alive at all.\xe2\x80\x99 And I wanted to see my godfather,\nso I am going to find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am your godfather,\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger said.\n\nThe boy rejoiced and gave him the Easter greeting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to, godfather? If you are going in our direction\ncome in to us, or if you are going home, may I come with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the stranger said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no time to come to you now, because I\nhave some business in the villages. I shall not be home until to-morrow,\nthen you can come to me if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how shall I find you, godfather?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk straight towards the east until you come to a wood in the midst of\nwhich you will find a clearing. Sit down to rest in that clearing and\nlook about you to see what is happening. When you come out of the wood\nyou will see a garden and in the garden is a house with a golden roof.\nThat is my house. Go in at the gate; I will meet you there myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSaying these words the godfather vanished from the godson\xe2\x80\x99s sight.\n\n\nIV\n\nThe boy followed the godfather\xe2\x80\x99s directions. He wandered and wandered\ntill he came to a wood and found the clearing, and in the midst of the\nclearing stood a pine tree to a branch of which a heavy block of oak was\nattached with string, and beneath the block was a trough of honey. As\nthe boy was wondering why the honey and the block were there, a\ncrackling was heard among the trees and out came a family of bears. The\nmother came in front and a yearling and some cubs followed behind. The\nmother, sniffing the air, went straight to the trough, the cubs\nfollowing. She thrust her muzzle into the honey and called to the cubs\nto do the same. They scampered up and thrust in their muzzles. The block\nswung back a little and returning, hit against the cubs. When the mother\nsaw this, she shoved the block away with her paw. The block swung back\nfurther, and returning more forcibly struck one cub on the back, another\non the head. The cubs jumped away, howling with pain. The mother bear\ngrowled, and seizing the block in her fore-paws, flung it away from her\nviolently. The block flew up high. The yearling ran up to the trough,\nthrust his muzzle into the honey, the other cubs followed him, but no\nsooner had they got there than the block swung back, struck the yearling\non the head and killed him. The mother-bear growled more angrily as she\nseized the block and flung it away with all her might. The block flew\nhigher than the branch, the string it was tied to even slackened; the\nmother-bear and the cubs came up to the trough; the block flew higher\nand higher, then stopped and began to descend; the lower it got the\nswifter became its course. It crashed down on the mother-bear\xe2\x80\x99s head.\nShe fell over; her legs twitched and she died. The cubs ran away into\nthe wood.\n\n\nV\n\nThe boy wondered and went on further. He came to a large garden and in\nthe garden was a high house with a golden roof. At the gate stood his\ngodfather, smiling. He greeted his godson, made him come inside the gate\nand took him round the garden. He had never even dreamt of such beauty\nand joy as there was in that garden.\n\nThe godfather took the boy into the house and he found that more\nwonderful still. The godfather showed him all the rooms--one more\nbeautiful than the other--then he brought him to a sealed door. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\nsee this door?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not locked, only sealed. It can be\nopened, but I forbid you to do it. You can live here and go where you\nlike and do what you like; taste of every pleasure; I forbid you only\none thing--to pass that door. But if it should happen that you do go in,\nremember what you saw in the wood.\xe2\x80\x9d With these words the godfather went\naway, and the godson was left alone. His life was so full of pleasure\nand such a happy one that when he had been there thirty years it seemed\nto him no more than three hours. Thus the thirty years passed and the\ngodson came to the sealed door, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why my godfather\nforbade me to go into this room? I will go in and see what is there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe pushed the door; the seal gave way and the door opened. The godson\nwent in and saw that the room was large and more beautiful than all the\nothers, and in the middle of it stood a golden throne. The godson\nwandered and wandered over the room; then he stopped by the throne,\nmounted the steps and sat down. He saw a sceptre by the throne and he\ntook it up in his hand. He had no sooner touched the sceptre than the\nwalls of the room rolled asunder. The godson looked about and saw the\nwhole world and everything people were doing in it. Straight before him\nwas the sea and ships sailing on it. To the right were foreign lands,\nwhere heathens lived. To the left were Christians, but not Russians. On\nthe fourth side were our own Russian people.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will look and see what is happening at home,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if\nthe corn is good this year?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked at his father\xe2\x80\x99s fields and saw the sheaves standing in them.\nHe began to count the sheaves to see if the harvest had been good, when\nhe saw a cart coming over the field with a peasant sitting in it. He\nlooked closer and saw that it was Vasily, a thief. Vasily stopped by the\nsheaves and began putting them into the cart. The godson could not\nendure this and cried aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cFather, they are stealing your sheaves!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe father awoke in the night. \xe2\x80\x9cI dreamt that some one was stealing my\nsheaves,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI will go and see.\xe2\x80\x9d He got upon his horse and rode\nout.\n\nWhen he got to the fields he saw Vasily and called aloud for help. Some\npeasants came up. Vasily was beaten, bound and taken to prison.\n\nThe godson then looked towards the town where his godmother lived and\nsaw that she had married a merchant. She was lying in bed and her\nhusband got up to leave her to go to another woman. And the godson\ncried aloud to his godmother, \xe2\x80\x9cGet up! Your husband is going to do\nsomething wicked!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godmother jumped up, dressed and set out to find her husband. She\nbrought him to shame, beat the other woman and would not take her\nhusband back again.\n\nThe godson looked again towards his home and saw his mother lying in the\nhouse and that a robber had stolen in and was breaking open a trunk. The\nmother awoke and cried out in terror. The robber raised his axe, and was\nabout to kill her, but the godson could endure no more; he thrust the\nsceptre straight into the robber\xe2\x80\x99s temple and killed him on the spot.\n\n\nVI\n\nHe had no sooner slain the robber than the walls rose up again and the\nroom became as before.\n\nThe door opened and the godfather entered. He approached the godson,\ntook him by the hand, led him from the throne and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou did not\nobey my commands. You did one wrong thing in opening the forbidden\ndoor, another when you mounted the throne and took my sceptre into your\nhand, and a third wrong, which has added to the evil in the world. Had\nyou sat on the throne an hour longer, you would have ruined half\nmankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godfather once more led the godson up to the throne and he took\nthe sceptre in his hand and the walls rolled asunder.\n\nAnd the godfather said, \xe2\x80\x9cSee what you have done to your father. Vasily\nsat in prison for a year and learnt every kind of wickedness and came\nout completely corrupted. See, he has driven off two of your father\xe2\x80\x99s\nhorses and is now setting fire to his barns. This is what you have done\nto your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs soon as the godson saw his father\xe2\x80\x99s barns burst into flame the\ngodfather hid the view from his sight and bade him look in another\ndirection.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cit is now a year since your godmother\xe2\x80\x99s husband left\nher, and he goes after other women and his wife has taken to drink and\nhis former mistress has fallen to still lower depths. This is what you\nhave done to your godmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis sight, too, he hid from the godson\xe2\x80\x99s gaze and bade him look towards\nhis own home. His mother was weeping and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been\nbetter if the robber had killed me than that I should have so many sins\non my soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what you have done to your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis sight, too, the godfather shut out and bade the godson look below.\nAnd he saw two keepers guarding the robber in a dungeon.\n\nAnd the godfather said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis man has killed nine people. He should have\natoned for his sins himself, but in killing him you have taken them upon\nyour own soul. Now you must answer for all his sins. This is what you\nhave done to yourself. When the mother-bear first pushed the block aside\nshe merely disturbed her cubs; when she pushed it a second time, she\nkilled her yearling; when she pushed it a third time, she was killed\nherself. You have done exactly the same. I give you a term of thirty\nyears. Go into the world and atone for the robber\xe2\x80\x99s sins; if you fail to\ndo so, you will have to take his place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how shall I atone for his sins?\xe2\x80\x9d the godson asked.\n\nAnd the godfather said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have rid the world of as much evil as\nyou brought into it, then you will have atoned for your own and the\nrobber\xe2\x80\x99s sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I rid the world of evil?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godfather said, \xe2\x80\x9cWalk straight towards the east until you come\nto some fields on which you will find some people. Take note of what\nthey are doing and teach them what you know, then go on further,\nobserving everything on the way. On the fourth day you will come to a\nwood in which you will find a cell, and in this cell a hermit lives.\nTell this hermit all that has happened and he will instruct you in what\nyou are to do. When you have done all that the hermit has told you, you\nwill have atoned for your own and the robber\xe2\x80\x99s sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith these words the godfather put the godson out at the gate.\n\n\nVII\n\nAnd the godson set out, thinking as he walked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I rid the world\nof evil? People rid the world of evil by banishing evil men or putting\nthem in prison or executing them. But how can I rid the world of evil\nwithout taking other men\xe2\x80\x99s sins upon myself?\xe2\x80\x9d And the godson wondered\nand wondered, but could come to no decision.\n\nHe wandered and wandered till he came to a field on which tall rich corn\nwas growing, ready to be harvested. And the godson saw a calf that had\nstrayed in among the corn and he saw men on horseback chasing the calf\nthis way and that and trampling down the corn. Each time the calf was\nabout to come out of the corn some one rode up and the calf got\nfrightened and ran back again, the men after it. In the road stood a\nwoman, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cThey will chase my calf to death!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson said to the men, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing? Come out of the\ncorn and let the woman call to her calf.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe men did so. The woman came up to the edge of the field and called to\nthe calf, who pricked up its ears, listening awhile, then it ran towards\nher and buried its nose in her skirts, nearly knocking her down. The men\nwere glad, and the woman was glad, and the calf, too, was glad.\n\nThe godson went on his way thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cI see that evil breeds evil. The\nmore people try to drive away evil, the more the evil grows, which shows\nthat it is impossible to drive out evil by evil. But how can one drive\nit out? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It is well that the calf obeyed its mistress; if\nit had not done so, how should we have got it out of the corn?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson wondered and wondered, but could come to no decision and\nwent on further.\n\n\nVIII\n\nHe wandered and wandered till he came to a village where he asked to be\nallowed to stay the night at the first house. The mistress let him in.\nBesides herself no one was in the house. The mistress was busy\ncleaning.\n\nWhen the godson came in he climbed on to the stove and began watching to\nsee what the mistress was doing. She had finished cleaning the floor and\nwas scrubbing the table. She scrubbed it and wiped it with a dirty\ncloth. She rubbed the cloth one way, but the table would not come clean.\nThe cloth left streaks of dirt. She rubbed it the other way--the first\nstreaks came out, new ones were made. She rubbed it lengthwise again and\nthe same thing happened. The dirty cloth rubbed out one streak of dirt\nand left another. The godson watched for some time and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nare you doing, mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see that I\xe2\x80\x99m cleaning the house for the festival? I can\xe2\x80\x99t get\nthe table clean, anyhow. The dirt will not come off and I\xe2\x80\x99m quite worn\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should rinse out the cloth, then wipe the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe mistress did as he told her and the table came clean. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor your lesson.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the morning the godson took leave of the mistress and went on\nfurther. He wandered and wandered till he came to a wood where he saw\nsome peasants making hoops. He approached them and saw them struggling\nand struggling, but they could not bend the wood. He looked closer and\nsaw that the block on which they were working was not firmly fixed. And\nthe godson said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing, brothers?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaking hoops, as you see. We have steamed the wood twice, yet cannot\nbend it. We are quite worn out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should fix the block more firmly, mates. It moves round with you as\nit is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe peasants did so and their work went smoothly afterwards.\n\nThe godson stayed the night with them, then went on his way. He walked\nthe whole of that day and the night and just before daybreak he came\nupon some shepherds encamped for the night, and joined them. They had\nsettled their cattle and were trying to light a fire. They took some dry\ntwigs and lighted them, and not giving them time to burn up, they put\nsome damp brushwood on top and smothered the fire. The shepherds took\nsome more dry twigs and lighted them, and again they smothered the fire\nwith damp brushwood. For a long time they struggled, but could get no\nfire.\n\nAnd the godson said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be in such a hurry to put on the brushwood,\nbut wait until the twigs have caught well. When the fire gets hot then\nyou can put on the brushwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe shepherds did as he told them. When the twigs had caught well, they\nput on the brushwood, and in a few minutes they had a blazing fire.\n\nThe godson stayed with them for a while then went on further. He\nwondered what these three things he had seen might mean, but could not\nunderstand, nor see the reason of them.\n\n\nIX\n\nThe godson wandered and wandered until nightfall, when he came to a\nwood, and in the wood was a cell. He went up to the cell and knocked at\nthe door.\n\nA voice from within asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great sinner. I have come to atone for the sins of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the hermit asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are these sins you have taken upon\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson told him everything about his godfather and the\nmother-bear and the cubs and about the throne in the sealed room, and\nabout his godfather\xe2\x80\x99s commands, and about the peasants who had trampled\nthe corn in the field, and the calf that had come to its mistress at her\ncall.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you cannot drive out evil by evil, but I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how it can be driven out and I want you to tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the hermit said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what else you have seen on the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson told him about the woman and how she had tried to clean the\ntable, and of the peasants who had tried to make the hoops, and the\nshepherds who had tried to light a fire.\n\nThe hermit waited until he had finished, then he went into his cell and\nbrought out a jagged axe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe hermit walked away from the cell and pointed to a tree. \xe2\x80\x9cCut it\ndown,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe godson felled it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChop it into three parts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson chopped it into three parts. The hermit again went into his\ncell and brought out a light.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet fire to those three logs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe godson made a fire and burnt the three logs till only three pieces\nof charcoal were left.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow plant them half into the ground, like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson planted them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see a river there by that hill? Fetch some water in your mouth\nand water them. Water this one in the way you taught the woman to clean,\nthis one in the way you taught the hoopers, and this one in the way you\ntaught the shepherds. When the three pieces of charcoal grow into\napple-trees you will know how to rid the world of evil, and will then\nhave atoned for your sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith these words the hermit went into his cell. The godson pondered and\npondered and could not understand what the hermit had said, but he did\nwhat the hermit had told him.\n\n\nX\n\nThe godson went to the river, filled his mouth with water and watered\none piece of charcoal; then he went again and again, until he had\nwatered the other two. The godson was tired and hungry. He went to the\nhermit\xe2\x80\x99s cell to ask for some food. When he opened the door there was\nthe hermit lying dead on a bench. The godson looked about the cell and\nfound some rusks, which he ate; then he discovered a spade and went out\nto dig a grave for the old man. By night he carried water to water the\npieces of charcoal, and by day he dug the grave. He had no sooner\nfinished it and was about to bury the hermit, when some people came from\nthe village to bring the hermit food.\n\nWhen the people heard that the hermit was dead they asked the godson to\ntake his place. They buried the hermit, left the bread with the godson\nand went away, promising to bring him more food later on.\n\nAnd the godson fell into the hermit\xe2\x80\x99s place and he lived and nourished\nhimself with the food people brought him, and went on watering the\npieces of charcoal as the hermit had bidden him do.\n\nThe godson lived thus for a year and many people began to visit him. He\ngrew famous throughout the country as a saint who saved his soul by\ncarrying water in his mouth from beneath a hill, and watering stumps of\ncharcoal. People flocked to him. Rich merchants brought him gifts, but\nthe godson used nothing but what he needed, giving the rest to the poor.\n\nAnd the godson began to live thus--for half the day he carried water in\nhis mouth to water the pieces of charcoal, for the other half he rested\nand received people.\n\nAnd the godson came to think that he had been told to live thus and that\nin this way he would atone for his sins.\n\nThe godson lived thus for another year, not missing a single day for\nwatering the charcoal, yet not a single piece had begun to sprout.\n\nOne day when he was sitting in his cell he heard a horseman gallop past,\nsinging to himself. The hermit came out to see what manner of man he\nwas. And he saw that the man was young and strong and was dressed in\nfine clothes and seated on a spirited horse.\n\nThe godson stopped him and asked him who he was and where he was going.\nThe man pulled up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a robber,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI roam the highway and kill whomever I have a\nmind to. The more men I kill the merrier are my songs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson was horrified and thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can one destroy evil in such\na man? It is well to talk to the people who come to me; they repent of\ntheir own accord, but this man glories in the evil he does.\xe2\x80\x9d The godson\nsaid nothing to him and turned away, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I do? If this\nrobber makes up his mind to stay here, he will scare away my people and\nno one will come to see me. They will lose some good thereby, and I\nshall have nothing to live on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson stopped and said to the robber, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople come to me not to\nboast of the evil they do, but to repent and pray for their sins to be\nforgiven them. You repent likewise, if you have the fear of God in your\nheart, and if you do not seek repentance, go away from this place and do\nnot come back again, so as not to hinder me or scare away my people. If\nyou fail to listen to my words God will punish you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid of your God and I won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to you. You are not my\nmaster to order me about. You live by your piety, I by my robbery. We\nmust all live. Teach the women who come to you, but let me alone. Since\nyou have dared to mention the name of God to me I will kill two extra\npeople to-morrow. I would kill you now, only I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to soil my\nhands, but take care never to cross my path again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber threatened him thus and rode away. He did not come again and\nthe godson lived in the hermitage as before for another eight years.\n\n\nXI\n\nOne night the godson set out to water his pieces of charcoal and when he\nhad finished he sat down in his cell to rest. He peered along the path\nnow and again to see if any visitor was coming, but no one came that\nday. The godson sat alone until evening and he grew lonesome and weary\nand began to think about his life. He recollected how the robber had\nreproached him for living by his piety. He began to look back upon his\nlife. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not living as the hermit told me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThe hermit\nimposed a penance on me and I have used it as a means of earning my\nbread and even gaining fame thereby. I have been so led astray over it\nthat I am even dull when people do not come to see me, and when they do\ncome, I rejoice when they praise my saintliness. This is not the way one\nmust live. I have been blinded by fame. Not only have I not atoned for\npast sins but have taken new ones upon myself. I will go away to\nanother place far into the wood, where the people will not find me, and\nI will live alone there and atone for my past sins, taking care not to\ncommit new ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThinking thus the godson took a bag of rusks and a spade, and he left\nthe cell and set out down a ravine to build himself a mud hut in the\nthicket and disappear from people\xe2\x80\x99s sight.\n\nThe godson was walking along with his bag and spade when the robber\njumped out upon him. The godson was afraid and would have run away, but\nthe robber stopped him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nThe godson told him that he wanted to go away from people and bury\nhimself in a wild part of the wood where no one would come to him.\n\nThe robber wondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what will you live on if no one comes to see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson had not thought of that, but now the robber had mentioned it\nhe remembered that he had to eat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what God gives,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe robber made no reply and went his way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say anything to him about his life?\xe2\x80\x9d the godson thought.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may be repentant now. He seemed softer of manner and did not\nthreaten to kill me to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d And he called to the robber saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\ntime you repented. You cannot get away from God.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber turned his horse round, seized a knife from his girdle and\nbrandished it aloft. The godson took fright and ran away into the wood.\n\nThe robber did not trouble to go after him, he merely said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have let\nyou off twice, old man; take care not to come my way a third time, or\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith these words the robber rode away.\n\nThat evening the godson went to water his pieces of charcoal and behold!\none of the pieces had sprouted! A young apple-tree had shot forth.\n\n\nXII\n\nThe godson hid himself from the eyes of men and began to live alone.\nHis rusks were all gone. \xe2\x80\x9cI must hunt for some roots,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, but\nhe had no sooner gone out than he saw a bag of rusks hanging on the\nbranch of a tree. He took the bag and began to eat.\n\nWhen that was all gone he found another bag in the very same place. Thus\nthe godson lived. He had only one care--his fear of the robber. When he\nheard him coming he hid himself, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he kills me I shall not\nbe able to atone for my sins.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother ten years passed. One apple-tree grew up, the other pieces of\ncharcoal remained as they were before.\n\nOne day the godson went out early to do his watering. He moistened the\nsoil around the stumps until he was tired and sat down to rest. As he\nrested he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI have sinned greatly in fearing death. If it be\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s will I will atone for my sins by death even.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe thought had no sooner occurred to him than he heard the robber come\nalong cursing at some one. And the godson thought, \xe2\x80\x9cBesides God no one\ncan do me either good or evil.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went to meet the robber. He saw\nthat the robber was not alone. On the saddle, behind him, was another\nman, and this man\xe2\x80\x99s hands were bound and his mouth was gagged. The man\nmade no sound and the robber kept on abusing him. The godson approached\nthe robber and stopped before his horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you taking this man to?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInto the wood. He is a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s son and won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me where his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s money is hidden. I will keep him prisoner until he tells me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber was about to go on, but the godson would not let him, seizing\nthe horse by the bridle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the man go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe robber grew angry and raised his arm to strike him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to share his fate? I told you I would kill you. Let go!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson was not afraid.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t let go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of you; I only fear God. He\ntells me not to let go. Set the man free.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber frowned; he seized the knife from his girdle, cut the cords\nand released the merchant\xe2\x80\x99s son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe gone, the two of you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t come across my path a\nsecond time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe merchant\xe2\x80\x99s son fled. The robber was about to go, but the godson\nstopped him and once more beseeched him to abandon his wicked life. The\nrobber stood and listened without saying a word, then turned and rode\naway.\n\nIn the morning the godson went to water his pieces of charcoal. Behold!\nanother one had burst forth, another apple-tree had grown!\n\n\nXIII\n\nTen more years passed. The godson lived desiring nothing, afraid of\nnothing, and a feeling of gladness always at his heart. And he thought\none day, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat blessings the good Lord gives us! And we torment\nourselves for nothing. People should live in joy and happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\nremembered the evil men suffered and how they tormented themselves and\nhe grew to pity them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is in vain that I live as I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought;\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go among people and tell them what I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe thought had no sooner occurred to him than he heard the robber come\nalong, but he took no notice of him, thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the use of\ntalking to that man? He will not understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis was his first thought, but in a little while he repented of it and\nwent out in the road. The robber sat on his horse, frowning and looking\nat the ground. When the godson saw him, a feeling of pity came over him;\nhe rushed up and seized the robber\xe2\x80\x99s knee.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctake pity on your soul! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that\nthe spirit of God is in you? You torment yourself and others, and as\ntime goes on your torments will grow worse, and God loves you and wants\nto heap His blessings upon you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t destroy yourself, brother; change\nyour way of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe robber frowned and turned away. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe godson clutched the robber\xe2\x80\x99s knee still firmer and the tears stood\nin his eyes. The robber raised his eyes to his, gazed into them for a\nlong time, then climbed down from his horse and fell on his knees before\nthe godson.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have subdued me, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor twenty years I struggled\nagainst you, but you have won. I am powerless before you. Do what you\nwant with me. When you spoke to me the first time, I grew more hardened\nstill. I only began to take your words to heart when you went away from\npeople and I knew that you needed nothing from them. It was then I began\nto supply you with rusks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson recollected that the woman had only managed to clean the\ntable after she had washed the cloth. When he ceased to care for himself\nand cleansed his heart, he was able to cleanse the hearts of others.\n\nAnd the robber continued, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my heart turned when I saw that you had\nno fear of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the godson remembered that the hoopers began to bend the hoops only\nwhen they had made the block firm. When he ceased to fear death and\nestablished his life firmly in God he had been able to subdue this man\xe2\x80\x99s\nwild heart.\n\nAnd the robber said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the heart in me melted altogether when I saw\nthat you pitied me and wept before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe godson rejoiced. He led the robber to the place where his pieces of\ncharcoal were planted and behold! a third apple-tree had grown. And the\ngodson remembered that when the shepherds had allowed their dry twigs to\ncatch well, a big fire blazed up. It was only when his heart grew warm\nthat he had been able to kindle the heart of another.\n\nAnd the godson rejoiced that he had now atoned for all his sins.\n\nHe told the robber everything and died. The robber buried him and began\nto live as the godson had told him, and to teach other men what he knew.\n\n                          Printed in England\n       by Butler & Tanner Selwood Printing Works Frome, Somerset\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    e-text transcriber note:\n\n    Information was cropped off when the book used as a scan\n    source was rebound.
