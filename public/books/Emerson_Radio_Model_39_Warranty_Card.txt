N. Tolstoi\'s collected works, and are representative of his\nliterary activity between 1852 and 1859.\n\nThe first story, though only a fragment of a projected novel to be called\n"A Russian Proprietor," is perfect and complete in itself. One cannot help\nfeeling that it is autobiographical; Count Tolstoi himself, it will be\nremembered, having suddenly quitted the University of Kazan, in spite of\nthe entreaties of his friends, and retired to his paternal estate of\nYasnaya Polyana, near Tula. The aunt whose letter is quoted in the first\nchapter must have been Count Tolstoi\'s aunt, mentioned in the second\nchapter of "My Confession."\n\nThe "Recollections of a Scorer" and "Two Hussars" are both evidently\nreminiscent of Count Tolstoi\'s gambling-days. Both must have been suggested\nby some such terrible experience as that told of the count\'s gambling-debt\nin the Caucasus.\n\n"Lucerne" and "Albert" are likewise evidently transcripts from the author\'s\nown experience. The strange benefactor in each, and the shadowy Prince\nNekhliudof, are all Count Tolstoi in phases quite distinct from what he is\nat present.\n\n"The Three Deaths," written in 1859, has little of the sombre power of\n"Ivan Ilyitch." The scalpel which was so remorselessly applied to the soul\nin the latter is wholly hidden. It is realism pure and simple; and the\ncontrast between the death of the peasant and of the lady is left to\ninference, made all the stronger by the unexpected and grandiose finale in\nthe death of the tree.\n\nIn interesting contrast to these characteristic stories is the little gem\nentitled "A Prisoner in the Caucasus," which is found in Vol. IV. of the\nCount\'s works under the heading "Tales for Children." The style is\nperfectly simple and lucid; the pictures of life in the Tatar village among\nthe mountains are intensely vivid, painted with strong and masterly\ntouches; and the reader will not soon forget the little laughing maiden\nDina, with the rubles jingling in her braided hair. She stands forth as one\nof the most fascinating of the author\'s creations.\n\nNATHAN HASKELL DOLE.\n\nBOSTON, Dec. 5, 1887.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n\n                               PAGE\n\nA RUSSIAN PROPRIETOR              1\n\nLUCERNE                          87\n\nRECOLLECTIONS OF A SCORER       123\n\nALBERT                          148\n\nTWO HUSSARS                     190\n\nTHREE DEATHS                    286\n\nA PRISONER IN THE CAUCASUS      308\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nA RUSSIAN PROPRIETOR.\n\n\nI.\n\nPrince Nekhliudof was nineteen years of age when, at the end of his third\nterm at the university, he came to spend his summer vacation on his estate.\nHe was alone there all the summer.\n\nIn the autumn he wrote in his unformed, boyish hand, a letter to his aunt,\nthe Countess Bieloretskaia, who, according to his notion, was his best\nfriend, and the most genial woman in the world. The letter was in French,\nand was to the following effect:--\n\n     "DEAR AUNTIE,--I have adopted a resolution upon which must\n     depend the fate of my whole existence. I have left the\n     university in order to devote myself to a country life,\n     because I feel that I was born for it. For God\'s sake, dear\n     auntie, don\'t make sport of me. You say that I am young.\n     Perhaps I am still almost a child; but this does not prevent\n     me from feeling sure of my vocation, from wishing to\n     accomplish it successfully, and from loving it.\n\n     "As I have already written you, I found our affairs in\n     indescribable confusion. Wishing to bring order out of\n     chaos, I made an investigation, and discovered that the\n     principal trouble was due to the most wretched miserable\n     condition of the peasants, and that this trouble could be\n     remedied only by work and patience.\n\n     "If you could only see two of my peasants, David and Ivan,\n     and the way that they and their families live, I am\n     convinced that one glance at these two unfortunates would do\n     more to persuade you than all that I can tell you in\n     justification of my resolve. Is not my obligation sacred and\n     clear, to labor for the welfare of these seven hundred human\n     beings for whom I must be responsible to God? Would it not\n     be a sin to leave them to the mercy of harsh elders and\n     overseers, so as to carry out plans of enjoyment or\n     ambition? And why should I seek in any other sphere the\n     opportunity of being useful, and doing good, when such a\n     noble, brilliant, and paramount duty lies right at hand?\n\n     "I feel that I am capable of being a good farmer;[1] and in\n     order to make myself such an one as I understand the word to\n     mean, I do not need my diploma as B.A., nor the rank which\n     you so expect of me. Dear auntie, do not make ambitious\n     plans for me: accustom yourself to the thought that I am\n     going on an absolutely peculiar path, but one that is good,\n     and, I think, will bring me to happiness. I have thought and\n     thought about my future duties, have written out some rules\n     of conduct, and, if God only gives me health and strength, I\n     shall succeed in my undertaking.\n\n     [Footnote 1: _khozyain_.]\n\n     "Do not show this letter to my brother Vasya: I am afraid of\n     his ridicule. He generally dictates to me, and I am\n     accustomed to give way to him. Whilst Vanya may not approve\n     of my resolve, at least he will understand it."\n\nThe countess replied to her nephew in the following letter, also written in\nFrench:--\n\n     "Your letter, dear Dmitri, showed nothing else to me than\n     that you have a warm heart; and I have never had reason to\n     doubt that. But, my dear, our good tendencies do us more\n     harm in life than our bad ones. I will not tell you that you\n     are committing a folly, that your behavior annoys me; but I\n     will do my best to make one argument have an effect upon\n     you. Let us reason together, my dear.\n\n     "You say you feel that your vocation is for a country life;\n     that you wish to make your serfs happy, and that you hope to\n     be a good farmer.\n\n     "In the first place, I must tell you that we feel sure of\n     our vocation only when we have once made a mistake in one;\n     secondly, that it is easier to win happiness for ourselves\n     than for others; and thirdly, that, in order to be a good\n     master, it is necessary to be a cold and austere man, which\n     you will never in this world succeed in being, even though\n     you strive to make believe that you are.\n\n     "You consider your arguments irresistible, and go so far as\n     to adopt them as rules for the conduct of life; but at my\n     age, my dear, people don\'t care for arguments and rules, but\n     only for experience. Now, experience tells me that your\n     plans are childish.\n\n     "I am now in my fiftieth year, and I have known many fine\n     men; but I have never heard of a young man of good family\n     and ability burying himself in the country under the pretext\n     of doing good.\n\n     "You have always wished to appear original, but your\n     originality is nothing else than morbidly developed egotism.\n     And, my dear, choose some better-trodden path. It will lead\n     you to success; and success, if it is not necessary for you\n     as success, is at least indispensable in giving you the\n     possibility of doing good which you desire. The poverty of a\n     few serfs is an unavoidable evil, or, rather, an evil which\n     cannot be remedied by forgetting all your obligations to\n     society, to your relatives, and to yourself.\n\n     "With your intellect, with your kind heart, and your love\n     for virtue, no career would fail to bring you success; but\n     at all events choose one which would be worth your while,\n     and bring you honor.\n\n     "I believe that you are sincere, when you say that you are\n     free from ambition; but you are deceiving yourself. Ambition\n     is a virtue at your age, and with your means it becomes a\n     fault and an absurdity when a man is no longer in the\n     condition to satisfy this passion.\n\n     "And you will experience this if you do not change your\n     intention. Good-by, dear Mitya. It seems to me that I have\n     all the more love for you on account of your foolish but\n     still noble and magnanimous plan. Do as you please, but I\n     forewarn you that I shall not be able to sympathize with\n     you."\n\nThe young man read this letter, considered it long and seriously, and\nfinally, having decided that his genial aunt might be mistaken, sent in his\npetition for dismissal from the university, and took up his residence at\nhis estate.\n\n\nII.\n\nThe young proprietor had, as he wrote his aunt, devised a plan of action in\nthe management of his estate; and his whole life and activity were measured\nby hours, days, and months.\n\nSunday was reserved for the reception of petitioners, domestic servants,\nand peasants, for the visitation of the poor serfs belonging to the estate,\nand the distribution of assistance with the approval of the Commune, which\nmet every Sunday evening, and was obliged to decide who should have help,\nand what amount should be given.\n\nIn such employments passed more than a year, and the young man was now no\nlonger a novice either in the practical or theoretical knowledge of estate\nmanagement.\n\nIt was a clear July Sunday when Nekhliudof, having finished his coffee and\nrun through a chapter of "Maison Rustique," put his note-book and a packet\nof bank-notes into the pocket of his light overcoat, and started out of\ndoors. It was a great country-house with colonnades and terraces where he\nlived, but he occupied only one small room on the ground floor. He made his\nway over the neglected, weed-grown paths of the old English garden, toward\nthe village, which was distributed along both sides of the highway.\n\nNekhliudof was a tall, slender young man, with long, thick, wavy auburn\nhair, with a bright gleam in his dark eyes, a clear complexion, and rosy\nlips where the first down of young manhood was now beginning to appear.\n\nIn all his motions and gait, could be seen strength, energy, and the\ngood-natured self-satisfaction of youth.\n\nThe serfs, in variegated groups, were returning from church: old men,\nmaidens, children, mothers with babies in their arms, dressed in their\nSunday best, were scattering to their homes; and as they met the barin they\nbowed low and made room for him to pass.\n\nAfter Nekhliudof had walked some distance along the street, he stopped, and\ndrew from his pocket his note-book, on the last page of which, inscribed in\nhis own boyish hand, were a number of names of his serfs with memoranda. He\nread, "_Ivan Churis asks for aid_;" and then, proceeding still farther\nalong the street, entered the gate of the second hut[2] on the right.\n\n[Footnote 2: _izba_.]\n\nChuris\'s domicile consisted of a half-decayed structure, with musty\ncorners; the sides were rickety. It was so buried in the ground, that the\nbanking, made of earth and dung, almost hid the two windows. The one on the\nfront had a broken sash, and the shutters were half torn away; the other\nwas small and low, and was stuffed with flax. A boarded entry with rotting\nsills and low door, another small building still older and still\nlower-studded than the entry, a gate, and a barn were clustered about the\nprincipal hut.\n\nAll this had once been covered by one irregular roof; but now only over the\neaves hung the thick straw, black and decaying. Above, in places, could be\nseen the frame-work and rafters.\n\nIn front of the yard were a well with rotten curb, the remains of a post,\nand the wheel, and a mud-puddle stirred up by the cattle where some ducks\nwere splashing.\n\nNear the well stood two old willows, split and broken, with their\nwhitish-green foliage. They were witnesses to the fact that some one, some\ntime, had taken interest in beautifying this place. Under one of them sat a\nfair-haired girl of seven summers, watching another little girl of two, who\nwas creeping at her feet. The watch-dog gambolling about them, as soon as\nhe saw the barin, flew headlong under the gate, and there set up a\nquavering yelp expressive of panic.\n\n"Ivan at home?" asked Nekhliudof.\n\nThe little girl seemed stupefied at this question, and kept opening her\neyes wider and wider, but made no reply. The baby opened her mouth, and set\nup a yell.\n\nA little old woman, in a torn checkered skirt, belted low with an old red\ngirdle, peered out of the door, and also said nothing. Nekhliudof\napproached the entry, and repeated his inquiry.\n\n"Yes, he\'s at home," replied the little old woman in a quavering voice,\nbowing low, and evincing timidity and agitation.\n\nAfter Nekhliudof had asked after her health, and passed through the entry\ninto the little yard, the old woman, resting her chin in her hand, went to\nthe door, and, without taking her eyes off the barin, began gently to shake\nher head.\n\nThe yard was in a wretched condition, with heaps of old blackened manure\nthat had not been carried away: on the manure were thrown in confusion a\nrotting block, pitchforks, and two harrows.\n\nThere were pent-houses around the yard, under one side of which stood a\nwooden plough, a cart without a wheel, and a pile of empty\ngood-for-nothing bee-hives thrown one upon another. The roof was in\ndisrepair; and one side had fallen in so that the covering in front rested,\nnot on the supports, but on the manure.\n\nChuris, with the edge and head of an axe, was breaking off the wattles that\nstrengthened the roof. Ivan was a peasant, fifty years of age. In stature,\nhe was short. The features of his tanned oval face, framed in a dark auburn\nbeard and hair where a trace of gray was beginning to appear, were handsome\nand expressive. His dark blue eyes gleamed with intelligence and lazy\ngood-nature, from under half-shut lids. His small, regular mouth, sharply\ndefined under his sandy thin mustache when he smiled, betrayed a calm\nself-confidence, and a certain bantering indifference toward all around\nhim.\n\nBy the roughness of his skin, by his deep wrinkles, by the veins that stood\nout prominently on his neck, face, and hands, by his unnatural stoop and\nthe crooked position of his legs, it was evident that all his life had been\nspent in hard work, far beyond his strength.\n\nHis garb consisted of white hempen drawers, with blue patches on the knees,\nand a dirty shirt of the same material, which kept hitching up his back and\narms. The shirt was belted low in the waist by a girdle, from which hung a\nbrass key.\n\n"Good-day," said the barin, as he stepped into the yard. Churis glanced\naround, and kept on with his work; making energetic motions, he finished\nclearing away the wattles from under the shed, and then only, having struck\nthe axe into the block, he came out into the middle of the yard.\n\n"A pleasant holiday, your excellency!" said he, bowing low and smoothing\nhis hair.\n\n"Thanks, my friend. I came to see how your affairs[3] were progressing,"\nsaid Nekhliudof with boyish friendliness and timidity, glancing at the\npeasant\'s garb. "Just show me what you need in the way of supports that you\nasked me about at the last meeting."\n\n"Supports, of course, sir, your excellency, sir.[4] I should like it fixed\na little here, sir, if you will have the goodness to cast your eye on it:\nhere this corner has given way, sir, and only by the mercy of God the\ncattle didn\'t happen to be there. It barely hangs at all," said Churis,\ngazing with an expressive look at his broken-down, ramshackly, and ruined\nsheds. "Now the girders and the supports and the rafters are nothing but\nrot; you won\'t see a sound timber. But where can we get lumber nowadays, I\nshould like to know?"\n\n[Footnote 3: _khozyaistvo._]\n\n[Footnote 4: _batiushka._]\n\n"Well, what do you want with the five supports when the one shed has fallen\nin? the others will be soon falling in too, won\'t they? You need to have\nevery thing made new,--rafters and girders and posts; but you don\'t want\nsupports," said the barin, evidently priding himself on his comprehension\nof the case.\n\nChuris made no reply.\n\n"Of course you need lumber, but not supports. You ought to have told me\nso."\n\n"Surely I do, but there\'s nowhere to get it. Not all of us can come to the\nmanor-house. If we all should get into the habit of coming to the\nmanor-house and asking your excellency for every thing we wanted, what kind\nof serfs should we be? But if your kindness went so far as to let me have\nsome of the oak saplings that are lying idle over by the threshing-floor,"\nsaid the peasant, making a low bow and scraping with his foot, "then,\nmaybe, I might exchange some, and piece out others, so that the old would\nlast some time longer."\n\n"What is the good of the old? Why, you just told me that it was all old and\nrotten. This part has fallen in to-day; to-morrow, that one will; the day\nafter, a third. So, if any thing is to be done, it must be all made new, so\nthat the work may not be wasted. Now tell me what you think about it. Can\nyour premises[5] last out this winter, or not?"\n\n"Who can tell?"\n\n"No, but what do you think? Will they fall in, or not?"\n\nChuris meditated for a moment. "Can\'t help falling in," said he suddenly.\n\n"Well, now you see you had better have said that at the meeting, that you\nneeded to rebuild your whole place,[5] instead of a few props. You see, I\nshould be glad to help you."\n\n[Footnote 5: _dvor._]\n\n"Many thanks for your kindness," replied Churis, in an incredulous tone and\nnot looking at the barin. "If you would give me four joists and some props,\nthen, perhaps, I might fix things up myself; but if any one is hunting\nafter good-for-nothing timbers, then he\'d find them in the joists of the\nhut."\n\n"Why, is your hut so wretched as all that?"\n\n"My old woman and I are expecting it to fall in on us any day," replied\nChuris indifferently. "A day or two ago, a girder fell from the ceiling,\nand struck my old woman."\n\n"What! struck her?"\n\n"Yes, struck her, your excellency: whacked her on the back, so that she lay\nhalf dead all night."\n\n"Well, did she get over it?"\n\n"Pretty much, but she\'s been ailing ever since; but then she\'s always\nailing."\n\n"What, are you sick?" asked Nekhliudof of the old woman, who had been\nstanding all the time at the door, and had begun to groan as soon as her\nhusband mentioned her.\n\n"It bothers me here more and more, especially on Sundays," she replied,\npointing to her dirty lean bosom.\n\n"Again?" asked the young master in a tone of vexation, shrugging his\nshoulders. "Why, if you are so sick, don\'t you come and get advice at the\ndispensary? That is what the dispensary was built for. Haven\'t you been\ntold about it?"\n\n"Certainly we have, but I have not had any time to spare; have had to work\nin the field, and at home, and look after the children, and no one to help\nme; if I weren\'t all alone"....\n\n\nIII.\n\nNekhliudof went into the hut. The uneven smoke-begrimed walls of the\ndwelling were hung with various rags and clothes; and, in the living-room,\nwere literally covered with reddish cockroaches clustering around the holy\nimages and benches.\n\nIn the middle of this dark, fetid apartment, not fourteen feet square, was\na huge crack in the ceiling; and in spite of the fact that it was braced up\nin two places, the ceiling hung down so that it threatened to fall from\nmoment to moment.\n\n"Yes, the hut is very miserable," said the barin, looking into the face of\nChuris, who, it seems, had not cared to speak first about this state of\nthings.\n\n"It will crush us to death; it will crush the children," said the woman in\na tearful voice, attending to the stove which stood under the loft.\n\n"Hold your tongue," cried Churis sternly; and with a slight smile playing\nunder his mustaches, he turned to the master. "And I haven\'t the wit to\nknow what\'s to be done with it, your excellency,--with this hut and props\nand planks. There\'s nothing to be done with them."\n\n"How can we live through the winter here? _Okh, okh!_ Oh, oh!" groaned the\nold woman.\n\n"There\'s one thing--if we put in some more props and laid a new floor,"\nsaid the husband, interrupting her with a calm, practical expression, "and\nthrew over one set of rafters, then perhaps we might manage to get through\nthe winter. It is possible to live; but you\'d have to put some props all\nover the hut, like that: but if it gets shaken, then there won\'t be any\nthing left of it. As long as it stands, it holds together," he concluded,\nevidently perfectly contented that he appreciated this contingency.\n\nNekhliudof was both vexed and grieved that Churis had got himself into such\na condition, without having come to him long before; since he had more than\nonce, during his sojourn on the estate, told the peasants, and insisted\nupon it, that they should all apply directly to him for whatever they\nneeded.\n\nHe now felt some indignation against the peasant; he angrily shrugged his\nshoulders, and frowned. But the sight of the poverty in the midst of which\nhe found himself, and Churis\'s calm and self-satisfied appearance in\ncontrast with this poverty, changed his vexation into a sort of feeling of\nmelancholy and hopelessness.\n\n"Well, Ivan, why on earth didn\'t you tell me about this before?" he asked\nin a tone of reproach, as he took a seat on the filthy, unsteady bench.\n\n"I didn\'t dare to, your excellency," replied Churis with the same scarcely\nperceptible smile, shuffling with his black, bare feet over the uneven\nsurface of the mud floor; but this he said so fearlessly and with such\ncomposure, that it was hard to believe that he had any timidity about going\nto his master.\n\n"We are mere peasants; how could we be so presuming?" began the old woman,\nsobbing.\n\n"Hush up," said Churis, again addressing her.\n\n"It is impossible for you to live in this hut: it\'s all rotten," cried\nNekhliudof after a brief silence. "Now, this is how we shall manage it, my\nfriend"[6]....\n\n[Footnote 6: _bratets_, brother.]\n\n"I am listening."\n\n"Have you seen the improved stone cottages that I have been building at the\nnew farm,--the one with the undressed walls?"\n\n"Indeed I have seen them," replied Churis, with a smile that showed his\nwhite teeth still unimpaired. "Everybody\'s agog at the way they\'re built.\nFine cottages! The boys were laughing and wondering if they wouldn\'t be\nturned into granaries; they would be so secure against rats. Fine\ncottages," he said in conclusion, with an expression of absurd perplexity,\nshaking his head, "just like a jail!"\n\n"Yes, they\'re splendid cottages, dry and warm, and no danger of fire,"\nreplied the barin, a frown crossing his youthful face as he perceived the\npeasant\'s involuntary sarcasm.\n\n"Without question, your excellency, fine cottages."\n\n"Well, then, one of these cottages is just finished. It is twenty-four feet\nsquare, with an entry, and a barn, and it\'s entirely ready. I will let you\nhave it on credit if you say so, at cost price; you can pay for it at your\nown convenience," said the barin with a self-satisfied smile, which he\ncould not control, at the thought of his benevolence. "You can pull down\nthis old one," he went on to say; "it will make you a granary. We will also\nmove the pens. The water there is splendid. I will give you enough land for\na vegetable-garden, and I\'ll let you have a strip of land on all three\nsides. You can live there in a decent way. Now, does not that please you?"\nasked Nekhliudof, perceiving that as soon as he spoke of moving, Churis\nbecame perfectly motionless, and looked at the ground without even a\nshadow of a smile.\n\n"It\'s as your excellency wills," he replied, not raising his eyes.\n\nThe old woman came forward as though something had stung her to the quick,\nand began to speak; but her husband anticipated her.\n\n"It\'s as your excellency wills," he repeated resolutely, and at the same\ntime humbly glancing at his master, and tossing back his hair. "But it\nwould never do for us to live on a new farm."\n\n"Why not?"\n\n"Nay, your excellency, not if you move us over there: here we are wretched\nenough, but over there we could never in the world get along. What kind of\npeasants should we be there? Nay, nay, it is impossible for us to live\nthere."\n\n"But why not, pray?"\n\n"We should be totally ruined, your excellency."\n\n"But why can\'t you live there?"\n\n"What kind of a life would it be? Just think! it has never been lived in;\nwe don\'t know any thing about the water, no pasture anywhere. Here we have\nhad hemp-fields ever since we can remember, all manured; but what is there\nthere? Yes, what is there there? A wilderness! No hedges, no corn-kilns, no\nsheds, no nothing at all! Oh, yes, your excellency; we should be ruined if\nyou took us there; we should be perfectly ruined. A new place, all unknown\nto us," he repeated, shaking his head thoughtfully but resolutely.\n\nNekhliudof tried to point out to the peasant that the change, on the\ncontrary, would be very advantageous for him; that they would plant hedges,\nand build sheds; that the water there was excellent, and so on: but\nChuris\'s obstinate silence exasperated him, and he accordingly felt that he\nwas speaking to no purpose.\n\nChuris made no objection to what he said; but when the master finished\nspeaking, he remarked with a crafty smile, that it would be best of all to\nremove to that farm some of the old domestic servants, and Alyosha the\nfool, so that they might watch over the grain there.\n\n"That would be worth while," he remarked, and smiled once more. "This is\nfoolish business, your excellency."\n\n"What makes you think the place is not inhabitable?" insisted Nekhliudof\npatiently. "This place here isn\'t inhabitable, and hasn\'t been, and yet you\nlive here. But there, you will get settled there before you know it; you\nwill certainly find it easy"....\n\n"But, your excellency, kind sir,[7] how can it be compared?" replied Churis\neagerly, as though he feared that the master would not accept a conclusive\nargument. "Here is our place in the world; we are happy in it; we are\naccustomed to it, and the road and the pond--where would the old woman do\nher washing? where would the cattle get watered? And all our peasant ways\nare here; here from time out of mind. And here\'s the threshing-floor, and\nthe little garden, and the willows; and here my parents lived, and my\ngrandfather; and my father gave his soul into God\'s keeping here, and I too\nwould end my days here, your excellency. I ask nothing more than that. Be\ngood, and let the hut be put in order; we shall be always grateful for your\nkindness: but no, not for any thing, would we spend our last days anywhere\nelse. Let us stay here and say our prayers," he continued, bowing low; "do\nnot take us from our nest, kind sir."[8]\n\n[Footnote 7: _batiushka._]\n\n[Footnote 8: _batiushka._]\n\nAll the time that Churis was speaking, there was heard in the place under\nthe loft, where his wife was standing, sobs growing more and more violent;\nand when the husband said "_kind sir_," she suddenly darted forward, and\nwith tears in her eyes threw herself at the barin\'s feet.\n\n"Don\'t destroy us, benefactor; you are our father, you are our mother!\nWhere are you going to move us to? We are old folks; we have no one to help\nus. You are to us as God is," lamented the old woman.\n\nNekhliudof leaped up from the bench, and was going to lift the old woman;\nbut she, with a sort of passionate despair, beat her forehead on the earth\nfloor, and pushed aside the master\'s hand.\n\n"What is the matter with you? Get up, I beg of you. If you don\'t wish to\ngo, it is not necessary. I won\'t oblige you to," said he, waving his hand,\nand retreating to the door.\n\nWhen Nekhliudof sat down on the bench again, and silence was restored in\nthe room, interrupted only by the sobs of the old woman, who was once more\nbusy under the loft, and was wiping away her tears with the sleeves of her\nshirt, the young proprietor began to comprehend what was meant for the\npeasant and his wife by the dilapidated little hut, the crumbling well with\nthe filthy pool, the decaying stalls and sheds, and the broken willows\nwhich could be seen before the crooked window; and the feeling that arose\nin him was burdensome, melancholy, and touched with shame.\n\n"Why didn\'t you tell the Commune last Sunday, Ivan, that you needed a new\nhut? I don\'t know, now, how to help you. I told you all at the first\nmeeting, that I had come to live in the country, and devote my life to you,\nthat I was ready to deprive myself of every thing to make you happy and\ncontented; and I vowed before God, now, that I would keep my word," said\nthe young proprietor, not knowing that such a manner of opening the heart\nis incapable of arousing faith in any one, and especially in the Russian,\nwho loves not words but deeds, and is reluctant to be stirred up by\nfeelings, no matter how beautiful they may be.\n\nBut the simple-hearted young man was so pleased with this feeling that he\nexperienced, that he could not help speaking.\n\nChuris leaned his head to one side, and slowly blinking, listened with\nconstrained attention to his master, as to a man to whom he must needs\nlisten, even though he says things not entirely good, and absolutely\nforeign to his way of thinking.\n\n"But you see I cannot do all that everybody asks of me. If I did not refuse\nsome who ask me for wood, I myself should be left without any, and I could\nnot give to those who really needed. When I made this rule, I did it for\nthe regulation of the peasants\' affairs; and I put it entirely in the hands\nof the Commune. This wood now is not mine, but yours, you peasants\', and I\ncannot any longer dispose of it; but the Commune disposes of it, as you\nknow. Come to the meeting to-night. I will tell the Commune about your\nrequest: if they are disposed to give you a new hut, well and good; but I\nhaven\'t any more wood. I wish with all my soul to help you; but if you\naren\'t willing to move, then it is no longer my affair, but the Commune\'s.\nDo you understand me?"\n\n"Many thanks for your kindness," replied Churis in some agitation. "If you\nwill give me some lumber, then we can make repairs. What is the Commune?\nIt\'s a well-known fact that"....\n\n"No, you come."\n\n"I obey. I will come. Why shouldn\'t I come? Only this thing is sure: I\nwon\'t ask the Commune."\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe young proprietor evidently desired to ask some more questions of the\npeasants. He did not move from the bench; and he glanced irresolutely, now\nat Churis, now at the empty, unlighted stove.\n\n"Well, have you had dinner yet?" he asked at last.\n\nA mocking smile arose to Churis\'s lips, as though it were ridiculous to him\nfor his master to ask such foolish questions; he made no reply.\n\n"What do you mean,--dinner, benefactor?" said the old woman, sighing\ndeeply. "We\'ve eaten a little bread; that\'s our dinner. We couldn\'t get any\nvegetables to-day so as to boil some soup,[9] but we had a little\nkvas,--enough for the children."\n\n[Footnote 9: _shchets_ for _shchi_.]\n\n"To-day was a fast-day for us, your excellency," remarked Churis\nsarcastically, taking up his wife\'s words. "Bread and onions; that\'s the\nway we peasants live. Howsomever, praise be to the Lord, I have a little\ngrain yet, thanks to your kindness; it\'s lasted till now; but there\'s\nplenty of our peasants as ain\'t got any. Everywheres there\'s scarcity of\nonions. Only a day or two ago they sent to Mikhail the gardener, to get a\nbunch for a farthing: couldn\'t get any anywheres. Haven\'t been to God\'s\nchurch scarcely since Easter. Haven\'t had nothing to buy a taper for Mikola\n[St. Nicholas] with."\n\nNekhliudof, not by hearsay nor by trust in the words of others, but by the\nevidence of his own eyes, had long known the extreme depth of poverty into\nwhich his peasantry had sunken: but the entire reality was in such perfect\ncontrast to his own bringing-up, the turn of his mind, and the course of\nhis life, that in spite of himself he kept forgetting the truth of it; and\nevery time when, as now, it was brought vividly, tangibly, before him, his\nheart was torn with painful, almost unendurable melancholy, as though some\nabsolute and unavoidable punishment were torturing him.\n\n"Why are you so poor?" he exclaimed, involuntarily expressing his thought.\n\n"How could such as we help being poor, sir,[10] your excellency? Our land\nis so bad, you yourself may be pleased to know,--clay and sand-heaps; and\nsurely we must have angered God, for this long time, ever since the\ncholera, the corn won\'t grow. Our meadows and every thing else have been\ngrowing worse and worse. And some of us have to work for the farm, and some\ndetailed for the manor-lands. And here I am with no one to help me, and I\'m\ngetting old. I\'d be glad enough to work, but I hain\'t no strength. And my\nold woman\'s ailing; and every year there\'s a new girl born, and I have to\nfeed \'em all. I get tired out all alone, and here\'s seven dependent on me.\nI must be a sinner in the eyes of the Lord God, I often think to myself.\nAnd when God takes me off sudden-like, I feel it would be easier for me;\njust as it\'s better for them than to lead such a dog\'s life here"....\n\n[Footnote 10: _batiushka._]\n\n"Oh, _okh_!" groaned the old woman, as a sort of confirmation of her\nhusband\'s words.\n\n"And this is all the help I have," continued Churis, pointing to the\nwhite-headed, unkempt little boy of seven, with a huge belly, who at this\nmoment, timidly and quietly pushing the door open, came into the hut, and,\nresting his eyes in wonder and solemnity on the master, clung hold of\nChuris\'s shirt-band with both hands.\n\n"This is all the assistance I have here," continued Churis in a sonorous\nvoice, laying his shaggy hand on the little lad\'s white hair. "When will he\nbe good for any thing? But my work isn\'t much good. When I reach old age I\nshall be good for nothing; the rupture is getting the better of me. In wet\nweather it makes me fairly scream. I am getting to be an old man, and yet I\nhave to take care of my land.[11] And here\'s Yermilof, Demkin, Zabref, all\nyounger than I am, and they have been freed from their land long ago. Well,\nI haven\'t any one to help me with it; that\'s my misfortune. Have to feed so\nmany; that\'s where my struggle lies, your excellency."\n\n"I should be very glad to make it easier for you, truly. But how can I?"\nasked the young barin in a tone of sympathy, looking at the serf.\n\n"How make it easier? It\'s a well-known fact, if you have the land you must\ndo enforced labor also;[12] that\'s the regulation. I expect something from\nthis youngster. If only you\'d be good enough to let him off from going to\nschool. But just a day or two ago, the officer[13] came and said that your\nexcellency wanted him to go to school. Do let him off; he has no capacity\nfor learning, your excellency. He\'s too young yet; he won\'t understand any\nthing."\n\n[Footnote 11: The lands belonging to the Russian commune, or _mir_, were\nperiodically distributed by allotment, each full-grown peasant receiving as\nhis share a _tiaglo_ representing what the average man and his wife were\ncapable of cultivating. When the period was long--ten years for\ninstance--it sometimes happened that a serf, by reason of illness,\nlaziness, or other misfortune, would find it hard to cultivate his share,\npay the tax on it, and also do the work required of him on his barin\'s\nland. Such was Churis\'s complaint.]\n\n[Footnote 12: _barshchina_: work on the master\'s land.]\n\n[Footnote 13: _zemski._]\n\n"No, brother, you\'re wrong there," said the barin. "Your boy is old enough\nto understand; it\'s time for him to be learning. Just think of it! How\nhe\'ll grow up, and learn about farming; yes, and he\'ll know his a-b-c\'s,\nand know how to read; and read in church. He\'ll be a great help to you if\nGod lets him live," said Nekhliudof, trying to make himself as plain as\npossible, and at the same time blushing and stammering.\n\n"Very true, your excellency. You don\'t want to do us an injury, but there\'s\nno one to take care of the house; for while I and the old woman are doing\nthe enforced labor, the boy, though he\'s so young, is a great help, driving\nthe cattle and watering the horses. Whatever he is, he\'s a true muzhik;"\nand Churis, with a smile, took the lad\'s nose between his fat fingers, and\ndeftly removed the mucus.\n\n"Nevertheless, you must send him to school, for now you are at home, and he\nhas plenty of time,--do you hear? Don\'t you fail."\n\nChuris sighed deeply, and made no reply.\n\n\nV.\n\n"There\'s one other thing I wished to speak to you about," said Nekhliudof.\n"Why don\'t you haul out your manure?"\n\n"What manure, sir,[14] your excellency? There isn\'t any to haul out. What\ncattle have I got? One mare and colt; and last autumn I sold my heifer to\nthe porter,--that\'s all the cattle I\'ve got."\n\n[Footnote 14: _batiushka._]\n\n"I know you haven\'t much, but why did you sell your heifer?" asked the\nbarin in amazement.\n\n"What have I got to feed her on?"\n\n"Didn\'t you have some straw for feeding the cow? The others did."\n\n"The others have their fields manured, but my land\'s all clay. I can\'t do\nany thing with it."\n\n"Why don\'t you dress it, then, so it won\'t be clay? Then the land would\ngive you grain, and you\'d have something to feed to your stock."\n\n"But I haven\'t any stock, so how am I going to get dressing?"\n\n"That\'s an odd _cercle vicieux_," said Nekhliudof to himself; and he\nactually was at his wits\' ends to find an answer for the peasant.\n\n"And I tell you this, your excellency, it ain\'t the manure that makes the\ncorn grow, but God," continued the peasant. "Now, one summer I had six\nsheaves on one little unmanured piece of land, and only a twelfth as much\non that which was manured well. No one like God," he added with a sigh.\n"Yes, and my stock are always dying off. Five years past I haven\'t had any\nluck with \'em. Last summer one heifer died; had to sell another, hadn\'t any\nthing to feed her on; and last year my best cow perished. They were driving\nher home from pasture; nothing the matter, but suddenly she staggered and\nstaggered. And so now it\'s all empty here. Just my bad luck!"\n\n"Well, brother, since you say that you have no cattle to help you make\nfodder, and no fodder for your cattle, here\'s something towards a cow,"\nsaid Nekhliudof, reddening, and fetching forth from his pocket a packet of\ncrumpled bank-notes and untying it. "Buy you a cow at my expense, and get\nsome fodder from the granary: I will give orders. See to it that you have a\ncow by next Sunday. I shall come to see."\n\nChuris hesitated long; and when he did not offer to take the money,\nNekhliudof laid it down on the end of the table, and a still deeper flush\nspread over his face.\n\n"Many thanks for your kindness," said Churis, with his ordinary smile,\nwhich was somewhat sarcastic.\n\nThe old woman sighed heavily several times as she stood under the loft, and\nseemed to be repeating a prayer.\n\nThe situation was embarrassing for the young prince: he hastily got up from\nthe bench, went out into the entry, and called to Churis to follow him. The\nsight of the man whom he had been befriending was so pleasant that he found\nit hard to tear himself away.\n\n"I am glad to help you," said he, halting by the well. "It\'s in my power to\nhelp you, because I know that you are not lazy. You will work, and I will\nassist you; and, with God\'s aid, you will come out all right."\n\n"There\'s no hope of coming out all right, your excellency," said Churis,\nsuddenly assuming a serious and even stern expression of countenance, as\nthough the young man\'s assurance that he would come out all right had\nawakened all his opposition. "In my father\'s time my brothers and I did not\nsee any lack; but when he died, we broke all up. It kept going from bad to\nworse. Perfect wretchedness!"\n\n"Why did you break up?"\n\n"All on account of the women, your excellency. It was just after your\ngrandfather died; when he was alive, we should not have ventured to do it:\nthen the present order of things came in. He was just like you, he took an\ninterest in every thing; and we should not have dared to separate. The late\nmaster did not like to look after the peasants; but after your\ngrandfather\'s time, Andrei Ilyitch took charge. God forgive him! he was a\ndrunken, careless man. We came to him once and again with complaints,--no\nliving on account of the women,--begged him to let us separate. Well, he\nput it off, and put it off; but at last things came to such a pass, the\nwomen kept each to their own part; we began to live apart; and, of course,\nwhat could a single peasant do? Well, there wasn\'t no law or order. Andrei\nIlyitch managed simply to suit himself. \'Take all you can get.\' And\nwhatever he could extort from a peasant, he took without asking. Then the\npoll-tax was raised, and they began to exact more provisions, and we had\nless and less land, and the grain stopped growing. Well, when the new\nallotment was made, then he took away from us our manured land, and added\nit to the master\'s, the villain, and ruined us entirely. He ought to have\nbeen hung. Your father[15]--the kingdom of heaven be his!--was a good\nbarin, but it was rarely enough that we ever had sight of him: he always\nlived in Moscow. Well, of course they used to drive the carts in pretty\noften. Sometimes it would be the season of bad roads,[16] and no fodder;\nbut no matter! The barin couldn\'t get along without it. We did not dare to\ncomplain at this, but there wasn\'t system. But now your grace lets any of\nus peasants see your face, and so a change has come over us; and the\noverseer is a different kind of man. Now we know for sure that we have a\nbarin. And it is impossible to say how grateful your peasants are for your\nkindness. But before you came, there wasn\'t any real barin: every one was\nbarin. Ilyitch was barin, and his wife put on the airs of a lady,[17] and\nthe scribe from the police-station was barin. Too many of em! _ukh!_ the\npeasants had to put up with many trials."\n\nAgain Nekhliudof experienced a feeling akin to shame or remorse. He put on\nhis hat, and went on his way.\n\n[Footnote 15: _batiushka._]\n\n[Footnote 16: _rasputitsa._]\n\n[Footnote 17: _baruinya._]\n\n\nVI.\n\n"Yukhvanka the clever[18] wants to sell a horse," was what Nekhliudof next\nread in his note-book; and he proceeded along the street to Yukhvanka\'s\nplace.[19] Yukhvanka\'s hut was carefully thatched with straw from the\nthreshing-floor of the estate; the frame-work was of new light-gray\naspen-wood (also from stock belonging to the estate), had two handsome\npainted shutters for the window, and a porch with eaves and ingenious\nbalustrades cut out of deal planks.\n\n[Footnote 18: _Yukhvanka-Mudr\'yonui._]\n\n[Footnote 19: _dvor._]\n\nThe narrow entry and the cold hut were also in perfect order; but the\ngeneral impression of sufficiency and comfort given by this establishment\nwas somewhat injured by a barn enclosed in the gates, which had a\ndilapidated hedge and a sagging pent roof, appearing from behind it.\n\nJust as Nekhliudof approached the steps from one side, two peasant women\ncame up on the other carrying a tub full of water. One was Yukhvanka\'s\nwife, the other his mother.\n\nThe first was a robust, healthy-looking woman, with an extraordinarily\nexuberant bosom, and wide fat cheeks. She wore a clean shirt embroidered on\nthe sleeves and collar, an apron of the same material, a new linen skirt,\npeasant\'s shoes, a string of beads, and an elegant four-cornered head-dress\nof embroidered red paper and spangles.\n\nThe end of the water-yoke was not in the least unsteady, but was firmly\nsettled on her wide and solid shoulder. Her easy forcefulness, manifested\nin her rosy face, in the curvature of her back, and the measured swing of\nher arms and legs, made it evident that she had splendid health and rugged\nstrength.\n\nYukhvanka\'s mother, balancing the other end of the yoke, was, on the\ncontrary, one of those elderly women who seem to have reached the final\nlimit of old age and decrepitude. Her bony frame, clad in a black\ndilapidated shirt and a faded linen skirt, was bent so that the water-yoke\nrested rather on her back than on her shoulder. Her two hands, whose\ndistorted fingers seemed to clutch the yoke, were of a strange dark\nchestnut color, and were convulsively cramped. Her drooping head, wrapped\nup in some sort of a clout, bore the most monstrous evidences of indigence\nand extreme old age.\n\nFrom under her narrow brow, perfectly covered with deep wrinkles, two red\neyes, unprotected by lashes, gazed with leaden expression to the ground.\nOne yellow tooth protruded from her sunken upper lip, and, constantly\nmoving, sometimes came in contact with her sharp chin. The wrinkles on the\nlower part of her face and neck hung down like little bags, quivering at\nevery motion.\n\nShe breathed heavily and hoarsely; but her bare, distorted legs, though it\nseemed as if they would have barely strength to drag along over the ground,\nmoved with measured steps.\n\n\nVII.\n\nAlmost stumbling against the prince, the young wife precipitately set down\nthe tub, showed a little embarrassment, dropped a courtesy, and then with\nshining eyes glanced up at him, and, endeavoring to hide a slight smile\nbehind the sleeve of her embroidered shirt, ran up the steps, clattering in\nher wooden shoes.\n\n"Mother,[20] you take the water-yoke to aunt Nastasia," said she, pausing\nat the door, and addressing the old woman.\n\n[Footnote 20: _matushka._]\n\nThe modest young proprietor looked sternly but scrutinizingly at the rosy\nwoman, frowned, and turned to the old dame, who, seizing the yoke with her\ncrooked fingers, submissively lifted it to her shoulder, and was about to\ndirect her steps to the adjacent hut.\n\n"Your son at home?" asked the prince.\n\nThe old woman, her bent form bent more than usual, made an obeisance, and\ntried to say something in reply, but, suddenly putting her hand to her\nmouth, was taken with such a fit of coughing, that Nekhliudof without\nwaiting went into the hut.\n\nYukhvanka, who had been sitting on the bench in the "red corner,"[21] when\nhe saw the prince, threw himself upon the oven, as though he were anxious\nto hide from him, hastily thrust something away in the loft, and, with\nmouth and eyes twitching, squeezed himself close to the wall, as though to\nmake way for the prince.\n\n[Footnote 21: Where the holy images and the lighted taper are to be found.]\n\nYukhvanka was a light-complexioned fellow, thirty years of age, spare, with\na young, pointed beard. He was well proportioned, and rather handsome, save\nfor the unpleasant expression of his hazel eyes, under his knitted brow,\nand for the lack of two front teeth, which immediately attracted one\'s\nattention because his lips were short and constantly parted.\n\nHe wore a Sunday shirt with bright red gussets, striped print drawers, and\nheavy boots with wrinkled legs.\n\nThe interior of Vanka\'s hut was not as narrow and gloomy as that of\nChuris\'s, though it was fully as stifling, as redolent of smoke and\nsheep-skin, and showing as disorderly an array of peasant garments and\nutensils.\n\nTwo things here strangely attracted the attention,--a small damaged samovar\nstanding on the shelf, and a black frame near the _ikon_, with the remains\nof a dirty mirror and the portrait of some general in a red uniform.\n\nNekhliudof looked with distaste on the samovar, the general\'s portrait, and\nthe loft, where stuck out, from under some rags, the end of a\ncopper-mounted pipe. Then he turned to the peasant.\n\n"How do you do, Yepifan?" said he, looking into his eyes.\n\nYepifan bowed low, and mumbled, "Good-morning, \'slency,"[22] with a\npeculiar abbreviation of the last word, while his eyes wandered restlessly\nfrom the prince to the ceiling, and from the ceiling to the floor, and not\npausing on any thing. Then he hastily ran to the loft, dragged out a coat,\nand began to put it on.\n\n[Footnote 22: _vaciaso_ for _vashe siatelstvo_ (your excellency).]\n\n"Why are you putting on your coat?" asked Nekhliudof, sitting down on the\nbench, and evidently endeavoring to look at Yepifan as sternly as possible.\n\n"How can I appear before you without it, \'slency? You see we can\nunderstand"....\n\n"I have come to ask you why you need to sell a horse? Have you many horses?\nWhat horse do you wish to sell?" said the prince without wasting words, but\npropounding questions that he had evidently pre-considered.\n\n"We are greatly beholden to you, \'slency, that you do not think it beneath\nyou to visit me, a mere peasant," replied Yukhvanka, casting hasty glances\nat the general\'s portrait, at the stove, at the prince\'s boots, and every\nthing else except Nekhliudof\'s face. "We always pray God for your \'slency."\n\n"Why sell the horse?" repeated Nekhliudof, raising his voice, and coughing.\n\nYukhvanka sighed, tossed back his hair (again his glance roved about the\nhut), and noticing the cat that lay on the bench contentedly purring, he\nshouted out to her, "Scat, you rubbish!" and quickly addressed himself to\nthe barin. "A horse, \'slency, which ain\'t worth any thing. If the beast was\ngood for any thing, I shouldn\'t think of selling him, \'slency."\n\n"How many horses have you in all?"\n\n"Three horses, \'slency."\n\n"No colts?"\n\n"Of course, \'slency. There is one colt."\n\n\nVIII.\n\n"Come, show me your horses. Are they in the yard?"[23]\n\n[Footnote 23: _dvor._]\n\n"Indeed they are, \'slency. I have done as I was told, \'slency. Could we\nfail to heed you, \'slency? Yakof Ilyitch told me not to send the horses out\nto pasture. \'The prince,\' says he, \'is coming to look at them,\' and so we\ndidn\'t send them. For, of course, we shouldn\'t dare to disobey you,\n\'slency."\n\nWhile Nekhliudof was on his way to the door, Yukhvanka snatched down his\npipe from the loft, and flung it into the stove. His lips were still drawn\nin with the same expression of constraint as when the prince was looking at\nhim.\n\nA wretched little gray mare, with thin tail, all stuck up with burrs, was\nsniffing at the filthy straw under the pent roof. A long-legged colt two\nmonths old, of some nondescript color, with bluish hoofs and nose, followed\nclose behind her.\n\nIn the middle of the yard stood a pot-bellied brown gelding with closed\neyes and thoughtfully pendent head. It was apparently an excellent little\nhorse for a peasant.\n\n"So these are all your horses?"\n\n"No, indeed, \'slency. Here\'s still another mare, and here\'s the little\ncolt," replied Yukhvanka, pointing to the horses, which the prince could\nnot help seeing.\n\n"I see. Which one do you propose to sell?"\n\n"This here one, \'slency," he replied, waving his jacket in the direction of\nthe somnolent gelding, and constantly winking and sucking in his lips.\n\nThe gelding opened his eyes, and lazily switched his tail.\n\n"He does not seem to be old, and he\'s fairly plump," said Nekhliudof.\n"Bring him up, and show me his teeth. I can tell if he\'s old."\n\n"You can\'t tell by one indication, \'slency. The beast isn\'t worth a\nfarthing. He\'s peculiar. You have to judge both by tooth and limb,\n\'slency," replied Yukhvanka, smiling very gayly, and letting his eyes rove\nin all directions.\n\n"What nonsense! Bring him here, I tell you."\n\nYukhvanka stood still smiling, and made a deprecatory gesture; and it was\nonly when Nekhliudof cried angrily, "Well, what are you up to?" that he\nmoved toward the shed, seized the halter, and began to pull at the horse,\nscaring him, and getting farther and farther away as the horse resisted.\n\nThe young prince was evidently vexed to see this, and perhaps, also, he\nwished to show his own shrewdness.\n\n"Give me the halter," he cried.\n\n"Excuse me. It\'s impossible for you, \'slency,--don\'t"....\n\nBut Nekhliudof went straight up to the horse\'s head, and, suddenly seizing\nhim by the ears, threw him to the ground with such force, that the gelding,\nwho, as it seems, was a very peaceful peasant steed, began to kick and\nstrangle in his endeavors to get away.\n\nWhen Nekhliudof perceived that it was perfectly useless to exert his\nstrength so, and looked at Yukhvanka, who was still smiling, the thought\nmost maddening at his time of life occurred to him,--that Yukhvanka was\nlaughing at him, and regarding him as a mere child.\n\nHe reddened, let go of the horse\'s ears, and, without making use of the\nhalter, opened the creature\'s mouth, and looked at his teeth: they were\nsound, the crowns full, so far as the young man had time to make his\nobservations. No doubt the horse was in his prime.\n\nMeantime Yukhvanka came to the shed, and, seeing that the harrow was lying\nout of its place, seized it, and stood it up against the wattled hedge.\n\n"Come here," shouted the prince, with an expression of childish annoyance\nin his face, and almost with tears of vexation and wrath in his voice.\n"What! call this horse old?"\n\n"Excuse me, \'slency, very old, twenty years old at least. A horse that"....\n\n"Silence! You are a liar and a good-for-nothing. No decent peasant will\nlie, there\'s no need for him to," said Nekhliudof, choking with the angry\ntears that filled his throat.\n\nHe stopped speaking, lest he should be detected in weeping before the\npeasant. Yukhvanka also said nothing, and had the appearance of a man who\nwas almost on the verge of tears, blew his nose, and slowly shook his head.\n\n"Well, how are you going to plough when you have disposed of this horse?"\ncontinued Nekhliudof, calming himself with an effort, so as to speak in his\nordinary voice. "You are sent out into the field on purpose to drive the\nhorses for ploughing, and you wish to dispose of your last horse? And I\nshould like to know why you need to lie about it."\n\nIn proportion as the prince calmed down, Yukhvanka also calmed down. He\nstraightened himself up, and, while he sucked in his lips constantly, he\nlet his eyes rove about from one object to another.\n\n"Lie to you, \'slency? We are no worse off than others in going to work."\n\n"But what will you go on?"\n\n"Don\'t worry. We will do your work, \'slency," he replied, starting up the\ngelding, and driving him away. "Even if we didn\'t need money, I should want\nto get rid of him."\n\n"Why do you need money?"\n\n"Haven\'t no grain, \'slency; and besides, we peasants have to pay our debts,\n\'slency."\n\n"How is it you have no grain? Others who have families have corn enough;\nbut you have no family, and you are in want. Where is it all gone?"\n\n"Ate it up, \'slency, and now we haven\'t a bit. I will buy a horse in the\nautumn, \'slency."\n\n"Don\'t for a moment think of selling your horse."\n\n"But if we don\'t then what\'ll become of us, \'slency? No grain, and\nforbidden to sell any thing," he replied, turning his head to one side,\nsucking in his lips, and suddenly glancing boldly into the prince\'s face.\n"Of course we shall die of starvation."\n\n"Look here, brother," cried Nekhliudof, paling, and experiencing a feeling\nof righteous indignation against the peasant. "I can\'t endure such peasants\nas you are. It will go hard with you."\n\n"Just as you will, \'slency," he replied, shutting his eyes with an\nexpression of feigned submission: "I should not think of disobeying you.\nBut it comes not from any fault of mine. Of course, I may not please you,\n\'slency; at all events, I can do as you wish; only I don\'t see why I\ndeserve to be punished."\n\n"This is why: because your yard is exposed, your manure is not ploughed in,\nyour hedges are broken down, and yet you sit at home smoking your pipe, and\ndon\'t work; because you don\'t give a crust of bread to your mother, who\ngave you your whole place,[24] and you let your wife beat her, and she has\nto come to me with her complaints."\n\n[Footnote 24: _khozyaistvo._]\n\n"Excuse me, \'slency, I don\'t know what you mean by smoking your pipe,"\nreplied Yukhvanka in a constrained tone, showing beyond peradventure that\nthe complaint about his smoking touched him to the quick. "It is possible\nto say any thing about a man."\n\n"Now you\'re lying again! I myself saw"....\n\n"How could I venture to lie to you, \'slency?"\n\nNekhliudof made no answer, but bit his lip, and began to walk back and\nforth in the yard. Yukhvanka, standing in one place, and not lifting his\neyes, followed the prince\'s legs.\n\n"See here, Yepifan," said Nekhliudof in a childishly gentle voice, coming\nto a pause before the peasant, and endeavoring to hide his vexation, "it is\nimpossible to live so, and you are working your own destruction. Just\nthink. If you want to be a good peasant, then turn over a new leaf, cease\nyour evil courses, stop lying, don\'t get drunk any more, honor your mother.\nYou see, I know all about you. Take hold of your work; don\'t steal from the\ncrown woods, for the sake of going to the tavern. Think how well off you\nmight be. If you really need any thing, then come to me; tell me honestly,\nwhat you need and why you need it; and don\'t tell lies, but tell the whole\ntruth, and then I won\'t refuse you any thing that I can possibly grant."\n\n"Excuse me, \'slency, I think I understand you, \'slency," replied Yukhvanka\nsmiling as though he comprehended the entire significance of the prince\'s\nwords.\n\nThat smile and answer completely disenchanted Nekhliudof so far as he had\nany hope of reforming the man and of turning him into the path of virtue by\nmeans of moral suasion. It seemed to him hard that it should be wasted\nenergy when he had the power to warn the peasant, and that all that he had\nsaid was exactly what he should not have said.\n\nHe shook his head gravely, and went into the house. The old woman was\nsitting on the threshold and groaning heavily, as it seemed to the young\nproprietor as a sign of approbation of his words which she had overheard.\n\n"Here\'s something for you to get bread with," said Nekhliudof in her ear,\npressing a bank-note into her hand. "But keep it for yourself, and don\'t\ngive it to Yepifan, else he\'ll drink it up."\n\nThe old woman with her distorted hand laid hold of the door-post, and tried\nto get up. She began to pour out her thanks to the prince; her head began\nto wag, but Nekhliudof was already on the other side of the street when she\ngot to her feet.\n\n\nIX.\n\n"Davidka Byelui[25] asks for grain and posts," was what followed\nYukhvanka\'s case in the note-book.\n\n[Footnote 25: Little David White.]\n\nAfter passing by a number of places, Nekhliudof came to a turn in the lane,\nand there fell in with his overseer Yakof Alpatitch, who, while the prince\nwas still at a distance, took off his oiled cap, and pulling out a crumpled\nbandanna handkerchief began to wipe his fat red face.\n\n"Cover yourself, Yakof! Yakof, cover yourself, I tell you."\n\n"Where do you wish to go, your excellency?" asked Yakof, using his cap to\nshield his eyes from the sun, but not putting it on.\n\n"I have been at Yukhvanka\'s. Tell me, pray, why does he act so?" asked the\nprince as he walked along the street.\n\n"Why indeed, your excellency!" echoed the overseer as he followed behind\nthe prince in a respectful attitude. He put on his cap, and began to twist\nhis mustache.\n\n"What\'s to be done with him? He\'s thoroughly good for nothing, lazy,\nthievish, a liar; he persecutes his mother, and to all appearances he is\nsuch a confirmed good-for-nothing that there is no reforming him."\n\n"I didn\'t know, your excellency, that he displeased you so."\n\n"And his wife," continued the prince, interrupting the overseer, "seems\nlike a bad woman. The old mother is dressed worse than a beggar, and has\nnothing to eat; but she wears all her best clothes, and so does he. I\nreally don\'t know what is to be done with them."\n\nYakof knit his brows thoughtfully when Nekhliudof spoke of Yukhvanka\'s\nwife.\n\n"Well, if he behaves so, your excellency," began the overseer, "then it\nwill be necessary to find some way to correct things. He is in abject\npoverty like all the peasants who have no assistance, but he seems to\nmanage his affairs quite differently from the others. He\'s a clever fellow,\nknows how to read, and he\'s far from being a dishonest peasant. At the\ncollection of the poll-taxes he was always on hand. And for three years,\nwhile I was overseer he was bailiff, and no fault was found with him. In\nthe third year the warden took it into his head to depose him, so he was\nobliged to take to farming. Perhaps when he lived in town at the station he\ngot drunk sometimes, so we had to devise some means. They used to threaten\nhim, in fun, and he came to his senses again. He was good-natured, and got\nalong well with his family. But as it does not please you to use these\nmeans, I am sure I don\'t know what we are to do with him. He has really got\nvery low. He can\'t be sent into the army, because, as you may be pleased to\nremember, two of his teeth are missing. Yes, and there are others besides\nhim, I venture to remind you, who absolutely haven\'t any"....\n\n"Enough of that, Yakof," interrupted Nekhliudof, smiling shrewdly. "You and\nI have discussed that again and again. You know what ideas I have on this\nsubject; and whatever you may say to me, I still remain of the same\nopinion."\n\n"Certainly, your excellency, you understand it all," said Yakof, shrugging\nhis shoulders, and looking askance at the prince as though what he saw were\nworthy of no consideration. "But as far as the old woman is concerned, I\nbeg you to see that you are disturbing yourself to no purpose," he\ncontinued. "Certainly it is true that she has brought up the orphans, she\nhas fed Yukhvanka, and got him a wife, and so forth; but you know that is\ncommon enough among peasants. When the mother or father has transferred the\nproperty[26] to the son, then the new owners get control, and the old\nmother is obliged to work for her own living to the utmost of her strength.\nOf course they are lacking in delicate feelings, but this is common enough\namong the peasantry; and so I take the liberty of explaining to you that\nyou are stirred up about the old woman all for nothing. She is a clever old\nwoman, and a good housewife;[27] is there any reason for a gentleman to\nworry over her? Well, she has quarrelled with her daughter-in-law; maybe\nthe young woman struck her: that\'s like a woman, and they would make up\nagain while you torment yourself. You really take it all too much to\nheart," said the overseer looking with a certain expression of fondness\nmingled with condescension at the prince, who was walking silently with\nlong strides before him up the street.\n\n[Footnote 26: _khozyaistvo._]\n\n[Footnote 27: _khozyaika._]\n\n"Will you go home now?" he added.\n\n"No, to Davidka Byelui\'s or Kazyol\'s--what is his name?"\n\n"Well, he\'s a good-for-nothing, I assure you. All the race of the Kazyols\nare of the same sort. I haven\'t had any success with him; he cares for\nnothing. Yesterday I rode past the peasant\'s field, and his buckwheat\nwasn\'t even sowed yet. What do you wish done with such people? The old man\ntaught his son, but still he\'s a good-for-nothing just the same; whether\nfor himself or for the estate, he makes a bungle of every thing. Neither\nthe warden nor I have been able to do any thing with him: we\'ve sent him to\nthe station-house, and we\'ve punished him at home, because you are pleased\nnow to like"....\n\n"Who? the old man?"\n\n"Yes, the old man. The warden more than once has punished him before the\nwhole assembly, and, would you believe it? he would shake himself, go home,\nand be as bad as ever. And Davidka, I assure your excellency, is a\nlaw-abiding peasant, and a quick-witted peasant; that is, he doesn\'t smoke\nand doesn\'t drink," explained Yakof; "and yet he\'s worse than the other who\ngets drunk. There\'s nothing else to do with him than to make a soldier of\nhim or send him to Siberia. All the Kazyols are the same; and Matriushka\nwho lives in the village belongs to their family, and is the same sort of\ncursed good-for-nothing. Don\'t you care to have me here, your excellency?"\ninquired the overseer, perceiving that the prince did not heed what he was\nsaying.\n\n"No, go away," replied Nekhliudof absent-mindedly, and turned his steps\ntoward Davidka Byelui\'s.\n\nDavidka\'s hovel[28] stood askew and alone at the very edge of the village.\nIt had neither yard, nor cornkiln, nor barn. Only some sort of dirty stalls\nfor cattle were built against one side. On the other a heap of brush-wood\nand logs was piled up, in imitation of a yard.[29]\n\n[Footnote 28: _izba._]\n\n[Footnote 29: _dvor._]\n\nTall green steppe-grass was growing in the place where the court-yard\nshould have been.\n\nThere was no living creature to be seen near the hovel, except a sow lying\nin the mire at the threshold, and grunting.\n\nNekhliudof tapped at the broken window; but as no one made answer, he went\ninto the entry and shouted, "Holloa there!"[30]\n\n[Footnote 30: _khozyaeva_; literally, "master and mistress."]\n\nThis also brought no response. He passed through the entry, peered into the\nempty stalls, and entered the open hut.\n\nAn old red cock and two hens with ruffs were scratching with their legs,\nand strutting about over the floor and benches. When they saw a man they\nspread their wings, and, cackling with terror, flew against the walls, and\none took refuge on the oven.\n\nThe whole hut, which was not quite fourteen feet[31] square, was occupied\nby the oven with its broken pipe, a loom, which in spite of its being\nsummer-time was not taken down, and a most filthy table made of a split and\nuneven plank.\n\n[Footnote 31: Six _arshin_.]\n\nAlthough it was a dry situation, there was a filthy puddle at the door,\ncaused by the recent rain, which had leaked through roof and ceiling. Loft\nthere was none. It was hard to realize that this was a human habitation,\nsuch decided evidence of neglect and disorder was impressed upon both the\nexterior and the interior of the hovel; nevertheless, in this hovel lived\nDavidka Byelui and all his family.\n\nAt the present moment, notwithstanding the heat of the June day, Davidka,\nwith his head covered by his sheep-skin,[32] was fast asleep, curled up on\none corner of the oven. The panic-stricken hen, skipping up on the oven,\nand growing more and more agitated, took up her position on Davidka\'s back,\nbut did not awaken him.\n\n[Footnote 32: _polushubok._]\n\nNekhliudof, seeing no one in the hovel, was about to go, when a prolonged\nhumid sigh betrayed the sleeper.[33]\n\n[Footnote 33: _khozyain._]\n\n"Holloa! who\'s there?" cried the prince.\n\nA second prolonged sigh was heard from the oven.\n\n"Who\'s there? Come here!"\n\nStill another sigh, a sort of a bellow, and a heavy yawn responded to the\nprince\'s call.\n\n"Well, who are you?"\n\nSomething moved slightly on the oven. The skirt of a torn sheep-skin[34]\nwas lifted; one huge leg in a dilapidated boot was put down, then another,\nand finally Davidka\'s entire figure emerged. He sat up on the oven, and\nrubbed his eyes drowsily and morosely with his fist.\n\n[Footnote 34: _tulup._]\n\nSlowly shaking his head, and yawning, he looked down into the hut, and,\nseeing the prince, began to make greater haste than before; but still his\nmotions were so slow, that Nekhliudof had time to walk back and forth three\ntimes from the puddle to the loom before Davidka got down from the oven.\n\nDavidka Byelui or David White was white in reality: his hair, and his body,\nand his face all were perfectly white.\n\nHe was tall and very stout, but stout as peasants are wont to be, that is,\nnot in the waist alone, but in the whole body. His stoutness, however, was\nof a peculiar flabby, unhealthy kind. His rather comely face, with\npale-blue good-natured eyes, and a wide trimmed beard, bore the impress of\nill health. There was not the slightest trace of tan or blood: it was of a\nuniform yellowish ashen tint, with pale livid circles under the eyes, quite\nas though his face were stuffed with fat or bloated.\n\nHis hands were puffy and yellow, like the hands of men afflicted with\ndropsy, and they wore a growth of fine white hair. He was so drowsy that he\ncould scarcely open his eyes or cease from staggering and yawning.\n\n"Well, aren\'t you ashamed of yourself," began Nekhliudof, "sleeping in the\nvery best part of the day,[35] when you ought to be attending to your work,\nwhen you haven\'t any corn?"\n\n[Footnote 35: Literally, "middle of the white day."]\n\nAs Davidka little by little shook off his drowsiness, and began to realize\nthat it was the prince who was standing before him, he folded his arms\nacross his stomach, hung his head, inclining it a trifle to one side, and\ndid not move a limb or say a word; but the expression of his face and the\npose of his whole body seemed to say, "I know, I know; it is an old story\nwith me. Well, strike me, if it must be: I will endure it."\n\nHe evidently was anxious for the prince to get through speaking and give\nhim his thrashing as quickly as possible, even if he struck him severely on\nhis swollen cheeks, and then leave him in peace.\n\nPerceiving that Davidka did not understand him, Nekhliudof endeavored by\nvarious questions to rouse the peasant from his vexatiously obstinate\nsilence.\n\n"Why have you asked me for wood when you have enough to last you a whole\nmonth here, and you haven\'t had any thing to do? What?"\n\nDavidka still remained silent, and did not move.\n\n"Well, answer me."\n\nDavidka muttered something, and blinked his white eyelashes.\n\n"You must go to work, brother. What will become of you if you don\'t work?\nNow you have no grain, and what\'s the reason of it? Because your land is\nbadly ploughed, and not harrowed, and no seed put in at the right\ntime,--all from laziness. You asked me for grain: well, let us suppose that\nI gave it to you, so as to keep you from starving to death, still it is not\nbecoming to do so. Whose grain do I give you? whose do you think? Answer\nme,--whose grain do I give you?" demanded Nekhliudof obstinately.\n\n"The Lord\'s," muttered Davidka, raising his eyes timidly and questioningly.\n\n"But where did the Lord\'s grain come from? Think for yourself, who ploughed\nfor it? who harrowed? who planted it? who harvested it? The peasants, hey?\nJust look here: if the Lord\'s grain is given to the peasants, then those\npeasants who work most will get most; but you work less than anybody. You\nare complained about on all sides. You work less than all the others, and\nyet you ask for more of the Lord\'s grain than all the rest. Why should it\nbe given to you, and not to the others? Now, if all, like you, lay on their\nbacks, it would not be long before everybody in the world died of\nstarvation. Brother, you\'ve got to labor. This is disgraceful. Do you hear,\nDavid?"\n\n"I hear you," said the other slowly through his teeth.\n\n\nX.\n\nAt this moment, the window was darkened by the head of a peasant woman who\npassed carrying some linen on a yoke, and presently Davidka\'s mother came\ninto the hovel. She was a tall woman, fifty years old, very fresh and\nlively. Her ugly face was covered with pock-marks and wrinkles; but her\nstraight, firm nose, her delicate, compressed lips, and her keen gray eyes\ngave witness to her mental strength and energy.\n\nThe angularity of her shoulders, the flatness of her chest, the thinness of\nher hands, and the solid muscles of her black bare legs, made it evident\nthat she had long ago ceased to be a woman, and had become a mere drudge.\n\nShe came hurrying into the hovel, shut the door, set down her linen, and\nlooked angrily at her son.\n\nNekhliudof was about to say something to her, but she turned her back on\nhim, and began to cross herself before the black wooden _ikon_, that was\nvisible behind the loom.\n\nWhen she had thus done, she adjusted the dirty checkered handkerchief which\nwas tied around her head, and made a low obeisance to the prince.\n\n"A pleasant Lord\'s day to you, excellency," she said. "God spare you; you\nare our father."\n\nWhen Davidka saw his mother he grew confused, bent his back a little, and\nhung his head still lower.\n\n"Thanks, Arina," replied Nekhliudof. "I have just been talking with your\nson about your affairs."[36]\n\nArina or Arishka Burlak,[37] as the peasants used to call her when she was\na girl, rested her chin on the clinched fist of her right hand, which she\nsupported with the palm of the left, and, without waiting for the prince to\nspeak further, began to talk so sharply and loud that the whole hovel was\nfilled with the sound of her voice; and from outside it might have been\nconcluded that several women had suddenly fallen into a discussion.\n\n[Footnote 36: _khozyaistvo._]\n\n[Footnote 37: clod-hopper.]\n\n"What, my father, what is then to be said to him? You can\'t talk to him as\nto a man. Here he stands, the lout," she continued contemptuously, wagging\nher head in the direction of Davidka\'s woe-begone, stolid form.\n\n"How are _my_ affairs, your excellency? We are poor. In your whole village\nthere are none so bad off as we are, either for our own work or for yours.\nIt\'s a shame! And it\'s all his fault. I bore him, fed him, gave him to\ndrink. Didn\'t expect to have such a lubber. There is but one end to the\nstory. Grain is all gone, and no more work to be got out of him than from\nthat piece of rotten wood. All he knows is to lie on top of the oven, or\nelse he stands here, and scratches his empty pate," she said, mimicking\nhim.\n\n"If you could only frighten him, father! I myself beseech you: punish him,\nfor the Lord God\'s sake! send him off as a soldier,--it\'s all one. But he\'s\nno good to me,--that\'s the way it is."\n\n"Now, aren\'t you ashamed, Davidka, to bring your mother to this?" said\nNekhliudof reproachfully, addressing the peasant.\n\nDavidka did not move.\n\n"One might think that he was a sick peasant," continued Arina, with the\nsame eagerness and the same gestures; "but only to look at him you can see\nhe\'s fatter than the pig at the mill. It would seem as if he might have\nstrength enough to work on something, the lubber! But no, not he! He\nprefers to curl himself up on top of the oven. And even when he undertakes\nto do any thing, it would make you sick even to look at him, the way he\ngoes about the work! He wastes time when he gets up, when he moves, when he\ndoes any thing," said she, dwelling on the words, and awkwardly swaying\nfrom side to side with her angular shoulders.\n\n"Now, here to-day my old man himself went to the forest after wood, and\ntold him to dig a hole; but he did not even put his hand to the shovel."\n\nShe paused for a moment.\n\n"He has killed me," she suddenly hissed, gesticulating with her arms, and\nadvancing toward her son with threatening gesture. "Curse your smooth, bad\nface!"\n\nShe scornfully, and at the same time despairingly, turned from him, spat,\nand again addressed the prince with the same animation, still swinging her\narms, but with tears in her eyes.\n\n"I am the only one, benefactor. My old man is sick, old: yes, and I get no\nhelp out of him; and I am the only one at all. And this fellow hangs around\nmy neck like a stone. If he would only die, then it would be easier; that\nwould be the end of it. He lets me starve, the poltroon. You are our\nfather. There\'s no help for me. My daughter-in-law died of work, and I\nshall too."\n\n\nXI.\n\n"How did she die?" inquired Nekhliudof, somewhat sceptically.\n\n"She died of hard work, as God knows, benefactor. We brought her last year\nfrom Baburin," she continued, suddenly changing her wrathful expression to\none of tearfulness and grief. "Well, the woman[38] was young, fresh,\nobliging, good stuff. As a girl, she lived at home with her father in\nclover, never knew want; and when she came to us, then she learned to do\nour work,--for the estate and at home and everywhere.... She and I--that\nwas all to do it. What was it to me? I was used to it. She was going to\nhave a baby, good father; and she began to suffer pain; and all because she\nworked beyond her strength. Well, she did herself harm, the poor little\nsweetheart. Last summer, about the time of the feast of Peter and Paul, she\nhad a poor little boy born. But there was no bread. We ate whatever we\ncould get, my father. She went to work too soon: her milk all dried up. The\nbaby was her first-born. There was no cow, and we were mere peasants. She\nhad to feed him on rye. Well, of course, it was sheer folly. It kept pining\naway on this. And when the child died, she became so down-spirited,--she\nwould sob and sob, and howl and howl; and then it was poverty and work, and\nall the time going from bad to worse. So she passed away in the summer,\nthe sweetheart, at the time of the feast of St. Mary\'s Intercession. He\nbrought her to it, the beast," she cried, turning to her son with wrathful\ndespair. "I wanted to ask your excellency a favor," she continued after a\nshort pause, lowering her voice, and making an obeisance.\n\n[Footnote 38: _baba._]\n\n"What?" asked Nekhliudof in some constraint.\n\n"You see he\'s a young peasant still. He demands so much work of me. To-day\nI am alive, to-morrow I may die. How can he live without a wife? He won\'t\nbe any good to you at all. Help us to find some one for him, good father."\n\n"That is, you want to get a wife for him? What? What an idea!"\n\n"God\'s will be done! You are in the place of parents to us."\n\nAnd after making a sign to her son, she and the man threw themselves on the\nfloor at the prince\'s feet.\n\n"Why do you stoop to the ground?" asked Nekhliudof peevishly, taking her by\nthe shoulder. "You know I don\'t like this sort of thing. Marry your son, of\ncourse, if you have a girl in view. I should be very glad if you had a\ndaughter-in-law to help you."\n\nThe old woman got up, and began to rub her dry eyes with her sleeves.\nDavidka followed her example, and, rubbing his eyes with his weak fist,\nwith the same patiently-submissive expression, continued to stand, and\nlisten to what Arina said.\n\n"Plenty of brides, certainly. Here\'s Vasiutka Mikheikin\'s daughter, and a\nright good girl she is; but the girl would not come to us without your\nconsent."\n\n"Isn\'t she willing?"\n\n"No, benefactor, she isn\'t."\n\n"Well, what\'s to be done? I can\'t compel her. Select some one else. If you\ncan\'t find one at home, go to another village. I will pay for her, only she\nmust come of her own free will. It is impossible to marry her by force.\nThere\'s no law allows that; that would be a great sin."\n\n"_E-e-kh!_ benefactor! Is it possible that any one would come to us of her\nown accord, seeing our way of life, our wretchedness? Not even the wife of\na soldier would like to undergo such want. What peasant would let us have\nhis daughter?[39] It is not to be expected. You see we\'re in the very\ndepths of poverty. They will say, \'Since you starved one to death, it will\nbe the same with my daughter.\' Who is to give her?" she added, shaking her\nhead dubiously. "Give us your advice, excellency."\n\n[Footnote 39: _dyevka_, marriageable girl.]\n\n"Well, what can I do?"\n\n"Think of some one for us, kind sir," repeated Arina urgently. "What are we\nto do?"\n\n"How can I think of any one? I can\'t do any thing at all for you as things\nare."\n\n"Who will help us if you do not?" said Arina, drooping her head, and\nspreading her palms with an expression of melancholy discontent.\n\n"Here you ask for grain, and so I will give orders for some to be delivered\nto you," said the prince after a short silence, during which Arina sighed,\nand Davidka imitated her. "But I cannot do any thing more."\n\nNekhliudof went into the entry. Mother and son with low bows followed the\nprince.\n\n\nXII.\n\n"O-okh! alas for my wretchedness!" exclaimed Arina, sighing deeply.\n\nShe paused, and looked angrily at her son. Davidka immediately turned\naround, and, clumsily lifting his stout leg incased in a huge dirty boot\nover the threshold, took refuge in the opposite door.\n\n"What shall I do with him, father?" continued Arina, turning to the prince.\n"You yourself see what he is. He is not a bad man;[40] doesn\'t get drunk,\nand is peaceable; wouldn\'t hurt a little child. It\'s a sin to say hard\nthings of him. There\'s nothing bad about him, and God knows what has taken\nplace in him to make him so bad to himself. You see he himself does not\nlike it. Would you believe it, father,[41] my heart bleeds when I look at\nhim, and see what suffering he undergoes. You see, whatever he is, he is my\nson. I pity him. Oh, how I pity him!... You see, it isn\'t as though he had\ndone any thing against me or his father or the authorities. But, no: he\'s a\nbashful man, almost like a child. How can he bear to be a widower? Help us\nout, benefactor," she said once more, evidently desirous of removing the\nunfavorable impression which her bitter words might have left upon the\nprince. "Father, your excellency, I"--She went on to say in a confidential\nwhisper, "My wit does not go far enough to explain him. It seems as though\nbad men had spoiled him."\n\n[Footnote 40: _muzhik._]\n\n[Footnote 41: _batiushka._]\n\nShe paused for a moment.\n\n"If we could find the men, we might cure him."\n\n"What nonsense you talk, Arina! How can he be spoiled?"\n\n"My father, they spoil him so that they make him a no-man forever! Many bad\npeople in the world! Out of ill-will they take a handful of earth from out\nof one\'s path, or something of that sort; and one is made a no-man forever\nafter. Isn\'t that a sin? I think to myself, Might I not go to the old man\nDanduk, who lives at Vorobyevka? He knows all sorts of words; and he knows\nherbs, and he can make charms; and he finds water with a cross. Wouldn\'t he\nhelp me?" said the woman. "Maybe he will cure him."\n\n"What abjectness and superstition!" thought the young prince, shaking his\nhead gloomily, and walking back with long strides through the village.\n\n"What\'s to be done with him? To leave him in this situation is impossible,\nboth for myself and for the others and for him,--impossible," he said to\nhimself, counting off on his fingers these reasons.\n\n"I cannot bear to see him in this plight; but how extricate him? He renders\nnugatory all my best plans for the management of the estate. If such\npeasants are allowed, none of my dreams will ever be realized," he went on,\nexperiencing a feeling of despite and anger against the peasant in\nconsequence of the ruin of his plans. "To send him to Siberia, as Yakof\nsuggests, against his will, would that be good for him? or to make him a\nsoldier? That is best. At least I should be quit of him, and I could\nreplace him by a decent peasant."\n\nSuch was his decision.\n\nHe thought about this with satisfaction; but at the same time something\nobscurely told him that he was thinking with only one side of his mind, and\nnot wholly right.\n\nHe paused.\n\n"I will think about it some more," he said to himself. "To send him off as\na soldier--why? He is a good man, better than many; and I know.... Shall I\nfree him?" he asked himself, putting the question from a different side of\nhis mind. "It wouldn\'t be fair. Yes, it\'s impossible."\n\nBut suddenly a thought occurred to him that greatly pleased him. He smiled\nwith the expression of a man who has decided a difficult question.\n\n"I will take him to the house," he said to himself. "I will look after him\nmyself; and by means of kindness and advice, and selecting his employment,\nI will teach him to work, and reform him."\n\n\nXIII.\n\n"That\'s the way I\'ll do," said Nekhliudof to himself with a pleasant\nself-consciousness; and then, recollecting that he had still to go to the\nrich peasant Dutlof, he directed his steps toward a lofty and ample\nestablishment, with two chimneys, standing in the midst of the village.\n\nAs he passed a neighboring hut on his way thither, he stopped to speak with\na tall, disorderly-looking peasant-woman of forty summers, who came to meet\nhim.\n\n"A pleasant holiday, father,"[42] she said, with some show of assurance,\nstopping at a little distance from him with a pleased smile and a low\nobeisance.\n\n"Good-morning, my nurse. How are you? I was just going to see your\nneighbor."\n\n"Pretty well, your excellency, my father. It\'s a good idea. But won\'t you\ncome in? I beg you to. My old man would be very pleased."\n\n"Well, I\'ll come; and we\'ll have a little talk with you, nurse. Is this\nyour house?"\n\n"It is, sir."[42]\n\n[Footnote 42: _batiushka._]\n\nAnd the nurse led the way into the hut. Nekhliudof followed her into the\nentry, and sat down on a tub, and began to smoke a cigarette.\n\n"It\'s hot inside. It\'s better to sit down here, and have our talk," he said\nin reply to the woman\'s invitation to go into the hut.\n\nThe nurse was a well-preserved and handsome woman. In the features of her\ncountenance, and especially in her big black eyes, there was a strong\nresemblance to the prince himself. She folded her hands under her apron,\nand looking fearlessly at him, and incessantly moving her head, began to\ntalk with him.\n\n"Why is it, father? why do you wish to visit Dutlof?"\n\n"Oh, I am anxious for him to take thirty desiatins[43] of land of me, and\nenlarge his domain; and moreover I want him to buy some wood from me also.\nYou see, he has money, so why should it be idle? What do you think about\nit, nurse?"\n\n[Footnote 43: eighty-one acres.]\n\n"Well, what can I say? The Dutlofs are strong people: he\'s the leading\npeasant in the whole estate," replied the nurse, shaking her head. "Last\nsummer he built another building out of his own lumber. He did not call\nupon the estate at all. He has horses, and yearling colts besides, at least\nsix troikas, and cattle, cows, and sheep; so that it is a sight worth\nseeing when they are driven along the street from pasture, and the women of\nthe house come out to get them into the yard. There is such a crush of\nanimals at the gate that they can scarcely get through, so many of them\nthere are. And two hundred bee-hives at the very least. He is a strong\npeasant, and must have money."\n\n"But what do you think,--has he much money?" asked the prince.\n\n"Men say, out of spite of course, that the old man has no little money. But\nhe does not go round talking about it, and he does not tell even his sons,\nbut he must have. Why shouldn\'t he take hold of the woodland? Perhaps he\nis afraid of getting the reputation for money. Five years ago he went into\na small business with Shkalik the porter. They got some meadow-land; and\nthis Shkalik, some way or other, cheated him, so that the old man was three\nhundred rubles out of pocket. And from that time he has sworn off. How can\nhe help being forehanded, your excellency, father?" continued the nurse.\n"He has three farms, a big family, all workers; and besides, the old\nman--it is hard to say it--is a capital manager. He is lucky in every\nthing; it is surprising,--in his grain and in his horses and in his cattle\nand in his bees, and he\'s lucky in his children. Now he has got them all\nmarried off. He has found husbands for his daughters; and he has just\nmarried Ilyushka, and given him his freedom. He himself bought the letter\nof enfranchisement. And so a fine woman has come into his house."\n\n"Well, do they live harmoniously?" asked the prince.\n\n"As long as there\'s the right sort of a head to the house, they get along.\nYet even the Dutlofs--but of course that\'s among the women. The\ndaughters-in-law bark at each other a little behind the oven, but the old\nman generally holds them in hand; and the sons live harmoniously."\n\nThe nurse was silent for a little.\n\n"Now, the old man, we hear, wants to leave his eldest son, Karp, as master\nof the house. \'I am getting old,\' says he. \'It\'s my business to attend to\nthe bees.\' Well, Karp is a good peasant, a careful peasant; but he doesn\'t\nmanage to please the old man in the least. There\'s no sense in it."\n\n"Well, perhaps Karp wants to speculate in land and wood. What do you think\nabout it?", pursued the prince, wishing to learn from the woman all that\nshe knew about her neighbors.\n\n"Scarcely, sir,"[44] continued the nurse. "The old man hasn\'t disclosed his\nmoney to his son. As long as he lives, of course, the money in the house\nwill be under the old man\'s control; and it will increase all the time\ntoo."\n\n[Footnote 44: _batiushka._]\n\n"But isn\'t the old man willing?"\n\n"He is afraid."\n\n"What is he afraid of?"\n\n"How is it possible, sir, for a seignorial peasant to make a noise about\nhis money? And it\'s a hard question to decide what to do with money anyway.\nHere he went into business with the porter, and was cheated. Where was he\nto get redress? And so he lost his money. But with the proprietor he would\nhave any loss made good immediately, of course."\n\n"Yes, hence," ... said Nekhliudof, reddening. "But good-by, nurse."\n\n"Good-by, sir, your excellency. Greatly obliged to you."\n\n\nXIV.\n\n"Hadn\'t I better go home?" mused Nekhliudof, as he strode along toward the\nDutlof enclosure, and felt a boundless melancholy and moral weariness.\n\nBut at this moment the new deal gates were thrown open before him with a\ncreaking sound; and a handsome, ruddy fellow of eighteen in wagoner\'s\nattire appeared, leading a troika of powerful-limbed and still sweaty\nhorses. He hastily brushed back his blonde hair, and bowed to the prince.\n\n"Well, is your father at home, Ilya?" asked Nekhliudof.\n\n"At the bee-house, back of the yard," replied the youth, driving the\nhorses, one after the other, through the half-opened gates.\n\n"I will not give it up. I will make the proposal. I will do the best I\ncan," reflected Nekhliudof; and, after waiting till the horses had passed\nout, he entered Dutlof\'s spacious yard.\n\nIt was plain to see that the manure had only recently been carried away.\nThe ground was still black and damp; and in places, particularly in the\nhollows, were left red fibrous clots.\n\nIn the yard and under the high sheds, many carts stood in orderly rows,\ntogether with ploughs, sledges, harrows, barrels, and all sorts of farming\nimplements. Doves were flitting about, cooing in the shadows under the\nbroad solid rafters. There was an odor of manure and tar.\n\nIn one corner Karp and Ignat were fitting a new cross-bar to a large\niron-mounted, three-horse cart.\n\nAll three of Dutlof\'s sons bore a strong family resemblance. The youngest,\nIlya, who had met Nekhliudof at the gate, was beardless, of smaller\nstature, ruddier complexion, and more neatly dressed, than the others. The\nsecond, Ignat, was rather taller and darker. He had a wedge-shaped beard;\nand though he wore boots, a driver\'s shirt, and a lamb\'s-skin cap, he had\nnot such a festive, holiday appearance as his brother had.\n\nThe eldest, Karp, was still taller. He wore clogs, a gray kaftan, and a\nshirt without gussets. He had a reddish beard, trimmed; and his expression\nwas serious, even to severity.\n\n"Do you wish my father sent for, your excellency?" he asked, coming to meet\nthe prince, and bowing slightly and awkwardly.\n\n"No, I will go to him at the hives: I wish to see what he\'s building there.\nBut I should like a talk with you," said Nekhliudof, drawing him to the\nother side of the yard, so that Ignat might not overhear what he was about\nto talk about with Karp.\n\nThe self-confidence and degree of pride noticeable in the deportment of the\ntwo peasants, and what the nurse had told the young prince, so troubled\nhim, that it was difficult for him to make up his mind to speak with them\nabout the matter proposed.\n\nHe had a sort of guilty feeling, and it seemed to him easier to speak with\none brother out of the hearing of the other. Karp seemed surprised that the\nprince took him to one side, but he followed him.\n\n"Well, now," began Nekhliudof awkwardly,--"I wished to inquire of you if\nyou had many horses."\n\n"We have about five troikas, also some colts," replied Karp in a\nfree-and-easy manner, scratching his back.\n\n"Well, are your brothers going to take out relays of horses for the post?"\n\n"We shall send out three troikas to carry the mail. And there\'s Ilyushka,\nhe has been off with his team; but he\'s just come back."\n\n"Well, is that profitable for you? How much do you earn that way?"\n\n"What do you mean by profit, your excellency? We at least get enough to\nlive on and bait our horses, thank God for that!"\n\n"Then, why don\'t you take hold of something else? You see, you might buy\nwood, or take more land."\n\n"Of course, your excellency: we might rent some land if there were any\nconvenient."\n\n"I wish to make a proposition to you. Since you only make enough out of\nyour teaming to live on, you had better take thirty desiatins of land from\nme. All that strip behind Sapof I will let you have, and you can carry on\nyour farming better."\n\nAnd Nekhliudof, carried away by his plan for a peasant farm, which more\nthan once he had proposed to himself, and deliberated about, began fluently\nto explain to the peasant his proposition about it.\n\nKarp listened attentively to the prince\'s words.\n\n"We are very grateful for your kindness," said he, when Nekhliudof stopped,\nand looked at him in expectation of his answer. "Of course here there\'s\nnothing very bad. To occupy himself with farming is better for a peasant\nthan to go off as a whip. He goes among strangers; he sees all sorts of\nmen; he gets wild. It\'s the very best thing for a peasant, to occupy\nhimself with land."\n\n"You think so, do you?"\n\n"As long as my father is alive, how can I think, your excellency? It\'s as\nhe wills."\n\n"Take me to the bee-hives. I will talk with him."\n\n"Come with me this way," said Karp, slowly directing himself to the barn\nback of the house. He opened a low gate which led to the apiary, and after\nletting the prince pass through, he shut it, and returned to Ignat, and\nsilently took up his interrupted labors.\n\n\nXV.\n\nNekhliudof, stooping low, passed through the low gate, under the gloomy\nshed, to the apiary, which was situated behind the yard.\n\nA small space, surrounded by straw and a wattled hedge, through the chinks\nof which the light streamed, was filled with bee-hives symmetrically\narranged, and covered with shavings, while the golden bees were humming\naround them. Every thing was bathed in the warm and brilliant rays of the\nJuly sun.\n\nFrom the gate a well-trodden footway led through the middle to a wooden\nside-building, with a tin-foil image on it gleaming brightly in the sun.\n\nA few orderly young lindens lifting, above the thatched roof of the\nneighboring court-yard, their bushy tops, almost audibly rustled their\ndark-green, fresh foliage, in unison with the sound of the buzzing bees.\nAll the shadows from the covered hedge, from the lindens, and from the\nhives, fell dark and short on the delicate curling grass springing up\nbetween the planks.\n\nThe bent, small figure of the old man, with his gray hair and bald spot\nshining in the sun, was visible near the door of a straw-thatched structure\nsituated among the lindens. When he heard the creaking of the gate, the old\nman looked up, and wiping his heated, sweaty face with the flap of his\nshirt, and smiling with pleasure, came to meet the prince.\n\nIn the apiary it was so comfortable, so pleasant, so warm, so free! The\nfigure of the gray-haired old man, with thick wrinkles radiating from his\neyes, and wearing wide shoes on his bare feet, as he came waddling along,\ngood-naturedly and contentedly smiling, to welcome the prince to his own\nprivate possessions, was so ingenuously soothing that Nekhliudof for a\nmoment forgot the trying impressions of the morning, and his cherished\ndream came vividly up before him. He already saw all his peasants just as\nprosperous and contented as the old man Dutlof, and all smiling soothingly\nand pleasantly upon him, because to him alone they were indebted for their\nprosperity and happiness.\n\n"Would you like a net, your excellency? The bees are angry now," said the\nold man, taking down from the fence a dirty gingham bag fragrant of honey,\nand handing it to the prince. "The bees know me, and don\'t sting," he\nadded, with the pleasant smile that rarely left his handsome sunburned\nface.\n\n"I don\'t need it either. Well, are they swarming yet?" asked Nekhliudof,\nalso smiling, though without knowing why.\n\n"Yes, they are swarming, father, Mitri Mikolayevitch,"[45] replied the old\nman, throwing an expression of peculiar endearment into this form of\naddressing his barin by his name and patronymic. "They have only just begun\nto swarm; it has been a cold spring, you know."\n\n[Footnote 45: _batiushka_; Mitri Mikolayevitch, rustic for Dmitri\nNikolayevitch.]\n\n"I have just been reading in a book," began Nekhliudof, defending himself\nfrom a bee which had got entangled in his hair, and was buzzing under his\near, "that if the wax stands straight on the bars, then the bees swarm\nearlier. Therefore such hives as are made of boards ... with cross-b--"\n\n"You don\'t want to gesticulate; that makes it worse," said the little old\nman. "Now don\'t you think you had better put on the net?"\n\nNekhliudof felt a sharp pain, but by some sort of childish egotism he did\nnot wish to give in to it; and so, once more refusing the bag, continued to\ntalk with the old man about the construction of hives, about which he had\nread in "Maison Rustique," and which, according to his idea, ought to be\nmade twice as large. But another bee stung him in the neck, and he lost the\nthread of his discourse and stopped short in the midst of it.\n\n"That\'s well enough, father, Mitri Mikolayevitch," said the old man,\nlooking at the prince with paternal protection; "that\'s well enough in\nbooks, as you say. Yes; maybe the advice is given with some deceit, with\nsome hidden meaning; but only just let him do as he advises, and we shall\nbe the first to have a good laugh at his expense. And this happens! How are\nyou going to teach the bees where to deposit their wax? They themselves put\nit on the cross-bar, sometimes straight and sometimes aslant. Just look\nhere!" he continued, opening one of the nearest hives, and gazing at the\nentrance-hole blocked by a bee buzzing and crawling on the crooked comb.\n"Here\'s a young one. It sees; at its head sits the queen, but it lays the\nwax straight and sideways, both according to the position of the block,"\nsaid the old man, evidently carried away by his interest in his occupation,\nand not heeding the prince\'s situation. "Now, to-day, it will fly with the\npollen. To-day is warm; it\'s on the watch," he continued, again covering up\nthe hive and pinning down with a cloth the crawling bee; and then brushing\noff into his rough palm a few of the insects from his wrinkled neck.\n\nThe bees did not sting him; but as for Nekhliudof, he could scarcely\nrefrain from the desire to beat a retreat from the apiary. The bees had\nalready stung him in three places, and were buzzing angrily on all sides\naround his head and neck.\n\n"You have many hives?" he asked as he retreated toward the gate.\n\n"What God has given," replied Dutlof sarcastically. "It is not necessary to\ncount them, father; the bees don\'t like it. Now, your excellency, I wanted\nto ask a favor of you," he went on to say, pointing to the small posts\nstanding by the fence. "It was about Osip, the nurse\'s husband. If you\nwould only speak to him. In our village it\'s so hard to act in a neighborly\nway; it\'s not good."\n\n"How so?... Ah, how they sting!" exclaimed the prince, already seizing the\nlatch of the gate.\n\n"Every year now, he lets his bees out among my young ones. We could stand\nit, but strange bees get away their comb and kill them," said the old man,\nnot heeding the prince\'s grimaces.\n\n"Very well, by and by; right away," said Nekhliudof. And having no longer\nstrength of will to endure, he hastily beat a retreat through the gate,\nfighting his tormentors with both hands.\n\n"Rub it with dirt. It\'s nothing," said the old man, coming to the door\nafter the prince. The prince took some earth, and rubbed the spot where he\nhad been stung, and reddened as he cast a quick glance at Karp and Ignat,\nwho did not deign to look at him. Then he frowned angrily.\n\n\nXVI.\n\n"I wanted to ask you something about my sons, your excellency," said the\nold man, either pretending not to notice, or really not noticing, the\nprince\'s angry face.\n\n"What?"\n\n"Well, we are well provided with horses, praise the Lord! and that\'s our\ntrade, and so we don\'t have to work on your land."\n\n"What do you mean?"\n\n"If you would only be kind enough to let my sons have leave of absence,\nthen Ilyushka and Ignat would take three troikas, and go out teaming for\nall summer. Maybe they\'d earn something."\n\n"Where would they go?"\n\n"Just as it happened," replied Ilyushka, who at this moment, having put the\nhorses under the shed, joined his father. "The Kadminski boys went with\neight horses to Romen. Not only earned their own living, they say, but\nbrought back a gain of more than three hundred per cent. Fodder, they say,\nis cheap at _Odest_."\n\n"Well, that\'s the very thing I wanted to talk with you about," said the\nprince, addressing the old man, and anxious to draw him shrewdly into a\ntalk about the farm. "Tell me, please, if it would be more profitable to go\nto teaming than farming at home?"\n\n"Why not more profitable, your excellency?" said Ilyushka, again putting in\nhis word, and at the same time quickly shaking back his hair. "There\'s no\nway of keeping horses at home."\n\n"Well, how much do you earn in the summer?"\n\n"Since spring, as feed was high, we went to Kief with merchandise, and to\nKursk, and back again to Moscow with grits; and in that way we earned our\nliving. And our horses had enough, and we brought back fifteen rubles in\nmoney."\n\n"There\'s no harm in taking up with an honorable profession, whatever it\nis," said the prince, again addressing the old man. "But it seems to me\nthat you might find another form of activity. And besides, this work is\nsuch that a young man goes everywhere. He sees all sorts of people,--may\nget wild," he added, quoting Karp\'s words.\n\n"What can we peasants take up with, if not teaming?" objected the old man\nwith his sweet smile. "If you are a good driver, you get enough to eat, and\nso do your horses; but, as regards mischief, they are just the same as at\nhome, thank the Lord! It isn\'t the first time that they have been. I have\nbeen myself, and never saw any harm in it, nothing but good."\n\n"How many other things you might find to do at home! with fields and\nmeadows"--\n\n"How is it possible?" interrupted Ilyushka with animation. "We were born\nfor this. All the regulations are at our fingers\' ends. We like the work.\nIt\'s the most enjoyable we have, your excellency. How we like to go\nteaming!"\n\n"Your excellency, will you not do us the honor of coming into the house?\nYou have not yet seen our new domicile," said the old man, bowing low, and\nwinking to his son.\n\nIlyushka hastened into the house, and Nekhliudof and the old man followed\nafter him.\n\n\nXVII.\n\nAs soon as he got into the house, the old man bowed once more; then using\nhis coat-tail to dust the bench in the front of the room, he smiled, and\nsaid,--\n\n"What do you want of us, your excellency?"\n\nThe hut was bright and roomy, with a chimney; and it had a loft and berths.\nThe fresh aspen-wood beams, between which could be seen the moss, scarcely\nfaded, were as yet not turned dark. The new benches and the loft were not\npolished smooth, and the floor was not worn. One young peasant woman,\nrather lean, with a serious oval face, was sitting on a berth, and using\nher foot to rock a hanging cradle that was suspended from the ceiling by a\nlong hook. This was Ilya\'s wife.\n\nIn the cradle lay at full length a suckling child, scarcely breathing, and\nwith closed eyes.\n\nAnother young woman, robust and rosy-cheeked, with her sleeves rolled up\nabove her elbows, showing strong arms and hands red even higher than her\nwrists, was standing in front of the oven, and mincing onions in a wooden\ndish. This was Karp\'s wife.\n\nA pock-marked woman, showing signs of pregnancy, which she tried to\nconceal, was standing near the oven. The room was hot, not only from the\nsummer sun, but from the heat of the oven; and there was a strong smell of\nbaking bread.\n\nTwo flaxen-headed little boys and a girl gazed down from the loft upon the\nprince, with faces full of curiosity. They had come in, expecting something\nto eat.\n\nNekhliudof was delighted to see this happy household; and at the same time\nhe felt a sense of constraint in presence of these peasants, men and women,\nall looking at him. He flushed a little as he sat down on the bench.\n\n"Give me a crust of hot bread: I am fond of it," said he, and the flush\ndeepened.\n\nKarp\'s wife cut off a huge slice of bread, and handed it on a plate to the\nprince. Nekhliudof said nothing, not knowing what to say. The women also\nwere silent, the old man smiled benevolently.\n\n"Well, now why am I so awkward? as though I were to blame for something,"\nthought Nekhliudof. "Why shouldn\'t I make my proposition about the farm?\nWhat stupidity!" Still he remained silent.\n\n"Well, father Mitri Mikolayevitch, what are you going to say about my boys\'\nproposal?" asked the old man.\n\n"I should advise you absolutely not to send them away, but to have them\nstay at home, and work," said Nekhliudof, suddenly collecting his wits.\n"You know what I have proposed to you. Go in with me, and buy some of the\ncrown woods and some more land"--\n\n"But how are we going to get money to buy it, your excellency?" he asked,\ninterrupting the prince.\n\n"Why, it isn\'t very much wood, only two hundred rubles\' worth," replied\nNekhliudof.\n\nThe old man gave an indignant laugh.\n\n"Very good, if that\'s all. Why not buy it?" said he.\n\n"Haven\'t you money enough?" asked the prince reproachfully.\n\n"_Okh!_ Sir, your excellency!" replied the old man, with grief expressed in\nhis tone, looking apprehensively toward the door. "Only enough to feed my\nfamily, not enough to buy woodland."\n\n"But you know you have money,--what do you do with it?" insisted\nNekhliudof.\n\nThe old man suddenly fell into a terrible state of excitement: his eyes\nflashed, his shoulders began to twitch.\n\n"Wicked men may say all sorts of things about me," he muttered in a\ntrembling voice. "But, so may God be my witness!" he said, growing more and\nmore animated, and turning his eyes toward the ikon, "may my eyes crack,\nmay I perish with all my family, if I have any thing more than the fifteen\nsilver rubles which Ilyushka brought home; and we have to pay the poll-tax,\nyou yourself know that. And we built the hut"--\n\n"Well, well, all right," said the prince, rising from the bench. "Good-by,\nfriends."[46]\n\n[Footnote 46: _Proshchaite_, _khozyaeva_.]\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n"My God! my God!" was Nekhliudof\'s mental exclamation, as with long strides\nhe hastened home through the shady alleys of his weed-grown garden, and,\nabsent-mindedly, snapped off the leaves and branches which fell in his way.\n\n"Is it possible that my dreams about the ends and duties of my life are all\nidle nonsense? Why is it hard for me, and mournful, as though I were\ndissatisfied with myself because I imagined that having once begun this\ncourse I should constantly experience the fulness of the morally pleasant\nfeeling which I had when, for the first time, these thoughts came to me?"\n\nAnd with extraordinary vividness and distinctness he saw in his imagination\nthat happy moment which he had experienced a year before.\n\nHe had arisen very early, before every one else in the house, and feeling\npainfully those secret, indescribable impulses of youth, he had gone\naimlessly out into the garden, and from there into the woods; and, amid the\nenergetic but tranquil nature pulsing with the new life of Maytime, he had\nwandered long alone, without thought, and suffering from the exuberance of\nsome feeling, and not finding any expression for it.\n\nThen, with all the allurement of what is unknown, his youthful imagination\nbrought up before him the voluptuous form of a woman; and it seemed to him\nthat was the object of his indescribable longing. But another, deeper\nsentiment said, _Not that_, and impelled him to search and be disturbed in\nmind.\n\nWithout thought or desire, as always happens after extra activity, he lay\non his back under a tree, and looked at the diaphanous morning-clouds\ndrifting over him across the deep, endless sky.\n\nSuddenly, without any reason, the tears sprang to his eyes, and God knows\nin what way the thought came to him with perfect clearness, filling all his\nsoul and giving him intense delight,--the thought that love and\nrighteousness are the same as truth and enjoyment, and that there is only\none truth, and only one possible happiness, in the world.\n\nThe deeper feeling this time did not say, _Not that_. He sat up, and began\nto verify this thought.\n\n"That is it, that is it," said he to himself, in a sort of ecstasy,\nmeasuring all his former convictions, all the phenomena of his life, by the\ntruth just discovered to him, and as it seemed to him absolutely new.\n\n"What stupidity! All that I knew, all that I believed in, all that I\nloved," he had said to himself. "Love is self-denying; this is the only\ntrue happiness independent of chance," he had said over and over again,\nsmiling and waving his hands.\n\nApplying this thought on every side to life, and finding in it confirmation\nboth of life and that inner voice which told him that this was _it_, he had\nexperienced a new feeling of pleasant agitation and enthusiasm.\n\n"And so I ought to do good if I would be happy," he thought; and all his\nfuture vividly came up before him, not as an abstraction, but in images in\nthe form of the life of a proprietor.\n\nHe saw before him a huge field, conterminous with his whole life, which he\nwas to consecrate to the good, and in which really he should find\nhappiness. There was no need for him to search for a sphere of activity; it\nwas all ready. He had one out-and-out obligation: he had his serfs....\n\nAnd what comfortable and beneficent labor lay before him! "To work for this\nsimple, impressionable, incorruptible class of people; to lift them from\npoverty; to give them pleasure; to give them education which, fortunately,\nI will turn to use in correcting their faults, which arise from ignorance\nand superstition; to develop their morals; to induce them to love the\nright.... What a brilliant, happy future! And besides all this, I, who am\ngoing to do this for my own happiness, shall take delight in their\nappreciation, shall see how every day I shall go farther and farther toward\nmy predestined end. A wonderful future! Why could I not have seen this\nbefore?\n\n"And besides," so he had thought at the same time, "who will hinder me from\nbeing happy in love for a woman, in enjoyment of family?"\n\nAnd his youthful imagination portrayed before him a still more bewitching\nfuture.\n\n"I and my wife, whom I shall love as no one ever loved a wife before in the\nworld, we shall always live amid this restful, poetical, rural nature, with\nour children, maybe, and with my old aunt. We have our love for each other,\nour love for our children; and we shall both know that our aim is the\nright. We shall help each other in pressing on to this goal. I shall make\ngeneral arrangements; I shall give general aid when it is right; I shall\ncarry on the farm, the savings bank, the workshop. And she, with her dear\nlittle head, and dressed in a simple white dress, which she lifts above\nher dainty ankle as she steps through the mud, will go to the peasants\'\nschool, to the hospital, to some unfortunate peasant who in truth does not\ndeserve help, and everywhere carry comfort and aid.... Children, old men,\nwomen, will wait for her, and look on her as on some angel, as on\nProvidence. Then she will return, and hide from me the fact that she has\nbeen to see the unfortunate peasant, and given him money; but I shall know\nall, and give her a hearty hug, and rain kisses thick and fast on her\nlovely eyes, her modestly-blushing cheeks, and her smiling, rosy lips."\n\n\nXIX.\n\n"Where are those dreams?" the young man now asked himself as he walked home\nafter his round of visits. "Here more than a year has passed since I have\nbeen seeking for happiness in this course, and what have I found? It is\ntrue, I sometimes feel that I can be contented with myself; but this is a\ndry, doubtful kind of content. Yet, no; I am simply dissatisfied! I am\ndissatisfied because I find no happiness here; and I desire, I passionately\nlong for, happiness. I have not experienced delight, I have cut myself off\nfrom all that gives it. Wherefore? for what end? Does that make it easier\nfor any one?\n\n"My aunt was right when she wrote that it is easier to find happiness than\nto give it to others. Have my peasants become any richer? Have they learned\nany thing? or have they shown any moral improvement? Not the least. They\nare no better off, but it grows harder and harder every day for me. If I\nsaw any success in my undertakings, if I saw any signs of gratitude, ...\nbut, no! I see falsely directed routine, vice, untruthfulness,\nhelplessness. I am wasting the best years of my life."\n\nThus he said to himself, and he recollected that his neighbors, as he heard\nfrom his nurse, called him "a mere boy;" that he had no money left in the\ncounting-room; that his new threshing-machine, which he had invented, much\nto the amusement of the peasants, only made a noise, and did not thresh\nany thing when it had been set in motion for the first time in presence of\nnumerous spectators, who had gathered at the threshing-floor; that from day\nto day he had to expect the coming of the district judge for the list of\ngoods and chattels, which he had neglected to make out, having been\nengrossed in various new enterprises on his estate.\n\nAnd suddenly there arose before him, just as vividly as, before, that walk\nthrough the forest and his ideal of rural life had arisen,--just as vividly\nthere appeared his little university room at Moscow, where he used to sit\nhalf the night before a solitary candle, with his chum and his favorite boy\nfriend.\n\nThey used to read for five hours on a stretch, and study such stupid\nlessons in civil law; and when they were done with them, they would send\nfor supper, open a bottle of champagne, and talk about the future which\nawaited them.\n\nHow entirely different the young student had thought the future would be!\nThen the future was full of enjoyment, of varied occupation, brilliant with\nsuccess, and beyond a peradventure sure to bring them both to what seemed\nto them the greatest blessing in the world,--to fame.\n\n"He will go on, and go on rapidly, in that path," thought Nekhliudof of his\nfriend; "but I"....\n\nBut by this time he was already mounting the steps to his house; and near\nit were standing a score of peasants and house-servants, waiting with\nvarious requests to the prince. And this brought him back from dreams to\nthe reality.\n\nAmong the crowd was a ragged and blood-stained peasant-woman, who was\nlamenting and complaining of her father-in-law, who had been beating her.\nThere were two brothers, who for two years past had been going on shares in\ntheir domestic arrangements, and now looked at each other with hatred and\ndespair. There was also an unshaven, gray-haired domestic serf, with hands\ntrembling from the effects of intoxication; and this man was brought to the\nprince by his son, a gardener, who complained of his disorderly conduct.\nThere was a peasant, who had driven his wife out of the house because she\nhad not worked any all the spring. There was also the wife, a sick woman,\nwho sobbed, but said nothing, as she sat on the grass by the steps,--only\nshowed her inflamed and swollen leg, carelessly wrapped up in a filthy rag.\n\nNekhliudof listened to all the petitions and complaints; and after he had\ngiven advice to one, blamed others, and replied to still others, he began\nto feel a sort of whimsical sensation of weariness, shame, weakness, and\nregret. And he went to his room.\n\n\nXX.\n\nIn the small room occupied by Nekhliudof stood an old leather sofa\ndecorated with copper nails, a few chairs of the same description, an\nold-fashioned inlaid extension-table with scallops and brass mountings, and\nstrewn with papers, and an old-fashioned English grand with narrow keys,\nbroken and twisted.\n\nBetween the windows hung a large mirror with an old carved frame gilded. On\nthe floor, near the table, lay packages of papers, books, and accounts.\n\nThis room, on the whole, had a characterless and disorderly appearance; and\nthis lively disorder presented a sharp contrast with the affectedly\naristocratic arrangement of the other rooms of the great mansion.\n\nWhen Nekhliudof reached his room, he flung his hat angrily on the table,\nand sat down in a chair which stood near the piano, crossed his legs, and\nshook his head.\n\n"Will you have lunch, your excellency?" asked a tall, thin, wrinkled old\nwoman, who entered just at this instant, dressed in a cap, a great\nkerchief, and a print dress.\n\nNekhliudof looked at her for a moment or two in silence, as though\ncollecting his thoughts.\n\n"No: I don\'t wish any thing, nurse," said he, and again fell into thought.\n\nThe nurse shook her head at him in some vexation, and sighed.\n\n"Eh! Father, Dmitri Nikolayevitch, are you melancholy? Such tribulation\ncomes, but it will pass away. God knows"....\n\n"I am not melancholy. What have you brought, Malanya Finogenovna?" replied\nNekhliudof, endeavoring to smile.\n\n"Ain\'t melancholy! can\'t I see?" the old woman began to say with warmth.\n"The whole livelong day to be all sole alone! And you take every thing to\nheart so, and look out for every thing; and besides, you scarcely eat any\nthing. What\'s the reason of it? If you\'d only go to the city, or visit your\nneighbors, as others do! You are young, and the idea of bothering over\nthings so! Pardon me, little father, I will sit down," pursued the old\nnurse, taking a seat near the door. "You see, we have got into such a habit\nthat we lose fear. Is that the way gentlemen do? There\'s no good in it. You\nare only ruining yourself, and the people are spoiled. That\'s just like our\npeople: they don\'t understand it, that\'s a fact. You had better go to your\nauntie. What she wrote was good sense," said the old nurse, admonishing\nhim.\n\nNekhliudof kept growing more and more dejected. His right hand, resting on\nhis knee, lazily struck the piano, making a chord, a second, a third.\n\nNekhliudof moved nearer, drew his other hand from his pocket, and began to\nplay. The chords which he made were sometimes not premeditated, were\noccasionally not even according to rule, often remarkable for absurdity,\nand showed that he was lacking in musical talent; but the exercise gave him\na certain indefinable melancholy enjoyment.\n\nAt every modification in the harmony, he waited with muffled heart-beat for\nwhat would come out of it; and when any thing came, he, in a dark sort of\nway, completed with his imagination what was missing.\n\nIt seemed to him that he heard a hundred melodies, and a chorus, and an\norchestra simultaneously joining in with his harmony. But his chief\npleasure was in the powerful activity of his imagination; confused and\nbroken, but bringing up with striking clearness before him the most varied,\nmixed, and absurd images and pictures from the past and the future.\n\nNow it presents the puffy figure of Davidka Byelui, timidly blinking his\nwhite eyelashes at the sight of his mother\'s black fist with its net-work\nof veins; his bent back, and huge hands covered with white hairs,\nexhibiting a uniform patience and submission to fate, sufficient to\novercome torture and deprivation.\n\nThen he saw the brisk, presuming nurse, and, somehow, seemed to picture her\ngoing through the villages, and announcing to the peasants that they ought\nto hide their money from the proprietors; and he unconsciously said to\nhimself, "Yes, it is necessary to hide money from the proprietors."\n\nThen suddenly there came up before him the fair head of his future wife,\nfor some reason weeping and leaning on his shoulder in deep grief.\n\nThen he seemed to see Churis\'s kindly blue eyes looking affectionately at\nhis pot-bellied little son. Yes, he saw in him a helper and savior, apart\nfrom his son. "That is love," he whispered.\n\nThen he remembered Yukhvanka\'s mother, remembered the expression of\npatience and conciliation which, notwithstanding her prominent teeth and\nher irregular features, he recognized on her aged face.\n\n"It must be that I have been the first during her seventy years of life, to\nrecognize her good qualities," he said to himself, and whispered\n"Strange;" but he continued still to drum on the piano, and to listen to\nthe sounds.\n\nThen he vividly recalled his retreat from the bees, and the expressions on\nthe faces of Karp and Ignat, who evidently wanted to laugh though they made\nbelieve not look at him. He reddened, and involuntarily glanced at the old\nnurse, who still remained sitting by the door, looking at him with silent\nattention, occasionally shaking her gray head.\n\nHere, suddenly, he seemed to see a troika of sleek horses, and Ilyushka\'s\nhandsome, robust form, with bright curls, gayly shining, narrow blue eyes,\nfresh complexion, and delicate down just beginning to appear on lip and\nchin.\n\nHe remembered how Ilyushka was afraid that he would not be permitted to go\nteaming, and how eagerly he argued in favor of the work that he liked so\nwell. And he saw the gray early morning, that began with mist, and the\nsmooth paved road, and the long lines of three-horse wagons, heavily laden\nand protected by mats, and marked with big black letters. The stout,\ncontented, well-fed horses, thundering along with their bells, arching\ntheir backs, and tugging on the traces, pulled in unison up the hill,\nforcefully straining on their long-nailed shoes over the smooth road.\n\nAs the train of wagons reached the foot of the hill, the postman had\nquickly dashed by with jingling bells, which were echoed far and wide by\nthe great forest extending along on both sides of the road.\n\n"_A-a-ai!_" in a loud, boyish voice, shouts the head driver, who has a\nbadge on his lambskin cap, and swings his whip around his head.\n\nBeside the front wheel of the front team, the redheaded, cross-looking\nKarp is walking heavily in huge boots. In the second team Ilyushka shows\nhis handsome head, as he sits on the driver\'s seat playing the bugle. Three\ntroika-wagons loaded with boxes, with creaking wheels, with the sound of\nbells and shouts, file by. Ilyushka once more hides his handsome face under\nthe matting, and falls off to sleep.\n\nNow it is a fresh, clear evening. The deal gates open for the weary horses\nas they halt in front of the tavern yard; and one after the other, the high\nmat-covered teams roll in across the planks that lie at the gates, and come\nto rest under the wide sheds.\n\nIlyushka gayly exchanges greetings with the light-complexioned,\nwide-bosomed landlady, who asks, "Have you come far? and will there be many\nof you to supper?" and at the same time looks with pleasure on the handsome\nlad, with her bright, kindly eyes.\n\nAnd now, having unharnessed the horses, he goes into the warm house[47]\ncrowded with people, crosses himself, sits down at the generous wooden\nbowl, and enters into lively conversation with the landlady and his\ncompanions.\n\n[Footnote 47: _izba_.]\n\nAnd then he goes to bed in the open air, under the stars which gleam down\ninto the shed. His bed is fragrant hay, and he is near the horses, which,\nstamping and snorting, eat their fodder in the wooden cribs. He goes to the\nshed, turns toward the east, and after crossing himself thirty times in\nsuccession on his broad brawny chest, and throwing back his bright curls,\nhe repeats "Our Father" and "Lord have mercy" a score of times, and\nwrapping himself, head and all, in his cloak, sleeps the healthy, dreamless\nsleep of strong, fresh manhood.\n\nAnd here he sees in his vision the city of Kief, with its saints and\nthrongs of priests; Romen, with its merchants and merchandise; he sees\n_Odest_, and the distant blue sea studded with white sails, and the city of\nTsar-grad,[48] with its golden palaces, and the white-breasted, dark-browed\nTurkish maidens; and thither he flies, lifting himself on invisible wings.\n\n[Footnote 48: Constantinople.]\n\nHe flies freely and easily, always farther and farther away, and sees below\nhim golden cities bathed in clear effulgence, and the blue sky with bright\nstars, and a blue sea with white sails; and smoothly and pleasantly he\nflies, always farther and farther away....\n\n"Splendid!" whispers Nekhliudof to himself; and the thought, "Why am I not\nIlyushka?" comes to him.\n\n\n\n\nLUCERNE.\n\n_FROM THE RECOLLECTIONS OF PRINCE NEKHLIUDOF._\n\n\nJULY 20,1857.\n\nYesterday evening I arrived at Lucerne, and put up at the best inn there,\nthe Schweitzerhof.\n\n"Lucerne, the chief city of the canton, situated on the shore of the\nVierwaldstaetter See," says Murray, "is one of the most romantic places of\nSwitzerland: here cross three important highways, and it is only an hour\'s\ndistance by steamboat to Mount Righi, from which is obtained one of the\nmost magnificent views in the world."\n\nWhether that be true or no, other Guides say the same thing, and\nconsequently at Lucerne there are throngs of travellers of all\nnationalities, especially the English.\n\nThe magnificent five-storied building of the Hotel Schweitzerhof is\nsituated on the quay, at the very edge of the lake, where in olden times\nthere used to be the crooked covered wooden bridge[49] with chapels on the\ncorners and pictures on the roof. Now, thanks to the tremendous inroad of\nEnglishmen, with their necessities, their tastes, and their money, the old\nbridge has been torn down, and in its place has been erected a granite\nquay, straight as a stick. On the quay are built the long, quadrangular\nfive-storied houses; in front of the houses two rows of lindens have been\nset out and provided with supports, and between the lindens are the usual\nsupply of green benches.\n\n[Footnote 49: Hofbruecke, torn down in 1852.]\n\nThis is the promenade; and here back and forth stroll the Englishwomen in\ntheir Swiss straw hats, and the Englishmen in simple and comfortable\nattire, and rejoice in that which they have caused to be created. Possibly\nthese quays and houses and lindens and Englishmen would be excellent in\ntheir way anywhere else, but here they seem discordant amid this strangely\ngrandiose and at the same time indescribably harmonious and smiling nature.\n\nAs soon as I went up to my room, and opened the window facing the lake, the\nbeauty of the sheet of water, of these mountains, and of this sky, at the\nfirst moment literally dazzled and overwhelmed me. I experienced an inward\nunrest, and the necessity of expressing in some manner the feelings that\nsuddenly filled my soul to overflowing. I felt a desire to embrace,\npowerfully to embrace, some one, to tickle him, or to pinch him; in short,\nto do to him and to myself something extraordinary.\n\nIt was seven o\'clock in the evening. The rain had been falling all day, but\nnow it had cleared off.\n\nThe lake, blue as heated sulphur, spread out before my windows smooth and\nmotionless, like a concave mirror between the variegated green shores; its\nsurface was dotted with boats, which left behind them vanishing trails.\nFarther away it was contracted between two monstrous headlands, and,\ndarkling, set itself against and disappeared behind a confused pile of\nmountains, clouds, and glaciers. In the foreground stretched a panorama of\nmoist, fresh green shores, with reeds, meadows, gardens, and villas.\nFarther away, the dark-green wooded heights, crowned with the ruins of\nfeudal castles; in the background, the rolling, pale-lilac-colored vista of\nmountains, with fantastic peaks built up of crags and dead white mounds of\nsnow. And every thing was bathed in a fresh, transparent atmosphere of\nazure blue, and kindled by the warm rays of the setting sun, bursting forth\nthrough the riven skies.\n\nNot on the lake nor on the mountains nor in the skies was there a single\ncompleted line, a single unmixed color, a single moment of repose;\neverywhere motion, irregularity, fantasy, endless conglomeration and\nvariety of shades and lines; and above all, a calm, a softness, a unity,\nand a striving for the beautiful.\n\nAnd here amid this indefinable, confused, unfettered beauty, before my very\nwindow, stretched in stupid kaleidoscopic confusion the white line of the\nquay, the lindens with their supports, and the green seats,--miserable,\ntasteless creations of human ingenuity, not subordinated, like the distant\nvillas and ruins, to the general harmony of the beautiful scene, but on the\ncontrary brutally contradicting it.... Constantly, though against my will,\nmy eyes were attracted to that horribly straight line of the quay; and\nmentally I should have liked to spurn it, to demolish it like a black spot\ndisfiguring the nose beneath one\'s eye.\n\nBut the quay with the sauntering Englishmen remained where it was, and I\ninvoluntarily tried to find a point of view where it would be out of my\nsight. I succeeded in finding such a view; and till dinner was ready I took\ndelight, alone by myself, in this incomplete and therefore the more\nenjoyable feeling of oppression that one experiences in the solitary\ncontemplation of natural beauty.\n\nAbout half-past seven I was called to dinner. Two long tables,\naccommodating at least a hundred persons, were spread in the great,\nmagnificently decorated dining-room on the first floor.... The silent\ngathering of the guests lasted three minutes,--the _frou-frou_ of women\'s\ndresses, the soft steps, the softly-spoken words addressed to the courtly\nand elegant waiters. And all the places were occupied by ladies and\ngentlemen dressed elegantly, even richly, and for the most part in perfect\ntaste.\n\nAs is apt to be the case in Switzerland, the majority of the guests were\nEnglish, and this gave the ruling characteristics of the common table: that\nis, a strict decorum regarded as an obligation, a reserve founded not in\npride but in the absence of any necessity for social relationship, and\nfinally a uniform sense of satisfaction felt by each in the comfortable and\nagreeable gratification of his wants.\n\nOn all sides gleamed the whitest laces, the whitest collars, the whitest\nteeth,--natural and artificial,--the whitest complexions and hands. But the\nfaces, many of which were very handsome, bore the expression merely of\nindividual prosperity, and absolute absence of interest in all that\nsurrounded them unless it bore directly on their own individual selves; and\nthe white hands glittering with rings, or protected by mitts, moved only\nfor the purpose of straightening collars, cutting meat, or filling\nwine-glasses; no soul-felt emotion was betrayed in these actions.\n\nOccasionally members of some one family would exchange remarks in subdued\nvoices, about the excellence of such and such a dish or wine, or about the\nbeauty of the view from Mount Righi.\n\nIndividual tourists, whether men or women, sat alongside of each other in\nsilence, and did not even seem to see each other. If it happened\noccasionally, that, out of this five-score human beings, two spoke to each\nother, the topic of their conversation consisted uniformly in the weather,\nor the ascent of the Righi.\n\nKnives and forks scarcely rattled on the plates, so perfect was the\nobservance of propriety; and no one dared to convey pease and vegetables to\nthe mouth otherwise than on the fork. The waiters, involuntarily subdued by\nthe universal silence, asked in a whisper what wine you would be pleased to\norder.\n\nSuch dinners invariably depress me: I dislike them, and before they are\nover I become blue.... It always seems to me as if I were in some way to\nblame; just as when I was a boy I was set upon a chair in consequence of\nsome naughtiness, and bidden ironically, "Now rest a little while, my dear\nyoung fellow." And all the time my young blood was pulsing through my\nveins, and in the other room I could hear the merry shouts of my brothers.\n\nI used to try to rebel against this feeling of being choked down, which I\nexperienced at such dinners, but in vain. All these dead-and-alive faces\nhave an irresistible ascendency over me, and I myself become also as one\ndead. I have no desires, I have no thoughts: I do not even observe.\n\nAt first I attempted to enter into conversation with my neighbors; but I\ngot no response beyond the phrases which had been repeated in that place a\nhundred times, a thousand times, with absolutely no variation of\ncountenance.\n\nAnd yet these people were by no means all stupid and feelingless; but\nevidently many of them, though they seemed so dead, had got into the habit\nof leading self-centred lives, which in reality were far more complicated\nand interesting than my own. Why, then, should they deprive themselves of\none of the greatest enjoyments of life,--the enjoyment that comes from the\nintercourse of man with man?\n\nHow different it used to be in our _pension_ at Paris, where twenty of us,\nbelonging to as many different nationalities, professions, and\nindividualities, met together at a common table, and, under the influence\nof the Gallic sociability, found the keenest zest!\n\nThere, from the very moment that we sat down, from one end of the table to\nthe other, was general conversation, sandwiched with witticisms and puns,\nthough often in a broken speech. There every one, without being solicitous\nfor the proprieties, said whatever came into his head. There we had our own\nphilosopher, our own disputant, our own _bel esprit_, our own butt,--all\ncommon property.\n\nThere, immediately after dinner, we would move the table to one side, and,\nwithout paying too much attention to rhythm, take to dancing the polka on\nthe dusty carpet, and often keep it up till evening. There, though we were\nrather flirtatious, and not over-wise, but perfectly respectable, still we\nwere human beings.\n\nAnd the Spanish countess with romantic proclivities, and the Italian\n_abbate_ who insisted on declaiming from the Divine Comedy after dinner,\nand the American doctor who had the _entree_ into the Tuileries, and the\nyoung dramatic author with long hair, and the pianist who, according to her\nown account, had composed the best polka in existence, and the unhappy\nwidow who was a beauty, and wore three rings on every finger,--all of us\nenjoyed this society, which, though somewhat superficial, was human and\npleasant. And we each carried away from it hearty recollections of each\nother, perhaps lighter in some cases, and more serious in others.\n\nBut at these English _table-d\'hote_ dinners, as I look at all these laces,\nribbons, jewels, pomaded locks, and silken dresses, I often think how many\nliving women would be happy, and would make others happy, with these\nadornments.\n\nStrange to think how many friends and lovers--most fortunate friends and\nlovers--are sitting here side by side, without, perhaps, knowing it! And\nGod knows why they never come to this knowledge, and never give each other\nthis happiness, which they might so easily give, and which they so long\nfor.\n\nI began to feel blue, as invariably happens after such a dinner; and,\nwithout waiting for dessert, I sallied out in the same frame of mind for a\nconstitutional through the city. My melancholy frame of mind was not\nrelieved, but rather confirmed by the narrow, muddy streets without\nlanterns, the shuttered shops, the encounters with drunken workmen, and\nwith women hastening after water, or in bonnets, glancing around them as\nthey turned the corners.\n\nIt was perfectly dark in the streets, when I returned to the hotel without\ncasting a glance about me, or having an idea in my head. I hoped that sleep\nwould put an end to my melancholy. I experienced that peculiar spiritual\nchill and loneliness and heaviness, which, without any reason, beset those\nwho are just arrived in any new place.\n\nLooking steadfastly down, I walked along the quay to the Schweitzerhof,\nwhen suddenly my ear was struck by the strains of a peculiar but thoroughly\nagreeable and sweet music.\n\nThese strains had an immediately enlivening effect upon me. It was as\nthough a bright, cheerful light had poured into my soul. I felt contented,\ngay. My slumbering attention was awakened again to all surrounding objects;\nand the beauty of the night and the lake, to which till then I had been\nindifferent, suddenly came over me with quickening force like a novelty.\n\nI involuntarily took in at a glance the dark sky with gray clouds flecking\nits deep blue, now lighted by the rising moon, the glassy dark-green lake\nwith its surface reflecting the lighted windows, and far away the snowy\nmountains; and I heard the croaking of the frogs over on the Freshenburg\nshore, and the dewy fresh call of the quail.\n\nDirectly in front of me, in the spot whence the sounds of music had first\ncome, and which still especially attracted my attention, I saw, amid the\nsemi-darkness on the street, a throng of people standing in a semi-circle,\nand in front of the crowd, at a little distance, a small man in dark\nclothes.\n\nBehind the throng and the man, there stood out harmoniously against the\ndark, ragged sky, gray and blue, the black tops of a few Lombardy poplars\nin some garden, and, rising majestically on high, the two stern spires that\nstand on the towers of the ancient cathedral.\n\nI drew nearer, and the strains became more distinct. At some distance I\ncould clearly distinguish the full accords of a guitar, sweetly swelling in\nthe evening air, and several voices, which, while taking turns with each\nother, did not sing any definite theme, but gave suggestions of one in\nplaces wherever the melody was most pronounced.\n\nThe theme was in somewhat the nature of a mazurka, sweet and graceful. The\nvoices sounded now near at hand, now far distant; now a bass was heard, now\na tenor, now a falsetto such as the Tyrolese warblers are wont to sing.\n\nIt was not a song, but the graceful masterly sketch of a song. I could not\ncomprehend what it was, but it was beautiful.\n\nThose voluptuous, soft chords of the guitar, that sweet, gentle melody, and\nthat solitary figure of the man in black, amid the fantastic environment of\nthe lake, the gleaming moon, and the twin spires of the cathedral rising in\nmajestic silence, and the black tops of the poplars,--all was strange and\nperfectly beautiful, or at least seemed so to me.\n\nAll the confused, arbitrary impressions of life suddenly became full of\nmeaning and beauty. It seemed to me as though a fresh fragrant flower had\nsprung up in my soul. In place of the weariness, dulness, and indifference\ntoward every thing in the world, which I had been feeling the moment\nbefore, I experienced a necessity for love, a fulness of hope, and an\nunbounded enjoyment of life.\n\n"What dost thou desire, what dost thou long for?" an inner voice seemed to\nsay. "Here it is. Thou art surrounded on all sides by beauty and poetry.\nBreathe it in, in full, deep draughts, as long as thou hast strength. Enjoy\nit to the full extent of thy capacity. \'Tis all thine, all blessed!"\n\nI drew nearer. The little man was, as it seemed, a travelling Tyrolese. He\nstood before the windows of the hotel, one leg a little advanced, his head\nthrown back; and, as he thrummed on the guitar, he sang his graceful song\nin all those different voices.\n\nI immediately felt an affection for this man, and a gratefulness for the\nchange which he had brought about in me.\n\nThe singer, so far as I was able to judge, was dressed in an old black\ncoat. He had short black hair, and he wore a civilian\'s hat that was no\nlonger new. There was nothing artistic in his attire, but his clever and\nyouthfully gay motions and pose, together with his diminutive stature,\nformed a pleasing and at the same time pathetic spectacle.\n\nOn the steps, in the windows, and on the balconies of the brilliantly\nlighted hotel, stood ladies handsomely decorated and attired, gentlemen\nwith polished collars, porters and lackeys in gold-embroidered liveries; in\nthe street, in the semi-circle of the crowd, and farther along on the\nsidewalk, among the lindens, were gathered groups of well-dressed waiters,\ncooks in white caps and aprons, and young girls wandering about with arms\nabout each other\'s waists.\n\nAll, it seemed, were under the influence of the same feeling that I myself\nexperienced. All stood in silence around the singer, and listened\nattentively. Silence reigned, except in the pauses of the song, when there\ncame from far away across the waters the regular click of a hammer, and\nfrom the Freshenburg shore rang in fascinating monotone the voices of the\nfrogs, interrupted by the mellow, monotonous call of the quail.\n\nThe little man in the darkness, in the midst of the street, poured out his\nheart like a nightingale, in couplet after couplet, song after song. Though\nI had come close to him, his singing continued to give me greater and\ngreater gratification.\n\nHis voice, which was not of great power, was extremely pleasant and tender;\nthe taste and feeling for rhythm which he displayed in the control of it\nwere extraordinary, and proved that he had great natural gifts.\n\nAfter he sung each couplet, he invariably repeated the theme in variation,\nand it was evident that all his graceful variations came to him at the\ninstant, spontaneously.\n\nAmong the crowd, and above on the Schweitzerhof, and near by on the\nboulevard, were heard frequent murmurs of approval, though generally the\nmost respectful silence reigned.\n\nThe balconies and the windows kept filling more and more with handsomely\ndressed men and women leaning on their elbows, and picturesquely\nilluminated by the lights in the house.\n\nPromenaders came to a halt, and in the darkness on the quay stood men and\nwomen in little groups. Near me, at some distance from the common crowd,\nstood an aristocratic cook and lackey, smoking their cigars. The cook was\nforcibly impressed by the music, and at every high falsetto note\nenthusiastically nodded his head to the lackey, and nudged him with his\nelbow with an expression of astonishment that seemed to say, "How he sings!\nhey?"\n\nThe lackey, whose careless smile betrayed the depth of feeling that he\nexperienced, replied to the cook\'s nudges by shrugging his shoulders, as if\nto show that it was hard enough for him to be made enthusiastic, and that\nhe had heard much better music.\n\nIn one of the pauses of his song, while the minstrel was clearing his\nthroat, I asked the lackey who he was, and if he often came there.\n\n"Twice this summer he has been here," replied the lackey. "He is from\nAargau; he goes round begging."\n\n"Well, do many like him come round here?" I asked.\n\n"Oh, yes," replied the lackey, not comprehending the full force of what I\nasked; but, immediately after, recollecting himself, he added, "Oh, no.\nThis one is the only one I ever heard here. No one else."\n\nAt this moment the little man had finished his first song, briskly twanged\nhis guitar, and said something in his German patois, which I could not\nunderstand, but which brought forth a hearty round of laughter from the\nsurrounding throng.\n\n"What was that he said?" I asked.\n\n"He says that his throat is dried up, he would like some wine," replied the\nlackey who was standing near me.\n\n"What? is he rather fond of the glass?"\n\n"Yes, all that sort of people are," replied the lackey, smiling and\npointing at the minstrel.\n\nThe minstrel took off his cap, and swinging his guitar went toward the\nhotel. Raising his head, he addressed the ladies and gentlemen standing by\nthe windows and on the balconies, saying in a half-Italian, half-German\naccent, and with the same intonation that jugglers use in speaking to their\naudiences,--\n\n"_Messieurs et mesdames, si vous croyez que je gagne quelque chose, vous\nvous trompez: je ne suis qu\'un pauvre tiaple._"\n\nHe stood in silence a moment, but as no one gave him any thing, he once\nmore took up his guitar and said,--\n\n"_A present, messieurs et mesdames, je vous chanterai l\'air du Righi._"\n\nHis hotel audience made no response, but stood in expectation of the coming\nsong. Below on the street a laugh went round, probably in part because he\nhad expressed himself so strangely, and in part because no one had given\nhim any thing.\n\nI gave him a few centimes, which he deftly changed from one hand to the\nother, and bestowed them in his vest-pocket; and then, replacing his cap,\nbegan once more to sing the graceful, sweet Tyrolese melody which he had\ncalled _l\'air du Righi_.\n\nThis song, which formed the last on his programme, was even better than the\npreceding, and from all sides in the wondering throng were heard sounds of\napprobation.\n\nHe finished. Again he swung his guitar, took off his cap, held it out in\nfront of him, went two or three steps nearer to the windows, and again\nrepeated his stock phrase,--\n\n"_Messieurs et mesdames, si vous croyez que je gagne quelque chose_," which\nhe evidently considered to be very shrewd and witty; but in his voice and\nmotions I perceived a certain irresolution and childish timidity which were\nespecially touching in a person of such diminutive stature.\n\nThe elegant public, still picturesquely grouped in the lighted windows and\non the balconies, were shining in their rich attire; a few conversed in\nsoberly discreet tones, apparently about their singer who was standing\nthere below them with outstretched hand; others gazed down with attentive\ncuriosity on the little black figure; on one balcony could be heard the\nmerry, ringing laughter of some young girl.\n\nIn the surrounding crowd the talk and laughter grew constantly louder and\nlouder.\n\nThe singer for the third time repeated his phrase, but in a still weaker\nvoice, and did not even end the sentence; and again he stretched his hand\nwith his cap, but instantly drew it back. Again not one of those\nbrilliantly dressed scores of people standing to listen to him threw him a\npenny.\n\nThe crowd laughed heartlessly.\n\nThe little singer, so it seemed to me, shrunk more into himself, took his\nguitar into his other hand, lifted his cap, and said,--\n\n"_Messieurs et mesdames, je vous remercie, et je vous souhais une bonne\nnuit._" Then he put on his hat.\n\nThe crowd cackled with laughter and satisfaction. The handsome ladies and\ngentlemen, calmly exchanging remarks, withdrew gradually from the\nbalconies. On the boulevard the promenading began once more. The street,\nwhich had been still during the singing, assumed its wonted liveliness; a\nfew men, however, stood at some distance, and, without approaching the\nsinger, looked at him and laughed.\n\nI heard the little man muttering something between his teeth as he turned\naway; and I saw him, apparently growing more and more diminutive, hurry\ntoward the city with brisk steps. The promenaders who had been looking at\nhim followed him at some distance, still making merry at his expense. My\nmind was in a whirl; I could not comprehend what it all meant; and still\nstanding in the same place, I gazed abstractedly into the darkness after\nthe little man, who was fast disappearing, as he went with ever-increasing\nswiftness with long strides into the city, followed by the merry-making\npromenaders.\n\nI was overmastered by a feeling of pain, of bitterness, and above all, of\nshame for the little man, for the crowd, for myself, as though it were I\nwho had asked for money and received none; as though it were I who had been\nturned to ridicule.\n\nWithout looking any longer, feeling my heart oppressed, I also hurried with\nlong strides toward the entrance of the Schweitzerhof. I could not explain\nthe feeling that overmastered me; only there was something like a stone,\nfrom which I could not free myself, weighing down my soul and oppressing\nme.\n\nAt the ample, well-lighted entrance, I met the porter, who politely made\nway for me. An English family was also at the door. A portly, handsome, and\ntall gentleman, with black side-whiskers, in a black hat, and with a plaid\non one arm, while in his hand he carried a costly cane, came out slowly and\nfull of importance. Leaning on his arm was a lady, who wore a raw silk\ndress and bonnet with bright ribbons and the most costly laces. Together\nwith them was a pretty, fresh-looking young lady, in a graceful Swiss hat\nwith a feather _a la mousquetaire_; from under it escaped long light-yellow\ncurls softly encircling her fair face. In front of them skipped a buxom\ngirl of ten, with round white knees which showed from under her thin\nembroideries. "Magnificent night!" the lady was saying in a sweet, happy\nvoice, as I passed them.\n\n"Oh, yes," growled the Englishman lazily; and it was evident that he found\nit so enjoyable to be alive in the world, that it was too much trouble even\nto speak.\n\nAnd it seemed as though all of them alike found it so comfortable and easy,\nso light and free, to be alive in the world, their faces and motions\nexpressed such perfect indifference to the lives of every one else, and\nsuch absolute confidence that it was to them that the porter made way and\nbowed so profoundly, and that when they returned they would find clean,\ncomfortable beds and rooms, and that all this was bound to be, and was\ntheir indefeasible right, that I involuntarily contrasted them with the\nwandering minstrel who weary, perhaps hungry, full of shame, was retreating\nbefore the laughing crowd. And then suddenly I comprehended what it was\nthat oppressed my heart with such a load of heaviness, and I felt an\nindescribable anger against these people.\n\nTwice I walked up and down past the Englishman, and each time, without\nturning out for him, my elbow punched him, which gave me a feeling of\nindescribable satisfaction; and then, darting down the steps, I hastened\nthrough the darkness in the direction toward the city taken by the little\nman.\n\nOvertaking the three men who had been walking together, I asked them where\nthe singer was; they laughed, and pointed straight ahead. There he was,\nwalking alone with brisk steps; no one was with him; all the time, as it\nseemed to me, he was indulging in bitter monologue.\n\nI caught up with him, and proposed to him to go somewhere with me and drink\na bottle of wine. He kept on with his rapid walk, and scarcely deigned to\nlook at me; but when he perceived what I was saying, he halted.\n\n"Well, I would not refuse, if you would be so kind," said he; "here is a\nlittle cafe, we can go in there. It\'s not fashionable," he added, pointing\nto a drinking-saloon that was still open.\n\nHis expression "not fashionable" involuntarily suggested the idea of not\ngoing to an unfashionable cafe, but to go to the Schweitzerhof, where those\nwho had been listening to him were. Notwithstanding the fact that several\ntimes he showed a sort of timid disquietude at the idea of going to the\nSchweitzerhof, declaring that it was too fine for him there, still I\ninsisted in carrying out my purpose; and he, putting the best face on the\nmatter, gayly swinging his guitar, went back with me across the quay.\n\nA few loiterers who had happened along as I was talking with the minstrel,\nand had stopped to hear what I had to say, now, after arguing among\nthemselves, followed us to the very entrance of the hotel, evidently\nexpecting from the Tyrolese some further demonstration.\n\nI ordered a bottle of wine of a waiter whom I met in the hall. The waiter\nsmiled and looked at us, and went by without answering. The head waiter, to\nwhom I addressed myself with the same order, listened to me solemnly, and,\nmeasuring the minstrel\'s modest little figure from head to foot, sternly\nordered the waiter to take us to the room at the left.\n\nThe room at the left was a bar-room for simple people. In the corner of\nthis room a hunch-backed maid was washing dishes. The whole furniture\nconsisted of bare wooden tables and benches.\n\nThe waiter who came to serve us looked at us with a supercilious smile,\nthrust his hands in his pockets, and exchanged some remarks with the\nhumpbacked dish-washer. He evidently tried to give us to understand that he\nfelt himself immeasurably higher than the minstrel, both in dignity and\nsocial position, so that he considered it not only an indignity, but even\nan actual joke, that he was called upon to serve us.\n\n"Do you wish _vin ordinaire_?" he asked with a knowing look, winking toward\nmy companion, and switching his napkin from one hand to the other.\n\n"Champagne, and your very best," said I, endeavoring to assume my\nhaughtiest and most imposing appearance.\n\nBut neither my champagne, nor my endeavor to look haughty and imposing, had\nthe least effect on the servant: he smiled incredulously, loitered a moment\nor two gazing at us, took time enough to glance at his gold watch, and with\nleisurely steps, as though going out for a walk, left the room.\n\nSoon he returned with the wine, bringing two other waiters with him. These\ntwo sat down near the dish-washer, and gazed at us with amused attention\nand a bland smile, just as parents gaze at their children when they are\ngently playing. Only the dish-washer, it seemed to me, did not look at us\nscornfully but sympathetically.\n\nThough it was trying and awkward to lunch with the minstrel, and to play\nthe entertainer, under the fire of all these waiters\' eyes, I tried to do\nmy duty with as little constraint as possible. In the lighted room I could\nsee him better. He was a small but symmetrically built and muscular man,\nthough almost a dwarf in stature; he had bristly black hair, teary big\nblack eyes, bushy eyebrows, and a thoroughly pleasant, attractively shaped\nmouth. He had little side-whiskers, his hair was short, his attire was very\nsimple and mean. He was not over-clean, was ragged and sunburnt, and in\ngeneral had the look of a laboring-man. He was far more like a poor\ntradesman than an artist.\n\nOnly in his ever humid and brilliant eyes, and in his firm mouth, was there\nany sign of originality or genius. By his face it might be conjectured that\nhis age was between twenty-five and forty; in reality, he was\nthirty-seven.\n\nHere is what he related to me, with good-natured readiness and evident\nsincerity, of his life. He was a native of Aargau. In early childhood he\nhad lost father and mother; other relatives he had none. He had never owned\nany property. He had been apprenticed to a carpenter; but twenty-two years\npreviously one of his hands had been attacked by caries, which had\nprevented him from ever working again.\n\nFrom childhood he had been fond of singing, and he began to be a singer.\nOccasionally strangers had given him money. With this he had learned his\nprofession, bought his guitar, and now for eighteen years he had been\nwandering about through Switzerland and Italy, singing before hotels. His\nwhole luggage consisted of his guitar, and a little purse in which, at the\npresent time, there was only half a franc. That would have to suffice for\nsupper and lodgings this night.\n\nEvery year now for eighteen years he had made the round of the best and\nmost popular resorts of Switzerland,--Zurich, Lucerne, Interlaken,\nChamounix, etc.; by the way of the St. Bernard he would go down into Italy,\nand return over the St. Gothard, or through Savoy. Just at present it was\nrather hard for him to walk, as he had caught a cold, causing him to suffer\nfrom some trouble in his legs,--he called it rheumatism,--which grew more\nsevere from year to year; and, moreover, his voice and eyes had grown\nweaker. Nevertheless, he was on his way to Interlaken, Aix-les-Bains, and\nthence over the Little St. Bernard to Italy, which he was very fond of. It\nwas evident that on the whole he was well content with his life.\n\nWhen I asked him why he returned home, if he had any relatives there, or a\nhouse and land, his mouth parted in a gay smile, and he replied, "_Oui, le\nsucre est bon, il est doux pour les enfants!_" and he winked at the\nservants.\n\nI did not catch his meaning, but the group of servants burst out laughing.\n\n"No, I have nothing of the sort, but still I should always want to go\nback," he explained to me. "I go home because there is always a something\nthat draws one to one\'s native place." And once more he repeated with a\nshrewd, self-satisfied smile, his phrase, "_Oui, le sucre est bon_," and\nthen laughed good-naturedly.\n\nThe servants were very much amused, and laughed heartily; only the\nhunch-backed dish-washer looked earnestly from her big kindly eyes at the\nlittle man, and picked up his cap for him, when, as we talked, he once\nknocked it off the bench. I have noticed that wandering minstrels,\nacrobats, even jugglers, delight in calling themselves artists, and several\ntimes I hinted to my comrade that he was an artist; but he did not at all\naccept this designation, but with perfect simplicity looked upon his work\nas a means of existence.\n\nWhen I asked him if he had not himself written the songs which he sang, he\nshowed great surprise at such a strange question, and replied that the\nwords of whatever he sang were all of old Tyrolese origin.\n\n"But how about that song of the Righi? I think that cannot be very\nancient," I suggested.\n\n"Oh, that was composed about fifteen years ago. There was a German in\nBasel; he was a clever man; it was he who composed it. A splendid song. You\nsee he composed it especially for travellers." And he began to repeat the\nwords of the Righi song, which he liked so well, translating them into\nFrench as he went along.\n\n    "_If you wish to go to Righi,\n    You will not need shoes to Wegis,\n    (For you go that far by steamboat),\n    But from Wegis take a stout staff,\n    Also take upon your arm a maiden;\n    Drink a glass of wine on starting,\n    Only do not drink too freely,\n    For if you desire to drink here,\n    You must earn the right to, first._"\n\n"Oh! a splendid song!" he exclaimed, as he finished.\n\nThe servants, evidently, also found the song much to their mind, because\nthey came up closer to us.\n\n"Yes, but who was it composed the music?" I asked.\n\n"Oh, no one at all; you know you must have something new when you are going\nto sing for strangers."\n\nWhen the ice was brought, and I had given my comrade a glass of champagne,\nhe seemed somewhat ill at ease, and, glancing at the servants, he turned\nand twisted on the bench.\n\nWe touched our glasses to the health of all artists; he drank half a glass,\nthen he seemed to be collecting his ideas, and knit his brows in deep\nthought.\n\n"It is long since I have tasted such wine, _je ne vous dis que ca_. In\nItaly the _vino d\'Asti_ is excellent, but this is still better. Ah! Italy;\nit is splendid to be there!" he added.\n\n"Yes, there they know how to appreciate music and artists," said I, trying\nto bring him round to the evening\'s mischance before the Schweitzerhof.\n\n"No," he replied. "There, as far as music is concerned, I cannot give\nanybody satisfaction. The Italians are themselves musicians,--none like\nthem in the world; but I know only Tyrolese songs. They are something of a\nnovelty to them, though."\n\n"Well, you find rather more generous gentlemen there, don\'t you?" I went on\nto say, anxious to make him share in my resentment against the guests of\nthe Schweitzerhof. "There it would not be possible to find a big hotel\nfrequented by rich people, where, out of a hundred listening to an artist\'s\nsinging, not one would give him any thing."\n\nMy question utterly failed of the effect that I expected. It did not enter\nhis head to be indignant with them: on the contrary, he saw in my remark an\nimplied slur upon his talent which had failed of its reward, and he\nhastened to set himself right before me. "It is not every time that you get\nany thing," he remarked; "sometimes one isn\'t in good voice, or you are\ntired; now to-day I have been walking ten hours, and singing almost all the\ntime. That is hard. And these important aristocrats do not always care to\nlisten to Tyrolese songs."\n\n"But still, how can they help giving?" I insisted.\n\nHe did not comprehend my remark.\n\n"That\'s nothing," he said; "but here the principal thing is, _on est tres\nserre pour la police_, that\'s what\'s the trouble. Here, according to these\nrepublican laws, you are not allowed to sing; but in Italy you can go\nwherever you please, no one says a word. Here, if they want to let you,\nthey let you; but if they don\'t want to, then they can throw you into\njail."\n\n"What? That\'s incredible!"\n\n"Yes, it is true. If you have been warned once, and are found singing\nagain, they may put you in jail. I was kept there three months once," he\nsaid, smiling as though that were one of his pleasantest recollections.\n\n"Oh! that is terrible!" I exclaimed. "What was the reason?"\n\n"That was in consequence of one of the new republican laws," he went on to\nexplain, growing animated. "They cannot comprehend here that a poor fellow\nmust earn his living somehow. If I were not a cripple, I would work. But\nwhat harm do I do to any one in the world by my singing? What does it mean?\nThe rich can live as they wish, _un pauvre tiaple_ like myself can\'t live\nat all. What kind of laws are these republican ones? If that is the way\nthey run, then we don\'t want a republic: isn\'t that so, my dear sir? We\ndon\'t want a republic, but we want--we simply want--we want"--he hesitated\na little,--"we want natural laws."\n\nI filled up his glass. "You are not drinking," I said.\n\nHe took the glass in his hand, and bowed to me.\n\n"I know what you wish," he said, blinking his eyes at me, and threatening\nme with his finger. "You wish to make me drunk, so as to see what you can\nget out of me; but no, you sha\'n\'t have that gratification."\n\n"Why should I make you drunk?" I inquired. "All I wished was to give you a\npleasure."\n\nHe seemed really sorry that he had offended me by interpreting my\ninsistence so harshly. He grew confused, stood up, and touched my elbow.\n\n"No, no," said he, looking at me with a beseeching expression in his moist\neyes. "I was only joking."\n\nAnd immediately after he made use of some horribly uncultivated slang\nexpression, intended to signify that I was, nevertheless, a fine young man.\n"_Je ne vous dis que ca_," he said in conclusion. In this fashion the\nminstrel and I continued to drink and converse; and the waiters continued\nunceremoniously to stare at us, and, as it seemed, to make ridicule of us.\n\nIn spite of the interest which our conversation aroused in me, I could not\navoid taking notice of their behavior; and I confess I began to grow more\nand more angry.\n\nOne of the waiters arose, came up to the little man, and, regarding the top\nof his head, began to smile. I was already full of wrath against the\ninmates of the hotel, and had not yet had a chance to pour it out on any\none; and now I confess I was in the highest degree irritated by this\naudience of waiters.\n\nThe porter, not removing his hat, came into the room, and sat down near me,\nleaning his elbows on the table. This last circumstance, which was so\ninsulting to my dignity or my vainglory, completely enraged me, and gave an\noutlet for all the wrath which all the evening long had been boiling within\nme. I asked myself why he had so humbly bowed when he had met me before,\nand now, because I was sitting with the travelling minstrel, he came and\ntook his place near me so rudely? I was entirely overmastered by that\nboiling, angry indignation which I enjoy in myself, which I sometimes\nendeavor to stimulate when it comes over me, because it has an exhilarating\neffect upon me, and gives me, if only for a short time, a certain\nextraordinary flexibility, energy, and strength in all my physical and\nmoral faculties.\n\nI leaped to my feet.\n\n"Whom are you laughing at?" I screamed at the waiter; and I felt my face\nturn pale, and my lips involuntarily set together.\n\n"I am not laughing," replied the waiter, moving away from me.\n\n"Yes, you are: you are laughing at this gentleman. And what right have you\nto come, and to take a seat here, when there are guests? Don\'t you dare to\nsit down!"\n\nThe porter, muttering something, got up, and turned to the door.\n\n"What right have you to make sport of this gentleman, and to sit down by\nhim, when he is a guest, and you are a waiter? Why didn\'t you laugh at me\nthis evening at dinner, and come and sit down beside me? Because he is\nmeanly dressed, and sings in the streets? Is that the reason? and because I\nhave better clothes? He is poor, but he is a thousand times better than you\nare; that I am sure of, because he has never insulted any one, but you have\ninsulted him."\n\n"I didn\'t mean any thing," replied my enemy the waiter. "Perhaps I\ndisturbed him by sitting down."\n\nThe waiter did not understand me, and my German was wasted on him. The rude\nporter was about to take the waiter\'s part; but I fell upon him so\nimpetuously that the porter pretended not to understand me, and waved his\nhand.\n\nThe hunch-backed dish-washer, either because she perceived my wrathful\nstate, and feared a scandal, or possibly because she shared my views, took\nmy part, and, trying to force her way between me and the porter, told him\nto hold his tongue, saying that I was right, but at the same time urging me\nto calm myself.\n\n"_Der Herr hat Recht; Sie haben Recht_," she said over and over again. The\nminstrel\'s face presented a most pitiable, terrified expression; and\nevidently he did not understand why I was angry, and what I wanted: and he\nurged me to let him go away as soon as possible.\n\nBut the eloquence of wrath burned within me more and more. I understood it\nall,--the throng that had made merry at his expense, and his auditors who\nhad not given him any thing; and not for all the world would I have held my\npeace.\n\nI believe, that, if the waiters and the porter had not been so submissive,\nI should have taken delight in having a brush with them, or striking the\ndefenceless English lady on the head with a stick. If at that moment I had\nbeen at Sevastopol, I should have taken delight in devoting myself to\nslaughtering and killing in the English trench.\n\n"And why did you take this gentleman and me into this room, and not into\nthe other? What?" I thundered at the porter, seizing him by the arm so that\nhe could not escape from me. "What right had you to judge by his appearance\nthat this gentleman must be served in this room, and not in that? Have not\nall guests who pay, equal rights in hotels? Not only in a republic, but in\nall the world! Your scurvy republic!... Equality, indeed! You would not\ndare to take an Englishman into this room, not even those Englishmen who\nhave heard this gentleman free of cost; that is, who have stolen from him,\neach one of them, the few centimes which ought to have been given to him.\nHow did you dare to take us to this room?"\n\n"That room is closed," said the porter.\n\n"No," I cried, "that isn\'t true; it isn\'t closed."\n\n"Then you know best."\n\n"I know,--I know that you are lying."\n\nThe porter turned his back on me.\n\n"Eh! What is to be said?" he muttered.\n\n"What is to be said?" I cried. "You conduct us instanter into that room!"\n\nIn spite of the dish-washer\'s warning, and the entreaties of the minstrel,\nwho would have preferred to go home, I insisted on seeing the head waiter,\nand went with my guest into the big dining-room. The head waiter, hearing\nmy angry voice, and seeing my menacing face, avoided a quarrel, and, with\ncontemptuous servility, said that I might go wherever I pleased. I could\nnot prove to the porter that he had lied, because he had hastened out of\nsight before I went into the hall.\n\nThe dining-room was, in fact, open and lighted; and at one of the tables\nsat an Englishman and a lady, eating their supper. Although we were shown\nto a special table, I took the dirty minstrel to the very one where the\nEnglishman was, and bade the waiter bring to us there the unfinished\nbottle.\n\nThe two guests at first looked with surprised, then with angry, eyes at the\nlittle man, who, more dead than alive, was sitting near me. They talked\ntogether in a low tone; then the lady pushed back her plate, her silk dress\nrustled, and both of them left the room. Through the glass doors I saw the\nEnglishman saying something in an angry voice to the waiter, and pointing\nwith his hand in our direction. The waiter put his head through the door,\nand looked at us. I waited with pleasurable anticipation for some one to\ncome and order us out, for then I could have found a full outlet for all my\nindignation. But fortunately, though at the time I felt injured, we were\nleft in peace. The minstrel, who before had fought shy of the wine, now\neagerly drank all that was left in the bottle, so that he might make his\nescape as quickly as possible.\n\nHe, however, expressed his gratitude with deep feeling, as it seemed to me,\nfor his entertainment. His teary eyes grew still more humid and brilliant,\nand he made use of a most strange and complicated phrase of gratitude. But\nstill very pleasant to me was the sentence in which he said that if\neverybody treated artists as I had been doing, it would be very good, and\nended by wishing me all manner of happiness. We went out into the hall\ntogether. There stood the servants, and my enemy the porter apparently\nairing his grievances against me before them. All of them, I thought,\nlooked at me as though I were a man who had lost his wits. I treated the\nlittle man exactly like an equal, before all that audience of servants; and\nthen, with all the respect that I was able to express in my behavior, I\ntook off my hat, and pressed his hand with its dry and hardened fingers.\n\nThe servants made believe not pay the slightest attention to me. One of\nthem only indulged in a sarcastic laugh.\n\nAs soon as the minstrel had bowed himself out, and disappeared in the\ndarkness, I went up-stairs to my room, intending to sleep off all these\nimpressions and the foolish childish anger which had come upon me so\nunexpectedly. But finding that I was too much excited to sleep, I once more\nwent down into the street with the intention of walking until I should have\nrecovered my equanimity, and, I must confess, with the secret hope that I\nmight accidentally come across the porter or the waiter or the Englishman,\nand show them all their rudeness, and, most of all, their unfairness. But\nbeyond the porter, who when he saw me turned his back, I met no one; and I\nbegan to promenade in absolute solitude along the quay.\n\n"This is an example of the strange fate of poetry," said I to myself,\nhaving grown a little calmer. "All love it, all are in search of it; it is\nthe only thing in life that men love and seek, and yet no one recognizes\nits power, no one prizes this best treasure of the world, and those who\ngive it to men are not rewarded. Ask any one you please, ask all these\nguests of the Schweitzerhof, what is the most precious treasure in the\nworld, and all, or ninety-nine out of a hundred, putting on a sardonic\nexpression, will say that the best thing in the world is money.\n\n"\'Maybe, though, this does not please you, or coincide with your elevated\nideas,\' it will be urged, \'but what is to be done if human life is so\nconstituted that money alone is capable of giving a man happiness? I cannot\nforce my mind not to see the world as it is,\' it will be added, \'that is,\nto see the truth.\'\n\n"Pitiable is your intellect, pitiable the happiness which you desire! And\nyou yourselves, unhappy creatures, not knowing what you desire, ... why\nhave you all left your fatherland, your relatives, your money-making trades\nand occupations, and come to this little Swiss city of Lucerne? Why did you\nall this evening gather on the balconies, and in respectful silence listen\nto the little beggar\'s song? And if he had been willing to sing longer, you\nwould have been silent and listened longer. What! could money, even\nmillions of it, have driven you all from your country, and brought you all\ntogether in this little nook of Lucerne? Could money have gathered you all\non the balconies to stand for half an hour silent and motionless? No! One\nthing compels you to do it, and will forever have a stronger influence than\nall the other impulses of life: the longing for poetry which you know,\nwhich you do not realize, but feel, always will feel so long as you have\nany human sensibilities. The word \'poetry\' is a mockery to you; you make\nuse of it as a sort of ridiculous reproach; you regard the love for poetry\nas something meet for children and silly girls, and you make sport of them\nfor it. For yourselves you must have something more definite.\n\n"But children look upon life in a healthy way: they recognize and love what\nman ought to love, and what gives happiness. But life has so deceived and\nperverted you, that you ridicule the only thing that you really love, and\nyou seek for what you hate and for what gives you unhappiness.\n\n"You are so perverted that you did not perceive what obligations you were\nunder to the poor Tyrolese who rendered you a pure delight; but at the same\ntime you feel yourselves needlessly obliged to bow before some lord, which\ngives you neither pleasure nor profit, but rather causes you to sacrifice\nyour comfort and convenience. What absurdity! what incomprehensible lack of\nreason!\n\n"But it was not this that made the most powerful impression upon me this\nevening. This blindness to all that gives happiness, this unconsciousness\nof poetic enjoyment, I can almost comprehend, or at least I have become\nwonted to it, since I have almost everywhere met with it in the course of\nmy life; the harsh, unconscious churlishness of the crowd was no novelty to\nme: whatever those who argue in favor of popular sentiment may say, the\nthrong is a conglomeration of very possibly good people, but of people who\ntouch each other only on their coarse animal sides, and express only the\nweakness and harshness of human nature. But how was it that you, children\nof a humane people, you Christians, you simple people, repaid with coldness\nand ridicule the poor beggar who gave you a pure enjoyment? But no, in\nyour country there are asylums for beggars. There are no beggars, there can\nbe none; and there can be no feelings of sympathy, since that would be a\nconfession that beggary existed.\n\n"But he labored, he gave you enjoyment, he besought you to give him\nsomething of your superfluity in payment for his labor of which you took\nadvantage. But you looked upon him with a cool smile as upon one of the\ncuriosities in your lofty brilliant palaces; and though there were a\nhundred of you, favored with happiness and wealth, not one man or one woman\namong you gave him a _sou_. Abashed he went away from you, and the\nthoughtless throng, laughing, followed and ridiculed not you, but him,\nbecause you were cold, harsh, and dishonorable; because you robbed him in\nreceiving the entertainment which he gave you: for this they jeered _him_.\n\n"\'_On the 19th of July, 1857, before the Schweitzerhof Hotel, in which were\nlodging very opulent people, a wandering beggar minstrel sang for half an\nhour his songs, and played his guitar. About a hundred people listened to\nhim. The minstrel thrice asked you all to give him something. No one person\ngave him a thing, and many made sport of him._\'\n\n"This is not an invention, but an actual fact, as those who desire can find\nout for themselves by consulting the papers for the list of those who were\nat the Schweitzerhof on the 19th of July.\n\n"This is an event which the historians of our time ought to describe in\nletters of inextinguishable flame. This event is more significant and more\nserious, and fraught with far deeper meaning, than the facts that are\nprinted in newspapers and histories. That the English have killed several\nthousand Chinese because the Chinese would not sell them any thing for\nmoney while their land is overflowing with ringing coins; that the French\nhave killed several thousand Kabyles because the wheat grows well in\nAfrica, and because constant war is essential for the drill of an army;\nthat the Turkish ambassador in Naples must not be a Jew; and that the\nEmperor Napoleon walks about in Plombieres, and gives his people the\nexpress assurance that he rules only in direct accordance with the will of\nthe people,--all these are words which darken or reveal something long\nknown. But the episode that took place in Lucerne on the 19th of July seems\nto me something entirely novel and strange, and it is connected not with\nthe everlastingly ugly side of human nature, but with a well-known epoch in\nthe development of society. This fact is not for the history of human\nactivities, but for the history of progress and civilization.\n\n"Why is it that this inhuman fact, impossible in any country,--Germany,\nFrance, or Italy,--is quite possible here where civilization, freedom, and\nequality are carried to the highest degree of development, where there are\ngathered together the most civilized travellers from the most civilized\nnations? Why is it that these cultivated human beings, generally capable of\nevery honorable human action, had no hearty, human feeling for one good\ndeed? Why is it that these people who in their palaces, their meetings, and\ntheir societies, labor warmly for the condition of the celibate Chinese in\nIndia, about the spread of Christianity and culture in Africa, about the\nformation of societies for attaining all perfection,--why is it that they\nshould not find in their souls the simple, primitive feeling of human\nsympathy? Has such a feeling entirely disappeared, and has its place been\ntaken by vainglory, ambition, and cupidity, governing these men in their\npalaces, meetings, and societies? Has the spreading of that reasonable,\negotistical association of people, which we call civilization, destroyed\nand rendered nugatory the desire for instinctive and loving association?\nAnd is this that boasted equality for which so much innocent blood has been\nshed, and so many crimes have been perpetrated? Is it possible that\nnations, like children, can be made happy by the mere sound of the word\n\'equality\'?\n\n"Equality before the law? Does the whole life of a people revolve within\nthe sphere of law? Only the thousandth part of it is subject to the law:\nthe rest lies outside of it, in the sphere of the customs and intuitions of\nsociety.\n\n"But in society the lackey is better dressed than the minstrel, and insults\nhim with impunity. I am better dressed than the lackey, and insult him with\nimpunity. The porter considers me higher, but the minstrel lower, than\nhimself; when I made the minstrel my companion, he felt that he was on an\nequality with us both, and behaved rudely. I was impudent to the porter,\nand the porter acknowledged that he was inferior to me. The waiter was\nimpudent to the minstrel, and the minstrel accepted the fact that he was\ninferior to the waiter.\n\n"And is that government free, even though men seriously call it free, where\na single citizen can be thrown into prison because, without harming any\none, without interfering with any one, he does the only thing that he can\nto prevent himself from dying of starvation?\n\n"A wretched, pitiable creature is man with his craving for positive\nsolutions, thrown into this everlastingly tossing, limitless ocean of\n_good_ and _evil_, of combinations and contradictions. For centuries men\nhave been struggling and laboring to put the _good_ on one side, the _evil_\non the other. Centuries will pass, and no matter how much the unprejudiced\nmind may strive to decide where the balance lies between the _good_ and the\n_evil_, the scales will refuse to tip the beam, and there will always be\nequal quantities of the _good_ and the _evil_ on each scale.\n\n"If only man would learn to form judgments, and not to indulge in rash and\narbitrary thoughts, and not to make reply to questions that are propounded\nmerely to remain forever unanswered! If only he would learn that every\nthought is both a lie and a truth!--a lie from the one-sidedness and\ninability of man to recognize all truth; and true because it expresses one\nside of mortal endeavor. There are divisions in this everlastingly\ntumultuous, endless, endlessly confused chaos of the _good_ and the _evil_.\nThey have drawn imaginary lines over this ocean, and they contend that the\nocean is really thus divided.\n\n"But are there not millions of other possible subdivisions from absolutely\ndifferent standpoints, in other planes? Certainly these novel subdivisions\nwill be made in centuries to come, just as millions of different ones have\nbeen made in centuries past.\n\n"Civilization is _good_, barbarism is _evil_; freedom, _good_; slavery,\n_evil_. Now, this imaginary knowledge annihilates the instinctive,\nbeatific, primitive craving for the _good_ that is in human nature. And who\nwill explain to me what is freedom, what is despotism, what is\ncivilization, what is barbarism?\n\n"Where are the boundaries that separate them? And whose soul possesses so\nabsolute a standard of good and evil as to measure these fleeting,\ncomplicated facts? Whose wit is so great as to comprehend and weigh all the\nfacts in the irretrievable past? And who can find any circumstance in which\nthere is no union of _good_ and _evil_? And because I know that I see more\nof one than of the other, is it not because my standpoint is wrong? And who\nhas the ability to separate himself so absolutely from life, even for a\nmoment, as to look upon it from above?\n\n"One, only one infallible Guide we have,--the universal Spirit which\npenetrates all collectively and as units, which has endowed each of us with\nthe craving for the right; the Spirit which impels the tree to grow toward\nthe sun, which stimulates the flower in autumn-tide to scatter its seed,\nand which obliges each one of us unconsciously to draw closer together. And\nthis one unerring, inspiring voice rings out louder than the noisy, hasty\ndevelopment of culture.\n\n"Who is the greater man, and who the greater barbarian,--that lord, who,\nseeing the minstrel\'s well-worn clothes, angrily left the table, who gave\nhim not the millionth part of his possessions in payment of his labor, and\nnow lazily sitting in his brilliant, comfortable room, calmly opines about\nthe events that are happening in China, and justifies the massacres that\nhave been done there; or the little minstrel, who, risking imprisonment,\nwith a franc in his pocket, and doing no harm to any one, has been going\nabout for a score of years, up hill and down dale, rejoicing men\'s hearts\nwith his songs, though they have jeered at him, and almost cast him out of\nthe pale of humanity; and who, in weariness and cold and shame, has gone\noff to sleep, no one knows where, on his filthy straw?"\n\nAt this moment, from the city, through the dead silence of the night, far,\nfar away, I caught the sound of the little man\'s guitar and his voice.\n\n"No," something involuntarily said to me, "you have no right to commiserate\nthe little man, or to blame the lord for his well-being. Who can weigh the\ninner happiness which is found in the soul of each of these men? There he\nstands somewhere in the muddy road, and gazes at the brilliant moonlit sky,\nand gayly sings amid the smiling, fragrant night; in his soul there is no\nreproach, no anger, no regret. And who knows what is transpiring now in the\nhearts of all these men within those opulent, brilliant rooms? Who knows if\nthey all have as much unencumbered, sweet delight in life, and as much\nsatisfaction with the world, as dwells in the soul of that little man?\n\n"Endless are the mercy and wisdom of Him who has permitted and formed all\nthese contradictions. Only to thee, miserable little worm of the dust,\naudaciously, lawlessly attempting to fathom His laws, His designs,--only to\nthee do they seem like contradictions.\n\n"Full of love He looks down from His bright, immeasurable height, and\nrejoices in the endless harmony in which you all move in endless\ncontradictions. In thy pride thou hast thought thyself able to separate\nthyself from the laws of the universe. No, thou also, with thy petty,\nridiculous anger against the waiters,--thou also hast disturbed the\nharmonious craving for the eternal and the infinite."....\n\n\n\n\nRECOLLECTIONS OF A SCORER.\n\n_A STORY._\n\n\nWell, it happened about three o\'clock. The gentlemen were playing. There\nwas the big stranger, as our men called him. The prince was there,--the two\nare always together. The whiskered barin was there; also the little hussar,\nOliver, who was an actor, and there was the _pan_.[50] It was a pretty good\ncrowd.\n\n[Footnote 50: Polish name for lord or gentleman.]\n\nThe big stranger and the prince were playing together. Now, here I was\nwalking up and down around the billiard-table with my stick, keeping\ntally,--ten and forty-seven, twelve and forty-seven.\n\nEverybody knows it\'s our business to score. You don\'t get a chance to get a\nbite of any thing, and you don\'t get to bed till two o\'clock o\' nights, but\nyou\'re always being screamed at to bring the balls.\n\nI was keeping tally; and I look, and see a new barin comes in at the door.\nHe gazed and gazed, and then sat down on the sofa. Very well!\n\n"Now, who can that be?" thinks I to myself. "He must be somebody."\n\nHis dress was neat,--neat as a pin,--checkered tricot pants, stylish little\nshort coat, plush vest, and gold chain and all sorts of trinkets dangling\nfrom it.\n\nHe was dressed neat; but there was something about the man neater still;\nslim, tall, his hair brushed forward in style, and his face fair and\nruddy,--well, in a word, a fine young fellow.\n\nYou must know our business brings us into contact with all sorts of people.\nAnd there\'s many that ain\'t of much consequence, and there\'s a good deal of\npoor trash. So, though you\'re only a scorer, you get used to telling folks;\nthat is, in a certain way you learn a thing or two.\n\nI looked at the barin. I see him sit down, modest and quiet, not knowing\nanybody; and the clothes on him are so bran-new, that thinks I, "Either\nhe\'s a foreigner,--an Englishman maybe,--or some count just come. And\nthough he\'s so young, he has an air of some distinction." Oliver sat down\nnext him, so he moved along a little.\n\nThey began a game. The big man lost. He shouts to me. Says he, "You\'re\nalways cheating. You don\'t count straight. Why don\'t you pay attention?"\n\nHe scolded away, then threw down his cue, and went out. Now, just look\nhere! Evenings, he and the prince plays for fifty silver rubles a game; and\nhere he only lost a bottle of Makon wine, and got mad. That\'s the kind of a\ncharacter he is.\n\nAnother time he and the prince plays till two o\'clock. They don\'t bank down\nany cash; and so I know neither of them\'s got any cash, but they are simply\nplaying a bluff game.\n\n"I\'ll go you twenty-five rubles," says he.\n\n"All right."\n\nJust yawning, and not even stopping to place the ball,--you see, he was not\nmade of stone,--now just notice what he said. "We are playing for money,"\nsays he, "and not for chips."\n\nBut this man puzzled me worse than all the rest. Well, then, when the big\nman left, the prince says to the new barin, "Wouldn\'t you like," says he,\n"to play a game with me?"\n\n"With pleasure," says he.\n\nHe sat there, and looked rather foolish, indeed he did. He may have been\ncourageous in reality; but, at all events, he got up, went over to the\nbilliard-table, and did not seem flustered as yet. He was not exactly\nflustered, but you couldn\'t help seeing that he was not quite at his ease.\n\nEither his clothes were a little too new, or he was embarrassed because\neverybody was looking at him; at any rate, he seemed to have no energy. He\nsort of sidled up to the table, caught his pocket on the edge, began to\nchalk his cue, dropped his chalk.\n\nWhenever he hit the ball, he always glanced around, and reddened. Not so\nthe prince. He was used to it; he chalked and chalked his hand, tucked up\nhis sleeve; he goes and sits down when he pockets the ball, even though he\nis such a little man.\n\nThey played two or three games; then I notice the prince puts up the cue,\nand says, "Would you mind telling me your name?"\n\n"Nekhliudof," says he.\n\nSays the prince, "Was your father commander in the corps of cadets?"\n\n"Yes," says the other.\n\nThen they began to talk in French, and I could not understand them. I\nsuppose they were talking about family affairs.\n\n"_Au revoir_," says the prince. "I am very glad to have made your\nacquaintance." He washed his hands, and went to get a lunch; but the other\nstood by the billiard-table with his cue, and was knocking the balls about.\n\nIt\'s our business, you know, when a new man comes along, to be rather\nsharp: it\'s the best way. I took the balls, and go to put them up. He\nreddened, and says, "Can\'t I play any longer?"\n\n"Certainly you can," says I. "That\'s what billiards is for." But I don\'t\npay any attention to him. I straighten the cues.\n\n"Will you play with me?"\n\n"Certainly, sir," says I.\n\nI place the balls.\n\n"Shall we play for odds?"\n\n"What do you mean,--\'play for odds\'?"\n\n"Well," says I, "you give me a half-ruble, and I crawl under the table."\n\nOf course, as he had never seen that sort of thing, it seemed strange to\nhim: he laughs.\n\n"Go ahead," says he.\n\n"Very well," says I, "only you must give me odds."\n\n"What!" says he, "are you a worse player than I am?"\n\n"Most likely," says I. "We have few players who can be compared with you."\n\nWe began to play. He certainly had the idea that he was a crack shot. It\nwas a caution to see him shoot; but the Pole sat there, and kept shouting\nout every time,--\n\n"Ah, what a chance! ah, what a shot!"\n\nBut what a man he was! His ideas were good enough, but he didn\'t know how\nto carry them out. Well, as usual I lost the first game, crawled under the\ntable, and grunted.\n\nThereupon Oliver and the Pole jumped down from their seats, and applauded,\nthumping with their cues.\n\n"Splendid! Do it again," they cried, "once more."\n\nWell enough to cry "once more," especially for the Pole. That fellow would\nhave been glad enough to crawl under the billiard-table, or even under the\nBlue bridge, for a half-ruble! Yet he was the first to cry, "Splendid! but\nyou haven\'t wiped off all the dust yet."\n\nI, Petrushka the marker, was pretty well known to everybody.\n\nOnly, of course, I did not care to show my hand yet. I lost my second game.\n\n"It does not become me at all to play with you, sir," says I.\n\nHe laughs. Then, as I was playing the third game, he stood forty-nine and I\nnothing. I laid the cue on the billiard-table, and said, "Barin, shall we\nplay off?"\n\n"What do you mean by playing off?" says he. "How would you have it?"\n\n"You make it three rubles or nothing," says I.\n\n"Why," says he, "have I been playing with you for money?" The fool!\n\nHe turned rather red.\n\nVery good. He lost the game. He took out his pocket-book,--quite a new one,\nevidently just from the English shop,--opened it: I see he wanted to make a\nlittle splurge. It is stuffed full of bills,--nothing but hundred-ruble\nnotes.\n\n"No," says he, "there\'s no small stuff here."\n\nHe took three rubles from his purse. "There," says he, "there\'s your two\nrubles; the other pays for the games, and you keep the rest for vodka."\n\n"Thank you, sir, most kindly." I see that he is a splendid fellow. For such\na one I would crawl under any thing. For one thing, it\'s a pity that he\nwon\'t play for money. For then, thinks I, I should know how to work him for\ntwenty rubles, and maybe I could stretch it out to forty.\n\nAs soon as the Pole saw the young man\'s money, he says, "Wouldn\'t you like\nto try a little game with me? You play so admirably." Such sharpers prowl\naround.\n\n"No," says the young man, "excuse me: I have not the time." And he went\nout.\n\nI don\'t know who that man was, that Pole. Some one called him _Pan_ or the\nPole, and so it stuck to him. Every day he used to sit in the\nbilliard-room, and always look on. He was no longer allowed to take a hand\nin any game whatever; but he always sat by himself, and got out his pipe,\nand smoked. But then he could play well.\n\nVery good. Nekhliudof came a second time, a third time; he began to come\nfrequently. He would come morning and evening. He learned to play French\ncarom and pyramid pool,--every thing in fact. He became less bashful, got\nacquainted with everybody, and played tolerably well. Of course, being a\nyoung man of a good family, with money, everybody liked him. The only\nexception was the "big guest:" he quarrelled with him.\n\nAnd the whole thing grew out of a trifle.\n\nThey were playing pool,--the prince, the big guest, Nekhliudof, Oliver, and\nsome one else. Nekhliudof was standing near the stove talking with some\none. When it came the big man\'s turn to play, it happened that his ball\nwas just opposite the stove. There was very little space there, and he\nliked to have elbow-room.\n\nNow, either he didn\'t see Nekhliudof, or he did it on purpose; but, as he\nwas flourishing his cue, he hit Nekhliudof in the chest, a tremendous rap.\nIt actually made him groan. What then? He did not think of apologizing, he\nwas so boorish. He even went further: he didn\'t look at him; he walks off\ngrumbling,--\n\n"Who\'s jostling me there? It made me miss my shot. Why can\'t we have some\nroom?"\n\nThen the other went up to him, pale as a sheet, but quite self-possessed,\nand says so politely,--\n\n"You ought first, sir, to apologize: you struck me," says he.\n\n"Catch me apologizing now! I should have won the game," says he, "but now\nyou have spoiled it for me."\n\nThen the other one says, "You ought to apologize."\n\n"Get out of my way! I insist upon it, I won\'t."\n\nAnd he turned away to look after his ball.\n\nNekhliudof went up to him, and took him by the arm.\n\n"You\'re a boor," says he, "my dear sir."\n\nThough he was a slender young fellow, almost like a girl, still he was all\nready for a quarrel. His eyes flash fire; he looks as if he could eat him\nalive. The big guest was a strong, tremendous fellow, no match for\nNekhliudof.\n\n"Wha-at!" says he, "you call me a boor?" Yelling out these words, he raises\nhis hand to strike him.\n\nThen everybody there rushed up, and seized them both by the arms, and\nseparated them.\n\nAfter much talk, Nekhliudof says, "Let him give me satisfaction: he has\ninsulted me."\n\n"Not at all," said the other. "I don\'t care a whit about any satisfaction.\nHe\'s nothing but a boy, a mere nothing. I\'ll pull his ears for him."\n\n"If you aren\'t willing to give me satisfaction, then you are no gentleman."\n\nAnd, saying this, he almost cried.\n\n"Well, and you, you are a little boy: nothing you say or do can offend me."\n\nWell, we separated them,--led them off, as the custom is, to different\nrooms. Nekhliudof and the prince were friends.\n\n"Go," says the former; "for God\'s sake make him listen to reason."\n\nThe prince went. The big man says, "I ain\'t afraid of any one," says he. "I\nam not going to have any explanation with such a baby. I won\'t do it, and\nthat\'s the end of it."\n\nWell, they talked and talked, and then the matter died out, only the big\nguest ceased to come to us any more.\n\nAs a result of this,--this row, I might call it,--he was regarded as quite\nthe cock of the walk. He was quick to take offence,--I mean Nekhliudof,--as\nto so many other things, however, he was as unsophisticated as a new-born\nbabe.\n\nI remember once, the prince says to Nekhliudof, "Whom do you keep here?"\n\n"No one," says he.\n\n"What do you mean,--\'no one\'!"\n\n"Why should I?" says Nekhliudof.\n\n"How so,--why should you?"\n\n"I have always lived thus. Why shouldn\'t I continue to live the same way?"\n\n"You don\'t say so? Did you ever!"\n\nAnd saying this, the prince burst into a peal of laughter, and the\nwhiskered barin also roared. They couldn\'t get over it.\n\n"What, never?" they asked.\n\n"Never!"\n\nThey were dying with laughter. Of course I understood well enough what they\nwere laughing at him for. I keep my eyes open. "What," thinks I, "will come\nof it?"\n\n"Come," says the prince, "come right off."\n\n"No; not for any thing," was his answer.\n\n"Now, that is absurd," says the prince. "Come along!"\n\nThey went out.\n\nThey came back at one o\'clock. They sat down to supper; quite a crowd of\nthem were assembled. Some of our very best customers,--Atanof, Prince\nRazin, Count Shustakh, Mirtsof. And all congratulate Nekhliudof, laughing\nas they do so. They call me in: I see that they are pretty jolly.\n\n"Congratulate the barin," they shout.\n\n"What on?" I ask.\n\nHow did he call it? His initiation or his enlightenment; I can\'t remember\nexactly.\n\n"I have the honor," says I, "to congratulate you."\n\nAnd he sits there very red in the face, yet he smiles. Didn\'t they have fun\nwith him though!\n\nWell and good. They went afterwards to the billiard-room, all very gay; and\nNekhliudof went up to the billiard-table, leaned on his elbow, and said,--\n\n"It\'s amusing to you, gentlemen," says he, "but it\'s sad for me. Why," says\nhe, "did I do it? Prince," says he, "I shall never forgive you or myself\nas long as I live."\n\nAnd he actually burst into tears. Evidently he did not know himself what he\nwas saying. The prince went up to him with a smile.\n\n"Don\'t talk nonsense," says he. "Let\'s go home, Anatoli."\n\n"I won\'t go anywhere," says the other. "Why did I do that?"\n\nAnd the tears poured down his cheeks. He would not leave the\nbilliard-table, and that was the end of it. That\'s what it means for a\nyoung and inexperienced man to....\n\nIn this way he used often to come to us. Once he came with the prince, and\nthe whiskered man who was the prince\'s crony; the gentlemen always called\nhim "Fedotka." He had prominent cheek-bones, and was homely enough, to be\nsure; but he used to dress neatly and ride in a carriage. What was the\nreason that the gentlemen were so fond of him? I really could not tell.\n\n"Fedotka! Fedotka!" they\'d call, and ask him to eat and to drink, and\nthey\'d spend their money paying up for him; but he was a thorough-going\nbeat. If ever he lost, he would be sure not to pay; but if he won, you bet\nhe wouldn\'t fail to collect his money. Often too he came to grief: yet\nthere he was, walking arm in arm with the prince.\n\n"You are lost without me," he would say to the prince. "I am, Fedot,"[51]\nsays he; "but not a Fedot of that sort."\n\n[Footnote 51: _Fedot, da nye tot_, an untranslatable play on the word.]\n\nAnd what jokes he used to crack, to be sure! Well, as I said, they had\nalready arrived that time, and one of them says, "Let\'s have the balls for\nthree-handed pool."\n\n"All right," says the other.\n\nThey began to play at three rubles a stake. Nekhliudof and the prince play,\nand chat about all sorts of things meantime.\n\n"Ah!" says one of them, "you mind only what a neat little foot she has."\n\n"Oh," says the other, "her foot is nothing; her beauty is her wealth of\nhair."\n\nOf course they paid no attention to the game, only kept on talking to one\nanother.\n\nAs to Fedotka, that fellow was alive to his work; he played his very best,\nbut they didn\'t do themselves justice at all.\n\nAnd so he won six rubles from each of them. God knows how many games he had\nwon from the prince, yet I never knew them to pay each other any money; but\nNekhliudof took out two greenbacks, and handed them over to him.\n\n"No," says he, "I don\'t want to take your money. Let\'s square it: play\n\'quits or double,\'[52]--either double or nothing."\n\n[Footnote 52: _Kitudubl_ = Fr. _quitte ou double_.]\n\nI set the balls. Fedotka began to play the first hand. Nekhliudof seemed to\nplay only for fun: sometimes he would come very near winning a game, yet\njust fail of it. Says he, "It would be too easy a move, I won\'t have it\nso." But Fedotka did not forget what he was up to. Carelessly he proceeded\nwith the game, and thus, as if it were unexpectedly, won.\n\n"Let us play double stakes once more," says he.\n\n"All right," says Nekhliudof.\n\nOnce more Fedotka won the game.\n\n"Well," says he, "it began with a mere trifle. I don\'t wish to win much\nfrom you. Shall we make it once more or nothing?"\n\n"Yes."\n\nSay what you may, but fifty rubles is a pretty sum, and Nekhliudof himself\nbegan to propose, "Let us make it double or quit." So they played and\nplayed.\n\nIt kept going worse and worse for Nekhliudof. Two hundred and eighty rubles\nwere written up against him. As to Fedotka, he had his own method: he would\nlose a simple game, but when the stake was doubled, he would win sure.\n\nAs for the prince, he sits by and looks on. He sees that the matter is\ngrowing serious.\n\n"Enough!"[53] says he, "hold on."\n\n[Footnote 53: _ase_ = _assez_.]\n\nMy! they keep increasing the stake.\n\nAt last it went so far that Nekhliudof was in for more than five hundred\nrubles. Fedotka laid down his cue, and said,--\n\n"Aren\'t you satisfied for to-day? I\'m tired," says he.\n\nYet I knew he was ready to play till dawn of day, provided there was money\nto be won. Stratagem, of course. And the other was all the more anxious to\ngo on. "Come on! Come on!"\n\n"No,--\'pon my honor, I\'m tired. Come," says Fedot; "let\'s go up-stairs;\nthere you shall have your revanche."\n\nUp-stairs with us meant the place where the gentlemen used to play cards.\nFrom that very day, Fedotka wound his net round him so that he began to\ncome every day. He would play one or two games of billiards, and then\nproceed up-stairs,--every day up-stairs.\n\nWhat they used to do there, God only knows; but it is a fact that from that\ntime he began to be an entirely different kind of man, and seemed hand in\nglove with Fedotka. Formerly he used to be stylish, neat in his dress, with\nhis hair slightly curled even; but now it would be only in the morning that\nhe would be any thing like himself; but as soon as he had paid his visit\nup-stairs, he would not be at all like himself.\n\nOnce he came down from up-stairs with the prince, pale, his lips trembling,\nand talking excitedly.\n\n"I cannot permit such a one as _he_ is," says he, "to say that I am\nnot"--How did he express himself? I cannot recollect, something like "not\nrefined enough," or what,--"and that he won\'t play with me any more. I tell\nyou I have paid him ten thousand, and I should think that he might be a\nlittle more considerate, before others, at least."\n\n"Oh, bother!" says the prince, "is it worth while to lose one\'s temper with\nFedotka?"\n\n"No," says the other, "I will not let it go so."\n\n"Why, old fellow, how can you think of such a thing as lowering yourself to\nhave a row with Fedotka?"\n\n"That is all very well; but there were strangers there, mind you."\n\n"Well, what of that?" says the prince; "strangers? Well, if you wish, I\nwill go and make him ask your pardon."\n\n"No," says the other.\n\nAnd then they began to chatter in French, and I could not understand what\nit was they were talking about.\n\nAnd what would you think of it? That very evening he and Fedotka ate supper\ntogether, and they became friends again.\n\nWell and good. At other times again he would come alone.\n\n"Well," he would say, "do I play well?"\n\nIt\'s our business, you know, to try to make everybody contented, and so I\nwould say, "Yes, indeed;" and yet how could it be called good play, when he\nwould poke about with his cue without any sense whatever?\n\nAnd from that very evening when he took in with Fedotka, he began to play\nfor money all the time. Formerly he didn\'t care to play for stakes, either\nfor a dinner or for champagne. Sometimes the prince would say,--\n\n"Let\'s play for a bottle of champagne."\n\n"No," he would say. "Let us rather have the wine by itself. Hollo there!\nbring a bottle!"\n\nAnd now he began to play for money all the time; he used to spend his\nentire days in our establishment. He would either play with some one in the\nbilliard-room, or he would go "up-stairs."\n\nWell, thinks I to myself, every one else gets something from him, why don\'t\nI get some advantage out of it?\n\n"Well, sir," says I one day, "it\'s a long time since you have had a game\nwith me."\n\nAnd so we began to play. Well, when I won ten half-rubles of him, I says,--\n\n"Don\'t you want to make it double or quit, sir?"\n\nHe said nothing. Formerly, if you remember, he would call me a fool for\nsuch a boldness. And we went to playing "quit or double."\n\nI won eighty rubles of him.\n\nWell, what would you think? Since that first time he used to play with me\nevery day. He would wait till there was no one about, for of course he\nwould have been ashamed to play with a mere marker in presence of others.\nOnce he had got rather warmed up by the play (he already owed me sixty\nrubles), and so he says,--\n\n"Do you want to stake all you have won?"\n\n"All right," says I.\n\nI won. "One hundred and twenty to one hundred and twenty?"\n\n"All right," says I.\n\nAgain I won. "Two hundred and forty against two hundred and forty?"\n\n"Isn\'t that too much?" I ask.\n\nHe made no reply. We played the game. Once more it was mine. "Four hundred\nand eighty against four hundred and eighty?"\n\nI says, "Well, sir, I don\'t want to wrong you. Let us make it a hundred\nrubles that you owe me, and call it square."\n\nYou ought to have heard how he yelled at this, and yet he was not a proud\nman at all. "Either play, or don\'t play!" says he.\n\nWell, I see there\'s nothing to be done. "Three hundred and eighty, then, if\nyou please," says I.\n\nI really wanted to lose. I allowed him forty points in advance. He stood\nfifty-two to my thirty-six. He began to cut the yellow one, and missed\neighteen points; and I was standing just at the turning-point. I made a\nstroke so as to knock the ball off of the billiard-table. No--so luck would\nhave it. Do what I might, he even missed the doublet. I had won again.\n\n"Listen," says he. "Peter,"--he did not call me _Petrushka_ then,--"I can\'t\npay you the whole right away. In a couple of months I could pay three\nthousand even, if it were necessary."\n\nAnd there he stood just as red, and his voice kind of trembled.\n\n"Very good, sir," says I.\n\nWith this he laid down the cue. Then he began to walk up and down, up and\ndown, the perspiration running down his face.\n\n"Peter," says he, "let\'s try it again, double or quit."\n\nAnd he almost burst into tears.\n\n"What, sir, what! would you play against such luck?"\n\n"Oh, let us play, I beg of you." And he brings the cue, and puts it in my\nhand.\n\nI took the cue, and I threw the balls on the table so that they bounced\nover on to the floor; I could not help showing off a little, naturally. I\nsay, "All right, sir."\n\nBut he was in such a hurry that he went and picked up the balls himself,\nand I thinks to myself, "Anyway, I\'ll never be able to get the seven\nhundred rubles from him, so I can lose them to him all the same." I began\nto play carelessly on purpose. But no--he won\'t have it so. "Why," says he,\n"you are playing badly on purpose."\n\nBut his hands trembled, and when the ball went towards a pocket, his\nfingers would spread out and his mouth would screw up to one side, as if he\ncould by any means force the ball into the pocket. Even I couldn\'t stand\nit, and I say, "That won\'t do any good, sir."\n\nVery well. As he won this game I says, "This will make it one hundred and\neighty rubles you owe me, and fifty games; and now I must go and get my\nsupper." So I laid down my cue, and went off.\n\nI went and sat down all by myself, at a small table opposite the door; and\nI look in and see, and wonder what he will do. Well, what would you think?\nHe began to walk up and down, up and down, probably thinking that no one\'s\nlooking at him; and then he would give a pull at his hair, and then walk up\nand down again, and keep muttering to himself; and then he would pull his\nhair again.\n\nAfter that he wasn\'t seen for a week. Once he came into the dining-room as\ngloomy as could be, but he didn\'t enter the billiard-room. The prince\ncaught sight of him.\n\n"Come," says he, "let\'s have a game."\n\n"No," says the other, "I am not going to play any more."\n\n"Nonsense! come along."\n\n"No," says he, "I won\'t come, I tell you. For you it\'s all one whether I go\nor not, yet for me it\'s no good to come here."\n\nAnd so he did not come for ten days more. And then, it being the holidays,\nhe came dressed up in a dress suit: he\'d evidently been into company. And\nhe was here all day long; he kept playing, and he came the next day, and\nthe third....\n\nAnd it began to go in the old style, and I thought it would be fine to have\nanother trial with him.\n\n"No," says he, "I\'m not going to play with you; and as to the one hundred\nand eighty rubles that I owe you, if you\'ll come at the end of a month, you\nshall have it."\n\nVery good. So I went to him at the end of a month.\n\n"By God," says he, "I can\'t give it to you; but come back on Thursday."\n\nWell, I went on Thursday. I found that he had a splendid suite of\napartments.\n\n"Well," says I, "is he at home?"\n\n"He hasn\'t got up yet," I was told.\n\n"Very good, I will wait."\n\nFor a body-servant he had one of his own serfs, such a gray-haired old man!\nThat servant was perfectly single-minded, he didn\'t know any thing about\nbeating about the bush. So we got into conversation.\n\n"Well," says he, "what is the use of our living here, master and I? He\'s\nsquandered all his property, and it\'s mighty little honor or good that we\nget out of this Petersburg of yours. As we started from the country, I\nthought it would be as it was with the last barin (may his soul rest in\npeace!), we would go about with princes and counts and generals; he thought\nto himself, \'I\'ll find a countess for a sweetheart, and she\'ll have a big\ndowry, and we\'ll live on a big scale.\' But it\'s quite a different thing\nfrom what he expected; here we are, running about from one tavern to\nanother as bad off as we could be! The Princess Rtishcheva, you know, is\nhis own aunt, and Prince Borotintsef is his godfather. What do you think?\nHe went to see them only once, that was at Christmas-time; he never shows\nhis nose there. Yes, and even their people laugh about it to me. \'Why,\'\nsays they, \'your barin is not a bit like his father!\' And once I take it\nupon myself to say to him,--\n\n"\'Why wouldn\'t you go, sir, and visit your aunt? They are feeling bad\nbecause you haven\'t been for so long.\'\n\n"\'It\'s stupid there, Demyanitch,\' says he. Just to think, he found his only\namusement here in the saloon! If he only would enter the service! yet, no:\nhe has got entangled with cards and all the rest of it. When men get going\nthat way, there\'s no good in any thing; nothing comes to any good....\n_E-ekh!_ we are going to the dogs, and no mistake.... The late mistress\n(may her soul rest in peace!) left us a rich inheritance: no less than a\nthousand souls, and about three hundred thousand rubles worth of\ntimber-lands. He has mortgaged it all, sold the timber, let the estate go\nto rack and ruin, and still no money on hand. When the master is away, of\ncourse, the overseer is more than the master. What does he care? He only\ncares to stuff his own pockets.\n\n"A few days ago, a couple of peasants brought complaints from the whole\nestate. \'He has wasted the last of the property,\' they say. What do you\nthink? he pondered over the complaints, and gave the peasants ten rubles\napiece. Says he, \'I\'ll be there very soon. I shall have some money, and I\nwill settle all accounts when I come,\' says he.\n\n"But how can he settle accounts when we are getting into debt all the time?\nMoney or no money, yet the winter here has cost eighty thousand rubles, and\nnow there isn\'t a silver ruble in the house. And all owing to his\nkind-heartedness. You see, he\'s such a simple barin that it would be hard\nto find his equal: that\'s the very reason that he\'s going to ruin,--going\nto ruin, all for nothing." And the old man almost wept.\n\nNekhliudof woke up about eleven, and called me in.\n\n"They haven\'t sent me any money yet," says he. "But it isn\'t my fault. Shut\nthe door," says he.\n\nI shut the door.\n\n"Here," says he, "take my watch or this diamond pin, and pawn it. They\nwill give you more than one hundred and eighty rubles for it, and when I\nget my money I will redeem it," says he.\n\n"No matter, sir," says I. "If you don\'t happen to have any money, it\'s no\nconsequence; let me have the watch if you don\'t mind. I can wait for your\nconvenience."\n\nI can see that the watch is worth more than three hundred.\n\nVery good. I pawned the watch for a hundred rubles, and carried him the\nticket. "You will owe me eighty rubles," says I, "and you had better redeem\nthe watch."\n\nAnd so it happened that he still owed me eighty rubles.\n\nAfter that he began to come to us again every day. I don\'t know how matters\nstood between him and the prince, but at all events he kept coming with him\nall the time, or else they would go and play cards up-stairs with Fedotka.\nAnd what queer accounts those three men kept between them! this one would\nlend money to the other, the other to the third, yet who it was that owed\nthe money you never could find out.\n\nAnd in this way he kept on coming our way for well-nigh two years; only it\nwas to be plainly seen that he was a changed man, such a devil-may-care\nmanner he assumed at times. He even went so far at times as to borrow a\nruble of me to pay a hack-driver; and yet he would still play with the\nprince for a hundred rubles stake.\n\nHe grew gloomy, thin, sallow. As soon as he came he used to order a little\nglass of absinthe, take a bite of something, and drink some port wine, and\nthen he would grow more lively.\n\nHe came one time before dinner; it happened to be carnival time, and he\nbegan to play with a hussar.\n\nSays he, "Do you want to play for a stake?"\n\n"Very well," says he. "What shall it be?"\n\n"A bottle of Claude Vougeaux? What do you say?"\n\n"All right."\n\nVery good. The hussar won, and they went off for their dinner. They sat\ndown at table, and then Nekhliudof says, "Simon, a bottle of Claude\nVougeaux, and see that you warm it to the proper point."\n\nSimon went out, brought in the dinner, but no wine.\n\n"Well," says he, "where\'s the wine?"\n\nSimon hurried out, brought in the roast.\n\n"Let us have the wine," says he.\n\nSimon makes no reply.\n\n"What\'s got into you? Here we\'ve almost finished dinner, and no wine. Who\nwants to drink with dessert?"\n\nSimon hurried out. "The landlord," says he, "wants to speak to you."\n\nNekhliudof turned scarlet. He sprang up from the table.\n\n"What\'s the need of calling me?"\n\nThe landlord is standing at the door.\n\nSays he, "I can\'t trust you any more, unless you settle my little bill."\n\n"Well, didn\'t I tell you that I would pay the first of the month?"\n\n"That will be all very well," says the landlord, "but I can\'t be all the\ntime giving credit, and having no settlement. There are more than ten\nthousand rubles of debts outstanding now," says he.\n\n"Well, that\'ll do, _monshoor_, you know that you can trust me! Send the\nbottle, and I assure you that I will pay you very soon."\n\nAnd he hurried back.\n\n"What was it? Why did they call you out?" asked the hussar.\n\n"Oh, some one wanted to ask me a question."\n\n"Now it would be a good time," says the hussar, "to have a little warm wine\nto drink."\n\n"Simon, hurry up!"\n\nSimon came back, but still no wine, nothing. Too bad! He left the table,\nand came to me.\n\n"For God\'s sake," says he, "Petrushka, let me have six rubles!"\n\nHe was pale as a sheet. "No, sir," says I: "by God, you owe me quite too\nmuch now."\n\n"I will give forty rubles for six, in a week\'s time."\n\n"If only I had it," says I, "I should not think of refusing you, but I\nhaven\'t."\n\nWhat do you think! He rushed away, his teeth set, his fist doubled up, and\nran down the corridor like one mad, and all at once he gave himself a knock\non the forehead.\n\n"O my God!" says he, "what has it come to?"\n\nBut he did not return to the dining-room; he jumped into a carriage, and\ndrove away. Didn\'t we have our laugh over it! The hussar asks,--\n\n"Where is the gentleman who was dining with me?"\n\n"He has gone," said some one.\n\n"Where has he gone? What message did he leave?"\n\n"He didn\'t leave any; he just took to his carriage, and went off."\n\n"That\'s a fine way of entertaining a man!" says he.\n\nNow, thinks I to myself, it\'ll be a long time before he comes again after\nthis; that is, on account of this scandal. But no. On the next day he came\nabout evening. He came into the billiard-room. He had a sort of a box in\nhis hand. Took off his overcoat.\n\n"Now let us have a game," says he.\n\nHe looked out from under his eyebrows, rather fierce like.\n\nWe played a game. "That\'s enough now," says he: "go and bring me a pen and\npaper; I must write a letter."\n\nNot thinking any thing, not suspecting any thing, I bring some paper, and\nput it on the table in the little room.\n\n"It\'s all ready, sir," says I.\n\n"Very good." He sat down at the table. He kept on writing and writing, and\nmuttering to himself all the time: then he jumps up, and, frowning, says,\n"Look and see if my carriage has come yet."\n\nIt was on a Friday, during carnival time, and so there weren\'t any of the\ncustomers on hand; they were all at some ball. I went to see about the\ncarriage, and just as I was going out of the door, "Petrushka! Petrushka!"\nhe shouted, as if something suddenly frightened him.\n\nI turn round. I see he\'s pale as a sheet, standing here and looking at me.\n\n"Did you call me, sir?" says I.\n\nHe makes no reply.\n\n"What do you want?" says I.\n\nHe says nothing. "Oh, yes!" says he. "Let\'s have another game."\n\nThen says he, "Haven\'t I learned to play pretty well?"\n\nHe had just won the game. "Yes," says I.\n\n"All right," says he; "go now, and see about my carriage." He himself\nwalked up and down the room.\n\nWithout thinking any thing, I went down to the door. I didn\'t see any\ncarriage at all. I started to go up again.\n\nJust as I am going up, I hear what sounds like the thud of a billiard-cue.\nI go into the billiard-room. I notice a peculiar smell.\n\nI look around; and there he is lying on the floor in a pool of blood, with\na pistol beside him. I was so scared that I could not speak a word.\n\nHe keeps twitching, twitching his leg; and stretched himself a little. Then\nhe sort of snored, and stretched out his full length in such a strange way.\nAnd God knows why such a sin came about,--how it was that it occurred to\nhim to ruin his own soul,--but as to what he left written on this paper, I\ndon\'t understand it at all. Truly, you can never account for what is going\non in the world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n"God gave me all that a man can desire,--wealth, name, intellect, noble\naspirations. I wanted to enjoy myself, and I trod in the mire all that was\nbest in me. I have done nothing dishonorable, I am not unfortunate, I have\nnot committed any crime; but I have done worse: I have destroyed my\nfeelings, my intellect, my youth. I became entangled in a filthy net, from\nwhich I could not escape, and to which I could not accustom myself. I feel\nthat I am falling lower and lower every moment, and I cannot stop my fall.\n\n"And what ruined me? Was there in me some strange passion which I might\nplead as an excuse? No!\n\n"My recollections are pleasant. One fearful moment of forgetfulness, which\ncan never be erased from my mind, led me to come to my senses. I shuddered\nwhen I saw what a measureless abyss separated me from what I desired to be,\nand might have been. In my imagination arose the hopes, the dreams, and the\nthoughts of my youth.\n\n"Where are those lofty thoughts of life, of eternity, of God, which at\ntimes filled my soul with light and strength? Where that aimless power of\nlove which kindled my heart with its comforting warmth?...\n\n"But how good and happy I might have been, had I trodden that path which,\nat the very entrance of life, was pointed out to me by my fresh mind and\ntrue feelings! More than once did I try to go from the ruts in which my\nlife ran, into that sacred path.\n\n"I said to myself, Now I will use my whole strength of will; and yet I\ncould not do it. When I happened to be alone, I felt awkward and timid.\nWhen I was with others, I no longer heard the inward voice; and I fell all\nthe time lower and lower.\n\n"At last I came to a terrible conviction that it was impossible for me to\nlift myself from this low plane. I ceased to think about it, and I wished\nto forget all; but hopeless repentance worried me still more and more.\nThen, for the first time, the thought of suicide occurred to me....\n\n"I once thought that the nearness of death would rouse my soul. I was\nmistaken. In a quarter of an hour I shall be no more, yet my view has not\nin the least changed. I see with the same eyes, I hear with the same ears,\nI think the same thoughts; there is the same strange incoherence,\nunsteadiness, and lightness in my thoughts."....\n\n\n\n\nALBERT.\n\n_A STORY._\n\n1857.\n\n\nI.\n\nFive rich young men went at three o\'clock in the morning to a ball in\nPetersburg to have a good time.\n\nMuch champagne was drunk; a majority of the gentlemen were very young; the\ngirls were pretty; a pianist and a fiddler played indefatigably one polka\nafter another; there was no cease to the noise of conversation and dancing.\nBut there was a sense of awkwardness and constraint; every one felt somehow\nor other--and this is not unusual--that all was not as it should be.\n\nThere were several attempts made to make things more lively, but simulated\nliveliness is much worse than melancholy.\n\nOne of the five young men, who was more discontented than any one else,\nboth with himself and with the others, and who had been feeling all the\nevening a sense of disgust, took his hat, and went out noiselessly on\npurpose, intending to go home.\n\nThere was no one in the ante-room, but in the next room at the door he\nheard two voices disputing. The young man paused, and listened.\n\n"It is impossible, there are guests in there," said a woman\'s voice.\n\n"Come, let me in, please. I will not do any harm," urged a man in a gentle\nvoice.\n\n"Indeed I will not without madame\'s permission," said the woman. "Where are\nyou going? Oh, what a man you are!"\n\nThe door was flung open, and on the threshold appeared the figure of a\nstranger. Seeing a guest, the maid ceased to detain the man; and the\nstranger, timidly bowing, came into the room with a somewhat unsteady gait.\n\nHe was a man of medium stature, with a lank, crooked back, and long\ndishevelled hair. He wore a short paletot, and tight ragged pantaloons over\ncoarse dirty boots. His necktie, twisted into a string, exposed his long\nwhite neck. His shirt was filthy, and the sleeves came down over his lean\nhands.\n\nBut, notwithstanding his thoroughly emaciated body, his face was attractive\nand fair; and a fresh color even mantled his cheeks under his thin dark\nbeard and side-whiskers. His dishevelled locks, thrown back, exposed a low\nand remarkably pure forehead. His dark, languid eyes looked unswervingly\nforward with an expression of serenity, submission, and sweetness, which\nmade a fascinating combination with the expression of his fresh, curved\nlips, visible under his thin moustache.\n\nAdvancing a few steps, he paused, turned to the young man, and smiled. He\nfound it apparently rather hard to smile. But his face was so lighted up by\nit, that the young man, without knowing why, smiled in return.\n\n"Who is that man?" he asked of the maid in a whisper, as the stranger\nwalked toward the room where the dancing was going on.\n\n"A crazy musician from the theatre," replied the maid. "He sometimes comes\nto call upon madame."\n\n"Where are you going, Delesof?" some one at this moment called from the\ndrawing-room.\n\nThe young man who was called Delesof returned to the drawing-room. The\nmusician was now standing at the door; and, as his eyes fell on the\ndancers, he showed by his smile and by the beating of his foot how much\npleasure this spectacle afforded him.\n\n"Won\'t you come, and have a dance too?" said one of the guests to him. The\nmusician bowed, and looked at the hostess inquiringly.\n\n"Come, come. Why not, since the gentlemen have invited you?" said the\nhostess. The musician\'s thin, weak face suddenly assumed an expression of\ndecision; and smiling and winking, and shuffling his feet, he awkwardly,\nclumsily went to join the dancers in the drawing-room.\n\nIn the midst of a quadrille a jolly officer, who was dancing very\nbeautifully and with great liveliness, accidentally hit the musician in the\nback. His weak, weary legs lost their equilibrium; and the musician, making\nineffectual struggles to keep his balance, measured his length on the\nfloor.\n\nNotwithstanding the sharp, hard sound made by his fall, almost everybody at\nthe first moment laughed.\n\nBut the musician did not rise. The guests grew silent, even the piano\nceased to sound. Delesof and the hostess were the first to reach the\nprostrate musician. He was lying on his elbow, and gloomily looking at the\nground. When he had been lifted to his feet, and set in a chair, he threw\nback his hair from his forehead with a quick motion of his bony hand, and\nbegan to smile without replying to the questions that were put.\n\n"Mr. Albert! Mr. Albert!" exclaimed the hostess. "Were you hurt? Where?\nNow, I told you that you had better not try to dance.... He is so weak,"\nshe added, addressing her guests. "It takes all his strength."\n\n"Who is he?" some one asked the hostess.\n\n"A poor man, an artist. A very nice young fellow; but he\'s a sad case, as\nyou can see."\n\nShe said this without paying the least heed to the musician\'s presence. He\nsuddenly opened his eyes as though frightened at something, collected\nhimself, and remarked to those who were standing about him, "It\'s nothing\nat all," said he suddenly, arising from the chair with evident effort.\n\nAnd in order to show that he had suffered no injury, he went into the\nmiddle of the room, and was going to dance; but he tottered, and would have\nfallen again, had he not been supported.\n\nEverybody felt constrained. All looked at him, and no one spoke. The\nmusician\'s glance again lost its vivacity; and, apparently forgetting that\nany one was looking, he put his hand to his knee. Suddenly he raised his\nhead, advanced one faltering foot, and, with the same awkward gesture as\nbefore, tossed back his hair, and went to a violin-case, and took out the\ninstrument.\n\n"It was nothing at all," said he again, waving the violin. "Gentlemen, we\nwill have a little music."\n\n"What a strange face!" said the guests among themselves.\n\n"Maybe there is great talent lurking in that unhappy creature," said one of\nthem.\n\n"Yes: it\'s a sad case,--a sad case," said another.\n\n"What a lovely face!... There is something extraordinary about it," said\nDelesof. "Let us have a look at him."...\n\n\nII.\n\nAlbert by this time, not paying attention to any one, had raised his violin\nto his shoulder, and was slowly crossing over to the piano, and tuning his\ninstrument. His lips were drawn into an expression of indifference, his\neyes were almost shut; but his lank, bony back, his long white neck, his\ncrooked legs, and disorderly black hair presented a strange but somehow not\nentirely ridiculous appearance. After he had tuned his violin, he struck a\nquick chord, and, throwing back his head, turned to the pianist who was\nwaiting to accompany him. "_Melancholie, G sharp_," he said, turning to the\npianist with a peremptory gesture. And immediately after, as though in\napology for his peremptory gesture, he smiled sweetly, and with the same\nsmile turned to his audience again.\n\nTossing back his hair with the hand that held the bow, Albert stood at one\nside of the piano, and, with a flowing motion of the bow, touched the\nstrings. Through the room there swept a pure, harmonious sound, which\ninstantly brought absolute silence.\n\nAt first, it was as though a ray of unexpectedly brilliant light had\nflashed across the inner world of each hearer\'s consciousness; and the\nnotes of the theme immediately followed, pouring forth abundant and\nbeautiful.\n\nNot one discordant or imperfect note distracted the attention of the\nlisteners. All the tones were clear, beautiful, and full of meaning. All\nsilently, with trembling expectation, followed the development of the\ntheme. From a state of tedium, of noisy gayety, or of deep drowsiness, into\nwhich these people had fallen, they were suddenly transported to a world\nwhose existence they had forgotten.\n\nIn one instant there arose in their souls, now a sentiment as though they\nwere contemplating the past, now of passionate remembrance of some\nhappiness, now the boundless longing for power and glory, now the feelings\nof humility, of unsatisfied love, and of melancholy.\n\nNow bitter-sweet, now vehemently despairing, the notes, freely\nintermingling, poured forth and poured forth, so sweetly, so powerfully,\nand so spontaneously, that it was not so much that sounds were heard, as\nthat some sort of beautiful stream of poetry, long known, but now for the\nfirst time expressed, gushed through the soul.\n\nAt each note that he played, Albert grew taller and taller. At a little\ndistance, he had no appearance of being either crippled or peculiar.\nPressing the violin to his chin, and with an expression of listening with\npassionate attention to the tones that he produced, he convulsively moved\nhis feet. Now he straightened himself up to his full height, now\nthoughtfully leaned forward.\n\nHis left hand, curving over spasmodically on the strings, seemed as though\nit had swooned in its position, while it was only the bony fingers that\nchanged about spasmodically; the right hand moved smoothly, gracefully,\nwithout effort.\n\nHis face shone with complete, enthusiastic delight; his eyes gleamed with a\nradiant, steely light; his nostrils quivered, his red lips were parted in\nrapture.\n\nSometimes his head bent down closer to his violin, his eyes almost closed,\nand his face, half shaded by his long locks, lighted up with a smile of\ngenuine blissfulness. Sometimes he quickly straightened himself up, changed\nfrom one leg to the other, and his pure forehead, and the radiant look\nwhich he threw around the room, were alive with pride, greatness, and the\nconsciousness of power. Once the pianist made a mistake, and struck a false\nchord. Physical pain was apparent in the whole form and face of the\nmusician. He paused for a second, and with an expression of childish anger\nstamped his foot, and cried, "_Moll, ce moll!_" The pianist corrected his\nmistake; Albert closed his eyes, smiled, and, again forgetting himself and\neverybody else, gave himself up with beatitude to his work. Everybody who\nwas in the room while Albert was playing preserved an attentive silence,\nand seemed to live and breathe only in the music.\n\nThe gay officer sat motionless in a chair by the window, with his eyes\nfixed upon the floor, and drawing long heavy sighs. The girls, awed by the\nuniversal silence, sat along by the walls, only occasionally exchanging\nglances expressive of satisfaction or perplexity.\n\nThe fat smiling face of the hostess was radiant with happiness. The pianist\nkept his eyes fixed on Albert\'s face, and while his whole figure from head\nto foot showed his solicitude lest he should make some mistake, he did his\nbest to follow him. One of the guests, who had been drinking more heavily\nthan the rest, lay at full length on the sofa, and tried not to move lest\nhe should betray his emotion. Delesof experienced an unusual sensation. It\nseemed as though an icy band, now contracting, now expanding, were pressed\nupon his head. The roots of his hair seemed endued with consciousness; the\ncold shivers ran down his back, something rose higher and higher in his\nthroat, his nose and palate were full of little needles, and the tears\nstole down his cheeks.\n\nHe shook himself, tried to swallow them back and wipe them away without\nattracting attention, but fresh tears followed and streamed down his face.\nBy some sort of strange association of impressions, the first tones of\nAlbert\'s violin carried Delesof back to his early youth.\n\nOld before his time, weary of life, a broken man, he suddenly felt as\nthough he were a boy of seventeen again, self-satisfied and handsome,\nblissfully dull, unconsciously happy. He remembered his first love for his\ncousin who wore a pink dress, he remembered his first confession of it in\nthe linden alley; he remembered the warmth and the inexpressible charm of\nthe fortuitous kiss; he remembered the immensity and enigmatical mystery of\nNature as it surrounded them then.\n\nIn his imagination as it went back in its flight, _she_ gleamed in a mist\nof indefinite hopes, of incomprehensible desires, and the indubitable faith\nin the possibility of impossible happiness. All the priceless moments of\nthat time, one after the other, arose before him, not like unmeaning\ninstants of the fleeting present, but like the immutable, full-formed,\nreproachful images of the past.\n\nHe contemplated them with rapture, and wept,--wept not because the time had\npassed and he might have spent it more profitably (if that time had been\ngiven to him again he would not have spent it any more profitably), but he\nwept because it had passed and would never return. His recollections\nevolved themselves without effort, and Albert\'s violin was their\nmouthpiece. It said, "They have passed, forever passed, the days of thy\nstrength, of love, and of happiness; passed forever, and never will return.\nWeep for them, shed all thy tears, let thy life pass in tears for these\ndays; this is the only and best happiness that remains to thee."\n\nAt the end of the next variation, Albert\'s face grew serene, his eyes\nflushed, great clear drops of sweat poured down his cheeks. The veins\nswelled on his forehead; his whole body swayed more and more; his pale lips\nwere parted, and his whole figure expressed an enthusiastic craving for\nenjoyment. Despairingly swaying with his whole body, and throwing back his\nhair, he laid down his violin, and with a smile of proud satisfaction and\nhappiness gazed at the bystanders. Then his back assumed its ordinary\ncurve, his head sank, his lips grew set, his eyes lost their fire; and as\nthough he were ashamed of himself, timidly glancing round, and stumbling,\nhe went into the next room.\n\n\nIII.\n\nSomething strange came over all the audience, and something strange was\nnoticeable in the dead silence that succeeded Albert\'s playing. It was as\nthough each desired, and yet dared not, to acknowledge the meaning of it\nall.\n\nWhat did it mean,--this brightly lighted, warm room, these brilliant women,\nthe dawn just appearing at the windows, these hurrying pulses, and the pure\nimpressions made by the fleeting tones of music? But no one ventured to\nacknowledge the meaning of it all; on the contrary, almost all, feeling\nincapable of throwing themselves completely under the influence of what the\nnew impression concealed from them, rebelled against it.\n\n"Well, now, he plays mighty well," said the officer.\n\n"Wonderfully," replied Delesof, stealthily wiping his cheek with his\nsleeve.\n\n"One thing sure, it\'s time to be going, gentlemen," said the gentleman who\nhad been lying on the sofa, straightening himself up a little. "We\'ll have\nto give him something, gentlemen. Let us make a collection."\n\nAt this time, Albert was sitting alone in the next room, on the sofa. As he\nsupported himself with his elbows on his bony knees, he smoothed his face\nwith his dirty, sweaty hand, tossed back his hair, and smiled at his own\nhappy thoughts.\n\nA large collection was taken up, and Delesof was chosen to present it.\nAside from this, Delesof, who had been so keenly and unwontedly affected by\nthe music, had conceived the thought of conferring some benefit upon this\nman.\n\nIt came into his head to take him home with him, to feed him, to establish\nhim somewhere,--in other words, to lift him from his vile position.\n\n"Well, are you tired?" asked Delesof, approaching him. Albert replied with\na smile. "You have creative talent; you ought seriously to devote yourself\nto music, to play in public."\n\n"I should like to have something to drink," exclaimed Albert, as though\nsuddenly waking up.\n\nDelesof brought him some wine, and the musician greedily drained two\nglasses.\n\n"What splendid wine!" he exclaimed.\n\n"What a lovely thing that _Melancholie_ is!" said Delesof.\n\n"Oh, yes, yes," replied Albert with a smile. "But pardon me, I do not know\nwith whom I have the honor to be talking; maybe you are a count or a\nprince. Couldn\'t you let me have a little money?" He paused for a moment.\n"I have nothing--I am a poor man: I couldn\'t pay it back to you."\n\nDelesof flushed, grew embarrassed, and hastened to hand the musician the\nmoney that had been collected for him.\n\n"Very much obliged to you," said Albert, seizing the money. "Now let us\nhave some more music; I will play for you as much as you wish. Only let me\nhave something to drink, something to drink," he repeated, as he started to\nhis feet.\n\nDelesof gave him some more wine, and asked him to sit down by him.\n\n"Pardon me if I am frank with you," said Delesof. "Your talent has\ninterested me so much. It seems to me that you are in a wretched position."\n\nAlbert glanced now at Delesof, now at the hostess, who just then came into\nthe room.\n\n"Permit me to help you," continued Delesof. "If you need any thing, then I\nshould be very glad if you would come and stay with me for a while. I live\nalone, and maybe I could be of some service to you."\n\nAlbert smiled, and made no reply.\n\n"Why don\'t you thank him?" said the hostess. "It seems to me that this\nwould be a capital thing for you.--Only I would not advise you," she\ncontinued, turning to Delesof, and shaking her head warningly.\n\n"Very much obliged to you," said Albert, seizing Delesof\'s hand with both\nhis moist ones. "Only now let us have some music, please."\n\nBut the rest of the guests were already making their preparations to\ndepart; and as Albert did not address them, they came out into the\nante-room.\n\nAlbert bade the hostess farewell; and having taken his worn hat with wide\nbrim, and a last summer\'s _alma viva_, which composed his only protection\nagainst the winter, he went with Delesof down the steps.\n\nAs soon as Delesof took his seat in his carriage with his new friend, and\nbecame conscious of that unpleasant odor of intoxication and filthiness\nexhaled by the musician, he began to repent of the step that he had taken,\nand to curse himself for his childish softness of heart and lack of reason.\nMoreover, all that Albert said was so foolish and in such bad taste, and he\nseemed so near a sudden state of beastly intoxication, that Delesof was\ndisgusted. "What shall I do with him?" he asked himself.\n\nAfter they had been driving for a quarter of an hour, Albert relapsed into\nsilence, took off his hat, and laid it on his knee, then threw himself into\na corner of the carriage, and began to snore.... The wheels crunched\nmonotonously over the frozen snow, the feeble light of dawn scarcely made\nits way through the frosty windows.\n\nDelesof glanced at his companion. His long body, wrapped in his mantle, lay\nalmost lifeless near him. It seemed to him that a long head with large\nblack nose was swaying on his trunk; but on examining more closely he\nperceived that what he took to be nose and face was the man\'s hair, and\nthat his actual face was lower down.\n\nHe bent over, and studied the features of Albert\'s face. Then the beauty of\nhis brow and of his peacefully closed mouth once more charmed him. Under\nthe influence of nervous excitement caused by the sleepless hours of the\nlong night and the music, Delesof, as he looked at that face, was once more\ncarried back to the blessed world of which he had caught a glimpse once\nbefore that night; again he remembered the happy and magnanimous time of\nhis youth, and he ceased to repent of his rashness. At that moment he loved\nAlbert truly and warmly, and firmly resolved to be a benefactor to him.\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe next morning when Delesof was awakened to go to his office, he saw,\nwith an unpleasant feeling of surprise, his old screen, his old servant,\nand his clock on the table.\n\n"What did I expect to see if not the usual objects that surround me?" he\nasked himself.\n\nThen he recollected the musician\'s black eyes and happy smile; the motive\nof the _Melancholie_ and all the strange experiences of the night came back\ninto his consciousness. It was never his way, however, to reconsider\nwhether he had done wisely or foolishly in taking the musician home with\nhim. After he had dressed, he carefully laid out his plans for the day: he\ntook some paper, wrote out some necessary directions for the house, and\nhastily put on his cloak and galoshes.\n\nAs he went by the dining-room he glanced in at the door. Albert, with his\nface buried in the pillow and lying at full length in his dirty, tattered\nshirt, was buried in the profoundest slumber on the saffron sofa, where in\nabsolute unconsciousness he had been laid the night before.\n\nDelesof felt that something was not right: it disturbed him. "Please go for\nme to Boriuzovsky, and borrow his violin for a day or two," said he to his\nman; "and when he wakes up, bring him some coffee, and get him some clean\nlinen and some old suit or other of mine. Fix him up as well as you can,\nplease."\n\nWhen he returned home in the afternoon, Delesof, to his surprise, found\nthat Albert was not there.\n\n"Where is he?" he asked of his man.\n\n"He went out immediately after dinner," replied the servant. "He took the\nviolin, and went out, saying that he would be back again in an hour; but\nsince that time we have not seen him."\n\n"Ta, ta! how provoking!" said Delesof. "Why did you let him go, Zakhar?"\n\nZakhar was a Petersburg lackey, who had been in Delesof\'s service for eight\nyears. Delesof, as a single young bachelor, could not help intrusting him\nwith his plans; and he liked to get his judgment in regard to each of his\nundertakings.\n\n"How should I have ventured to detain him?" replied Zakhar, playing with\nhis watch-charms. "If you had intimated, Dmitri Ivanovitch, that you wished\nme to keep him here, I might have kept him at home. But you only spoke of\nhis wardrobe."\n\n"Ta! how vexatious! Well, what has he been doing while I was out?"\n\nZakhar smiled.\n\n"Indeed, he\'s a real artist, as you may say, Dmitri Ivanovitch. As soon as\nhe woke up he asked for some madeira: then he began to keep the cook and me\npretty busy. Such an absurd.... However, he\'s a very interesting character.\nI brought him some tea, got some dinner ready for him; but he would not eat\nalone, so he asked me to sit down with him. But when he began to play on\nthe fiddle, then I knew that you would not find many such artists at\nIzler\'s. One might well keep such a man. When he played \'Down the Little\nMother Volga\' for us, why, it was enough to make a man weep. It was too\ngood for any thing! The people from all the floors came down into our\nentry to listen."\n\n"Well, did you give him some clothes?" asked the barin.\n\n"Certainly I did: I gave him your dress-shirt, and I put on him an overcoat\nof mine. You want to help such a man as that, he\'s a fine fellow." Zakhar\nsmiled. "He asked me what rank you were, and if you had had important\nacquaintances, and how many _souls_ of peasantry you had."\n\n"Very good: but now we must send and find him; and henceforth don\'t give\nhim any thing to drink, otherwise you\'ll do him more harm than good."\n\n"That is true," said Zakhar in assent. "He doesn\'t seem in very robust\nhealth: we used to have an overseer who, like him"....\n\nDelesof, who had already long ago heard the story of the drunken overseer,\ndid not give Zakhar time to finish, but bade him make every thing ready for\nthe night, and then go out and bring the musician back.\n\nHe threw himself down on his bed, and put out the candle; but it was long\nbefore he fell asleep, for thinking about Albert.\n\n"This may seem strange to some of my friends," said Delesof to himself,\n"but how seldom it is that I can do any thing for any one beside myself!\nand I ought to thank God for a chance when one presents itself. I will not\nsend him away. I will do every thing, at least every thing that I can, to\nhelp him. Maybe he is not absolutely crazy, but only inclined to get drunk.\nIt certainly will not cost me very much. Where one is, there is always\nenough to satisfy two. Let him live with me a while, and then we will find\nhim a place, or get him up a concert; we\'ll help him off the shoals, and\nthen there will be time enough to see what will come of it." An agreeable\nsense of self-satisfaction came over him after making this resolution.\n\n"Certainly I am not a bad man: I might say I am far from being a bad man,"\nhe thought. "I might go so far as to say that I am a good man, when I\ncompare myself with others."\n\nHe was just dropping off to sleep when the sound of opening doors, and\nsteps in the ante-room, roused him again. "Well, shall I treat him rather\nseverely?" he asked himself; "I suppose that is best, and I ought to do\nit."\n\nHe rang.\n\n"Well, did you find him?" he asked of Zakhar, who answered his call.\n\n"He\'s a poor, wretched fellow, Dmitri Ivanovitch," said Zakhar, shaking his\nhead significantly, and closing his eyes.\n\n"What! is he drunk?"\n\n"Very weak."\n\n"Had he the violin with him?"\n\n"I brought it: the lady gave it to me."\n\n"All right. Now please don\'t bring him to me to-night: let him sleep it\noff; and to-morrow don\'t under any circumstances let him out of the house."\n\nBut before Zakhar had time to leave the room, Albert came in.\n\n\nV.\n\n"You don\'t mean to say that you\'ve gone to bed at this time," said Albert\nwith a smile. "I was there again, at Anna Ivanovna\'s. I spent a very\npleasant evening. We had music, told stories; there was a very pleasant\ncompany there. Please let me have a glass of something to drink," he added,\nseizing a carafe of water that stood on the table, "only not water."\n\nAlbert was just as he had been the night before,--the same lovely smiling\neyes and lips, the same fresh inspired brow, and weak features. Zakhar\'s\novercoat fitted him as though it had been made for him, and the clean,\ntall, stiffly-starched collar of the dress-shirt picturesquely fitted\naround his delicate white neck, giving him a peculiarly childlike and\ninnocent appearance.\n\nHe sat down on Delesof\'s bed, smiling with pleasure and gratitude, and\nlooked at him without speaking. Delesof gazed into Albert\'s eyes, and\nsuddenly felt himself once under the sway of that smile. All desire for\nsleep vanished from him, he forgot his resolution to be stern: on the\ncontrary, he felt like having a gay time, to hear some music, and to talk\nconfidentially with Albert till morning. Delesof bade Zakhar bring a bottle\nof wine, cigarettes, and the violin.\n\n"This is excellent," said Albert. "It\'s early yet, we\'ll have a little\nmusic. I will play whatever you like."\n\nZakhar, with evident satisfaction, brought a bottle of Lafitte, two\nglasses, some mild cigarettes such as Albert smoked, and the violin. But,\ninstead of going off to bed as his barin bade him, he lighted a cigar, and\nsat down in the next room.\n\n"Let us talk instead," said Delesof to the musician, who was beginning to\ntune the violin.\n\nAlbert sat down submissively on the bed, and smiled pleasantly.\n\n"Oh, yes!" said he, suddenly striking his forehead with his hand, and\nputting on an expression of anxious curiosity. The expression of his face\nalways foretold what he was going to say. "I wanted to ask you,"--he\nhesitated a little,--"that gentleman who was there with you last\nevening.... You called him N. Was he the son of the celebrated N.?"\n\n"His own son," replied Delesof, not understanding at all what Albert could\nfind of interest in him.\n\n"Indeed!" he exclaimed, smiling with satisfaction. "I instantly noticed\nthat there was something peculiarly aristocratic in his manners. I love\naristocrats. There is something splendid and elegant about an aristocrat.\nAnd that officer who danced so beautifully," he went on to ask. "He also\npleased me very much, he was so gay and noble looking. It seems he is\ncalled Adjutant N. N."\n\n"Who?" asked Delesof.\n\n"The one who ran into me when we were dancing. He must be a splendid man."\n\n"No, he is a silly fellow," replied Delesof.\n\n"Oh, no! it can\'t be," rejoined Albert hotly. "There\'s something very, very\npleasant about him. And he\'s a fine musician," added Albert. "He played\nsomething from an opera. It\'s a long time since I have seen any one who\npleased me so much."\n\n"Yes, he plays very well; but I don\'t like his playing," said Delesof,\nanxious to bring his companion to talk about music. "He does not understand\nclassic music, but only Donizetti and Bellini; and that\'s no music, you\nknow. You agree with me, don\'t you?"\n\n"Oh, no, no! Pardon me," replied Albert with a gentle expression of\nvindication. "The old music is music; but modern music is music too. And in\nthe modern music there are extraordinarily beautiful things. Now,\n\'Somnambula,\' and the _finale_ of \'Lucia,\' and Chopin, and \'Robert\'! I\noften think,"--he hesitated, apparently collecting his thoughts,--"that if\nBeethoven were alive, he would weep tears of joy to hear \'Somnambula.\' It\'s\nso beautiful all through. I heard \'Somnambula\' first when Viardot and\nRubini were here. That was something worth while," he said, with shining\neyes, and making a gesture with both hands, as though he were casting\nsomething from his breast. "I\'d give a good deal, but it would be\nimpossible, to bring it back."\n\n"Well, but how do you like the opera nowadays?" asked Delesof.\n\n"Bosio is good, very good," was his reply, "exquisite beyond words; but she\ndoes not touch me here," he said, pointing to his sunken chest. "A singer\nmust have passion, and she hasn\'t any. She is enjoyable, but she doesn\'t\ntorture you."\n\n"Well, how about Lablache?"\n\n"I heard him in Paris, in \'The Barber of Seville.\' Then he was the only\none, but now he is old. He can\'t be an artist, he is old."\n\n"Well, supposing he is old, still he is fine in _morceaux d\'ensemble_,"\nsaid Delesof, still speaking of Lablache.\n\n"Who said that he was old?" said Albert severely. "He can\'t be old. The\nartist can never be old. Much is needed in an artist, but fire most of\nall," he declared with glistening eyes, and raising both hands in the air.\nAnd, indeed, a terrible inner fire seemed to glow throughout his whole\nframe. "Ah, my God!" he exclaimed suddenly. "You don\'t know Petrof, do\nyou,--Petrof, the artist?"\n\n"No, I don\'t know him," replied Delesof with a smile.\n\n"How I wish that you and he might become acquainted! You would enjoy\ntalking with him. How he does understand art! He and I often used to meet\nat Anna Ivanovna\'s, but now she is vexed with him for some reason or other.\nBut I really wish that you might make his acquaintance. He has great, great\ntalent."\n\n"Oh! Does he paint pictures?" asked Delesof.\n\n"I don\'t know. No, I think not; but he was an artist of the Academy. What\nthoughts he had! Whenever he talks, it is wonderful. Oh, Petrof has great\ntalent, only he leads a very gay life!... It\'s too bad," said Albert with a\nsmile. The next moment he got up from the bed, took the violin, and began\nto play.\n\n"Have you been at the opera lately?" asked Delesof.\n\nAlbert looked round, and sighed.\n\n"Ah, I have not been able to!" he said, clutching his head. Again he sat\ndown by Delesof. "I will tell you," he went on to say, almost in a whisper.\n"I can\'t go: I can\'t play there. I have nothing, nothing at all,--no\nclothes, no home, no violin. It\'s a wretched life,--a wretched life!" he\nrepeated the phrase. "Yes, and why have I got into such a state? Why,\nindeed? It ought not to have been," said he, smiling. "_Akh! Don Juan._"\n\nAnd he struck his head.\n\n"Now let us have something to eat," said Delesof.\n\nAlbert, without replying, sprang up, seized the violin, and began to play\nthe _finale_ of the first act of "Don Juan," accompanying it with a\ndescription of the scene in the opera.\n\nDelesof felt the hair stand up on his head, when he played the voice of the\ndying commander.\n\n"No, I cannot play to-night," said Albert, laying down the instrument. "I\nhave been drinking too much." But immediately after he went to the table,\npoured out a brimming glass of wine, drank it at one gulp, and again sat\ndown on the bed near Delesof.\n\nDelesof looked steadily at Albert. The latter occasionally smiled, and\nDelesof returned his smile. Neither of them spoke, but the glance and smile\nbrought them close together into a reciprocity of affection. Delesof felt\nthat he was growing constantly fonder and fonder of this man, and he\nexperienced an inexpressible pleasure.\n\n"Were you ever in love?" he asked suddenly. Albert remained sunk in thought\nfor a few seconds, then his face lighted up with a melancholy smile. He\nbent over toward Delesof, and gazed straight into his eyes.\n\n"Why did you ask me that question?" he whispered. "But I will tell you all\nabout it. I like you," he added, after a few moments of thought, and\nglancing around. "I will not deceive you, I will tell you all, just as it\nwas, from the beginning." He paused, and his eyes took on a strange wild\nappearance. "You know that I am weak in judgment," he said suddenly. "Yes,\nyes," he continued. "Anna Ivanovna has told you about it. She tells\neverybody that I am crazy. It isn\'t true, she says it for a joke; she is a\ngood woman, but I really have not been quite well for some time." Albert\npaused again, and stood up, gazing with wide-opened eyes at the dark door.\n"You asked me if I had ever been in love. Yes, I have been in love," he\nwhispered, raising his brows. "That happened long ago; it was at a time\nwhen I still had a place at the theatre. I went to play second violin at\nthe opera, and she came into a parquet box at the left."\n\nAlbert stood up, and bent over to Delesof\'s ear. "But no," said he, "why\nshould I mention her name? You probably know her, everybody knows her. I\nsaid nothing, but simply looked at her: I knew that I was a poor artist,\nand she an aristocratic lady. I knew that very well. I only looked at her,\nand had no thoughts."\n\nAlbert paused for a moment, as though making sure of his recollections.\n\n"How it happened I know not, but I was invited once to accompany her on my\nviolin.... Now I was only a poor artist!" he repeated, shaking his head and\nsmiling. "But no, I cannot tell you, I cannot!" he exclaimed, again\nclutching his head. "How happy I was!"\n\n"What? did you go to her house often?" asked Delesof.\n\n"Once, only once.... But it was my own fault; I wasn\'t in my right mind. I\nwas a poor artist, and she an aristocratic lady. I ought not to have spoken\nto her. But I lost my senses, I committed a folly. Petrof told me the\ntruth: \'It would have been better only to have seen her at the theatre.\'"\n\n"What did you do?" asked Delesof.\n\n"Ah! wait, wait, I cannot tell you that."\n\nAnd, hiding his face in his hands, he said nothing for some time.\n\n"I was late at the orchestra. Petrof and I had been drinking that evening,\nand I was excited. She was sitting in her box, and talking with some\ngeneral. I don\'t know who that general was. She was sitting at the very\nedge of the box, with her arm resting on the rim. She wore a white dress,\nwith pearls on her neck. She was talking with him, but she looked at me.\nTwice she looked at me. She had arranged her hair in such a becoming way! I\nstopped playing, and stood near the bass, and gazed at her. Then, for the\nfirst time, something strange took place in me. She smiled on the general,\nbut she looked at me. I felt certain that she was talking about me; and\nsuddenly I seemed to be not in my place in the orchestra, but was standing\nin her box, and seizing her hand in that place. What was the meaning of\nthat?" asked Albert, after a moment\'s silence.\n\n"A powerful imagination," said Delesof.\n\n"No, no, ... I cannot tell," said Albert frowning. "Even then I was poor. I\nhadn\'t any room; and when I went to the theatre, I sometimes used to sleep\nthere."\n\n"What, in the theatre?" asked Delesof.\n\n"Ah! I am not afraid of these stupid things. Ah! just wait a moment. As\nsoon as everybody was gone, I went to that box where she had been sitting,\nand slept there. That was my only pleasure. How many nights I spent there!\nOnly once again did I have that experience. At night many things seemed to\ncome to me. But I cannot tell you much about them." Albert contracted his\nbrows, and looked at Delesof. "What did it mean?" he asked.\n\n"It was strange," replied the other.\n\n"No, wait, wait!" he bent over to his ear, and said in a whisper,--\n\n"I kissed her hand, wept there before her, and said many things to her. I\nheard the fragrance of her sighs, I heard her voice. She said many things\nto me that one night. Then I took my violin, and began to play softly. And\nI played beautifully. But it became terrible to me. I am not afraid of such\nstupid things, and I don\'t believe in them, but my head felt terribly," he\nsaid, smiling sweetly, and moving his hand over his forehead. "It seemed\nterrible to me on account of my poor mind; something happened in my head.\nMaybe it was nothing; what do you think?"\n\nNeither spoke for several minutes.\n\n    _"Und wenn die Wolken sie verhuellen,\n    Die Sonne bleibt doch ewig klar._[54]"\n\nhummed Albert, smiling gently. "That is true, isn\'t it?" he asked.\n\n    _"Ich auch habe gelebt und genossen."_[55]\n\n[Footnote 54:\n\n    E\'en though the clouds may veil it,\n      The sun shines ever clear.\n\n]\n\n[Footnote 55:\n\n    I also have lived and rejoiced.\n\n]\n\n"Ah, old man Petrof! how this would have made things clear to you!"\n\nDelesof, in silence and with dismay, looked at his companion\'s excited and\ncolorless face.\n\n"Do you know the Juristen waltzes?" suddenly asked Albert in a loud voice,\nand without waiting for an answer, jumped up, seized the violin, and began\nto play the waltz. In absolute self-forgetfulness, and evidently imagining\nthat a whole orchestra was playing for him, Albert smiled, began to dance,\nto shuffle his feet, and to play admirably.\n\n"Hey, we will have a good time!" he exclaimed, as he ended, and waved his\nviolin. "I am going," said he, after sitting down in silence for a little.\n"Won\'t you come along too?"\n\n"Where?" asked Delesof in surprise.\n\n"Let us go to Anna Ivanovna\'s again. It\'s gay there,--bustle, people,\nmusic."\n\nDelesof for a moment was almost persuaded. However, coming to his senses,\nhe promised Albert that he would go with him the next day.\n\n"I should like to go this minute."\n\n"Indeed, I wouldn\'t go."\n\nAlbert sighed, and laid down the violin.\n\n"Shall I stay, then?" He looked over at the table, but the wine was gone;\nand so, wishing him a good-night, he left the room.\n\nDelesof rang. "Look here," said he to Zakhar, "don\'t let Mr. Albert go\nanywhere without asking me about it first."\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe next day was a holiday. Delesof, on waking, sat in his parlor, drinking\nhis coffee and reading a book. Albert, who was in the next room, had not\nyet moved. Zakhar discreetly opened the door, and looked into the\ndining-room.\n\n"Would you believe it, Dmitri Ivanovitch, there he lies asleep on the bare\nsofa. I would not send him away for any thing, God knows. He\'s like a\nlittle child. Indeed, he\'s an artist!"\n\nAt twelve o\'clock, there was a sound of yawning and coughing on the other\nside of the door.\n\nZakhar again crept into the dining-room; and the barin heard his wheedling\nvoice, and Albert\'s gentle, beseeching voice.\n\n"Well, how is he?" asked Delesof, when Zakhar came out.\n\n"He feels blue, Dmitri Ivanovitch. He doesn\'t want to get dressed. He\'s so\ncross. All he asks for is something to drink."\n\n"Now, if we are to get hold of him, we must strengthen his character," said\nDelesof to himself. And, forbidding Zakhar to give him any wine, he again\ndevoted himself to his book; in spite of himself, however, listening all\nthe time for developments in the dining-room.\n\nBut there was no movement there, only occasionally were heard a heavy chest\ncough and spitting. Two hours passed. Delesof, after dressing to go out,\nresolved to look in upon his guest. Albert was sitting motionless at the\nwindow, leaning his head on his hands.\n\nHe looked round. His face was sallow, morose, and not only melancholy but\ndeeply unhappy. He tried to welcome his host with a smile, but his face\nassumed a still more woe-begone expression. It seemed as though he were on\nthe point of tears.\n\nWith effort he stood up and bowed. "If I might have just a little glass of\nsimple vodka," he exclaimed with a supplicating expression. "I am so weak.\nIf you please!"\n\n"Coffee will be more strengthening, I would advise you."\n\nAlbert\'s face lost its childish expression; he gazed coldly, sadly, out of\nthe window, and fell back into the chair.\n\n"Wouldn\'t you like some breakfast?"\n\n"No, thank you, I haven\'t any appetite."\n\n"If you want to play on the violin, you will not disturb me," said Delesof,\nlaying the instrument on the table. Albert looked at the violin with a\ncontemptuous smile.\n\n"No, I am too weak, I cannot play," he said, and pushed the instrument from\nhim.\n\nAfter that, in reply to all Delesof\'s propositions to go to walk, to go to\nthe theatre in the evening, or any thing else, he only shook his head\nmournfully, and refused to speak.\n\nDelesof went out, made a few calls, dined out, and before the theatre hour,\nhe returned to his rooms to change his attire and find out how the musician\nwas getting along.\n\nAlbert was sitting in the dark ante-room, and, with his head resting on his\nhand, was gazing at the heated stove. He was neatly dressed, washed and\ncombed; but his eyes were sad and vacant, and his whole form expressed even\nmore weakness and debility than in the morning.\n\n"Well, have you had dinner, Mr. Albert?" asked Delesof.\n\nAlbert nodded his head, and, after looking with a terrified expression at\nDelesof, dropped his eyes. It made Delesof feel uncomfortable.\n\n"I have been talking to-day with a manager," said he, also dropping his\neyes. "He would be very glad to make terms with you, if you would like to\naccept an engagement."\n\n"I thank you, but I cannot play," said Albert, almost in a whisper; and he\nwent into his room, and closed the door as softly as possible. After a few\nminutes, lifting the latch as softly as possible, he came out of the room,\nbringing the violin. Casting a sharp, angry look at Delesof, he laid the\ninstrument on the table, and again disappeared.\n\nDelesof shrugged his shoulders, and smiled.\n\n"What am I to do now? Wherein am I to blame?" he asked himself.\n\n"Well, how is the musician?" was his first question when he returned home\nlate that evening.\n\n"Bad," was Zakhar\'s short and ringing reply. "He sighs all the time, and\ncoughs, and says nothing at all, only he has asked for vodka four or five\ntimes, and once I gave him some. How can we avoid killing him this way,\nDmitri Ivanovitch? That was the way the overseer"....\n\n"Well, hasn\'t he played on the fiddle?"\n\n"Didn\'t even touch it. I took it to him, twice--Well, he took it up slowly,\nand carried it out," said Zakhar with a smile. "Do you still bid me refuse\nhim something to drink?"\n\n"Don\'t give him any thing to-day; we\'ll see what\'ll come of it. What is he\ndoing now?"\n\n"He has shut himself into the parlor."\n\nDelesof went into his library, took down a few French books, and the\nTestament in German. "Put these books to-morrow in his room; and look out,\ndon\'t let him get away," said he to Zakhar.\n\nThe next morning Zakhar informed his barin that the musician had not slept\na wink all night. "He kept walking up and down his rooms, and going to the\nsideboard to try to open the cupboard and door; but every thing, in spite\nof his efforts, remained locked."\n\nZakhar told how, while he was going to sleep, he heard Albert muttering to\nhimself in the darkness and gesticulating.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEach day Albert grew more gloomy and taciturn. It seemed as though he were\nafraid of Delesof, and his face expressed painful terror whenever their\neyes met. He did not touch either book or violin, and made no replies to\nthe questions put to him.\n\nOn the third day after the musician came to stay with him, Delesof returned\nhome late in the evening, tired and worried. He had been on the go all day,\nattending to his duties. Though they had seemed very simple and easy, yet,\nas is often the case, he had not made any progress at all, in spite of his\nstrenuous endeavors. Afterwards he had stopped at the club, and lost at\nwhist. He was out of spirits.\n\n"Well, God be with him," he replied to Zakhar, who had been telling him of\nAlbert\'s pitiable state. "To-morrow I shall be really worried about him. Is\nhe willing or not to stay with me, and follow my advice? No? Then it\'s\nidle. I have done the best that I could."\n\n"That\'s what comes of trying to be a benefactor to people," said he to\nhimself. "I am putting myself to inconvenience for him. I have taken this\nfilthy creature into my rooms, which keeps me from receiving strangers in\nthe morning; I work and trot; and yet he looks upon me as some enemy who,\nagainst his will, would keep him in pound. But the worst is, that he is not\nwilling to take a step in his own behalf. That\'s the way with them all."\n\nThat word _all_ referred to people in general, and especially to those with\nwhom he had been associated in business that day. "But what is to be done\nfor him now? What is he contemplating? Why is he melancholy? Is he\nmelancholy on account of the debauch from which I rescued him? on account\nof the degradation in which he has been? the humiliation from which I saved\nhim? Can it be that he has fallen so low that it is a burden for him to\nlook on a pure life?...\n\n"No, this was a childish action," reasoned Delesof. "Why should I undertake\nto direct others, when it is as much as I can do to manage my own affairs?"\n\nThe impulse came over him to let him go immediately, but after a little\ndeliberation he postponed it till the morning.\n\nDuring the night Delesof was aroused by the noise of a falling table in the\nante-room, and the sound of voices and stamping feet.\n\n"Just wait a little, I will tell Dmitri Ivanovitch," said Zakhar\'s voice;\nAlbert\'s voice replied passionately and incoherently.\n\nDelesof leaped up, and went with a candle into the ante-room. Zakhar in his\nnightdress was standing against the door; Albert in cap and _alma viva_ was\ntrying to pull him away, and was screaming at him in a pathetic voice.\n\n"You have no right to detain me; I have a passport; I have not stolen any\nthing from you. You must let me go. I will go to the police."\n\n"I beg of you, Dmitri Ivanovitch," said Zakhar, turning to his barin, and\ncontinuing to stand guard at the door. "He got up in the night, found the\nkey in my overcoat-pocket, and he has drunk up the whole decanter of sweet\nvodka. Was that good? And now he wants to go. You didn\'t give me orders,\nand so I could not let him out."\n\nAlbert, seeing Delesof, began to pull still more violently on Zakhar. "No\none has the right to detain me! He cannot do it," he screamed, raising his\nvoice more and more.\n\n"Let him go, Zakhar," said Delesof. "I do not wish to detain you, and I\nhave no right to, but I advise you to stay till to-morrow," he added,\naddressing Albert.\n\n"No one has the right to detain me. I am going to the police," screamed\nAlbert more and more furiously, addressing only Zakhar, and not heeding\nDelesof. "Guard!" he suddenly shouted at the top of his voice.\n\n"Now, what are you screaming like that for? You see you are free to go,"\nsaid Zakhar, opening the door.\n\nAlbert ceased screaming. "How did they dare? They were going to murder me!\nNo!" he muttered to himself as he put on his galoshes. Not offering to say\ngood-by, and still muttering something unintelligible, he went out of the\ndoor. Zakhar accompanied him to the gate, and came back.\n\n"Thank the Lord, Dmitri Ivanovitch! Any longer would have been a sin," said\nhe to his barin. "And now we must count the silver."\n\nDelesof only shook his head, and made no reply. There came over him a\nlively recollection of the first two evenings which he and the musician had\nspent together; he remembered the last wretched days which Albert had spent\nthere; and above all he remembered the sweet but absurd sentiment of\nwonder, of love, and of sympathy, which had been aroused in him by the very\nfirst sight of this strange man; and he began to pity him.\n\n"What will become of him now?" he asked himself. "Without money, without\nwarm clothing, alone at midnight!" He thought of sending Zakhar after him,\nbut now it was too late.\n\n"Is it cold out doors?" he asked.\n\n"A healthy frost, Dmitri Ivanovitch," replied the man. "I forgot to tell\nyou that you will have to buy some more firewood to last till spring."\n\n"But what did you mean by saying that it would last?"\n\n\nVII.\n\nOut of doors it was really cold; but Albert did not feel it, he was so\nexcited by the wine that he had taken and by the quarrel.\n\nAs he entered the street, he looked around him, and rubbed his hands with\npleasure. The street was empty, but the long lines of lights were still\nbrilliantly gleaming; the sky was clear and beautiful. "What!" he cried,\naddressing the lighted window in Delesof\'s apartments; and then thrusting\nhis hands in his trousers pockets under his coat, and looking straight\nahead, he walked with heavy and uncertain steps straight up the street.\n\nHe felt an absolute weight in his legs and abdomen, something hummed in his\nhead, some invisible power seemed to hurl him from side to side; but he\nstill plunged ahead in the direction of where Anna Ivanovna lived.\n\nStrange, disconnected thoughts rushed through his head. Now he remembered\nhis quarrel with Zakhar, now something recalled the sea and his first\nvoyage in the steamboat to Russia; now the merry night that he had spent\nwith some friend in the wine-shop by which he was passing; then suddenly\nthere came to him a familiar air singing itself in his recollections, and\nhe seemed to see the object of his passion and the terrible night in the\ntheatre.\n\nBut notwithstanding their incoherence, all these recollections presented\nthemselves before his imaginations with such distinctness that when he\nclosed his eyes he could not tell which was nearer to the reality: what he\nwas doing, or what he was thinking. He did not realize and he did not feel\nhow his legs moved, how he staggered and hit against a wall, how he looked\naround him, and how he made his way from street to street.\n\nAs he went along the Little Morskaya, Albert tripped and fell. Collecting\nhimself in a moment, he saw before him some huge and magnificent edifice,\nand he went toward it.\n\nIn the sky not a star was to be seen, nor sign of dawn, nor moon, neither\nwere there any street-lights there; but all objects were perfectly\ndistinguishable. The windows of the edifice, which loomed up at the corner\nof the street, were brilliantly lighted, but the lights wavered like\nreflections. The building kept coming nearer and nearer, clearer and\nclearer, to Albert.\n\nBut the lights vanished the moment that Albert entered the wide portals.\nInside it was dark. He took a few steps under the vaulted ceiling, and\nsomething like shades glided by and fled at his approach.\n\n"Why did I come here?" wondered Albert; but some irresistible power dragged\nhim forward into the depths of the immense hall.\n\nThere stood some lofty platform, and around it in silence stood what seemed\nlike little men. "Who is going to speak?" asked Albert. No one answered,\nbut some one pointed to the platform. There stood now on the platform a\ntall, thin man, with bushy hair and dressed in a variegated gown. Albert\nimmediately recognized his friend Petrof.\n\n"How strange! what is he doing here?" said Albert to himself.\n\n"No, brethren," said Petrof, pointing to something, "you did not appreciate\nthe man while he was living among you; you did not appreciate him! He was\nnot a cheap artist, not a merely mechanical performer, not a crazy, ruined\nman. He was a genius, a great musical genius, who perished among you\nunknown and unvalued."\n\nAlbert immediately understood of whom his friend was speaking; but not\nwishing to interrupt him, he hung his head modestly. "He, like a sheaf of\nstraw, was wholly consumed by the sacred fire which we all serve,"\ncontinued the voice. "But he has completely fulfilled all that God gave\nhim; therefore he ought to be considered a great man. You may despise him,\ntorture him, humiliate him," continued the voice, more and more\nenergetically, "but he has been, is, and will be immeasurably higher than\nyou all. He is happy, he is good. He loved you all alike, or cared for you,\nit is all the same; but he has served only that with which he was so highly\nendowed. He loved one thing,--beauty, the only infinite good in the world.\nOh, yes, what a man he is! Fall all of you before him. On your knees!"\ncried Petrof in a thundering voice.\n\nBut another voice mildly answered from another corner of the hall. "I do\nnot wish to bow my knee before him," said the voice.\n\nAlbert instantly recognized Delesof.\n\n"Why is he great? And why should we bow before him? Has he conducted\nhimself in an honorable and righteous manner? Has he brought society any\nadvantage? Do we not know how he borrowed money, and never returned it;\nhow he carried off a violin that belonged to a brother artist, and pawned\nit?"\n\n"My God! how did he know all that?" said Albert to himself, drooping his\nhead still lower.\n\n"Do we not know," the voice went on, "how he pandered to the lowest of the\nlow, pandered to them for money? Do we not know how he was driven out of\nthe theatre? How Anna Ivanovna threatened to hand him over to the police?"\n\n"My God! that is all true, but protect me," cried Albert. "You are the only\none who knows why I did so."\n\n"Stop, for shame!" cried Petrof\'s voice again. "What right have you to\naccuse him? Have you lived his life? Have you experienced his enthusiasms?"\n\n"Right! right!" whispered Albert.\n\n"Art is the highest manifestation of power in man. It is given only to the\nfavored few, and it lifts the chosen to such an eminence that the head\nswims, and it is hard to preserve its integrity. In art, as in every\nstruggle, there are heroes who bring all under subjection to them, and\nperish if they do not attain their ends."\n\nPetrof ceased speaking; and Albert lifted his head, and tried to shout in a\nloud voice, "Right! right!" but his voice died without a sound.\n\n"That is not the case with you. This does not concern you," sternly said\nthe artist Petrof, addressing Delesof. "Yes, humble him, despise him," he\ncontinued, "for he is better and happier than all the rest of you."\n\nAlbert, with rapture in his heart at hearing these words, could not contain\nhimself, but went up to his friend, and was about to kiss him.\n\n"Get thee gone, I do not know you," replied Petrof. "Go your own way, you\ncannot come here."\n\n"Here, you drunken fellow, you cannot come here," cried a policeman at the\ncrossing.\n\nAlbert hesitated, then collected all his forces, and, endeavoring not to\nstumble, crossed over to the next street.\n\nIt was only a few steps to Anna Ivanovna\'s. From the hall of her house a\nstream of light fell on the snowy _dvor_, and at the gate stood sledges and\ncarriages.\n\nClinging with both hands to the balustrade, he made his way up the steps,\nand rang the bell.\n\nThe maid\'s sleepy face appeared at the open door, and looked angrily at\nAlbert.\n\n"It is impossible," she cried; "I have been forbidden to let you in," and\nshe slammed the door. The sounds of music and women\'s voices floated down\nto him.\n\nAlbert sat down on the ground, and leaned his head against the wall, and\nshut his eyes. At that very instant a throng of indistinct but correlated\nvisions took possession of him with fresh force, mastered him, and carried\nhim off into the beautiful and free domain of fancy.\n\n"Yes! he is better and happier," involuntarily the voice repeated in his\nimagination.\n\nFrom the door were heard the sounds of a polka. These sounds also told him\nthat he was better and happier. In a neighboring church was heard the sound\nof a prayer-bell; and the prayer-bell also told him that he was better and\nhappier.\n\n"Now I will go back to that hall again," said Albert to himself. "Petrof\nmust have many things still to tell me."\n\nThere seemed to be no one now in the hall; and in the place of the artist\nPetrof, Albert himself stood on the platform, and was playing on his violin\nall that the voice had said before.\n\nBut his violin was of strange make: it was composed of nothing but glass,\nand he had to hold it with both hands, and slowly rub it on his breast to\nmake it give out sounds. The sounds were so sweet and delicious, that\nAlbert felt he had never before heard any thing like them. The more tightly\nhe pressed the violin to his breast, the more sweet and consoling they\nbecame. The louder the sounds, the more swiftly the shadows vanished, and\nthe more brilliantly the walls of the hall were illuminated. But it was\nnecessary to play very cautiously on the violin, lest it should break.\n\nAlbert played on the instrument of glass cautiously and well. He played\nthings the like of which he felt no one would ever hear again.\n\nHe was growing tired, when a heavy distant sound began to annoy him. It was\nthe sound of a bell, but this sound seemed to have a language.\n\n"Yes," said the bell, with its notes coming from somewhere far off and high\nup, "yes, he seems to you wretched; you despise him, but he is better and\nhappier than you. No one ever will play more on that instrument!"\n\nThese words which he understood seemed suddenly so wise, so novel, and so\ntrue, to Albert, that he stopped playing, and, while trying not to move,\nlifted his eyes and his arms toward heaven. He felt that he was beautiful\nand happy. Although no one was in the hall, Albert expanded his chest, and\nproudly lifted his head, and stood on the platform so that all might see\nhim.\n\nSuddenly some one\'s hand was gently laid on his shoulder; he turned around,\nand in the half light saw a woman. She looked pityingly at him, and shook\nher head. He immediately became conscious that what he was doing was wrong,\nand a sense of shame came over him.\n\n"Where shall I go?" he asked her. Once more she gazed long and fixedly at\nhim, and bent her head pityingly. She was the one, the very one whom he\nloved, and her dress was the same; on her round white neck was the pearl\nnecklace, and her lovely arms were bare above the elbows.\n\nShe took him in her arms, and bore him away through the hall. At the\nentrance of the hall, Albert saw the moon and water. But the water was not\nbelow as is usually the case, and the moon was not above; there was a white\ncircle in one place as sometimes happens. The moon and the water were\ntogether,--everywhere, above and below, and on all sides and around them\nboth. Albert and his love darted off toward the moon and the water, and he\nnow realized that she whom he loved more than all in the world was in his\narms: he embraced her, and felt inexpressible felicity.\n\n"Is not this a dream?" he asked himself. But no, it was the reality, it was\nmore than reality: it was reality and recollection combined.\n\nThen he felt that the indescribable pleasure which he had felt during the\nlast moment was gone, and would never be renewed.\n\n"Why am I weeping?" he asked of her. She looked at him in silence, with\npitying eyes. Albert understood what she desired to say in reply. "Just as\nwhen I was alive," he went on to say. She, without replying, looked\nstraight forward.\n\n"This is terrible! How can I explain to her that I _am_ alive?" he asked\nhimself in horror. "My God, I am alive! Do understand me," he whispered.\n\n"He is better and happier," said a voice.\n\nBut something kept oppressing Albert ever more powerfully. Whether it was\nthe moon or the water, or her embrace or his tears, he could not tell, but\nhe was conscious that he could not say all that it was his duty to say, and\nthat all would be quickly over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo guests coming out from Anna Ivanovna\'s rooms stumbled against Albert\nlying on the threshold. One of them went back to Anna Ivanovna, and called\nher. "That was heartless," he said. "You might let a man freeze to death\nthat way."\n\n"_Akh!_ why, that is my Albert. See where he was lying!" exclaimed the\nhostess. "Annushka, have him brought into the room; find a place for him\nsomewhere," she added, addressing the maid.\n\n"Oh! I am alive, why do you bury me?" muttered Albert, as they brought him\nunconscious into the room.\n\n\n\n\nTWO HUSSARS.\n\n_A TALE._\n\n1856.\n\n        Jomini, ay, Jomini,\n    But not a single word of vodka.[56]\n\nD. DAVUIDOF.\n\n\nAt the very beginning of this century, when there were no railways, no\nmacadamized roads, no gas or stearine candles, no low and springy sofas, no\nunvarnished furniture, no disillusionized young men with eye-glasses, no\nwomen philosophers of liberal tendencies, no dear Camilles, such as our\ntime has produced in abundance; in those naive days when travellers made\nthe journey from Moscow to Petersburg by stage or carriage, and took with\nthem a whole kitchen of domestic preparations, and travelled for a week,\nnight and day, over soft roads, muddy or dusty as the case might be, pinned\ntheir faith to Pozharsky cutlets, Valdai bluebells, and pretzels; when\nduring the long autumn evenings tallow candles burned till they had to be\nsnuffed, and cast their rays on family circles of twenty or thirty people\n(at balls, wax or spermaceti candles were set up in candelabra); when\nfurniture was placed with stiff precision; when our fathers were still\nyoung, not merely by the absence of wrinkles and gray hair, but fought\nduels for women, and were fain to rush from one end of a room to the other\nto pick up a handkerchief dropped accidentally or otherwise, and our\nmothers wore short waists and huge sleeves, and decided family affairs by\nthe drawing of lots; when charming Camilles avoided the light of day; in\nthe naive period of Masonic lodges, of Martinists, and of the _Tugendbund_;\nat the time of the Miloradovitches, Davuidofs, and Pushkins,--a meeting of\nlanded proprietors took place in the governmental city of K., and the\nelection of the college of nobles was drawing to a close.\n\n[Footnote 56: From the poem entitled, "The Song of an Old Hussar," in which\na veteran contrasts the mighty days of the past with the dilettanti\npresent. Denis Vasilyevitch Davuidof, who was an officer of hussars, died\nin 1839.--TR.]\n\n\nI.\n\n"Well, all right, it\'s all the same, be it in the hall," said a young\nofficer dressed in a shuba, and wearing a hussar\'s helmet, as he dismounted\nfrom a travelling sledge in front of the best hotel of the city of K.\n\n"A great meeting, little father, your excellency,--a tremendous crowd,"\nsaid the hall-boy, who had already learned from the officer\'s man that it\nwas Count Turbin, and therefore honored him with the address of "your\nexcellency." "Madame Afrimova and her daughters have expressed the\nintention of going away this evening; you can be accommodated with their\nroom as soon as it is vacated,--No. 11," the hall-boy went on to say,\nnoiselessly showing the count the way, and constantly turning round to look\nat him.\n\nIn the sitting-room, at a small table under a blackened full-length\nportrait of the Emperor Alexander, sat a number of men, evidently belonging\nto the local aristocracy, drinking champagne; and on one side were some\ntravelling merchants in blue shubas.\n\nThe count entered the room, and calling Bluecher, a huge gray boarhound that\naccompanied him, he threw off his cloak, the collar of which was covered\nwith frost, and, after ordering vodka, sat down at the table in a short\nblue-satin jacket, and entered into conversation with the gentlemen sitting\nthere. The latter, attracted toward the new-comer by his handsome and frank\nexterior, offered him a glass of champagne.\n\nThe count had begun to drink his glass of vodka; but now he also ordered a\nbottle of champagne, in order to return the courtesy of his new companions.\n\nThe driver came in to ask for vodka-money.\n\n"Sashka,"[57] cried the count, "give it to him."\n\n[Footnote 57: Diminished diminutive of Aleksandr.]\n\nThe driver went out with Sashka, but quickly returned, holding the money in\nhis hands.\n\n"What! little father, \'slency, is that right? I did my best for you. You\npromised me a half-ruble, and you have only given me a quarter!"\n\n"Sashka, give him a ruble."\n\nSashka, hanging down his head, gazed at the driver\'s feet.\n\n"He will have enough," said he in his deep voice. "Besides, I haven\'t any\nmore money."\n\nThe count drew from his pocket-book the two solitary blue notes[58] which\nwere in it, and gave one to the driver, who kissed his hand, and went off.\n"I have come to the end," said the count, "my last five rubles."\n\n[Footnote 58: Blue notes were five rubles.]\n\n"True hussar style, count," said one of the nobles, whose mustaches, voice,\nand a certain energetic freedom in the use of his legs, proclaimed him,\nbeyond a peradventure, to be a retired cavalryman. "Are you going to spend\nsome time here, count?"\n\n"I must have some money if I stay, otherwise I should not be very likely\nto. Besides, there are no spare rooms, the Devil take it, in this cursed\ntavern."\n\n"I beg of you, count," pursued the cavalryman, "wouldn\'t you like to come\nin with me? My room is No. 7. If you wouldn\'t object to sleep there for the\npresent. We shall be here three days at least. To-day I was at the\nmarshal\'s: how glad he would be to see you!"\n\n"That\'s right, count, stay with us," urged another of the table companions,\na handsome young man. "What is your hurry? And besides, this happens only\nonce in three years,--these elections. We might get a glimpse of some of\nour girls, count!"\n\n"Sashka, get me some clean linen. I am going to have a bath," said the\ncount, rising. "And then we will see; perhaps I may decide to pay my\nrespects to the marshal."\n\nThen he called the waiter, and said something to him in an undertone. The\nwaiter replied, with a laugh, "That is within human possibility," and went\nout.\n\n"Well, then, little father, I have given orders to have my trunk taken to\nyour room," cried the count, as he went out of the door.\n\n"I shall consider it a favor: it delights me," replied the cavalryman as he\nhastened to the door, and cried, "No.7; don\'t forget!"\n\nWhen the count was out of hearing, the cavalryman returned to his place,\nand drawing his chair nearer to the _chinovnik_, and looking him straight\nin his smiling eyes, said,--\n\n"Well, he\'s the very one."\n\n"What one?"\n\n"I tell you that he\'s that very same hussar duellist,--let me see, the\nfamous Turbin. He knew me. I\'ll wager he knew me. I assure you, at Lebedyan\nhe and I were on a spree for three weeks, and were never sober once. That\nwas when I lost my remount. There was one little affair at that time,--we\nwere engaged in it together. Ah, he is a gay lad! isn\'t he, though?"\n\n"Indeed he is. What pleasant manners he has! There\'s no fault to be found\nwith him," replied the handsome young man. "How quickly we became\nacquainted!... He isn\'t more than twenty-two, is he?"\n\n"He certainly would not seem so, would he?... But he\'s really more than\nthat. Well, now you want to know who he is, don\'t you? Who carried off\nMegunova? He did. He killed Sablin. He kicked Matnyef out of the window. He\n\'did\' Prince Nesterof out of three hundred thousand rubles. He\'s a regular\nmadcap. You ought to know him,--a gambler, duellist, seducer, but a\nwhole-souled fellow, a genuine hussar. We got talked about a good deal, but\nif any one really understood what it meant to be a genuine hussar! Those\nwere great times."\n\nAnd the cavalryman began to tell his comrade of a drinking-bout with the\ncount, which had never taken place, nor could have taken place. It could\nnot have taken place, first, because he had never seen the count before,\nand had retired from the service two years before the count had entered it;\nand secondly, because this cavalryman had never served in the cavalry, but\nhad served four years as a very insignificant yunker in the Bielevsky\nregiment; and just as soon as he was promoted to be ensign, he retired.\n\nBut ten years before he had received an inheritance, and actually went to\nLebedyan; and there he spent seven hundred rubles with the cavalry\nofficers, and had had made for him an uhlan\'s uniform with orange lapels,\nwith the intention of entering the uhlans. His thought of entering the\ncavalry, and his three weeks spent with the officers at Lebedyan, made the\nvery happiest and most brilliant period of his life; so that he began to\ntransfer his thought into a reality. Then, as he added remembrance to it,\nhe began actually to believe in his military past,--which did not prevent\nhim from being a worthy man through his kindness of heart and uprightness.\n\n"Yes, any one who has never served in the cavalry," he went on to say,\n"will never understand us fellows."\n\nHe sat astride of his chair, and, thrusting out his lower lip, went on in a\ndeep voice, "It happens you are riding along in front of the battalion. A\ndevil is under you, not a horse, prancing along; thus you sit on this\nperfect devil. The battalion commander comes along. \'Lieutenant,\' says he,\n\'I beg of you--your service is absolutely indispensable. You must lead the\nbattalion for the parade.\' Very well, and so it goes. You look around, you\ngive a shout, you lead the brave fellows who are under your command. Ah!\nthe deuce take it! \'twas a glorious time!"\n\nThe count came back from the bath, all ruddy, and with his hair wet, and\nwent directly to No. 7, where the cavalryman was already sitting in his\ndressing-gown, with his pipe, and thinking with delight and some little\nanxiety of the good fortune that had befallen him in sharing his room with\nthe famous Turbin. "Well, now," the thought came into his head, "suppose he\nshould take me, and strip me naked, and carry me outside the town limits,\nand set me down in the snow, ... or smear me with tar ... or simply ...\nBut, no: he would not do such a thing to a comrade," he said, trying to\ncomfort himself.\n\n"Sashka, give Bluecher something to eat," cried the count.\n\nSashka made his appearance. He had been drinking glasses of vodka ever\nsince his arrival, and was beginning to be genuinely tipsy.\n\n"You have not been able to control yourself. You have been getting drunk,\n_canaillya_!... Feed Bluecher."\n\n"It won\'t kill him to fast.... You see, ... he\'s so plump," replied Sashka,\ncaressing the dog.\n\n"Now, none of your impudence. Go, and feed him."\n\n"All you care for is to have your dog fat; but if a man drinks a little\nglass, then you pitch into him."\n\n"Hey! I\'ll strike you," cried the count with a voice that made the\nwindow-panes rattle, and even scared the cavalryman somewhat.\n\n"You would better ask if _Sashka_ has had any thing to eat to-day. All\nright, strike away, if a dog is more to you than a man," continued Sashka.\n\nBut at that instant he received such a violent blow of the fist across the\nface that he staggered, struck his head against the partition, and,\nclutching his nose, leaped through the door, and threw himself down on a\nbench in the corridor.\n\n"He has broken my teeth," he growled, wiping his bloody nose with one hand,\nand with the other scratching Bluecher\'s back, as the dog licked him. "He\nhas broken my teeth, Bluechka; and yet he is my count, and I would jump into\nthe fire for him, that\'s a fact. Because he\'s my count, do you understand,\nBluechka? And do you want something to eat?"\n\nAfter lying there a while, he got up, gave the dog his dinner, and, almost\nsobered, went to serve his master, and get him his tea.\n\n"You would simply offend me," said the cavalryman timidly, standing in\nfront of the count, who was lying on the bed with his feet propped against\nthe partition. "Now, you see, I am an old soldier and comrade, I may say;\ninstead of letting you borrow of any one else, it would give me great\npleasure to let you have two hundred rubles. I haven\'t them with me\nnow,--only a hundred,--but I can get the rest to-day; don\'t refuse, you\nwould simply offend me, count!"\n\n"Thanks, little father," said Turbin, instantly perceiving what sort of\nrelationship would exist between them, and slapping the cavalryman on the\nshoulder. "Thanks. Well, then, we\'ll go to the ball if you say so. But now\nwhat shall we do? Tell me whom you have in your city: any pretty girls?\nanybody ready for a spree? Who plays cards?"\n\nThe cavalryman explained that there would be a crowd of pretty girls at the\nball; that the police commissioner,[59] Kolkof, who had just been\nre-elected, was the greatest hand for sprees, only he lacked the spirit of\na genuine hussar, but still was a first-rate fellow; that Ilyushka\'s chorus\nof gypsies had been singing at K. ever since the elections began; that\nStioshka[60] was the soloist, and that after the marshal\'s reception\neverybody went there nowadays. And the stakes were pretty high. "Lukhnof, a\nvisitor here," he said, "is sweeping in the money; and Ilyin, a cornet of\nuhlans, who rooms in No. 8, has already lost a pile. The game has already\nbegun there. They play there every evening; and he\'s a wonderfully fine\nyoung fellow, I tell you, count, this Ilyin is. There\'s nothing mean about\nhim--he\'d give you his last shirt."\n\n[Footnote 59: ispravnik.]\n\n[Footnote 60: Diminutive of Stepanida, Stephanie.]\n\n"Then let us go to his room. We will see what sort of men you have," said\nthe count.\n\n"Come on! come on! they will be mighty glad."\n\n\nII.\n\nIlyin, the cornet of uhlans, had not long been awake. The evening before,\nhe had sat down at the gambling-table at eight o\'clock, and lost for\nfifteen consecutive hours, till eleven o\'clock that day. He had lost a\ngreat amount, but exactly how much he did not know, because he had had\nthree thousand rubles of his money, and fifteen thousand belonging to the\ntreasury, which he had long ago mixed up with his own, and he did not dare\nto settle his accounts lest his anticipations that he had made too great\ninroads on the public money should be confirmed.\n\nHe went to sleep about noon, and slept that heavy, dreamless sleep,\npeculiar to very young men who have been losing heavily. Waking at six,\nabout the time that Count Turbin had arrived at the hotel, and seeing cards\nand chalk and soiled tables scattered around him in confusion in the room,\nhe remembered with horror the evening\'s games, and the last card, a knave,\nwhich had lost him five hundred rubles; but, still scarcely believing in\nthe reality, he drew out from under his pillow his money, and began to\ncount it. He recognized a few notes which, with corners turned down and\nindorsements, had gone from hand to hand around the table; he remembered\nall the particulars. He had lost his own three thousand rubles, and\ntwenty-five hundred belonging to the treasury had disappeared.\n\nThe uhlan had been playing for four nights in succession.\n\nHe had come from Moscow, where the public money had been intrusted to him.\nAt K. the post-superintendent had detained him under the pretext that there\nwere no post-horses, but in reality in accordance with his agreement with\nthe hotel-keeper to detain all visitors for a day.\n\nThe uhlan, who was a gay young fellow, and had just received from his\nparent three thousand rubles for his military equipment, was glad to spend\na few days in the city of K. during the elections, and counted on having a\ngood time.\n\nHe knew a landed proprietor whose family lived there, and he was preparing\nto call upon him and pay his addresses to his daughter, when the cavalryman\nappeared, and made his acquaintance. That very evening, without malice\nprepense, he took him down into the parlor, and introduced him to his\nfriends, Lukhnof and several other gamblers. From that time, the uhlan had\nkept steadily at gaming, and not only had not called on the proprietor, but\nhad not thought of inquiring further for horses, and for four days had not\nleft his room.\n\nAfter he had dressed, and taken his tea, he went to the window. He felt an\ninclination to go out so as to dispel the importunate recollections of the\ngame. He put on his cloak, and went into the street.\n\nThe sun had just sunk behind the white houses with their red roofs. It was\nalready twilight. It was warm. The snow was softly falling in big, damp\nflakes, in the muddy streets. His mind suddenly became filled with\nunendurable melancholy at the thought that he had spent all that day in\nsleep, and now the day was done.\n\n"This day which has gone, will never come back again," he said to himself.\n\n"I have wasted my youth," he suddenly exclaimed, not because he really felt\nthat he had wasted his youth,--he did not think about it at all,--but\nsimply this phrase came into his head.\n\n"What shall I do now?" he reasoned; "borrow of some one, and go away?"\n\nA lady was passing along the sidewalk.\n\n"What a stupid woman!" he said to himself for some reason.\n\n"There\'s no one I can borrow of. I have wasted my youth."\n\nHe came to a block of stores. A merchant in a fox-skin shuba was standing\nat the door of his shop, and inviting custom.\n\n"If I hadn\'t taken the eight, I should have won."\n\nA little old beggar-woman followed him, snivelling.\n\n"I have no one to borrow of."\n\nA gentleman in a bear-skin shuba passed him. A policeman was standing on\nthe corner.\n\n"What can I do that will make sensation? Fire a pistol at them? No! That\nwould be stupid. I have wasted my youth. _Akh!_ what a splendid harness\nthat is hanging in that shop! I should like to be riding behind a\ntroika!... _Ekh!_ you fine fellows![61] I am going back. Lukhnof will be\nthere pretty soon, and we\'ll have a game."\n\n[Footnote 61: _golubchiki_, little pigeons.]\n\nHe returned to the hotel, and once more counted his money. No, he was not\nmistaken the first time; twenty-five hundred rubles of public money were\nmissing, just as before.\n\n"I will put up twenty-five rubles first; the next time, a quarter stake;\nthen on seven, on fifteen, on thirty, and on sixty ... three thousand. I\nwill buy that harness, and start. He won\'t give me any odds, the villain!\nI have wasted my youth!"\n\nThis was what was passing through the uhlan\'s mind just as Lukhnof himself\ncame into the room.\n\n"Well, have you been up long, Mikhailo Vasilyitch?" inquired Lukhnof,\ndeliberately removing from his thin nose his gold eye-glasses, and\ncarefully wiping them with a red silk handkerchief.\n\n"No, only just this minute. I had a splendid sleep!"\n\n"A new hussar has just come. He is staying with Zavalshevsky. Had you heard\nabout it?"\n\n"No, I hadn\'t. Well, no one seems to be here yet. I believe they have gone\nto call on Priakhin. They\'ll be here very soon."\n\nIn fact, in a short time there came into the room an officer of the\ngarrison, who was always hovering round Lukhnof; a Greek merchant with a\nhuge hooked nose, cinnamon complexion, and deep-set black eyes; a stout,\npuffy proprietor, a brandy-distiller who gambled all night long, and always\nmade his stakes on the basis of half a ruble. All of these wished to begin\nplaying as promptly as possible, but the more daring players said nothing\nabout it; Lukhnof, in particular, with perfect equanimity, told stories of\nrascality in Moscow.\n\n"Just think of it," said he, "Moscow, the metropolis, the capital; and\nthere they go out at night with crooks, dressed like demons; and they scare\nthe stupid people, and rob pedestrians, and that is the end of it. Do the\npolice notice it? No! It is astonishing!"\n\nThe uhlan listened attentively to the tales of these highwaymen, but\nfinally got up and unobtrusively ordered cards to be brought. The stout\nproprietor was the first to notice it.\n\n"Well, gentlemen, we are wasting golden moments. To work, let us to work!"\n\n"Yes, you won by the half-ruble last evening, and so you like it,"\nexclaimed the Greek.\n\n"It\'s a good time to begin," said the garrison officer.\n\nIlyin looked at Lukhnof. Lukhnof, returning his gaze, went on calmly with\nhis story of the robbers who dressed themselves up like devils. "Will you\nstart the bank?" asked the uhlan.\n\n"Isn\'t it rather early?"\n\n"Byelof!" cried the uhlan, reddening for some reason or other; "bring me\nsomething to eat.... I haven\'t had any dinner to-day, gentlemen. Bring some\nchampagne, and distribute the cards."\n\nA this moment, the count and Zavalshevsky entered. It proved that Turbin\nand Ilyin were in the same division. They immediately struck up an\nacquaintance, drank a glass of champagne, clinking their glasses together,\nand in five minutes were calling each other "thou."\n\nIt was evident that Ilyin made a very pleasant impression on the count. The\ncount smiled whenever he looked at him, and was amused at his freshness.\n\n"What a fine young uhlan!" he said, "what a mustache! what a splendid\nmustache!"\n\nIlyin\'s upper lip bore the first down of a mustache, that was as yet almost\nwhite.\n\n"You were preparing to play, were you not?" asked the count. "Well, I\nshould like to win from you, Ilyin. I think that you must be a master," he\nadded smiling.\n\n"Yes, we were just starting in," replied Lukhnof, opening a pack of\ncards.... "Aren\'t you going to join us, count?"\n\n"No, I won\'t to-night. If I did there wouldn\'t be any thing left of any of\nyou! When I take a hand I always break the bank. But I haven\'t any money\njust now. I lost at Volotchok, at the station-house. It was by some sort of\ninfantry-man who wore rings; what a cheat he was! and he cleaned me out\ncompletely."\n\n"Were you long there at the station?" asked Ilyin.\n\n"I staid there twenty-two hours. I shall not forget that station, curse it!\nand the superintendent won\'t forget it either."\n\n"Why?"\n\n"I got there, you see; the superintendent comes out, rascally face, the\nliar! \'There are no horses,\' said he. Well, now I must tell you, I have\nmade a rule in such cases: when there are no horses, I keep on my shuba,\nand go straight to the superintendent\'s room,--not the waiting-room, mind\nyou, but the superintendent\'s own room,--and I have all the windows and\ndoors opened, as though it were stifling. Well, that\'s what I did here.\nCold! you remember how cold it has been this last month; twenty degrees\nbelow. The superintendent began to remonstrate. I knock his teeth in for\nhim. There was some old woman there; and some young girls and\npeasant-women[62] set up a piping, were going to seize their pots and fly\nto the village.... I go to the door, and say, \'Let me have horses, and I\'ll\ngo away: if you don\'t, I won\'t let you out, I\'ll freeze you all to death.\'"\n\n[Footnote 62: _babas._]\n\n"What an admirable way!" said the puffy proprietor, bursting out into a\nlaugh. "That\'s the way one would freeze out cockroaches."\n\n"But I wasn\'t sufficiently on my guard: the superintendent and all his\nwomen managed to get out and run away. Only the old woman remained on the\noven as my hostage. She kept sniffing, and offering prayers to God. Then we\nentered into negotiations. The superintendent came back, and, standing at a\ndistance, tried to persuade me to let the old woman go. But I set Bluecher\non him: Bluecher is a magnificent dog to take care of superintendents. Even\nthen the rascal did not let me have horses till the next morning. And then\ncame along that footpad! I went into the next room, and began to play. Have\nyou seen Bluecher?--Bluecher! _Fiu_!" Bluecher came running in. The players\nreceived him with flattering attention, although it was evident that they\nwere anxious to get to work at entirely different matters.\n\n"By the way, gentlemen, why don\'t you begin your game? I beg of you, don\'t\nlet me interfere with you. You see I am a chatterbox," said Turbin.\n"_Whether you love or not_, \'tis an excellent thing."\n\n\nIII.\n\nLukhnof took two candles, brought out a huge dark-colored pocket-book full\nof money; slowly, as though performing some sacrament, opened it on the\ntable; took out two one-hundred-ruble notes, and laid them on the cards.\n\n"There, just the same as last evening; the bank begins with two hundred,"\nsaid he, adjusting his glasses, and opening a pack of cards.\n\n"Very well," said Ilyin, not glancing at him, or interrupting his\nconversation with Turbin.\n\nThe game began. Lukhnof kept the bank with mechanical regularity,\noccasionally pausing, and deliberately making notes, or looking sternly\nover his glasses, and saying in a weak voice, "Throw."\n\nThe stout proprietor talked louder than the rest, making various\ncalculations at the top of his voice, while he wet his clumsy fingers and\ndog-eared his cards.\n\nThe garrison officer silently wrote in a fine hand his account on a card,\nturned down small corners, pressing them against the table.\n\nThe Greek sat next the banker, attentively following the game with his deep\nblack eyes, as though waiting for something.\n\nZavalshevsky, as he stood by the table, would suddenly become all of a\ntremble, draw from his trousers-pocket a blue note or a red,[63] lay a card\non it, pound on it with his palm, and say, "Bring me luck, little seven!"\nthen he would bite his mustache, change from one leg to the other, and be\nin a continual state of excitement until the card came out.\n\n[Footnote 63: Five or ten rubles.]\n\nIlyin, who had been eating veal and cucumbers placed near him on the\nhaircloth sofa, briskly wiped his hands on his coat, and began to put down\none card after another.\n\nTurbin, who had taken his seat at first on the sofa, immediately noticed\nthat something was wrong. Lukhnof did not look at the uhlan, or say any\nthing to him; but occasionally his eyes for an instant rested on the\nuhlan\'s hands. The most of his cards lost.\n\n"If I could only trump that little card," exclaimed Lukhnof in reference to\none of the stout proprietor\'s cards. He was still making half-ruble wagers.\n\n"Trump Ilyin\'s instead: what would be the use of trumping mine?" replied\nthe proprietor.\n\nAnd, in point of fact, Ilyin\'s cards were trumped oftener than the others\'.\nHe nervously tore up his losing card under the table, and with trembling\nhands chose another.\n\nTurbin arose from the sofa, and asked the Greek to give him his place next\nthe banker. The Greek changed places; and the count, taking his chair, and\nnot moving his eyes, began to watch Lukhnof\'s hands attentively.\n\n"Ilyin," said he suddenly in his ordinary voice, which, entirely contrary\nto his desire, drowned out the others, "why do you stick to those routine\ncards? You don\'t know how to play!"\n\n"Supposing I don\'t, it\'s all the same."\n\n"You\'ll lose that way surely. Let me play against the bank for you."\n\n"No, excuse me, I beg of you. I\'m always this way. Play for yourself if you\nlike."\n\n"I have told you that I am not going to play. But I should like to play for\nyou. I hate to see you losing so."\n\n"Ah, well! you see it\'s my luck."\n\nThe count said nothing more, and leaning on his elbow began once more to\nwatch the banker\'s hand just as attentively as before.\n\n"Shameful!" he suddenly cried in a loud voice, dwelling on the word.\n\nLukhnof glared at him.\n\n"Shameful, shameful!" he repeated still louder, staring straight into\nLukhnof\'s eyes.\n\nThe game continued.\n\n"That is not right!" said Turbin again, as Lukhnof trumped one of Ilyin\'s\nhigh cards.\n\n"What displeases you, count?" politely asked the banker with an air of\nindifference.\n\n"Because you give Ilyin a simplum, and turn down your corners. That\'s what\nis shameful!"\n\nLukhnof made a slight motion with his shoulders and brows, signifying that\nhe was resigned to any fate, and then he went on with the game.\n\n"Bluecher, _fiu_!" cried the count, rising; "over with him!" he added\nquickly. Bluecher, bumping against the sofa with his back, and almost\nknocking the garrison officer from his feet, came leaping toward his\nmaster, looking at every one and wagging his tail as though he would ask,\n"Who is misbehaving here, hey?"\n\nLukhnof laid down the cards, and moved his chair away. "This is no way to\nplay," said he. "I detest dogs. What kind of a game can you have if a whole\npack of hounds is to be brought in?"\n\n"Especially that kind of dog: they are called blood-suckers, if I am not\nmistaken," suggested the garrison officer.\n\n"Well, are we to play or not, Mikhailo Vasilyitch?" asked Lukhnof,\naddressing the uhlan.\n\n"Don\'t bother us, count, I beg of you," said Ilyin, turning to Turbin.\n\n"Come here for a moment," said Turbin, taking Ilyin\'s arm, and drawing him\ninto the next room.\n\nThere the count\'s words were perfectly audible, though he spoke in his\nordinary tone. But his voice was so powerful that it could always be heard\nthree rooms off.\n\n"Are you beside yourself? Don\'t you see that that man with the glasses is a\ncheat of the worst order?"\n\n"Hey? Nonsense! Be careful what you say."\n\n"No nonsense! but quit it, I tell you. It makes no difference to me.\nAnother time I myself would have plucked you; but now I am sorry to see you\nruining yourself. Have you any public money left?"\n\n"No. What makes you think so about him?"\n\n"Brother, I have been over this same road, and I know the ways of these\nprofessional gamblers. I tell you that the man in the glasses is a cheat.\nQuit, please. I ask you as a comrade."\n\n"All right; I\'ll have just one more hand, and then have done with it."\n\n"I know what that \'one more\' means: very well, we will see."\n\nThey returned to the gaming-table. In one deal he laid down so many cards,\nand they were trumped so badly, that he lost a large amount.\n\nTurbin rested his hand in the middle of the table, and said, "That\'s\nenough! now let us be going."\n\n"No, I can\'t go yet; leave me, please," said Ilyin in vexation, shuffling\nthe bent cards and not looking at Turbin.\n\n"All right! the Devil be with you! Lose all you\'ve got, if that please you;\nbut it\'s time for me to be going.--Come, Zavalshevsky, let us go to the\nmarshal\'s."\n\nAnd they went out. No one spoke, and Lukhnof did not make the bank until\nthe noise of their feet and of Bluecher\'s paws had died away down the\ncorridor.\n\n"That\'s a madcap," said the proprietor, smiling.\n\n"Well, now he won\'t bother us any more," said the garrison officer in a\nhurried whisper.\n\nAnd the game went on.\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe band, composed of the marshal\'s domestic serfs, were stationed in the\nbutler\'s pantry, which had been put in order on account of the ball, and,\nhaving turned up the sleeves of their coats, had begun at the signal of\ntheir leader to play the ancient polonaise "Aleksandr, Yelisavieta;" and\nunder the soft, brilliant light of the wax candles, the couples began to\nmove in tripping measure through the great ballroom; a governor-general of\nCatherine\'s time, with a star, taking out the gaunt wife of the marshal,\nthe marshal with the governor\'s wife, and so on through all the hierarchy\nof the government in various combinations and variations,--when\nZavalshevsky in a blue coat with a huge collar, and epaulets on his\nshoulders, and wearing stockings and pumps, and exhaling about him an odor\nof jasmine with which he had plentifully drenched his mustaches, the\nfacings of his coat, and his handkerchief, entered with the handsome count,\nwho wore tight-fitting blue trousers and a red pelisse embroidered with\ngold, and wearing on his breast the cross of Vladimir and a medal of 1812.\n\nThe count was of medium height, but had an extremely handsome figure. His\nclear blue eyes of remarkable brilliancy, and dark hair which was rather\nlong and fell in thick ringlets, gave his beauty a peculiar character.\n\nThe count\'s presence at the ball was not unexpected. The handsome young\nman who had seen him at the hotel had already spoken of him to the marshal.\n\nThe impressions made by this announcement were of various kinds, but on the\nwhole were not altogether pleasant.\n\n"I suppose this young man will turn us into ridicule," was what the old\nwomen and the men said to themselves.\n\n"Suppose he should run off with me," was what the wives and young ladies\nthought, with more or less apprehension.\n\nAs soon as the polonaise was finished, and the couples had made each other\nlow bows, once more the women formed little groups by themselves, and the\nmen by themselves. Zavalshevsky, proud and happy, led the count up to the\nhostess.\n\nThe marshal\'s wife, conscious of a certain inward trepidation lest this\nhussar should make her the cause of some scandal before everybody, said\nproudly and scornfully, as she turned away, "Very glad to see you. I hope\nthat you will dance." And then she looked at the count mistrustfully with\nan expression that seemed to say, "Now, if you insult any woman, then you\nare a perfect scoundrel after this."\n\nThe count, however, quickly overcame this prejudice by his amiability, his\npoliteness, and his handsome jovial appearance; so that in five minutes the\nexpression on the face of the marshal\'s wife plainly declared to all who\nstood around her, "I know how to manage all these men. He immediately\nrealized whom he was talking with. And now he will be charming to me all\nthe rest of the evening."\n\nMoreover, just then the governor, who had known his father, came up to the\ncount, and very graciously drew him to one side, and entered into\nconversation with him, which still more pleased the fashionable society of\nthe town, and raised the count in their estimation.\n\nThen Zavalshevsky presented the count to his sister, a plump young widow,\nwho, ever since the count entered the room, had kept her big black eyes\nfastened upon him.\n\nThe count asked the little widow for the waltz which at that moment the\nmusicians had struck up, and it was his artistic dancing that conquered the\nlast vestiges of the popular prejudice.\n\n"Ah, he\'s a master at dancing!" said a stout lady, following the legs in\nblue trousers which were flashing through the ballroom, and mentally\ncounting, "One, two, three; one, two, three,--he\'s a master."\n\n"How gracefully he moves his feet! how gracefully!" said another guest, who\ndid not stand very high in the governmental society. "How does he manage to\nnot hit any one with his spurs? Wonderful, very skilful!"\n\nThe count, by his skill in dancing, eclipsed the three best dancers of the\ncity. These were, a governor\'s aide, a tall albino, who was famous for his\nrapid dancing and because he held the lady pressed very close to his\nbreast; secondly, the cavalryman, who was famous for his graceful swaying\nduring the waltz, and for his frequent but light tapping with his heels;\nand thirdly, a civilian of whom everybody said, that, though he was not\nvery strong-minded, yet he was an admirable dancer and the life of all\nballs.\n\nIn point of fact, this civilian from the beginning to the end of a ball\ninvariably invited all the ladies in the order in which they sat, did not\ncease for a moment to dance, and only occasionally paused to wipe his\nweary but still radiant face with his cambric handkerchief, which would\nbecome wet through.\n\nThe count had surpassed them all, and had danced with the three principal\nladies,--with the stout one, who was rich, handsome, and stupid; with the\nmiddle-sized one, who was lean, and not particularly good-looking, but\nhandsomely dressed; and with the little one, who was not pretty, but very\nwitty.\n\nHe had danced also with others,--with all the pretty women, and there were\nmany pretty women there.\n\nBut the little widow, Zavalshevsky\'s sister, pleased the count more than\nall the rest; with her he danced a quadrille and a schottische and a\nmazurka.\n\nAt first, when they took their places for the quadrille, he overwhelmed her\nwith compliments, comparing her to Venus and Diana, and to a rosebush, and\nto some other flower besides.\n\nTo all these amenities the little widow only bent her white neck, modestly\ndropped her eyes, and, looking at her white muslin dress, changed her fan\nfrom one hand to the other.\n\nWhen, at last, she said, "This is too much, count; you are jesting," etc.,\nher voice, which was rather guttural, betrayed such _naive_ simplicity of\nheart and amusing naturalness that the count, as he looked at her, actually\ncompared her, not to a flower or to a rosebush, but to some kind of a\npinkish-white wild-flower, exuberant and odorless, growing alone on a\nvirgin snow-drift in some far, far-distant land.\n\nSuch a strange impression was made upon the count by this union of\n_naivete_ and unconventionality together with fresh beauty, that several\ntimes, in the pauses of the conversation, when he looked silently into her\neyes or contemplated the loveliness of her arms and neck, the desire came\nover him with such vehemence to take her into his arms and kiss her again\nand again, that he was really obliged to restrain himself.\n\nThe little widow was quite satisfied with the impression which she\nperceived that she had made; but there was something in the count\'s\nbehavior that began to disquiet her, and fill her with apprehensions,\nthough the young hussar was not only flatteringly amiable, but even, to an\nextravagant degree, deferential in his treatment of her.\n\nHe ran to get orgeat for her, picked up her handkerchief, snatched a chair\nfrom the hands of a scrofulous young proprietor, who was also anxious to\npay her attention, and who was not quick enough. But perceiving that these\nassiduities, which were fashionable at that period, had little effect in\nmaking the lady well-disposed, he began to amuse her by telling her\nridiculous anecdotes: he assured her that he was ready at a moment\'s notice\nto stand on his head, or to crow like a cock, or to jump out of the window,\nor to fling himself into a hole in the ice.\n\nThis procedure was a brilliant success: the little widow became very gay;\nshe rippled with laughter, displaying her marvellous white teeth, and\nbecame entirely satisfied with her cavalier. The count each moment grew\nmore and more enchanted with her, so that at the end of the quadrille he\nwas really in love with her.\n\nAfter the quadrille, when she was approached by her former admirer, a young\nman of eighteen, the son of a very rich proprietor, the same scrofulous\nyoung man from whom Turbin had snatched away the chair, she received him\nwith perfect coolness, and not one-tenth part of the constraint was\nnoticeable in her which she felt when she was with the count.\n\n"You are very kind," she said, all the time gazing at Turbin\'s back, and\nunconsciously reckoning how many yards[64] of gold-lace were used for his\nwhole jacket. "You are very kind; you promised to come to take me for a\nwalk, and to bring me some comfits."\n\n[Footnote 64: _arshins._]\n\n"Well, I did come, Anna Fedorovna, but you weren\'t at home, and I left the\nvery best comfits for you," said the young man, in a voice that was very\nthin, considering his height.\n\n"You always are provided with excuses; I don\'t need your comfits. Please do\nnot think"....\n\n"I begin to see, Anna Fedorovna, how you have changed toward me, and I know\nwhy. But it is not right," he added, but without finishing his remark,\nevidently owing to some powerful interior emotion, which caused his lips to\ntremble strangely.\n\nAnna Fedorovna did not heed him, and continued to follow Turbin with her\neyes. The marshal, at whose house the ball was given,--a big, stout old\nman, who had lost his teeth,--came up to the count, and, taking him by the\narm, invited him into his library to smoke and drink if he so desired.\n\nAs soon as Turbin disappeared, Anna Fedorovna felt that there was\nabsolutely nothing for her to do in the ballroom, and slipping her hand\nthrough the arm of a dried-up old maid, who was a friend of hers, went with\nher into the dressing-room.\n\n"Well, what do you think of him? Is he nice?" asked the old maid.\n\n"Only it\'s terrible--the way he follows you up!" said Anna Fedorovna, going\nto the mirror, and contemplating herself in it.\n\nHer face was aglow, her eyes were full of mischief, her color was\nheightened; then suddenly imitating one of the ballet-dancers whom she had\nseen during election time, she pirouetted round on one toe, and, laughing\nher guttural but sweet laugh, she leaped up in the air, crossing her knees.\n\n"What a man he is! he even asked me for a _souvenir_," she confided to her\nfriend. "But he will ne-e-ver get one," she said, singing the last words,\nand lifting one finger in the lilac-colored glove that reached to her\nelbow.\n\nIn the library where Turbin was conducted by the marshal, stood various\nkinds of vodka, liqueurs, edibles,[65] and champagne. In a cloud of\ntobacco-smoke the nobility were sitting, or walking up and down, talking\nabout the elections.\n\n[Footnote 65: _zakuski._]\n\n"When the whole of the high nobility of our district has honored him with\nan election," exclaimed the newly elected ispravnik who was already\ntolerably tipsy, "he certainly ought not to fail in his duties toward\nsociety in general."\n\nThe conversation was interrupted by the count\'s coming. All were presented\nto him, and the ispravnik especially pressed his hand long between both of\nhis, and asked him several times to go with him after the ball to the new\ntavern, where he would treat the gentlemen of the nobility, and where they\nwould hear the gypsies sing.\n\nThe count accepted his invitation, and drank with him several glasses of\nchampagne.\n\n"Why aren\'t you dancing, gentlemen?" he asked, as he was about to leave the\nlibrary.\n\n"We aren\'t dancers," replied the ispravnik, laughing. "We prefer the wine,\ncount; and besides, all these young ladies have grown up under my eyes,\ncount. But still, I do sometimes take part in a schottische, count. I can\ndo it, count."\n\n"Come on then for a while," said Turbin. "Let us have some sport before we\ngo to the gypsies."\n\n"What say you, gentlemen? Let us come! Let us delight our host!"\n\nAnd the three gentlemen who, since the beginning of the ball, had been\ndrinking in the library and had very red faces, began to draw on their\ngloves, some of black kid, another of knit silk, and were just going with\nthe count to the ballroom, when they were detained by the scrofulous young\nman, who, pale as a sheet, and scarcely able to refrain from tears, came\nstraight up to Turbin.\n\n"You have an idea, because you are a count, you can run into people as if\nyou were at a fair," said he, with difficulty drawing his breath; "hence it\nisn\'t fitting"--\n\nOnce more the stream of his speech was interrupted by the involuntary\ntrembling of his lips.\n\n"What?" cried Turbin, frowning suddenly, "what?... You\'re a baby," he\ncried, seizing him by the arm, and squeezing it so that the blood rushed to\nthe young man\'s head, not so much from vexation as from fright. "What is\nit? Do you want to fight? If so, I am at your service."\n\nTurbin had scarcely let go of his arm, which he had squeezed so powerfully,\nwhen two nobles seized the young man by the sleeve, and carried him off\nthrough a back door.\n\n"What! have you lost your wits? You\'ve surely been drinking too much. We\nshall have to tell your papa. What\'s the matter with you?" they asked.\n\n"No, I haven\'t been drinking; but he ran into me, and did not apologize.\nHe\'s a hog, that\'s what he is," whined the young man, now actually in\ntears.\n\nNevertheless they paid no attention to him, but carried him off home.\n\n"Never mind, count," said the ispravnik and Zavalshevsky assuringly. "He\'s\na mere child. They still whip him: he\'s only sixteen years old. It\'s hard\nto tell what is to be done with him. What fly stung him? And his father is\nsuch an honorable man! He\'s our candidate."\n\n"Well, the Devil take him if he refuses"....\n\nAnd the count returned to the ballroom, and, as gayly as before, danced the\nschottische with the pretty little widow, and laughed heartily when he saw\nthe antics of the gentlemen who had come with him out of the library. There\nwas a general burst of merriment all through the ballroom when the\nispravnik tripped, and measured his length on the floor in the midst of the\ndancers.\n\n\nV.\n\nAnna Fedorovna, while the count was in the library, went to her brother,\nand, for the very reason of her conviction that she ought to pretend to\nfeel very little interest in the count, she began to question him.\n\n"Who is this hussar that has been dancing with me? Tell me, brother."\n\nThe cavalryman explained, to the best of his ability, what a great man this\nhussar was, and in addition he told his sister that the count had stopped\nthere simply because his money had been stolen on the route: he himself had\nloaned him a hundred rubles, but that was not enough. Couldn\'t his sister\nlet him have two hundred more? Zavalshevsky asked her not to say any thing\nabout this to any one, and, above all, not to the count.\n\nAnna Fedorovna promised to send the money the next day, and to keep it a\nsecret; but somehow or other, during the schottische, she had a terrible\ndesire to offer the count as much money as he needed.\n\nShe deliberated, blushed, and at last, mastering her confusion, thus\naddressed herself to the task:--\n\n"My brother told me, count, that you had met with a misfortune on the road,\nand hadn\'t any money. Now, if you need some, wouldn\'t you take some of me?\nI should be terribly glad."\n\nBut after she had thus spoken, Anna Fedorovna suddenly was overcome with\nfright, and blushed. All the gayety had instantly vanished from the\ncount\'s face.\n\n"Your brother is a fool!" said he in a cutting tone. "You know, when a man\ninsults a man, then they fight a duel; but when a woman insults a man, then\nwhat do they do? Do you know?"\n\nPoor Anna Fedorovna blushed to her ears with confusion. She dropped her\neyes, and made no reply.\n\n"They kiss the woman in public," said the count softly, bending over to\nwhisper in her ear. "Permit me, however, to kiss your little hand," he\nadded almost inaudibly, after a long silence, having some pity on his\nlady\'s confusion.\n\n"Ah! only not quite yet," urged Anna Fedorovna, with a deep sigh.\n\n"But when, then? To-morrow I am going away early.... But really, you owe it\nto me."\n\n"Well, then, of course it is impossible," said Anna Fedorovna smiling.\n\n"Only give me a chance to see you before to-morrow, so that I may kiss your\nhand. I will find one."\n\n"How will you find one?"\n\n"That is my affair. I can do any thing to see you.... Is it agreed?"\n\n"Agreed."\n\nThe schottische came to an end; they danced through the mazurka, and in it\nthe count did marvels, purloining handkerchiefs, bending on one knee, and\nclinking his spurs in an extraordinary manner, after the Warsaw style, so\nthat all the old men came from their _boston_ to look into the ballroom;\nand the cavalryman who was the best dancer confessed himself outdone. After\nthey had eaten supper, they danced still the _gross vater_, and began to\ndisperse.\n\nThe count all this time did not take his eyes from the little widow. He had\nnot been insincere when he declared his readiness to throw himself into a\nhole in the ice.\n\nWhether it was caprice or love or stubbornness, but that evening all the\nstrength of his mind had been concentrated into one desire,--to see and to\nlove her.\n\nAs soon as he perceived that Anna Fedorovna was taking her farewell of the\nhostess, he hastened to the servants\' quarters, and thence, without his\nshuba, to the place where the carriages were drawn up.\n\n"Anna Fedorovna Zaitsova\'s equipage," he cried.\n\nA high four-seated carriage with lanterns moved out, and started to drive\nup to the doorstep.\n\n"Stop!" shouted the count to the coachman, rushing up toward the carriage\nthrough snow that was knee-deep.\n\n"What is wanted?" called the driver.\n\n"I want to get into the carriage," replied the count, opening the door as\nthe carriage moved, and trying to climb in.\n\n"Stop, you devil! stupid! Vaska![66] stop!" cried the coachman to the\npostilion, and reining in the horses. "What are you getting into another\nperson\'s carriage for? This belongs to the Lady Anna Fedorovna, and not to\nyour grace."\n\n[Footnote 66: Diminutive of Vasili.]\n\n"Hush up, blockhead! _Na!_ there\'s a ruble for you; now come down and shut\nthe door!" said the count.\n\nBut as the coachman did not move, he lifted the steps himself, and,\nshutting the window, managed to pull the door to.\n\nIn this, as in all ancient carriages, especially those upholstered in\nyellow galloon, there was an odor of mustiness and burnt bristles.\n\nThe count\'s legs were wet to the knees from melting snow, and almost\nfreezing in his thin boots and trousers; and his whole body was penetrated\nby a cold like that of winter.\n\nThe coachman was grumbling on his box, and seemed to be getting ready to\nget down. But the count heard nothing and felt nothing. His face was aglow,\nhis heart was beating violently. He convulsively clutched the yellow strap,\nthrust his head out of the side-window, and his whole being was\nconcentrated in expectation.\n\nHe was not doomed to wait long. At the door-steps, they shouted,\n"Zaitsova\'s carriage!" The coachman shook his reins, the carriage swung on\nits high springs; the lighted windows of the house passed one after another\nby the carriage-windows.\n\n"See here, rogue, if you tell the lackey that I am here," said the count,\nthrusting his head through the front window, and addressing the coachman,\n"you\'ll feel my whip; but if you hold your tongue, I will give you ten\nrubles more."\n\nHe had scarcely time to close the window, when the carriage shook again\nstill more violently, and then the wheels came to a stop.\n\nHe drew back as far as possible into the corner; he ceased to breathe; he\neven shut his eyes, so apprehensive was he, lest his passionate expectation\nshould be disappointed.\n\nThe door was opened; one after the other, with a creak, the steps were let\ndown; a woman\'s dress rustled, and the close atmosphere of the carriage\nwas impregnated by the odor of jasmine; a woman\'s dainty feet hurried up\nthe steps, and Anna Fedorovna, brushing against the count\'s leg with the\nskirt of her cloak, which was loosely thrown about her, silently, and with\na deep sigh, took her place on the cushioned seat next him.\n\nWhether she saw him or not, no one could decide, not even Anna Fedorovna\nherself: but when he took her hand, and said, "Now I will kiss your little\nhand anyway," she evinced very little dismay. She said nothing, but let him\ntake her hand, which he covered with kisses, not stopping at the glove.\n\nThe carriage rolled off.\n\n"Tell me something. You are not angry?" said he to her.\n\nShe silently sank back into her corner, but suddenly, for some reason or\nother, burst into tears, and let her head fall on his breast.\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe newly elected ispravnik, with his company, the cavalryman, and other\nmembers of the nobility, had already been listening for some time to the\ngypsies, and drinking at the new tavern, when the count, in a blue-lined\nbear-skin shuba which had belonged to Anna Fedorovna\'s late husband, joined\nthem.\n\n"Little father, your excellency! we have almost given up expecting you,"\nsaid a squint-eyed black gypsy with brilliant teeth, who met him in the\nentry and divested him of his shuba. "We haven\'t met since we were at\nLebedyan.... Stioshka has pined away on account of you."\n\nStioshka, a slender young gypsy-girl[67] with a cherry red bloom on her\ncinnamon-colored cheeks, with brilliant deep black eyes, shaded by long\neyelashes, also hurried to meet him.\n\n"Ah! dear little count![68] my sweetheart! This is a pleasure," she\nexclaimed through her teeth, with a joyous smile.\n\n[Footnote 67: _tsiganotchka._]\n\n[Footnote 68: _grafchik! golubchik!_]\n\nIlyushka himself came to greet Turbin, pretending that he was very glad to\nsee him. The old women, the wives, the young girls, hastened to the spot\nand surrounded the guest.\n\nOne would have said that he was a relative or a god-brother to them.\n\nTurbin kissed all the young gypsy girls on the lips; the old women and the\nmen kissed him on the shoulder or on the hand.\n\nThe gentlemen were also very glad of the count\'s arrival; the more because\nthe festivity, having passed its apogee, was now becoming tame; every one\nbegan to feel a sense of satiety. The wine, having lost its exhilarating\neffect on the nerves, only served to load the stomach. Everybody had\ndischarged the last cannon of his wildness, and was looking around moodily.\nAll the songs had been sung, and ran in the heads of each, leaving a mere\nimpression of noise and confusion.\n\nWhatever any one did that was strange and wild, the rest began to look upon\nit as nothing very entertaining or amusing.\n\nThe ispravnik stretched out on the floor in shameless fashion at the feet\nof some old woman, kicked his leg in the air, and began to cry,--\n\n"Champagne!... The count has come!... Champagne!... He has come!... Now\ngive us champagne!... I will make a bath of champagne, and swim in it!\nGentlemen of the nobility, I love your admirable society!... Stioshka, sing\n\'The Narrow Road.\'"\n\nThe cavalryman was also very gay, but in a different fashion. He was\nsitting in a corner of a sofa with a tall, handsome gypsy, Liubasha; and\nwith the consciousness that intoxication was beginning to cloud his eyes,\nhe kept blinking them, and swinging his head, and repeating the same words\nover and over again: he was proposing in a whisper to the gypsy to fly with\nhim somewhere.\n\nLiubasha, smiling, listened to him as though what he said were very amusing\nto her, and at the same time rather melancholy. Occasionally she cast her\nglances at her husband, the squint-eyed Sashka, who was standing behind a\nchair near her. In reply to the cavalryman\'s declaration of love, she bent\nover to his ear, and begged him to buy her some perfume and a ribbon\nwithout any one knowing it, so that the others should not see it.\n\n"Hurrah!" cried the cavalryman when the count came in.\n\nThe handsome young man, with an expression of anxiety, was walking up and\ndown the room with solicitously steady steps, and humming an air from the\n"Revolt in the Seraglio."\n\nAn old _paterfamilias_, dragged out to see the gypsies through the\nirresistible entreaties of the gentlemen of the nobility, who had told him\nthat if he staid away every thing would go to pieces, and in that case they\nhad better not go, was lying on a sofa where he had stretched himself out\nimmediately on his arrival; and no one paid any attention to him.\n\nA chinovnik, who had been there before, had taken off his coat, was sitting\nwith his legs on the table, and was rumpling up his hair, and thus proving\nthat he understood how to be dissipated.\n\nAs soon as the count came in, the official unbuttoned his shirt-collar, and\nlifted his legs still higher. The count\'s arrival generally gave new life\nto the festivities.\n\nThe gypsy girls, who had been scattered about the room, again formed their\ncircle. The count seated Stioshka, the soloist, on his knee, and ordered\nmore champagne to be brought. Ilyushka, with his guitar, stood in front of\nthe soloist, and began the _plyaska_, that is, the gypsy song and dance,\n"When I walk upon the Street," "Hey! you Hussars," "Do you hear, do you\nunderstand?" and others of the usual order.\n\nStioshka sang splendidly. Her flexible, sonorous contralto, with its deep\nchest notes, her smiles while she was singing, her mischievous, passionate\neyes, and her little foot which involuntarily kept time to the measure of\nthe song, her despairing wail at the end of each couplet,--this all touched\nsome resonant but tender chord. It was evident that she lived only in the\nsong that she was singing.\n\nIlyushka, in his smile, his back, his legs, his whole being, carrying out\nin pantomime the idea expressed in the song, accompanied it on his guitar,\nand, fixing his eyes upon her as though he were hearing her for the first\ntime, attentively and carefully lifted and drooped his head with the rhythm\nof the song.\n\nThen he suddenly straightened himself up as the singer sang the last note,\nand, as though he felt himself superior to every one else in the world,\nwith proud deliberation kicked the guitar, turned it over, stamped his\nfoot, tossed back his locks, and looked at the chorus with a frown.\n\nAll his body, from his neck to his toes, began to dance in every sinew.\n\nAnd twenty powerful, energetic voices, each trying to outdo the other in\nmaking strange and extraordinary noises, were lifted in union.\n\nThe old women sprang down from their chairs, waving their handkerchiefs,\nand showing their teeth, and crying in rhythmic measure, each louder than\nthe other. The bassos, leaning their heads on one side, and swelling their\nnecks, bellowed from behind their chairs.\n\nWhen Stioshka emitted her high notes, Ilyushka brought his guitar nearer to\nher as though trying to aid her; and the handsome young man, in his\nenthusiasm, cried out that now they struck B-flat.\n\nWhen they came to the national dance, the Plyasovaya, and Duniasha, with\nshoulders and bosom shaking, stepped in front of the count, and was passing\non, Turbin leaped from his place, took off his uniform, and, remaining only\nin his red shirt, boldly joined her, keeping up the same measure, and\ncutting with his feet such antics, that the gypsies laughed and exchanged\nglances of approval.\n\nThe ispravnik, who was sitting Turkish fashion, pounded his chest with his\nfist, and cried "_Vivat!_" and then, seizing the count by the leg, began to\ntell him that out of two thousand rubles, he had only five hundred left and\nthat he might do whatever he pleased, if only the count would permit him.\n\nThe old _paterfamilias_ woke up, and wanted to go home, but they would not\nlet him. The handsome young man asked a gypsy girl to waltz with him. The\ncavalryman, anxious to exalt himself by his friendship with the count, got\nup from his corner, and embraced Turbin. "Ah, my turtle-dove!" he cried.\n"Why must you leave us so soon? ha?" The count said nothing, being\nevidently absorbed in thought. "Where did you go? Ah, you rascal, I know\nwhere you went!"\n\nThis familiarity somehow displeased the Count Turbin. Without smiling, he\nlooked in silence into the cavalryman\'s face, and suddenly gave him such a\nterrible and grievous affront that the cavalryman was mortified, and for\nsome time did not know what to make of such an insult, whether it were a\njoke or not a joke. At last he made up his mind that it was a joke; he\nsmiled, and returned to his gypsy, assuring her that he would really marry\nher after Easter.\n\nAnother song was sung, a third, they danced again; the round of gayety was\nkept up, and every one continued to feel gay. There was no end to the\nchampagne.\n\nThe count drank a great deal. His eyes seemed to grow rather moist, but he\ndid not grow dizzy; he danced still better than the rest, spoke without any\nthickness, and even joined in a chorus, and supported Stioshka when she\nsang "The sweet emotion of friendship."\n\nIn the midst of the dance and song the merchant, who kept the hotel, came\nto beg the guests to go home, as it was three o\'clock in the morning.\n\nThe count took the landlord by the throat, and ordered him to dance the\n_prisiadka_. The merchant refused. The count snatched a bottle of\nchampagne, and standing the merchant on his head ordered him to stay so,\nand then amid general hilarity poured the whole bottle over him.\n\nThe dawn was already breaking. All were pale and weary except the count.\n\n"At all events, I must go to Moscow," said he, suddenly rising. "Come with\nme, all of you, to my room, children.... See me off, and let us have some\ntea."\n\nAll accompanied him with the exception of the sleeping proprietor, who\nstill remained there; they piled into three sledges that were waiting at\nthe door, and drove off to the hotel.\n\n\nVII.\n\n"Have the horses put in!" cried the count, as he entered the sitting-room\nof the hotel with all his friends including the gypsies.\n\n"Sashka,--not the gypsy Sashka, but mine,--tell the superintendent that if\nthe horses are poor I will flog him. Now give us some tea. Zavalshevsky,\nmake some tea; I am going to Ilyin\'s; I want to find how things have gone\nwith him," added Turbin; and he went out into the corridor, and directed\nhis steps to the uhlan\'s room.\n\nIlyin was just through playing, and, having lost all his money down to his\nlast kopek, had thrown himself face down on the worn-out haircloth sofa,\nand was picking the hairs out one by one, sticking them in his mouth,\nbiting them into two, and spitting them out again.\n\nTwo tallow candles, one of which was already burnt down to the paper, stood\non the card-cluttered ombre-table, and mingled their feeble rays with the\nmorning light which was beginning to shine through the window.\n\nThe uhlan\'s mind was vacant of all thought: that strange thick fog of the\ngambling-passion muffled all the capabilities of his mind so that there was\nnot even room for regret.\n\nOnce he endeavored to think what was left for him to do, how he should get\naway without a kopek, how he should pay back the fifteen thousand rubles\nof public money that he had lost in gambling, what his colonel would say,\nwhat his mother would say, what his comrades would say; and such fear came\nover him, and such disgust at himself, that, in his anxiety to rid himself\nof the thought of it, he arose and began to walk up and down through the\nroom, trying only to walk on the cracks of the floor; and then once more he\nbegan to recall all the least details of the evening.\n\nHe vividly imagined that he was winning the whole back again: he takes a\nnine, and lays down a king of spades on two thousand rubles; a queen lies\nat the right, at the left an ace, at the right a king of diamonds--and all\nwas lost! but if he had had a six at the right and a king of diamonds at\nthe left, then he would have won it all back, he would have staked all\nagain on P, and would have won back his fifteen thousand rubles, then he\nwould have bought a good pacer of the colonel, an extra pair of horses, and\na phaeton. And what else besides? Ah! indeed it would have been a splendid,\nsplendid thing!\n\nAgain he threw himself down on the sofa, and began to bite the hairs once\nmore.\n\n"Why are they singing songs in No. 7?" he wondered. "It must be, they are\nhaving a jollification in Turbin\'s room. I\'m of a good mind to go there,\nand have a little drink."\n\nJust at this moment the count came in.\n\n"Well, have you been losing, brother, hey?" he cried.\n\n"I will pretend to be asleep, otherwise I shall have to talk with him, and\nI really want to sleep now."\n\nNevertheless Turbin went up to him, and laid his hand caressingly on his\nhead.... "Well, my dear little friend, have you been losing? have you had\nbad luck? Tell me."\n\nIlyin made no reply.\n\nThe count took him by the arm.\n\n"I have been losing. What is it to you?" muttered Ilyin, in a sleepy voice\nexpressing indifference and vexation; he did not change his position.\n\n"Every thing?"\n\n"Well, yes. What harm is there in it? All! What is it to you?"\n\n"Listen: tell me the truth, as to a comrade," said the count, who, under\nthe influence of the wine that he had been drinking, was disposed to be\ntender, and continued to smooth the other\'s hair. "You know I have taken a\nfancy to you. Tell me the truth. If you have lost the public money, I will\nhelp you; if you don\'t, it will be too late.... Was it public money?"\n\nIlyin leaped up from the sofa.\n\n"If you wish me to tell you, don\'t speak to me so, because ... and I beg of\nyou don\'t speak to me.... I will blow my brains out--that\'s the only thing\nthat\'s left for me now!" he exclaimed with genuine despair, letting his\nhead sink into his hands, and bursting into tears, although but the moment\nbefore he had been calmly thinking about his horses.\n\n"_Ekh!_ you\'re a pretty young girl! Well, who might not have the same thing\nhappen to him? It isn\'t as bad as it might be; perhaps we can straighten\nthings out: wait for me here."\n\nThe count hastened from the room.\n\n"Where is the _pomyeshchik_[69] Lukhnof\'s room?" he demanded of the\nhall-boy.\n\n[Footnote 69: Landed proprietor.]\n\nThe hall-boy offered to show the count the way. The count in spite of the\nobjections of the lackey, who said that his master had only just come in\nand was preparing to retire, entered the room.\n\nLukhnof in his dressing-gown was sitting in front of a table, counting over\na number of packages of bank-notes piled up before him. On the table was a\nbottle of Rheinwein, of which he was very fond. He had procured himself\nthis pleasure from his winnings.\n\nColdly, sternly, Lukhnof looked at the count over his glasses, affecting\nnot to recognize him.\n\n"It seems that you do not know me," said the count, proceeding toward the\ntable with resolute steps.\n\nLukhnof recognized the count, and asked,--\n\n"What is your pleasure?"\n\n"I wish to play with you," said Turbin, sitting down on the sofa.\n\n"Now?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Another time I should be most happy, count; but now I am tired, and am\ngetting ready to go to bed. Won\'t you have some wine? It is excellent\nwine."\n\n"But I wish to play with you for a little while _now_."\n\n"I am not prepared to play any more. Maybe some of the other guests will.\n_I will not_, count! I beg of you to excuse me."\n\n"Then you will not?"\n\nLukhnof shrugged his shoulders as though to express his regret at not being\nable to fulfil the count\'s desires.\n\n"Will you not play under any consideration?"\n\nThe same gesture.\n\n"I am very desirous of playing with you.... Say, will you play, or not?"\n\nSilence.\n\n"Will you play?" asked the count a second time.\n\nThe same silence, and a quick glance over his glasses at the count\'s face,\nwhich was beginning to grow sinister.\n\n"Will you play?" cried the count in a loud voice, striking his hand on the\ntable so violently that the bottle of Rheinwein toppled over and the wine\nran out. "You have been cheating, have you not? Will you play? I ask you\nthe third time."\n\n"I have told you, no! This is truly strange, count, ... perfectly\nunjustifiable, to come this way, and put your knife at a man\'s throat,"\nremarked Lukhnof, not lifting his eyes.\n\nA brief silence followed, during which the count\'s face grew paler and\npaler. Suddenly Lukhnof received a terrible blow on the head, which stunned\nhim. He fell back on the divan, trying to grasp the money, and screamed in\na penetratingly despairing tone, such as was scarcely to be expected from\nhim, he was always so calm and imposing in his deportment.\n\nTurbin gathered up the remaining bank-notes that were lying on the table,\npushed away the servant who had come to his master\'s assistance, and with\nquick steps left the room.\n\n"If you wish satisfaction, I am at your service; I shall be in my room for\nhalf an hour yet,--No. 7," added the count, turning back as he reached the\ndoor.\n\n"Villain! thief!" cried a voice from within the room.... "I will have\nsatisfaction at law!"\n\nIlyin, who had not paid any heed to the count\'s promise to help him, was\nstill lying on the sofa in his room, drowned in tears of despair.\n\nThe count\'s caresses and sympathy had awakened him to a consciousness of\nthe reality, and now, amidst the fog of strange thoughts and recollections\nwhich filled his mind, it made itself more and more felt.\n\nHis youth, rich in hopes, honor, his social position, the dreams of love\nand friendship, were all destroyed forever. The fountain of his tears began\nto run dry, a too calm feeling of hopelessness took possession of him; and\nthe thought of suicide, now bringing no sense of repulsion or terror, more\nand more frequently recurred to him.\n\nAt this moment the count\'s firm steps were heard.\n\nOn Turbin\'s face were still visible the last traces of his recent wrath,\nhis hands trembled slightly; but in his eyes shone a kindly gayety and\nself-satisfaction.\n\n"There! It has been won back for you!" he cried, tossing upon the table\nseveral packages of bank-notes. "Count them; are they all there? Then come\nas soon as possible to the sitting-room; I am going off right away," he\nadded, as though he did not perceive the tremendous revulsion of joy and\ngratefulness which rushed over the uhlan\'s face. Then, humming a gypsy\nsong, he left the room.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nSashka, tightening his girdle, was waiting for the horses to be harnessed,\nbut was anxious to go first and get the count\'s cloak, which, with the\ncollar, must have been worth three hundred rubles, and return that\nmiserable blue-lined shuba to that rascally man who had exchanged with the\ncount at the marshal\'s. But Turbin said that it was not necessary, and went\nto his room to change his clothes.\n\nThe cavalryman kept hiccoughing as he sat silently by his gypsy maiden. The\nispravnik called for vodka, and invited all the gentlemen to come and\nbreakfast with him, promising them that his wife would, without fail, dance\nthe national dance with the gypsies.\n\nThe handsome young man was earnestly arguing with Ilyushka that there was\nmore soul in the piano-forte, and that it was impossible to take B-flat on\nthe guitar. The chinovnik was gloomily drinking tea in one corner, and\napparently the daylight made him feel ashamed of his dissipation.\n\nThe gypsies were conversing together in Romany, and urging that they should\nonce more enliven the gentlemen; to which Stioshka objected, declaring that\nit would only vex the _barorai_,--that is, in Romany, count or prince, or\nrather great barin.\n\nFor the most part, the last spark of the orgy was dying out.\n\n"Well, then, one more song for a farewell, and then home with you,"\nexclaimed the count, fresh, gay, and radiant above all the others, as he\ncame into the room ready dressed in his travelling suit.\n\nThe gypsies had again formed their circle, and were just getting ready to\nsing, when Ilyin came in with a package of bank-notes in his hand, and drew\nthe count to one side.\n\n"I had only fifteen thousand rubles of public money, but you gave me\nsixteen thousand three hundred," said the uhlan; "this is yours, of\ncourse."\n\n"That\'s a fine arrangement. Let me have it."\n\nIlyin handed him the money, looking timidly at the count, and opened his\nmouth to say something; but then he reddened so painfully that the tears\ncame into his eyes, and he seized the count\'s hand, and began to squeeze\nit.\n\n"Away with you, Ilyushka ... listen to me! Now, here\'s your money, but you\nmust accompany me with your songs to the city limits!" And he threw on his\nguitar the thirteen hundred rubles which Ilyin had brought him. But the\ncount had forgotten to repay the cavalryman the one hundred rubles which he\nhad borrowed of him the evening before.\n\nIt was now ten o\'clock in the morning. The little sun was rising above the\nhousetops, the streets were beginning to fill with people, the merchants\nhad long ago opened their shops, nobles and chinovniks were riding up and\ndown through the streets, and ladies were out shopping, when the band of\ngypsies, the ispravnik, the cavalryman, the handsome young fellow, Ilyin,\nand the count who was wrapped up in his blue-lined bear-skin shuba, came\nout on the door-steps of the hotel.\n\nIt was a sunny day, and it thawed. Three hired troikas, with their tails\nknotted, and splashing through the liquid mud, pranced up to the steps; and\nthe whole jolly company prepared to take their places. The count, Ilyin,\nStioshka, Ilyushka, and Sashka the count\'s man,[70] mounted the first\nsledge.\n\n[Footnote 70: _denshchik._]\n\nBluecher was beside himself with delight, and, wagging his tail, barked at\nthe shaft-horse.\n\nThe other gentlemen, together with the gypsies, men and women, climbed into\nthe other sledges. From the very hotel the sledges flew off side by side,\nand the gypsies set up a merry chorus and song.\n\nThe troikas, with the songs and jingling bells, dashed through the whole\nlength of the city to the gates, compelling all the equipages which they\nmet to rein up on the very sidewalks.\n\nMerchants and passers-by who did not know them, and especially those who\ndid, were filled with astonishment to see nobles of high rank, in the midst\nof "the white day," dashing through the streets with intoxicated gypsies,\nsinging at the tops of their voices.\n\nWhen they reached the city limits, the troikas stopped, and all the party\ntook farewell of the count.\n\nIlyin, who had drunk considerable at the leave-taking, and had all the time\nbeen driving the horses, suddenly became melancholy, and began to urge the\ncount to stay just one day more; but when he was assured that this was\nimpossible, quite unexpectedly threw himself into his arms, and began to\nkiss his new friend, and promised him that as soon as he got to camp, he\nwould petition to be transferred into the regiment of hussars in which\nCount Turbin served.\n\nThe count was extraordinarily hilarious; he tipped into a snow-drift the\ncavalryman, who, since morning, had definitely taken to saying _thou_ to\nhim; he set Bluecher on the ispravnik; he took Stioshka into his arms, and\nthreatened to carry her off with him to Moscow; but at last he tucked\nhimself into the sledge, and stationed Bluecher by his side, who was always\nready to ride. Sashka took his place on the box, after once more asking the\ncavalryman to secure the count\'s cloak from _them_, and to send it to him.\nThe count cried "Go on,"[71] took off his cap, waved it over his head, and\nwhistled in post-boy fashion to the horses. The troikas parted company.\n\n[Footnote 71: _proshol._]\n\nAs far as the eye could see, stretched a monotonous snow-covered plain,\nover which wound the yellowish muddy ribbon of the road.\n\nThe bright sunlight, dancing, glistened on the melting snow, which was\ncovered with a thin crust of transparent ice, and pleasantly warmed the\nface and back.\n\nThe steam arose from the sweaty horses. The bells jingled.\n\nA peasant[72] with a creaking sledge, heavily loaded, slowly turned out\ninto the slushy snow, twitching his hempen reins, and tramping with his\nwell-soaked sabots.[73]\n\n[Footnote 72: _muzhik._]\n\n[Footnote 73: _lapti._]\n\nA stout, handsome peasant woman, with a child wrapped in a sheep-skin on\nher lap, who was seated on another load, used the end of her reins to whip\nup a white mangy-tailed old nag.\n\nSuddenly the count remembered Anna Fedorovna.\n\n"Turn round!" he cried.\n\nThe driver did not understand.\n\n"Turn round and drive back; back to the city! Be quick about it." The\ntroika again passed the city gate, and quickly drew up in front of the\nboarded steps of the Zaitsova dwelling.\n\nThe count briskly mounted the steps, passed through the vestibule and the\nparlor, and finding the widow still asleep he took her in his arms, lifting\nher from her bed, and kissed her sleeping eyes again and again, and then\ndarted back to the sledge.\n\nAnna Fedorovna awoke from her slumber, and demanded, "What has happened?"\n\nThe count took his seat in his sledge, shouted to the driver, and now no\nlonger delaying, and thinking not of Lukhnof nor of the little widow, nor\nof Stioshka, but only of what was awaiting him in Moscow, rapidly left the\ncity of K. behind him.\n\n\nIX.\n\nA score of years have passed. Much water has run since then, many men have\ndied, many children have been born, many have grown up and become old;\nstill more thoughts have been born and perished. Much that was beautiful\nand much that was ugly in the past have disappeared; much that is beautiful\nin the new has been brought forth, and still more that is incomplete and\nabortive of the new has appeared in God\'s world.\n\nCount Feodor Turbin was long ago killed in a duel with some foreigner whom\nhe struck on the street with his long whip. His son, who was as like him as\ntwo drops of water, had already reached the age of two or three and twenty,\nand was a lovely fellow, already serving in the cavalry.\n\nMorally the young Count Turbin was entirely different from his father.\nThere was not a shadow of those fiery, passionate, and in truth be it said,\ncorrupt inclinations, peculiar to the last century.\n\nTogether with intelligence, cultivation, and inherited natural gifts, a\nlove for the proprieties and amenities of life, a practical view of men and\ncircumstances, wisdom and forethought, were his chief characteristics.\n\nThe young count made admirable progress in his profession; at twenty-three\nhe was already lieutenant.... When war broke out, he came to the conclusion\nthat it would be more for his interests to enter the regular army; and he\njoined a regiment of hussars as captain of cavalry, where he soon was given\ncommand of a battalion.\n\nIn the month of May, 1848, the S. regiment of hussars was on its way\nthrough the government of K., and the very battalion which the young Count\nTurbin commanded was obliged to be quartered for one night at Morozovka,\nAnna Fedorovna\'s village. Anna Fedorovna was still alive, but was now so\nfar from being young that she no longer called herself young, which, for a\nwoman, means much.\n\nShe had grown very stout, and this, it is said, restores youth in a woman.\nBut that was not the worst of it: over her pale, stout flesh was a net-work\nof coarse, flabby wrinkles. She no longer went to the city, she even found\nit hard to mount into her carriage; but still she was just as good-natured\nand as completely vacant-minded as ever,--the truth might safely be told,\nnow that it was no longer palliated by her beauty.\n\nUnder her roof lived her daughter Liza, a rustic Russian belle of\ntwenty-three summers, and her brother, our acquaintance the cavalryman, who\nhad spent all his patrimony in behalf of others, and now, in his old age,\nhad taken refuge with Anna Fedorovna.\n\nThe hair on his head had become perfectly gray; his upper lip was sunken,\nbut the mustache that it wore was carefully dyed. Wrinkles covered not only\nhis brow and cheeks, but also his nose and neck; and yet his weak bow-legs\ngave evidence of the old cavalryman.\n\nAnna Fedorovna\'s whole family and household were gathered in the small\nparlor of the ancient house. The balcony door and windows, looking out into\na star-shaped garden shaded by lindens, were open. Anna Fedorovna, in her\ngray hair and a lilac-colored gown,[74] was sitting on the sofa, before a\nsmall round mahogany table, shuffling cards. The old brother, dressed in\nspruce white pantaloons and a blue coat, had taken up his position near the\nwindow, knitting strips of white cotton on a fork, an occupation which his\nniece had taught him, and which gave him great enjoyment, as he had nothing\nelse to do, his eyes not being strong enough to enable him to read\nnewspapers, which was his favorite occupation. Near him Pimotchka, a\n_protegee_ of Anna Fedorovna, was studying her lessons under the guidance\nof Liza, who with wooden knitting-needles was knitting stockings of\ngoat-wool for her uncle.\n\n[Footnote 74: _katsaveika._]\n\nThe last rays of the setting sun, as always at this time, threw under the\nlinden alley their soft reflections on the last window-panes and the little\n_etagere_ which stood near it.\n\nIn the garden it was so still that one could hear the swift rush of a\nswallow\'s wings, and so quiet in the room that Anna Fedorovna\'s gentle\nsigh, or the old man\'s cough as he kept changing the position of his legs,\nwas the only sound.\n\n"How does this go, Lizanka? show me, please. I keep forgetting," said Anna\nFedorovna, pausing in the midst of her game of patience. Liza, without\nstopping her work, went over to her mother, and, glancing at the cards,\n"Ah!" says she. "You have mixed them all up, dear mamasha," said she,\narranging the cards. "That is the way they should be placed. Now they come\nas you desired," she added, secretly withdrawing one card.\n\n"Now you are always managing to deceive me! You said that it would go."\n\n"No, truly; it goes, I assure you. It has come out right."\n\n"Very well, then; very well, you rogue! But isn\'t it time for tea?"\n\n"I have just ordered the samovar heated. I will go and see about it\nimmediately. Shall we have it brought here?... Now, Pimotchka, hasten and\nfinish your lessons, and we will go and take a run."\n\nAnd Liza started for the door.\n\n"Lizotchka! Lizanka!" cried her uncle, steadfastly regarding his fork,\n"again it seems to me I have dropped a stitch. Arrange it for me, my\ndarling."[75]\n\n[Footnote 75: _golubchik._]\n\n"In a moment, in a moment. First I must have the sugar broken up."\n\nAnd in point of fact, within three minutes, she came running into the room,\nwent up to her uncle, and took him by the ear.\n\n"That\'s to pay you for dropping stitches," said she laughing. "You have not\nbeen knitting as I taught you."\n\n"Now, that\'ll do, that\'ll do, adjust it for me; there seems to be some sort\nof a knot."\n\nLiza took the fork, pulled out a pin from her kerchief, which was blown\nback a little by the breeze coming through the window, picked it out a\ncouple of times, and handed it back to her uncle.\n\n"Now you must kiss me for that," said she, putting up her rosy cheek toward\nhim, and re-adjusting her kerchief. "You shall have rum in your tea to-day.\nTo-day is Friday, you see."\n\nAnd again she went to the tea-room.\n\n"Uncle dear, come and look! some hussars are riding up toward the house!"\nher ringing voice was heard to say. Anna Fedorovna and her brother hastened\ninto the tea-room, the windows of which faced the village, and looked at\nthe hussars. Very little was to be seen; through the cloud of dust it could\nbe judged only that a body of men was advancing.\n\n"What a pity, sister," remarked the uncle to Anna Fedorovna, "what a pity\nthat we are so cramped, and the wing is not built yet, so that we might\ninvite the officers here. Officers of the hussars! they are such glorious,\ngay young fellows! I should like to have a glimpse at them."\n\n"Well, I should be heartily glad, but you know yourself that there is\nnowhere to put them: my sleeping-room, Liza\'s room, the parlor, and then\nyour room,--judge for yourself. Mikhailo Matveef has put the\n_starosta\'s_[76] house in order for them; he says it will be nice there."\n\n[Footnote 76: Village elder.]\n\n"But we must find you a husband, Lizotchka, among them,--a glorious\nhussar!" said the uncle.\n\n"No, I do not want a hussar: I want an uhlan. Let me see, you served among\nthe uhlans, didn\'t you, uncle?... I don\'t care to know these hussars. They\nsay they are desperate fellows."\n\nAnd Liza blushed a little, and then once more her ringing laugh was heard.\n"There\'s Ustiushka running: we must ask her what she saw," said she. Anna\nFedorovna sent to have Ustiushka brought in.\n\n"She has no idea of sticking to her work, she must always be running off to\nlook at the soldiers," said Anna Fedorovna.... "Now, where have they lodged\nthe officers?"\n\n"With the Yeremkins, your ladyship. There are two of them, such lovely men!\nOne of them is a count, they tell me."\n\n"What\'s his name?"\n\n"Kazarof or Turbinof. I don\'t remember, excuse me."\n\n"There now, you\'re a goose, you don\'t know how to tell any thing at all.\nYou might have remembered his name!"\n\n"Well, I\'ll run and find out."\n\n"I know that you are quite able to do that. But no, let Danilo\ngo.--Brother, go and tell him to go; have him ask if there is not something\nwhich the officers may need; every thing must be done in good form; have\nthem understand that it is the lady of the house who has sent to find out."\n\nThe old people sat down again in the tea-room, and Liza went to the\nservants\' room to put the lumps of sugar in the sugar-bowl. Ustiushka was\ntelling them there about the hussars.\n\n"O my dear young lady, what a handsome man he is! that count!" she said,\n"absolutely a little cherubim,[77] with black eyebrows. You ought to have\nsuch a husband as that; what a lovely little couple you would make!" The\nother maids smiled approvingly; the old nurse, sitting by the window with\nher stocking, sighed, and, drawing a long breath, murmured a prayer.\n\n[Footnote 77: _kherubimchik._]\n\n"It seems to me that the hussars have given you a great deal of pleasure,"\nsaid Liza. "You are a master hand at description. Bring me the _mors_,[78]\nUstiushka, please; we must give the officers something sour to drink." And\nLiza, laughing, went out with the sugar-bowl.\n\n[Footnote 78: A sour beverage made of cranberries.]\n\n"But I should like to see what sort of a man this hussar is,--whether he is\nbrunet or blondin. And I imagine he would not object to making our\nacquaintance. But he will go away, and never know that I was here and was\nthinking about him. And how many have passed by me in this way! No one ever\nsees me except uncle and Ustiushka! How many times I have arranged my hair,\nhow many pairs of cuffs I have put on, and yet no one ever sees me or falls\nin love with me," she thought with a sigh, contemplating her white, plump\nhand.\n\n"He must be tall, and have big eyes, and a nice little black mustache....\nNo! I am already over twenty-two, and no one has ever fallen in love with\nme except the pock-marked Ivan Ipatuitch. And four years ago I was still\nbetter-looking; and so my girlhood has gone, and no one is the better for\nit. Ah! I am an unhappy country maiden!"\n\nHer mother\'s voice, calling her to bring the tea, aroused the country\nmaiden from this momentary revery.\n\nShe shook her little head, and went into the tea-room.\n\nThe best things always happen unexpectedly; and the more you try to force\nthem, the worse they come out. In the country it is rare that any attempt\nis made to impart education, and therefore when a good one is found it is\ngenerally a surprise. And thus it happened, in a notable degree, in the\ncase of Liza. Anna Fedorovna, through her own lack of intelligence and\nnatural laziness, had not given Liza any education at all; had not taught\nher music, nor the French language which is so indispensable. But the girl\nhad fortunately been a healthy, bright little child: she had intrusted her\nto a wet-nurse and a day-nurse; she had fed her, and dressed her in print\ndresses and goat-skin shoes, and let her run wild and gather mushrooms and\nberries; had her taught reading and arithmetic by a resident seminarist.\nAnd thus, as fate would have it, at the age of sixteen, she found in her\ndaughter a companion, a soul who was always cheerful and good-natured, and\nthe actual mistress of the house.\n\nThrough her goodness of heart, Anna Fedorovna always had in her house some\n_protegee_, either a serf or some foundling. Liza, from the time she was\nten years old, had begun to take care of them; to teach them, clothe them,\ntake them to church, and keep them still when they were inclined to be\nmischievous.\n\nThen her old broken-down but good-natured uncle made his appearance, and he\nhad to be taken care of like a child. Then the domestic servants and the\npeasants began to come to the young mistress with their desires and their\nailments; and she treated them with elderberry, mint, and spirits of\ncamphor. Then the domestic management of the house fell into her hands\nentirely. Then came the unsatisfied craving for love, which found\nexpression only in nature and religion.\n\nThus Liza, by chance, grew into an active, good-naturedly cheerful,\nself-poised, pure, and deeply religious young woman.\n\nTo be sure, she had her little fits of jealousy and envy when she saw, all\naround her in church, her neighbors dressed in new, fashionable hats that\ncame from K.; she was sometimes vexed to tears by her old, irritable\nmother, and her caprices; she had her dreams of love in the most absurd and\neven the crudest forms, but her healthy activity, which she could not\nshirk, drove them away; and now, at twenty-two, not a single spot, not a\nsingle compunction, had touched the fresh, calm soul of this maiden, now\ndeveloped into the fulness of perfect physical and moral beauty.\n\nLiza was of medium height, rather plump than lean; her eyes were brown,\nsmall, with a soft dark shade on the lower lid; she wore her flaxen hair in\na long braid.\n\nIn walking she took long steps, and swayed like a duck, as the saying is.\n\nThe expression of her face, when she was occupied with her duties, and\nnothing especially disturbed her, seemed to say to all who looked into it,\n"Life in this world is good and pleasant to one who has a heart full of\nlove, and a pure conscience."\n\nEven in moments of vexation, of trouble, of unrest, or of melancholy, in\nspite of her tears, of the drawing-down of the left brow, of the compressed\nlips, of the petulance of her desires, even then in the dimples of her\ncheeks, in the corners of her mouth, and in her brilliant eyes, so used to\nsmile and rejoice in life,--even then there shone a heart good and upright,\nand unspoiled by knowledge.\n\n\nX.\n\nIt was still rather warm, though the sun was already set, when the\nbattalion arrived at Morozovka. In front of them, along the dusty village\nstreet, trotted a brindled cow, separated from the herd, bellowing, and\noccasionally stopping to look round, and never once perceiving that all she\nhad to do was to turn out and let the battalion pass.\n\nPeasants, old men, women, children, and domestic serfs, crowding both sides\nof the road, gazed curiously at the hussars.\n\nThrough a thick cloud of dust the hussars rode along on raven-black horses,\ncurvetting and occasionally snorting.\n\nAt the right of the battalion, gracefully mounted on beautiful black\nsteeds, rode two officers. One was the commander, Count Turbin; the other a\nvery young man, who had recently been promoted from the yunkers; his name\nwas Polozof.\n\nA hussar, in a white kittel, came from the best of the cottages, and,\ntaking off his cap, approached the officers.\n\n"What quarters have been assigned to us?" asked the count.\n\n"For your excellency?" replied the quartermaster, his whole body\nshuddering. "Here at the _starosta\'s_; he has put his cottage in order. I\ntried to get a room at the mansion,[79] but they said no; the proprietress\nis so ill-tempered."\n\n[Footnote 79: _barsky dvor._]\n\n"Well, all right," said the count, dismounting and stretching his legs as\nhe reached the _starosta\'s_ cottage. "Tell me, has my carriage come?"\n\n"It has deigned to arrive, your excellency," replied the quartermaster,\nindicating with his cap the leathern carriage-top which was to be seen\ninside the gate, and then hastening ahead into the entry of the cottage,\nwhich was crowded with the family of serfs, gathered to have a look at the\nofficer.\n\nHe even tripped over an old woman, as he hastily opened the door of the\nneatly cleaned cottage, and stood aside to let the count pass.\n\nThe cottage was large and commodious, but not perfectly clean. The German\nbody-servant,[80] dressed like a barin, was standing in the cottage, and,\nhaving just finished setting up the iron bed, was taking out clean linen\nfrom a trunk.\n\n[Footnote 80: _kammerdiener._]\n\n"_Phu!_ what a nasty lodging!" exclaimed the count in vexation. "Diadenko!\nIs it impossible to find me better quarters at the proprietor\'s or\nsomewhere?"\n\n"If your excellency command, I will go up to the mansion," replied\nDiadenko; "but the house is small and wretched, and seems not much better\nthan the cottage."\n\n"Well, that\'s all now. You can go."\n\nAnd the count threw himself down on the bed, supporting his head with his\nhands.\n\n"Johann!" he cried to his body-servant; "again you have made a hump in the\nmiddle. Why can\'t you learn to make a bed decently?"\n\nJohann was anxious to make it over again.\n\n"No, you need not trouble about it now!... Where\'s my dressing-gown?" he\nproceeded to ask in a petulant voice. The servant gave him the\ndressing-gown.\n\nThe count, before he put it on, examined the skirt. "There it is! You have\nnot taken that spot out! Could it be possible for any one to be a worse\nservant than you are?" he added, snatching the garment from the servant\'s\nhands, and putting it on. "Now tell me, do you do this way on purpose? Is\ntea ready?"\n\n"I haven\'t had time to make it," replied Johann.\n\n"Fool!"\n\nAfter this, the count took a French novel which was at hand, and read for\nsome time without speaking; but Johann went out into the entry to blow up\nthe coals in the samovar.\n\nIt was plain to see that the count was in a bad humor; it must have been\nowing to weariness, to the dust on his face, to his tightly-fitting\nclothes, and to his empty stomach. "Johann!" he cried again, "give me an\naccount of those ten rubles. What did you get in town?"\n\nThe count looked over the account which the servant handed him, and made\nsome dissatisfied remarks about the high prices paid.\n\n"Give me the rum for the tea."\n\n"I did not get any rum," said Johann.\n\n"Delightful! How many times have I told you always to have rum?"\n\n"I didn\'t have money enough."\n\n"Why didn\'t Polozof buy it? You might have got some from his man."\n\n"The cornet Polozof? I do not know. He bought tea and sugar."\n\n"Beast! Get you gone. You are the only man who has the power to exhaust my\npatience! You know that I always take rum in my tea when I am on the\nmarch."\n\n"Here are two letters one of the staff brought for you," said the\nbody-servant.\n\nThe count, as he lay on the bed, tore open the letters, and began to read\nthem. At this moment the cornet came in with gay countenance, having\nquartered the battalion.\n\n"Well, how is it, Turbin? It\'s first-rate here, seems to me. I am tired\nout, I confess it. It has been a warm day."\n\n"First-rate! I should think so! A dirty, stinking hut! and no rum, thanks\nto you. Your stupid did not buy any, nor this one either. You might have\nsaid something anyway!"\n\nAnd he went on with his reading. After he had read the letter through, he\ncrumpled it up, and threw it on the floor.\n\n"_Why_ didn\'t you buy some rum?" the cornet in a whisper demanded of his\nservant in the entry. "Didn\'t you have any money?"\n\n"Well, why should we be always the ones to spend the money? I have enough\nto spend for without that, and _his_ German does nothing but smoke his\npipe,--that\'s all."\n\nThe second letter was evidently not disagreeable, because the count smiled\nas he read it.\n\n"Who\'s that from?" asked Polozof, returning to the room, and trying to\narrange for himself a couch on the floor, near the oven.\n\n"From Mina," replied the count gayly, handing him the letter. "Would you\nlike to read it? What a lovely woman she is! Now, she\'s better than our\nyoung ladies, that\'s a fact. Just see what feeling and what wit in that\nletter! There\'s only one thing that I don\'t like,--she asks me for money!"\n\n"No, that\'s not pleasant," replied the cornet.\n\n"Well it\'s true I promised to give her some; but this expedition--And\nbesides, if I am commander of the battalion, at the end of three months I\nwill send some to her. I should not regret it; she\'s really a lovely woman.\nIsn\'t she?" he asked with a smile, following with his eyes Polozof\'s\nexpression as he read the letter.\n\n"Horribly misspelled, but sweet; it seems to me she really loves you,"\nreplied the cornet.\n\n"Hm! I should think so! Only these women truly love when they do love."\n\n"But who was that other letter from?" asked the cornet, pointing to the one\nwhich he had read.\n\n"That? Oh, that\'s from a certain man, very ugly, to whom I owe a gambling\ndebt, and this is the third time that he has reminded me of it. I can\'t pay\nit to him now. It\'s a stupid letter," replied the count, evidently nettled\nby the recollection of it.\n\nThe two officers remained silent for some little time. The cornet, who, it\nseemed, had come under Turbin\'s influence, drank his tea without speaking,\nthough he occasionally cast a glance at the clouded face of the handsome\ncount, who gazed steadily out of the window. He did not venture to renew\nthe conversation.\n\n"Well, then, I think it can be accomplished without difficulty," suddenly\nexclaimed the count, turning to Polozof, and gayly nodding his head. "If we\nwho are in the line get promoted this year, yes, and if we take part in\nsome engagement, then I can overtake my former captains of the guard."\n\nThey were drinking their second cup of tea, and the conversation was still\ndwelling on this theme, when the old Danilo came with the message from Anna\nFedorovna.\n\n"And she would also like to know whether you are not pleased to be the son\nof Feodor Ivanovitch Turbin," he added, on his own responsibility, as he\nhad found out the officer\'s name, and still remembered the late count\'s\nvisit to the city of K. "Our mistress,[81] Anna Fedorovna, used to be very\nwell acquainted with him."\n\n[Footnote 81: _baruinya._]\n\n"He was my father. Now tell the lady that I am very much obliged, but that\nI need nothing; only, if it would not be possible to give me a cleaner room\nin the mansion, say, or somewhere."\n\n"Now, why did you do that?" asked Polozof after Danilo had gone. "Isn\'t it\njust the same thing? For one night isn\'t it just as well here? And it will\nput them to inconvenience."\n\n"There it is again! It seems to me we have had enough of being sent round\namong these smoky hovels.[82] It\'s easy enough to see that you are not a\npractical man. Why shouldn\'t we seize the opportunity, when we can, of\nsleeping, even if it\'s for only one night, like decent men? And they,\ncontrary to what you think, will be mighty glad. There\'s only one thing\nobjectionable. If this lady used to know my father," continued the count,\nwith a smile that discovered his white gleaming teeth,--"somehow I always\nfeel a little ashamed of my late papasha; there\'s always some scandalous\nstory, or some debt or other. And so I can\'t endure to meet any of my\nfather\'s acquaintances. However, that was an entirely different age," he\nadded seriously.\n\n[Footnote 82: _kurnaya izba_, a peasant\'s hut without chimney.]\n\n"Oh! I did not tell you," rejoined Polozof. "I recently met Ilyin, the\nbrigade commander of uhlans. He is very anxious to see you; he is\npassionately fond of your father."\n\n"I think that he is terrible trash, that Ilyin. But the worst is that all\nthese gentlemen who imagine that they knew my father in order to make\nfriends with me, insist upon telling me, as though it were very pleasant\nfor me to hear, about escapades of his that make me blush. It is true I am\nnot impulsive, and I look upon things dispassionately; while he was too\nhot-spirited a man, and sometimes he played exceedingly reprehensible\ntricks. However, that was all due to his time. In our day and generation,\nmaybe, he would have been a very sensible man, for he had tremendous\nabilities; one must give him credit for that."\n\nIn a quarter of an hour the servant returned, and brought an invitation for\nthem to come and spend the night at the mansion.\n\n\nXI.\n\nAs soon as Anna Fedorovna learned that the officer of hussars was the son\nof Count Feodor Turbin, she was thrown into a great state of excitement.\n\n"Oh! great heavens![83] he is my darling! Danilo! run, hurry, tell them the\nlady invites them to stay at her house," she cried, in great agitation, and\nhastening to the servants\' room. "Lizanka! Ustiushka! You must have your\nroom put in order, Liza. You can go into your uncle\'s room; and you,\nbrother,--brother, you can sleep to-night in the parlor. It\'s for only one\nnight."\n\n[Footnote 83: _batiuzhki moi!_]\n\n"That\'s nothing, sister! I would sleep on the floor."\n\n"He must be a handsome fellow, I think, if he\'s like his father. Only let\nme see him, the turtle-dove! You shall see for yourself, Liza. Ah! his\nfather was handsome! Where shall we put the table? Let it go there," said\nAnna Fedorovna, running about here and there. "There now, bring in two\nbeds; get one from the overseer, and get from the _etagere_ the glass\ncandlestick which my brother gave me for my birthday, and put in a wax\ncandle."\n\nAt last all was ready. Liza, in spite of her mother\'s interference,\narranged her room in her own way for the two officers.\n\nShe brought out clean linen sheets, fragrant of mignonnette, and had the\nbeds made; she ordered a carafe of water and candles near it on the little\ntable. She burned scented paper in the girls\' room, and moved her own\nlittle bed into her uncle\'s chamber.\n\nAnna Fedorovna gradually became calm, and sat down again in her usual\nplace; she even took out her cards; but instead of shuffling them, she\nleaned on her fat elbow, and gave herself up to her thoughts.\n\n"How time has gone! how time has gone!" she exclaimed in a whisper. "It is\nlong! long! isn\'t it? I seem to see him now! _Akh!_ he was a scamp!"\n\nAnd the tears came into her eyes. "Now here is Lizanka, but she isn\'t at\nall what I was at her age. She is a nice girl; but no, not quite....\n\n"Lizanka, you had better wear your mousselin-de-laine dress this evening."\n\n"But are you going to invite them down-stairs, mamasha? You had better not\ndo it," rejoined Liza, with a feeling of invincible agitation at the\nthought of seeing the officers. "You had better not, mamasha!"\n\nIn point of fact, she did not so much desire to see them, as she felt\napprehensive of some painful pleasure awaiting her, as it seemed to her.\n\n"Perhaps they themselves would like to make our acquaintance, Lizotchka,"\nsaid Anna Fedorovna, glancing at her daughter\'s hair, and at the same time\nthinking, "No, not such hair as I had at her age. No, Lizotchka, how much I\ncould wish for you!" And she really wished something very excellent for her\ndaughter, but she could scarcely look forward to a match with the count;\nshe could not desire such a relationship as she herself had formed with his\nfather; but that something good would come of it, she wished very, very\nmuch for her daughter. She possibly had the desire to live over again in\nher daughter\'s happiness all the life which she lived with the late count.\n\nThe old cavalryman was also somewhat excited by the count\'s coming. He went\nto his room, and shut himself up in it. At the end of a quarter of an hour,\nhe re-appeared dressed in a Hungarian coat and blue pantaloons; and with a\ntroubled-happy expression of countenance, such as a girl wears when she\nputs on her first ball-dress, he started for the room assigned to the\nguests.\n\n"We shall have a glimpse of some of the hussars of to-day, sister. The late\ncount was indeed a genuine hussar. We shall see! we shall see!"\n\nThe officers had by this time come in by the back entrance, and were in the\nroom that had been put at their service.\n\n"There now," said the count, stretching himself out in his dusty boots on\nthe bed which had just been made for him, "if we aren\'t better off here\nthan we were there in that hovel with the cockroaches!"\n\n"Better? of course; but think what obligations we are putting ourselves\nunder to the people here."\n\n"What rubbish! You must always be a practical man. They are mighty glad to\nhave us, of course. Fellow!" cried the count, "ask some one to put a\ncurtain up at this window, else there\'ll be a draught in the night."\n\nAt this moment the old man came in to make the acquaintance of the\nofficers. Though he was somewhat confused, he did not fail to tell how he\nhad been a comrade of the late count\'s, who had been very congenial to him,\nand he even went so far as to say that more than once he had been under\nobligations to the late count. Whether he meant, in speaking of the\nobligations to the late count, a reference to the hundred rubles which the\ncount had borrowed and never returned, or to his throwing him into the\nsnow-drift, or to the slap in the face, the old man failed to explain.\n\nHowever, the count was very urbane with the old cavalryman, and thanked him\nfor his hospitality.\n\n"You must excuse us if it is not very luxurious, count,"--he almost said\n"your excellency," as he had got out of the habit of meeting with men of\nrank. "My sister\'s house is rather small. As for the window here, we will\nfind something to serve as a curtain right away, and it will be\nfirst-rate," added the little old man; and under the pretext of going for a\ncurtain, but really because he wanted to give his report about the officers\nas quickly as possible, he left the room. The pretty little Ustiushka came,\nbringing her mistress\'s shawl to serve as a curtain. She was also\ncommissioned to ask if the gentlemen would not like some tea.\n\nThe cheerful hospitality had had a manifestly beneficent influence upon the\ncount\'s spirits. He laughed and jested with Ustiushka gayly, and went to\nsuch lengths that she even called him a bad man; he asked her if her\nmistress was pretty, and in reply to her question whether he would like\nsome tea, replied that she might please bring him some, but above all, as\nhis supper was not ready, he would like some vodka now, and a little lunch,\nand some sherry if there was any.\n\nThe old uncle was in raptures over the young count\'s politeness, and\npraised to the skies the young generation of officers, saying that the men\nof the present day were far preferable to those of the past.\n\nAnna Fedorovna could not agree to that,--no one could be any better than\nCount Feodor Ivanovitch,--and she was beginning to grow seriously angry,\nand remarked dryly, "For you, brother, the one who flatters you last is the\nbest! Without any question, the men of our time are better educated, but\nstill Feodor Ivanovitch could dance the schottische, and was so amiable\nthat everybody in his day, you might say, was stupid compared to him! only\nhe did not care for any one else beside me. Oh, certainly there were fine\nmen in the old time!"\n\nAt this moment came the message requesting the vodka, the lunch, and the\nsherry.\n\n"There now, just like you, brother! You never do things right. We ought to\nhave had supper prepared.... Liza, attend to it, that\'s my darling."\n\nLiza hastened to the storeroom for mushrooms and fresh cream butter, and\ntold the cook to prepare beef cutlets.\n\n"How much sherry is there? Haven\'t you any left, brother?"\n\n"No, sister; I never have had any."\n\n"What! no sherry? but what is it you drink in your tea?"\n\n"That is rum, Anna Fedorovna."\n\n"Isn\'t that the same thing? Give them some of that. It is all the same,\nit\'ll make no difference. Or would it not be better to invite them down\nhere, brother? You know all about it. They would not be offended, I\nimagine, would they?"\n\nThe cavalryman assured her that he would answer for it that the count, in\nhis goodness of heart, would not decline, and that he would certainly bring\nthem.\n\nAnna Fedorovna went off to put on, for some reason or other, her gros-grain\ndress and a new cap; but Liza was so busy that she had no time to take off\nher pink gingham dress with wide sleeves. Moreover, she was terribly\nwrought up; it seemed to her that something astonishing, like a very low\nblack cloud, was sweeping down upon her soul.\n\nThis count-hussar, this handsome fellow, seemed to her an absolutely novel\nand unexpected but beautiful creature. His character, his habits, his\nwords, it seemed to her, must be something extraordinary, such as had never\ncome into the range of her experience. All that he thought and said must be\nbright and true; all that he did must be honorable; his whole appearance\nmust be beautiful. She could have no doubt of that. If he had demanded not\nmerely a lunch and sherry, but even a bath in spirits of salvia, she would\nnot have been surprised, she would not have blamed him, and she would have\nbeen convinced that this was just and reasonable.\n\nThe count immediately accepted when the cavalryman brought him his sister\'s\ninvitation; he combed his hair, put on his coat, and took his cigar-case.\n\n"Will you come?" he asked of Polozof.\n\n"Indeed we had better not go," replied the cornet; "_ils feront des frais\npour nous recevoir_."\n\n"Rubbish! it will make them happy. Besides, I have been making\ninquiries ... there\'s a pretty daughter here.... Come along," said the\ncount in French.\n\n"_Je vous en prie, messieurs_," said the cavalryman, merely for the sake of\ngiving them to understand that he also could speak French, and understood\nwhat the officers were saying.\n\n\nXII.\n\nLiza, red in the face and with downcast eyes, was ostensibly occupied with\nfilling up the teapot, and did not dare to look at the officers as they\nentered the room.\n\nAnna Fedorovna, on the contrary, briskly jumped up and bowed, and without\ntaking her eyes from the count\'s face began to talk to him, now finding an\nextraordinary resemblance to his father, now presenting her daughter, now\noffering him tea, meats, or jelly-cakes.\n\nNo one paid any attention to the cornet, thanks to his modest behavior; and\nhe was very glad of it, because it gave him a chance, within the limits of\npropriety, to observe and study the details of Liza\'s beauty, which had\nevidently come over him with the force of a surprise.\n\nThe uncle listening to his sister\'s conversation had a speech ready on his\nlips, and was waiting for a chance to relate his cavalry experiences.\n\nThe count smoked his cigar over his tea, so that Liza had great difficulty\nin refraining from coughing, but he was very talkative and amiable; at\nfirst, in the infrequent pauses of Anna Fedorovna\'s conversation, he\nintroduced his own stories, and finally he took the conversation into his\nown hands.\n\nOne thing struck his listeners as rather strange: in his talk he often used\nwords, which, though not considered reprehensible in his own set, were\nhere rather audacious, so that Anna Fedorovna was a little abashed, and\nLiza blushed to the roots of her hair. But this the count did not notice,\nand continued to be just as natural and amiable as ever.\n\nLiza filled the glasses in silence, not putting them into the hands of the\nguests, but pushing them toward them; she had not entirely recovered from\nher agitation, but listened eagerly to the count\'s anecdotes.\n\nThe count\'s pointless tales, and the pauses in the conversation, gradually\nre-assured her. The bright things that she had expected from him were not\nforthcoming, nor did she find in him that surpassing elegance for which she\nhad confusedly hoped. Even as soon as the third glass of tea, when her\ntimid eyes once encountered his, and he did not avoid them, but continued\nalmost too boldly to stare at her, with a lurking smile, she became\nconscious of a certain feeling of hostility against him; and she soon\ndiscovered that there was not only nothing out of the ordinary in him, but\nthat he was very little different from those whom she had already seen; in\nfact, that there was no reason to be afraid of him. She noticed that he had\nlong and neat finger-nails, but otherwise there was no mark of special\nbeauty about him.\n\nLiza suddenly, not without some inward sorrow, renouncing her dream,\nregained her self-possession; and only the undemonstrative cornet\'s glance,\nwhich she felt fixed upon her, disquieted her.\n\n"Perhaps it is not the count, but the other," she said to herself.\n\n\nXIII.\n\nAfter tea, the old lady invited her guests into the other room, and again\nsat down in her usual place. "But perhaps you would like to rest, count?"\nshe asked. "Well, then, what would you like to amuse yourselves with, my\ndear guests?" she proceeded to ask after she had been assured to the\ncontrary. "You play cards, do you not, count?--Here, brother, you might\ntake a hand in some game or other."...\n\n"Why, you yourself can play _preference_," replied the cavalryman. "You had\nbetter take a hand, then. The count will play, will he not? And you?"\n\nThe officers were agreeable to every thing that might satisfy their amiable\nhosts.\n\nLiza brought from her room her old cards which she used for divining\nwhether her mother would speedily recover of a cold, or whether her uncle\nwould return on such and such a day from the city if he chanced to have\ngone there, or whether her neighbor would be in during the day, and other\nlike things. These cards, though they had been in use for two months, were\nless soiled than those which Anna Fedorovna used for the same purpose.\n\n"Perhaps you are not accustomed to playing for small stakes," suggested the\nuncle. "Anna Fedorovna and I play for half-kopeks, and then she always gets\nthe better of all of us."\n\n"Ah! make your own arrangements. I shall be perfectly satisfied," said the\ncount.\n\n"Well, then, be it in paper kopeks for the sake of our dear guests; only\nlet me gain, as I am old," said Anna Fedorovna, settling herself in her\nchair, and adjusting her mantilla. "Maybe I shall win a ruble of them,"\nthought Anna Fedorovna, who in her old age felt a little passion for cards.\n\n"If you would like, I will teach you to play with tablets," said the count,\n"and with the _miseries_. It is very jolly."\n\nEverybody was delighted with this new Petersburg fashion. The uncle went so\nfar as to assert that he knew it, and that it was just the same thing as\n_boston_, but that he had forgotten somewhat about it.\n\nAnna Fedorovna did not comprehend it at all; and it took her so long to get\ninto it, that she felt under the necessity of smiling and nodding her head\nassuringly, to give the impression that she now understood, and that now it\nwas all perfectly clear to her. But there was no little amusement created\nwhen in the midst of the game Anna Fedorovna, with ace and king blank,\ncalled "_miserie_," and remained with the six. She even began to grow\nconfused, smiled timidly, and hastened to assure them that she had not as\nyet become accustomed to the new way.\n\nNevertheless they put down the points against her, and many of them too;\nthe more because the count, through his practice of playing on large\nstakes, played carefully, led very prudently, and never at all understood\nwhat the cornet meant by sundry raps with his foot under the table, or why\nhe made such stupid blunders in playing.\n\nLiza brought in more jelly-cakes, three kinds of preserves, and apples\ncooked in some manner with port-wine; and then, standing behind her\nmother\'s chair, she looked on at the game, and occasionally watched the\nofficers, and especially the count\'s white hands with their delicate long\nfinger-nails, as he with such skill, assurance, and grace, threw the cards,\nand took the tricks.\n\nOnce more Anna Fedorovna, with some show of temper going beyond the others,\nbid as high as seven, and lost three points; and when, at her brother\'s\ninstigation, she tried to make some calculation, she found herself utterly\nconfused and off the track.\n\n"It\'s nothing, mamasha; you\'ll win it back again," said Liza, with a smile,\nanxious to rescue her mother from her ridiculous position. "Some time\nyou\'ll put a fine on uncle: then he will be caught."\n\n"But you might help me, Lizotchka," cried Anna Fedorovna, looking with an\nexpression of dismay at her daughter; "I don\'t know how this"....\n\n"But I don\'t know how to play this either," rejoined Liza, carefully\ncalculating her mother\'s losses. "But if you go on at this rate, mamasha,\nyou will lose a good deal, and Pimotchka will not have her new dress," she\nadded in jest.\n\n"Yes, in this way it is quite possible to lose ten silver rubles," said the\ncornet, looking at Liza, and anxious to draw her into conversation.\n\n"Aren\'t we playing for paper money?" asked Anna Fedorovna, gazing round at\nthe rest.\n\n"I don\'t know, I am sure," replied the count. "But I don\'t know how to\nreckon in bank-notes. What are they? what do you mean by bank-notes?"[84]\n\n[Footnote 84: _Assignatsii._]\n\n"Why, no one nowadays reckons in bank-notes," explained the cavalryman, who\nwas playing like a hero and was on the winning side.\n\nThe old lady ordered some sparkling wine, drank two glasses herself, grew\nquite flushed, and seemed to abandon all hope. One braid of her gray hair\nescaped from under her cap, and she did not even put it up. It was evident\nthat she thought herself losing millions, and that she was entirely ruined.\nThe cornet kept nudging the count\'s leg more and more emphatically. The\ncount was noting down the old lady\'s losses.\n\nAt last the game came to an end. In spite of Anna Fedorovna\'s efforts to\nbring her reckoning higher than it should be, and to pretend that she had\nbeen cheated in her account, and that it could not be correct, in spite of\nher dismay at the magnitude of her losses, at last the account was made\nout, and she was found to have lost nine hundred and twenty points.\n\n"Isn\'t that equal to nine paper rubles?" she asked again and again; and she\ndid not begin to realize how great her forfeit was, until her brother, to\nher horror, explained that she was "out" thirty-two and a half paper\nrubles, and that it was absolutely necessary for her to pay it.\n\nThe count did not even sum up his gains, but, as soon as the game was over,\narose and went over to the window where Liza was arranging the lunch, and\nputting potted mushrooms on a plate. There he did with perfect calmness and\nnaturalness what the cornet had been anxious and yet unable to effect all\nthe evening,--he engaged her in conversation about the weather.\n\nThe cornet at this time was brought into a thoroughly unpleasant\npredicament. Anna Fedorovna, in the absence of the count and Liza, who had\nmanaged to keep her in a jovial frame of mind, became really angry.\n\n"Indeed, it is too bad that we have caused you to lose so heavily," said\nPolozof, in order to say something. "It is simply shameful."\n\n"I should think these tablets and _miseries_ were something of your own\ninvention. I don\'t know any thing about them. How many paper rubles does\nthe whole amount to?" she demanded.\n\n"Thirty-two rubles, thirty-two and a half," insisted the cavalryman, who,\nfrom the effect of having been on the winning side, was in a very waggish\nframe of mind. "Give him the money, sister.... Give it to him."\n\n"I will give all I owe, only you must not ask for any more. No, I shall\nnever win it back in my life."\n\nAnd Anna Fedorovna went to her room, all in excitement, hurried back, and\nbrought nine paper rubles. Only on the old man\'s strenuous insistence she\nwas induced to pay the whole sum. Polozof had some fear that the old lady\nwould pour out on him the vials of her wrath if he entered into\nconversation with her. He silently, without attracting attention, turned\naway, and rejoined the count and Liza, who were talking at the open window.\n\nOn the table, which was now spread for the supper, stood two tallow\ncandles, whose flame occasionally flickered in the gentle breeze of the\nmild May night. Through the window opening into the garden came a very\ndifferent light from that which filled the room. The moon, almost at its\nfull, already beginning to lose its golden radiance, was pouring over the\ntops of the lofty lindens, and making brighter and brighter the delicate\nfleecy clouds that occasionally overcast it.\n\nFrom the pond, the surface of which, silvered in one place by the moon,\ncould be seen through the trees, came the voices of the frogs. In the\nsweet-scented lilac-bush under the very window, which from time to time\nslowly shook its heavy-laden blossoms, birds were darting and fluttering.\n\n"What marvellous weather!" said the count, as he joined Liza, and sat down\nin the low window-seat. "I suppose you go to walk a good deal, don\'t you?"\n\n"Yes," rejoined Liza, not experiencing the slightest embarrassment in the\ncount\'s company. "Every morning, at seven o\'clock, I make the tour of the\nestate, and sometimes I take a walk with Pimotchka,--mamma\'s _protegee_."\n\n"It\'s pleasant living in the country," cried the count, putting his monocle\nto his eye, and gazing first at the garden, and then at Liza. "But don\'t\nyou like to take a walk on moonlight nights?"\n\n"No. Three years ago my uncle and I used to go out walking every moonlight\nnight. He had some sort of strange illness,--insomnia. Whenever there was a\nfull moon, he could not sleep. His room like this opens into the garden,\nand the window is low. The moon shines right into it."\n\n"Strange," remarked the count. "Then this is your room."\n\n"No, I only sleep there for this one night. You occupy my room."\n\n"Is it possible? ... oh, good heavens![85] I shall never in the world\nforgive myself for the trouble that I have caused," said the count, casting\nthe monocle from his eye as a sign of sincerity.... "If I had only known\nthat I was going to"....\n\n[Footnote 85: _Akh! Bozhe moi!_]\n\n"How much trouble was it? On the contrary, I am very glad. My uncle\'s room\nis so nice and jolly: there\'s a low window there. I shall sit down in it\nbefore I go to bed, or perhaps I shall go down, out into the garden, and\ntake a little walk."\n\n"What a glorious girl!" said the count to himself, replacing the monocle,\nand staring at her, and while pretending to change his seat in the window,\ntrying to touch her foot with his. "And how shrewdly she gave me to\nunderstand that I might meet her in the garden at the window, if I would\ncome down!"\n\nLiza even lost in the count\'s eyes a large share of her charm, so easy did\nthe conquest of her seem to him.\n\n"And how blissful it must be," said the count dreamily, gazing into the\nshadow-haunted alley, "to spend such a night in the garden with the object\nof one\'s love!"\n\nLiza was somewhat abashed by these words, and by a second evidently\ndeliberate pressure upon her foot. Before she thought, she made some reply\nfor the sake of dissimulating her embarrassment.\n\nShe said, "Yes, it is splendid to walk in the moonlight."\n\nThere was something disagreeable about the whole conversation. She put the\ncover on the jar from which she had been taking the mushrooms, and was just\nturning from the window, when the cornet came toward her, and she felt a\ncuriosity to know what kind of a man he was.\n\n"What a lovely night!" said he.\n\n"They can only talk about the weather," thought Liza.\n\n"What a wonderful view!" continued the cornet, "only I should think it\nwould be tiresome," he added through a strange propensity, peculiar to him,\nof saying things sure to offend the people who pleased him very much.\n\n"Why should you think so? Always the same cooking and always the same dress\nmight become tiresome; but a lovely garden can never be tiresome when you\nenjoy walking, and especially when there\'s a moon rising higher and higher.\nFrom my uncle\'s room you can see the whole pond. I shall see it from there\nto-night."\n\n"And you haven\'t any nightingales at all, have you?" asked the count,\ngreatly put out, because Polozof had come and prevented him from learning\nthe exact conditions of the rendezvous.\n\n"Oh, yes, we always have them; last year the hunters caught one; and last\nweek there was one that sang beautifully, but the district inspector[86]\ncame along with his bells, and scared him away.... Three years ago my uncle\nand I used to sit out in the covered alley, and listen to one for two hours\nat a time."\n\n[Footnote 86: _stanovoi._]\n\n"What is this chatterbox telling you about?" inquired the old uncle,\njoining the trio. "Aren\'t you ready for something to eat?"\n\nAt supper, the count by his reiterated praise of the viands, and his\nappetite, succeeded somewhat in pacifying Anna Fedorovna\'s unhappy state of\nmind. Afterwards the officers made their adieux, and went to their room.\nThe count shook hands with the old cavalier, and, to Anna Fedorovna\'s\nsurprise, with her, without offering to kiss her hand; and he also squeezed\nLiza\'s hand, at the same time looking straight into her eyes, and craftily\nsmiling his pleasing smile. This glance again somewhat disconcerted the\nmaiden. "He is very handsome," she said to herself, "only he is quite too\nconceited."\n\n\nXIV.\n\n"Well, now, aren\'t you ashamed?" exclaimed Polozof, when the two officers\nhad reached the privacy of their chamber. "I tried to lose, and I kept\nnudging you under the table. Now aren\'t you really ashamed? The poor old\nlady was quite beside herself."\n\nThe count burst into a terrible fit of laughter.\n\n"A most amusing dame! How abused she felt!"\n\nAnd again he began to laugh so heartily that even Johann, who was standing\nin front of him, cast down his eyes to conceal a smile. "And here is the\nson of an old family friend! Ha, ha, ha!" continued the count in a gale of\nlaughter.\n\n"No, indeed, it is not right. I felt really sorry for her," said the\ncornet.\n\n"What rubbish! How young you are! What! did you think that I was going to\nlose? Why should I lose? I only lose when I don\'t know any better. Ten\nrubles, brother, will come in handy. You must look on life in a practical\nway, or else you will always be a fool."\n\nPolozof made no answer: in the first place, he wanted to think by himself\nabout Liza, who seemed to him to be an extraordinarily pure and beautiful\ncreature.\n\nHe undressed, and lay down on the clean soft bed which had been made ready\nfor him.\n\n"How absurd all these honors and the glory of war!" he thought to himself,\ngazing at the window shaded by the shawl, through the interstices of which\ncrept the pale rays of the moon. "Here is happiness--to live in a quiet\nnook, with a gentle, bright, simple-hearted wife; that is enduring, true\nhappiness."\n\nBut somehow he did not communicate these imaginations to his friend; and he\ndid not even speak of the rustic maiden, though he felt sure that the count\nwas also thinking about her.\n\n"Why don\'t you undress?" he demanded of the count, who was walking up and\ndown the room.\n\n"Oh, I don\'t feel like sleeping! Put out the candle if you like," said he.\n"I can undress in the dark."\n\nAnd he continued to walk up and down.\n\n"He does not feel sleepy," repeated Polozof, who after the evening\'s\nexperiences felt more than ever dissatisfied with the count\'s influence\nupon him, and disposed to revolt against it. "I imagine," he reasoned,\nmentally addressing Turbin, "what thoughts are now trooping through that\nwell-combed head of yours. And I saw how she pleased you. But you are not\nthe kind to appreciate that simple-hearted, pure-minded creature. Mina is\nthe one for you, you want the epaulets of a colonel.--Indeed, I have a mind\nto ask him how he liked her."\n\nAnd Polozof was about to address him, but he deliberated: he felt that not\nonly he was not in the right frame of mind to discuss with him if the\ncount\'s glance at Liza was what he interpreted it to be, but that he should\nnot have the force of mind necessary for him to disagree with him, so\naccustomed was he to submit to an influence which for him grew each day\nmore burdensome and unrighteous.\n\n"Where are you going?" he asked, as the count took his cap and went to the\ndoor.\n\n"I am going to the stable; I wish to see if every thing is all right."\n\n"Strange!" thought the cornet; but he blew out the candle, and, trying to\ndispel the absurdly jealous and hostile thoughts that arose against his\nformer friend, he turned over on the other side.\n\nAnna Fedorovna meantime, having crossed herself, and kissed her brother,\nher daughter, and her _protegee_, as affectionately as usual, also retired\nto her room.\n\nLong had it been since the old lady had experienced in a single day so many\npowerful sensations. She could not even say her prayers in tranquillity;\nall the melancholy but vivid remembrances of the late count, and of this\nyoung dandy who had so ruthlessly taken advantage of her, kept coming up in\nher mind.\n\nNevertheless she undressed as usual, and drank a half glass of kvas which\nstood ready on the little table near the bed, and lay down. Her beloved cat\ncame softly into the room. Anna Fedorovna called her, and began to stroke\nher fur, and listen to her purring; but still she could not go to sleep.\n\n"It is the cat that disturbs me," she said to herself, and pushed her away.\nThe cat fell to the floor softly, and, slowly waving her bushy tail, got\nupon the oven;[87] and then the maid, who slept in the room on the floor,\nbrought her felt, and put out the candle, after lighting the night-lamp.\n\n[Footnote 87: The _lezhanka_, a part of the oven built out as a sort of\ncouch.]\n\nAt last the maid began to snore; but sleep still refused to come to Anna\nFedorovna, and calm her excited imagination. The face of the hussar\nconstantly arose before her mental vision, when she shut her eyes; and it\nseemed to her that it appeared in various strange guises in her room, when\nshe opened her eyes and looked at the commode, at the table, and her white\nraiment hanging up in the feeble light of the night-lamp. Then it seemed\nhot to her in the feather-bed, and the ticking of the watch on the table\nseemed unendurable; exasperating to the last degree, the snoring of the\nmaid. She wakened her, and bade her cease snoring.\n\nAgain the thoughts of the old count and of the young count, and of the game\nof _preference_, became strangely mixed in her mind. Now she seemed to see\nherself waltzing with the former count; she saw her own round white\nshoulders, she felt on them some one\'s kisses, and then she saw her\ndaughter in the young count\'s embrace.\n\nOnce more Ustiushka began to snore....\n\n"No, it\'s somehow different now, the men aren\'t the same. _He_ was ready to\nfling himself into the fire for my sake. Yes, I was worth doing it for! But\nthis one, have no fear, is sound asleep like a goose, instead of wooing.\nHow his father fell on his knees, and said, \'Whatever you desire I will do,\nI could kill myself in a moment; what do you desire?\' And he would have\nkilled himself, if I had bade him!"...\n\nSuddenly the sound of bare feet was heard in the corridor; and Liza with a\nshawl thrown over her came in pale and trembling, and almost fell on her\nmother\'s bed....\n\nAfter saying good-night to her mother, Liza had gone alone to the room that\nhad been her uncle\'s. Putting on a white jacket, throwing a handkerchief\nround her thick long braids, she put out the light, opened the window, and\ncurled up in a chair, turning her dreamy eyes to the pond which was now all\nshining with silver brilliancy.\n\nAll her ordinary occupations and interests came up before her now in an\nentirely different light. Her capricious old mother, unreasoning love for\nwhom had become a part of her very soul, her feeble but amiable old uncle,\nthe domestics, the peasants who worshipped their young mistress, the milch\ncows and the calves; all this nature which was forever the same in its\ncontinual death and resurrection, amid which she had grown up, with love\nfor others, and with the love of others for her,--all this that gave her\nthat gentle, agreeable peace of mind,--suddenly seemed to her something\ndifferent; it all seemed to her dismal, superfluous.\n\nIt was as though some one said to her, "Fool, fool! For twenty years you\nhave been occupied in trivialities, you have been serving others without\nreason, and you have not known what life, what happiness, were!"\n\nThis was what she thought now as she gazed down into the depths of the\nmotionless moonlit garden, and the thought came over her with vastly more\nforce than ever before. And what was it that induced this train of thought?\nIt was not in the least a sudden love for the count, as might easily be\nsupposed. On the contrary, he did not please her. It might rather have been\nthe cornet of whom she was thinking; but he was homely, poor, and taciturn.\n\n"No, it isn\'t that," she said to herself.\n\nHer ideal was so charming! It was an ideal which might have been loved in\nthe midst of this night, in the midst of this nature, without infringing\nits supernal beauty; an ideal not in the least circumscribed by the\nnecessity of reducing it to coarse reality.\n\nIn days gone by, her lonely situation, and the absence of people who might\nhave attracted her, caused that all the strength of the love which\nProvidence has implanted impartially in the hearts of each one of us, was\nstill intact and potential in her soul. But now she had been living too\nlong with the pathetic happiness of feeling that she possessed in her heart\nthis something, and occasionally opening the mysterious chalice of her\nheart, of rejoicing in the contemplation of its riches, ready to pour out\nwithout stint on some one all that it contained.\n\nGod grant that she may not have to take this melancholy delight with her to\nthe tomb! But who knows if there be any better and more powerful delight,\nor if it is not the only true and possible one?\n\n"O Father in heaven," she thought, "is it possible that I have lost my\nyouth and my happiness, and that they will never return?... Will they never\nreturn again? is it really true?"\n\nShe gazed in the direction of the moon at the bright far-off sky, studded\nwith white wavy clouds, which, as they swept on toward the moon, blotted\nout the little stars.\n\n"If the moon should seize that little cloud above it, then it means that it\nis true," she thought. A thin smoke-like strip of cloud passed over the\nlower half of the brilliant orb, and gradually the light grew fainter on\nthe turf, on the linden tops, on the pond: the black shadows of the trees\ngrew less distinct. And as though to harmonize with the gloomy shade which\nwas enveloping nature, a gentle breeze stirred through the leaves, and\nbrought to the window the dewy fragrance of the leaves, the moist earth,\nand the blooming lilacs.\n\n"No, it is not true!" she said, trying to console herself; "but if the\nnightingale should sing this night, then I should take it to mean that all\nmy forebodings are nonsense, and that there is no need of losing hope."\n\nAnd long she sat in silence, as though expecting some one, while once more\nall grew bright and full of life; and then again and again the clouds\npassed over the moon, and all became sombre.\n\nShe was even beginning to grow drowsy, as she sat there by the window, when\nshe was aroused by the nightingale\'s melodious trills clearly echoing\nacross the pond. The rustic maiden opened her eyes. Once more, with a new\nenjoyment, her whole soul was dedicated to that mysterious union with the\nnature which so calmly and serenely spread out before her.\n\nShe leaned on both elbows. A certain haunting sensation of gentle\nmelancholy oppressed her heart; and tears of pure, deep love, burning for\nsatisfaction, good consoling tears, sprang to her eyes.\n\nShe leaned her arms on the window-sill, and rested her head upon them. Her\nfavorite prayer seemed of its own accord to arise in her soul, and thus she\nfell asleep with moist eyes.\n\nThe pressure of some one\'s hand awakened her. She started up. But the touch\nwas gentle and pleasant. The hand squeezed hers with a stronger pressure.\n\nSuddenly she realized the true state of things, screamed, tore herself\naway; and trying to make herself believe that it was not the count who,\nbathed in the brilliant moonlight, was standing in front of her window, she\nhastened from the room.\n\n\nXV.\n\nIt was indeed the count. When he heard the maiden\'s cry, and the cough of\nthe watchman who was coming from the other side of the fence in reply to\nthe shriek, he had the sensation of being a thief caught in the act, and\nstarted to run across the dew-drenched grass, so as to hide in the depths\nof the garden.\n\n"Oh, what a fool I was!" he said instinctively. "I frightened her. I ought\nto have been more gentle, to have wakened her by gentle words. Oh! I am a\nbeast, a blundering beast."\n\nHe paused and listened. The watchman had come through the wicket-gate into\nthe garden, dragging his cane along the sanded walk.\n\nHe must hide. He went toward the pond. The frogs made him tremble as they\nhastily sprang from under his very feet into the water. There,\nnotwithstanding his wet feet, he crouched down on his heels, and, began to\nrecall all he had done,--how he had crept through the hedge, found her\nwindow, and at last caught a glimpse of a white shadow; how several times,\nwhile on the watch for the least noise, he had hastened away from the\nwindow; how at one moment it seemed to him that doubtless she was waiting\nfor him with vexation in her heart that he was so dilatory, and the next\nhow impossible it seemed that she would make an appointment with him so\neasily; and how, finally coming to the conclusion, that, through the\nembarrassment naturally felt by a country maiden, she was only pretending\nto be asleep, he had resolutely gone up to the window, and seen clearly her\nposition, and then suddenly, for some occult reason, had run away again;\nand only after a powerful effort of self-control, being ashamed of his\ncowardice, he had gone boldly up to her and touched her on the hand.\n\nThe watchman again coughed, and, shutting the squeaky gate, went out of the\ngarden. The window in the young girl\'s room was shut, and the wooden\nshutters inside were drawn.\n\nThe count was terribly disappointed to see this. He would have given a good\ndeal to have a chance to begin it all over again; he would not have acted\nso stupidly.\n\n"A marvellous girl! what freshness! simply charming! And so I lost her.\nStupid beast that I was."\n\nHowever, as he was not in the mood to go to sleep yet, he walked, as chance\nshould lead, along the path, through the linden alley, with the resolute\nsteps of a man who has been angry. And now for him also this night brought,\nas its gifts of reconciliation, a strange, calming melancholy, and a\ncraving for love.\n\nThe clay path, here and there dotted with sprouting grass or dry twigs, was\nlighted by patches of pale light where the moon sent its rays straight\nthrough the thick foliage of the lindens. Here and there a bending bough,\napparently overgrown with gray moss, gleamed on one side. The silvered\nfoliage occasionally rustled.\n\nAt the house there was no light in the windows; all sounds were hushed,\nonly the nightingale filled with his song all the immensity of silent and\nglorious space.\n\n"My God! what a night! what a marvellous night!" thought the count,\nbreathing in the fresh fragrance of the garden. "Something makes me feel\nblue, as though I were dissatisfied with myself and with others, and\ndissatisfied with my whole life. But what a splendid, dear girl! Perhaps\nshe was really offended." Here his fancies changed. He imagined himself\nthere in the garden with this district maiden in various and most\nremarkable situations; then his mistress Mina supplanted the maiden\'s\nplace.\n\n"What a fool I am! I ought simply to have put my arm around her waist, and\nkissed her."\n\nAnd with this regret the count returned to his room. The cornet was not yet\nasleep. He immediately turned over in bed, and looked at the count.\n\n"Aren\'t you asleep?" asked the count.\n\n"No."\n\n"Shall I tell you what happened?"\n\n"Well."\n\n"No, I\'d better not tell you.... Yes, I will too. Move your legs over a\nlittle."\n\nAnd the count, who had already given up vain regret for his unsuccessful\nintrigue, sat down with a gay smile on his comrade\'s bed. "Could you\nimagine that the young lady of the house gave me a rendezvous?"\n\n"What is that you say?" screamed Polozof, leaping up in bed.\n\n"Well, now listen."\n\n"But how? When? It can\'t be!"\n\n"See here: while you were making out your accounts in _preference_, she\ntold me that she would this night be sitting at the window, and that it was\npossible to get in at that window. Now, this is what it means to be a\npractical man: while you were there reckoning up with the old woman, I was\narranging this little affair. You yourself heard her say right out in your\npresence, that she was going to sit at the window to-night, and look at\nthe pond."\n\n"Yes, but she said that without any meaning in it."\n\n"I am not so sure whether she said it purposely or otherwise. Maybe she did\nnot wish to come at it all at once, only it looked like that. But a\nwretched piece of work came out of it. Like a perfect fool I spoilt the\nwhole thing," he added, scornfully smiling at himself.\n\n"Well, what is it? Where have you been?"\n\nThe count told him the whole story, with the exception of his irresolute\nand repeated advances. "I spoilt it myself; I ought to have been bolder.\nShe screamed, and ran away from the window."\n\n"Then she screamed and ran away?" repeated the cornet, replying with a\nconstrained smile to the count\'s smile, which had such a long and powerful\ninfluence upon him.\n\n"Yes, but now it\'s time to go to sleep."\n\nPolozof again turned his back to the door, and lay in silence for ten\nminutes. God knows what was going on in his soul; but when he turned over\nagain, his face was full of passion and resolution.\n\n"Count Turbin," said he in a broken voice.\n\n"Are you dreaming, or not?" replied the count calmly. "What is it, cornet\nPolozof?"\n\n"Count Turbin, you are a scoundrel," cried Polozof, and he sprang from the\nbed.\n\n\nXVI.\n\nThe next day the battalion departed. The officers did not see any of the\nhousehold, or bid them farewell. Neither did they speak together.\n\nIt was understood that they were to fight their duel when they came to the\nnext halting-place. But Captain Schultz, a good comrade, an admirable\nhorseman, who was loved by everybody in the regiment, and had been chosen\nby the count for his second, succeeded in arranging the affair in such a\nmanner that not only they did not fight, but that no one in the regiment\nknew about the matter; and Turbin and Polozof, though their old relations\nof friendship were never restored, still said "thou," and met at meals and\nat the gaming-table.\n\n\n\n\nTHREE DEATHS\n\n_A TALE._\n\n1859.\n\n\nI.\n\nIt was autumn.\n\nAlong the highway came two equipages at a brisk pace. In the first carriage\nsat two women. One was a lady, thin and pale. The other, her maid, with a\nbrilliant red complexion, and plump. Her short, dry locks escaped from\nunder a faded cap; her red hand, in a torn glove, put them back with a\njerk. Her full bosom, incased in a tapestry shawl, breathed of health; her\nrestless black eyes now gazed through the window at the fields hurrying by\nthem, now rested on her mistress, now peered solicitously into the corners\nof the coach.\n\nBefore the maid\'s face swung the lady\'s bonnet on the rack; on her knees\nlay a puppy; her feet were raised by packages lying on the floor, and could\nalmost be heard drumming upon them above the noise of the creaking of the\nsprings, and the rattling of the windows.\n\nThe lady, with her hands resting in her lap and her eyes shut, feebly\nswayed on the cushions which supported her back, and, slightly frowning,\nstruggled with a cough.\n\nShe wore a white nightcap, and a blue neckerchief twisted around her\ndelicate pale neck. A straight line, disappearing under the cap, parted her\nblonde hair, which was smoothly pomaded; and there was a dry, deathly\nappearance about the whiteness of the skin in this simple parting. The\nwithered and rather sallow skin was loosely drawn over her delicate and\npretty features, and there was a hectic flush on the cheeks and\ncheek-bones. Her lips were dry and restless, her thin eyelashes had lost\ntheir curve, and a cloth travelling capote made straight folds over her\nsunken chest. Although her eyes were closed, her face gave the impression\nof weariness, irascibility, and habitual suffering.\n\nThe lackey, leaning back, was napping on the coach-box. The hired\ndriver,[88] shouting in a clear voice, urged on his four powerful and\nsweaty horses, occasionally looking back at the other driver, who was\nshouting just behind them in an open barouche. The tires of the wheels, in\ntheir even and rapid course, left wide parallel tracks on the limy mud of\nthe highway.\n\n[Footnote 88: _yamshchik._]\n\nThe sky was gray and cold, a moist mist was falling over the fields and the\nroad. It was suffocating in the carriage, and smelt of eau-de-cologne and\ndust. The invalid leaned back her head, and slowly opened her eyes. Her\ngreat eyes were brilliant, and of a beautiful dark color. "Again!" said\nshe, nervously pushing away with her beautiful attenuated hand the end of\nher maid\'s cloak, which occasionally hit against her knee. Her mouth\ncontracted painfully.\n\nMatriosha raised her cloak in both hands, lifting herself up on her strong\nlegs, and then sat down again, farther away. Her fresh face was suffused\nwith a brilliant scarlet.\n\nThe invalid\'s handsome dark eyes eagerly followed the maid\'s motions; and\nthen with both hands she took hold of the seat, and did her best to raise\nherself a little higher, but her strength was not sufficient.\n\nAgain her mouth became contracted, and her whole face took on an expression\nof unavailing, angry irony.\n\n"If you would only help me.... Ah! It\'s not necessary. I can do it myself.\nOnly have the goodness not to put those pillows behind me.... On the whole,\nyou had better not touch them, if you don\'t understand!"\n\nThe lady closed her eyes, and then again, quickly raising the lids, gazed\nat her maid.\n\nMatriosha looked at her, and gnawed her red lower lip. A heavy sigh escaped\nfrom the sick woman\'s breast; but the sigh was not ended, but was merged in\na fit of coughing. She scowled, and turned her face away, clutching her\nchest with both hands. When the coughing fit was over, she once more shut\nher eyes, and continued to sit motionless. The coach and the barouche\nrolled into the village. Matriosha drew her fat hand from under her shawl,\nand made the sign of the cross.\n\n"What is this?" demanded the lady.\n\n"A post-station, madame."\n\n"Why did you cross yourself, I should like to know?"\n\n"The church, madame."\n\nThe lady looked out of the window, and began slowly to cross herself,\ngazing with all her eyes at the great village church, in front of which the\ninvalid\'s carriage was now passing.\n\nThe two vehicles came to a stop together at the post-house. The sick\nwoman\'s husband and the doctor dismounted from the barouche, and came to\nthe coach.\n\n"How are you feeling?" asked the doctor, taking her pulse.\n\n"Well, my dear, aren\'t you fatigued?" asked the husband, in French.\n"Wouldn\'t you like to go out?"\n\nMatriosha, gathering up the bundles, squeezed herself into the corner, so\nas not to interfere with the conversation.\n\n"No matter, it\'s all the same thing," replied the invalid. "I will not get\nout."\n\nThe husband, after standing there a little while, went into the post-house.\nMatriosha, jumping from the carriage, tiptoed across the muddy road, into\nthe enclosure.\n\n"If I am miserable, there is no reason why the rest of you should not have\nbreakfast," said the sick woman, smiling faintly to the doctor, who was\nstanding by her window.\n\n"It makes no difference to them how I am," she remarked to herself as the\ndoctor, turning from her with slow step, started to run up the steps of the\nstation-house. "They are well, and it\'s all the same to them. O my God!"\n\n"How now, Eduard Ivanovitch," said the husband, as he met the doctor, and\nrubbing his hands with a gay smile. "I have ordered my travelling-case\nbrought; what do you say to that?"\n\n"That\'s worth while," replied the doctor.\n\n"Well now, how about _her_?" asked the husband with a sigh, lowering his\nvoice and raising his brows.\n\n"I have told you that she cannot reach Moscow, much less Italy, especially\nin such weather."\n\n"What is to be done, then? Oh! my God! my God!"\n\nThe husband covered his eyes with his hand.... "Give it here," he added,\naddressing his man, who came bringing the travelling-case.\n\n"You\'ll have to stop somewhere on the route," replied the doctor, shrugging\nhis shoulders.\n\n"But tell me, how can that be done?" rejoined the husband. "I have done\nevery thing to keep her from going: I have spoken to her of our means, and\nof our children whom we should have to leave behind, and of my business.\nShe would not hear a word. She has made her plans for living abroad, as\nthough she were well. But if I should tell her what her real condition is,\nit would kill her."\n\n"Well, she is a dead woman now: you may as well know it, Vasili Dmitritch.\nA person cannot live without lungs, and there is no way of making lungs\ngrow again. It is melancholy, it is hard, but what is to be done about it?\nIt is my business and yours to make her last days as easy as possible. It\nis the confessor that is needed here."\n\n"Oh, my God! Now just perceive how I am situated, in speaking to her of her\nlast will. Let come whatever may, yet I cannot speak of that. And yet you\nknow how good she is."\n\n"Try at least to persuade her to wait until the roads are frozen," said the\ndoctor, shaking his head significantly: "something might happen during the\njourney."\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n"Aksiusha, oh, Aksiusha!" cried the superintendent\'s daughter, throwing a\ncloak over her head and tiptoeing down the muddy back steps. "Come along.\nLet us have a look at the Shirkinskaya lady: they say she\'s got\nlung-trouble, and they\'re taking her abroad. I never saw how any one looked\nin consumption."\n\nAksiusha jumped down from the door-sill; and the two girls, hand in hand,\nhurried out of the gates. Shortening their steps, they walked by the coach,\nand stared in at the lowered window. The invalid bent her head toward them;\nbut when she saw their inquisitiveness, she frowned and turned away.\n\n"Oh, de-e-ar!" said the superintendent\'s daughter, vigorously shaking her\nhead.... "How wonderfully pretty she used to be, and how she has changed!\nIt is terrible! Did you see? Did you see, Aksiusha?"\n\n"Yes, but how thin she is!" assented Aksiusha. "Let us go by and look\nagain; we\'ll make believe go to the well. Did you see, she turned away from\nus; still I got a good view of her. Isn\'t it too bad, Masha?"\n\n"Yes, but what terrible mud!" replied Masha, and both of them started to\nrun back within the gates.\n\n"It\'s evident that I have become a fright," thought the sick woman.... "But\nwe must hurry, hurry, and get abroad, and there I shall soon get well."\n\n"Well, and how are you, my dear?" inquired the husband, coming to the\ncarriage with still a morsel of something in his mouth.\n\n"Always one and the same question," thought the sick woman, "and he\'s even\neating!"\n\n"It\'s no consequence," she murmured between her teeth.\n\n"Do you know, my dear, I am afraid that this journey in such weather will\nonly make you worse. Eduard Ivanovitch says the same thing. Hadn\'t we\nbetter turn back?"\n\nShe maintained an angry silence.\n\n"The weather will improve maybe, the roads will become good, and that would\nbe better for you; then at least we could start all together."\n\n"Pardon me. If I had not listened to you so long, I should at this moment\nbe at Berlin and have entirely recovered."\n\n"What\'s to be done, my angel? it was impossible, as you know. But now if\nyou would wait a month, you would be ever so much better; I could finish up\nmy business, and we could take the children with us."\n\n"The children are well, and I am ill."\n\n"But just see here, my love, if in this weather you should grow worse on\nthe road.... At least we should be at home."\n\n"What is the use of being at home?... _Die_ at home?" replied the invalid\npeevishly.\n\nBut the word _die_ evidently startled her, and she turned upon her husband\na supplicating and inquiring look. He dropped his eyes, and said nothing.\n\nThe sick woman\'s mouth suddenly contracted in a childish fashion, and the\ntears sprang to her eyes. Her husband covered his face with his\nhandkerchief, and silently turned from the carriage.\n\n"No, I will go," cried the invalid; and lifting her eyes to the sky, she\nclasped her hands, and began to whisper incoherent words. "My God! why must\nit be?" she said, and the tears flowed more violently. She prayed long and\nfervently, but still there was just the same sense of constriction and pain\nin her chest, just the same gray melancholy in the sky and the fields and\nthe road; just the same autumnal mist, neither thicker nor more tenuous,\nbut ever the same in its monotony, falling on the muddy highway, on the\nroofs, on the carriage, and on the sheep-skin coats of the drivers, who\nwere talking in strong, gay voices, as they were oiling and adjusting the\ncarriage.\n\n\nII.\n\nThe coach was ready, but the driver loitered. He had gone into the driver\'s\ncottage,[89] where it was warm, close, dark, and suffocating; smelling of\nhuman occupation, of cooking bread, of cabbage, and of sheep-skin garments.\n\n[Footnote 89: _izba._]\n\nSeveral drivers were in the room; the cook was engaged near the oven, on\ntop of which lay a sick man wrapped up in pelts.\n\n"Uncle Khveodor! hey! Uncle Khveodor," called a young man, the driver, in a\ntulup, and with his knout in his belt, coming into the room, and addressing\nthe sick man.\n\n"What do you want, rattlepate? What are you calling to Fyedka[90] for?"\ndemanded one of the drivers. "There\'s your carriage waiting for you."\n\n[Footnote 90: Fyedka and Fyedya are diminutives of Feodor, Theodore.]\n\n"I want to borrow his boots. Mine are worn out," replied the young fellow,\ntossing back his curls and straightening his mittens in his belt. "Why? is\nhe asleep? Say, Uncle Khveodor!" he insisted, going to the oven.\n\n"What is it?" a weak voice was heard saying, and a blowsy, emaciated face\nwas lifted up from the oven.\n\nA broad, gaunt hand, bloodless and covered with hairs, pulled up his\novercoat over the dirty shirt that covered his bony shoulder. "Give me\nsomething to drink, brother; what is it you want?"\n\nThe young fellow handed him a small dish of water.\n\n"I say, Fyedya," said he, hesitating, "I reckon you won\'t want your new\nboots now; let me have them? Probably you won\'t need them any more."\n\nThe sick man dropping his weary head down to the lacquered bowl, and\ndipping his thin, hanging mustache in the brown water, drank feebly and\neagerly.\n\nHis tangled beard was unclean; his sunken, clouded eyes were with\ndifficulty raised to the young man\'s face. When he had finished drinking,\nhe tried to raise his hand to wipe his wet lips, but his strength failed\nhim, and he wiped them on the sleeve of his overcoat. Silently, and\nbreathing with difficulty through his nose, he looked straight into the\nyoung man\'s eyes, and tried to collect his strength.\n\n"Maybe you have promised them to some one else?" said the young driver. "If\nthat\'s so, all right. The worst of it is, it is wet outside, and I have to\ngo out to my work, and so I said to myself, \'I reckon I\'ll ask Fyedka for\nhis boots; I reckon he won\'t be needing them.\' But maybe you will need\nthem,--just say"....\n\nSomething began to bubble up and rumble in the sick man\'s chest; he bent\nover, and began to strangle, with a cough that rattled in his throat.\n\n"Now I should like to know where he would need them?" unexpectedly snapped\nout the cook, angrily addressing the whole hovel. "This is the second month\nthat he has not crept down from the oven. Just see how he is all broken up!\nand you can hear how it must hurt him inside. Where would he need boots?\nThey would not think of burying him in new ones! And it was time long ago,\nGod pardon me the sin of saying so. Just see how he chokes! He ought to be\ntaken from this hovel to another, or somewhere. They say there\'s hospitals\nin the city; but what\'s you going to do? he takes up the whole room, and\nthat\'s too much. There isn\'t any room at all. And yet you are expected to\nkeep neat."\n\n"Hey! Seryoha, come along, take your place, the people are waiting," cried\nthe head man of the station, coming to the door.\n\nSeryoha started to go without waiting for his reply, but the sick man\nduring his cough intimated by his eyes that he was going to speak.\n\n"You can take the boots, Seryoha," said he, conquering the cough and\ngetting his breath a little. "Only, do you hear, buy me a stone when I am\ndead," he added hoarsely.\n\n"Thank you, uncle; then I will take them, and as for the\nstone,--_ei-ei!_--I will buy you one."\n\n"There, children, you are witnesses," the sick man was able to articulate,\nand then once more he bent over and began to choke.\n\n"All right, we have heard," said one of the drivers. "But run, Seryoha, or\nelse the starosta will be after you again. You know Lady Shirkinskaya is\nsick."\n\nSeryoha quickly pulled off his ragged, unwieldy boots, and flung them under\nthe bench. Uncle Feodor\'s fitted his feet exactly, and the young driver\ncould not keep his eyes off them as he went to the carriage.\n\n"_Ek!_ what splendid boots! Here\'s some grease," called another driver with\nthe grease-pot in his hand, as Seryoha mounted to his box and gathered up\nthe reins. "Get them for nothing?"\n\n"So you\'re jealous, are you?" cried Seryoha, lifting up and tucking around\nhis legs the tails of his overcoat. "Off with you, my darlings," he cried\nto the horses, cracking his knout; and the coach and barouche with their\noccupants, trunks, and other belongings, were hidden in the thick autumnal\nmist, and rapidly whirled away over the wet road.\n\nThe sick driver remained on the oven in the stifling hovel, and, not being\nable to throw off the phlegm, by a supreme effort turned over on the\nother-side, and stopped coughing.\n\nTill evening there was a continual coming and going, and eating of meals in\nthe hovel, and the sick man was not noticed. Before night came on, the cook\nclimbed upon the oven, and pulled off the sheep-skin from his legs.\n\n"Don\'t be angry with me, Nastasya," murmured the sick man. "I shall soon\nleave you your room."\n\n"All right, all right, it\'s of no consequence. But what is the matter with\nyou, uncle? Tell me."\n\n"All my innards are gnawed out, God knows what it is!"\n\n"And I don\'t doubt your gullet hurts you when you cough so?"\n\n"It hurts me all over. My death is at hand, that\'s what it is. _Okh! Okh!\nOkh!_" groaned the sick man.\n\n"Now cover up your legs this way," said Nastasya, comfortably arranging the\novercoat so that it would cover him, and then getting down from the oven.\n\nDuring the night the hovel was faintly lighted by a single taper. Nastasya\nand a dozen drivers were sleeping, snoring loudly, on the floor and the\nbenches. Only the sick man feebly choked and coughed, and tossed on the\noven.\n\nIn the morning no sound was heard from him.\n\n"I saw something wonderful in my sleep," said the cook, as she stretched\nherself in the early twilight the next morning. "I seemed to see Uncle\nKhveodor get down from the oven, and go out to cut wood. \'Look here,\' says\nhe, \'I\'m going to help you, Nasya;\' and I says to him, \'How can you split\nwood?\' but he seizes the hatchet, and begins to cut so fast, so fast that\nnothing but chips fly. \'Why,\' says I, \'ain\'t you been sick?\'--\'No,\' says\nhe, \'I am well,\' and he kind of lifted up the axe, and I was scared; and I\nscreamed and woke up. He can\'t be dead, can he?--Uncle Khveodor! hey,\nuncle!"\n\nFeodor did not move.\n\n"Now he can\'t be dead, can he? Go and see," said one of the drivers who had\njust waked up. The emaciated hand, covered with reddish hair, that hung\ndown from the oven, was cold and pale.\n\n"Go tell the superintendent; it seems he is dead," said the driver.\n\nFeodor had no relatives. He was a stranger. On the next day they buried him\nin the new burying-ground behind the grove; and Nastasya for many days had\nto tell everybody of the dream which she had seen, and how she had been the\nfirst to discover that Uncle Feodor was dead.\n\n\nIII.\n\nSpring had come.\n\nAlong the wet streets of the city swift streamlets ran purling between bits\nof ice; bright were the colors of people\'s dresses and the tones of their\nvoices, as they hurried along. In the walled gardens, the buds on the trees\nwere bourgeoning, and the fresh breeze swayed their branches with a soft\ngentle murmur. Everywhere transparent drops were forming and falling....\n\nThe sparrows chattered incoherently, and fluttered about on their little\nwings. On the sunny side, on the walls, houses, and trees, all was full of\nlife and brilliancy. The sky, and the earth, and the heart of man\noverflowed with youth and joy.\n\nIn front of a great seignorial mansion, in one of the principal streets,\nfresh straw was laid; in the house lay that same invalid whom we saw\nhastening abroad.\n\nNear the closed doors of the house stood the sick lady\'s husband, and a\nlady well along in years. On a sofa sat the confessor, with cast-down eyes,\nholding something wrapped up under his stole.[91] In one corner, in a\nVoltaire easy-chair, reclined an old lady, the sick woman\'s mother, weeping\nviolently.\n\n[Footnote 91: Called _epitrachilion_ in the Greek Church.]\n\nNear her the maid stood holding a clean handkerchief, ready for the old\nlady\'s use when she should ask for it. Another maid was rubbing the old\nlady\'s temples, and blowing on her gray head underneath her cap.\n\n"Well, Christ be with you, my dear," said the husband to the elderly lady\nwho was standing with him near the door: "she has such confidence in you;\nyou know how to talk with her; go and speak with her a little while, my\ndarling, please go!"\n\nHe was about to open the door for her; but his cousin held him back,\nputting her handkerchief several times to her eyes, and shaking her head.\n\n"There, now she will not see that I have been weeping," said she, and,\nopening the door herself, went to the invalid.\n\nThe husband was in the greatest excitement, and seemed quite beside\nhimself. He started to go over to the old mother, but after taking a few\nsteps he turned around, walked the length of the room, and approached the\npriest.\n\nThe priest looked at him, raised his brows toward heaven, and sighed. The\nthick gray beard also was lifted and fell again.\n\n"My God! my God!" said the husband.\n\n"What can you do?" exclaimed the confessor, sighing and again lifting up\nhis brows and beard, and letting them drop.\n\n"And the old mother there!" exclaimed the husband, almost in despair. "She\nwill not be able to endure it. You see, she loved her so, she loved her so,\nthat she.... I don\'t know. You might try, holy father,[92] to calm her a\nlittle, and persuade her to go away."\n\n[Footnote 92: _batiushka._]\n\nThe confessor arose and went over to the old lady.\n\n"It is true, no one can appreciate a mother\'s heart," said he, "but God is\ncompassionate."\n\nThe old lady\'s face was suddenly convulsed, and a hysterical sob shook her\nframe.\n\n"God is compassionate," repeated the priest, when she had grown a little\ncalmer. "I will tell you, in my parish there was a sick man, and much worse\nthan Marya Dmitrievna, and he, though he was only a shopkeeper,[93] was\ncured in a very short time, by means of herbs. And this very same\nshopkeeper is now in Moscow. I have told Vasili Dmitrievitch about him; it\nmight be tried, you know. At all events, it would satisfy the invalid. With\nGod, all things are possible."\n\n[Footnote 93: _meshchanin._]\n\n"No, she won\'t get well," persisted the old lady. "Why should God have\ntaken her, and not me?"\n\nAnd again the hysterical sobbing overcame her so violently that she fainted\naway.\n\nThe invalid\'s husband hid his face in his hands, and rushed from the room.\n\nIn the corridor the first person whom he met was a six-year-old boy, who\nwas chasing his little sister with all his might and main.\n\n"Do you bid me take the children to their mamma?" inquired the nurse.\n\n"No, she is not able to see them. They distract her."\n\nThe lad stopped for a moment, and after looking eagerly into his father\'s\nface, he cut a dido with his leg, and with merry shouts ran on. "I\'m\nplaying she\'s a horse, papasha," cried the little fellow, pointing to his\nsister.\n\nMeantime, in the next room, the cousin had taken her seat near the sick\nwoman, and was skilfully bringing the conversation by degrees round so as\nto prepare her for the thought of death. The doctor stood by the window,\nmixing some draught.\n\nThe invalid in a white dressing-gown, all surrounded by cushions, was\nsitting up in bed, and gazed silently at her cousin.\n\n"Ah, my dear!" she exclaimed, unexpectedly interrupting her, "don\'t try to\nprepare me; don\'t treat me like a little child! I am a Christian woman. I\nknow all about it. I know that I have not long to live; I know that if my\nhusband had heeded me sooner, I should have been in Italy, and possibly,\nyes probably, should have been well by this time. They all told him so. But\nwhat is to be done? it\'s as God saw fit. We all of us have sinned, I know\nthat; but I hope in the mercy of God, that all will be pardoned, ought to\nbe pardoned. I am trying to sound my own heart. I also have committed many\nsins, my love. But how much I have suffered in atonement! I have tried to\nbear my sufferings patiently"....\n\n"Then shall I have the confessor come in, my love? It will be all the\neasier for you, after you have been absolved," said the cousin.\n\nThe sick woman dropped her head in token of assent. "O God! pardon me a\nsinner," she whispered.\n\nThe cousin went out, and beckoned to the confessor. "She is an angel," she\nsaid to the husband, with tears in her eyes. The husband wept. The priest\nwent into the sick-room; the old lady still remained unconscious, and in\nthe room beyond all was perfectly quiet. At the end of five minutes the\nconfessor came out, and, taking off his stole, arranged his hair.\n\n"Thanks be to the Lord, she is calmer now," said he. "She wishes to see\nyou."\n\nThe cousin and the husband went to the sick-room. The invalid, gently\nweeping, was gazing at the images.\n\n"I congratulate you, my love," said the husband.\n\n"Thank you. How well I feel now! what ineffable joy I experience!" said the\nsick woman, and a faint smile played over her thin lips. "How merciful God\nis! Is it not so? He is merciful and omnipotent!" And again with an eager\nprayer she turned her tearful eyes towards the holy images.\n\nThen suddenly something seemed to occur to her mind. She beckoned to her\nhusband.\n\n"You are never willing to do what I desire," said she in a weak and\nquerulous voice.\n\nThe husband, stretching his neck, listened to her submissively.\n\n"What is it, my love?"\n\n"How many times I have told you that these doctors don\'t know any thing!\nThere are uneducated women doctors: they make cures. That\'s what the good\nfather said.... A shopkeeper.... send for him"....\n\n"For whom, my love?"\n\n"Good heavens! you can never understand me." And the dying woman frowned,\nand closed her eyes.\n\nThe doctor came to her, and took her hand. Her pulse was evidently growing\nfeebler and feebler. He made a sign to the husband. The sick woman remarked\nthis gesture, and looked around in fright. The cousin turned away to hide\nher tears.\n\n"Don\'t weep, don\'t torment yourselves on my account," said the invalid.\n"That takes away from me my last comfort."\n\n"You are an angel!" exclaimed the cousin, kissing her hand.\n\n"No, kiss me here. They only kiss the hands of those who are dead. My God!\nmy God!"\n\nThat same evening the sick woman was a corpse, and the corpse in the\ncoffin lay in the parlor of the great mansion. In the immense room, the\ndoors of which were closed, sat the clerk,[94] and with a monotonous voice\nread the Psalms of David through his nose.\n\n[Footnote 94: _diachok._]\n\nThe bright glare from the wax candles in the lofty silver candelabra fell\non the white brow of the dead, on the heavy waxen hands, on the stiff folds\nof the cerement which brought out into awful relief the knees and the feet.\n\nThe clerk, not varying his tones, continued to read on steadily, and in the\nsilence of the chamber of death his words rang out and died away.\nOccasionally from distant rooms came the voice of children and their\nromping.\n\n"_Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their breath,\nthey die and return to their dust._\n\n"_Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the\nface of the earth._\n\n"_The glory of the Lord shall endure forever: the Lord shall rejoice in his\nworks._"\n\nThe face of the dead was stern and majestic. But there was no motion either\non the pure cold brow, or the firmly closed lips. She was all attention.\nBut did she perhaps now understand these grand words?\n\n\nIV.\n\nAt the end of a month, over the grave of the dead a stone chapel was\nerected. Over the driver\'s there was as yet no stone, and only the fresh\ngreen grass sprouted over the mound that served as the sole record of the\npast existence of a man.\n\n"It will be a sin and a shame, Seryoha," said the cook at the station-house\none day, "if you don\'t buy a gravestone for Khveodor. You kept saying,\n\'It\'s winter, winter,\' but now why don\'t you keep your word? I heard it\nall. He has already come back once to ask why you don\'t do it; if you don\'t\nbuy him one, he will come again, he will choke you."\n\n"Well, now, have I denied it?" urged Seryoha. "I am going to buy him a\nstone, as I said I would. I can get one for a ruble and a half. I have not\nforgotten about it; I\'ll have to get it. As soon as I happen to be in town,\nthen I\'ll buy him one."\n\n"You ought at least to put up a cross, that\'s what you ought to do," said\nan old driver. "It isn\'t right at all. You\'re wearing those boots now."\n\n"Yes. But where could I get him a cross? You wouldn\'t want to make one out\nof an old piece of stick, would you?"\n\n"What is that you say? Make one out of an old piece of stick? No; take your\naxe, go out to the wood a little earlier than usual, and you can hew him\nout one. Take a little ash-tree, and you can make one. You can have a\ncovered cross. If you go then, you won\'t have to give the watchman a little\ndrink of vodka. One doesn\'t want to give vodka for every trifle. Now,\nyesterday I broke my axletree, and I go and hew out a new one of green\nwood. No one said a word."\n\nEarly the next morning, almost before dawn, Seryoha took his axe, and went\nto the wood.\n\nOver all things hung a cold, dead veil of falling mist, as yet untouched by\nthe rays of the sun.\n\nThe cast gradually grew brighter, reflecting its pale light over the vault\nof heaven still covered by light clouds. Not a single grass-blade below,\nnot a single leaf on the topmost branches of the tree-top, waved. Only from\ntime to time could be heard the sounds of fluttering wings in the thicket,\nor a rustling on the ground broke in upon the silence of the forest.\n\nSuddenly a strange sound, foreign to this nature, resounded and died away\nat the edge of the forest. Again the noise sounded, and was monotonously\nrepeated again and again, at the foot of one of the ancient, immovable\ntrees. A tree-top began to shake in an extraordinary manner; the juicy\nleaves whispered something; and the warbler, sitting on one of the\nbranches, flew off a couple of times with a shrill cry, and, wagging its\ntail, finally perched on another tree.\n\nThe axe rang more and more frequently; the white chips, full of sap, were\nscattered upon the dewy grass, and a slight cracking was heard beneath the\nblows.\n\nThe tree trembled with all its body, leaned over, and quickly straightened\nitself with a fearful shudder on its base.\n\nFor an instant all was still, then once more the tree bent over; a crash\nwas heard in its trunk; and tearing the thicket, and dragging down the\nbranches, it plunged toward the damp earth.\n\nThe noise of the axe and of footsteps ceased.\n\nThe warbler uttered a cry, and flew higher. The branch which she grazed\nwith her wings shook for an instant, and then came to rest like all the\nothers with their foliage.\n\nThe trees, more joyously than ever, extended their branches over the new\nspace that had been made in their midst.\n\nThe first sunbeams, breaking through the cloud, gleamed in the sky, and\nshone along the earth and heavens.\n\nThe mist, in billows, began to float along the hollows; the dew, gleaming,\nplayed on the green foliage; translucent white clouds hurried along their\nazure path.\n\nThe birds hopped about in the thicket, and, as though beside themselves,\nvoiced their happiness; the juicy leaves joyfully and contentedly whispered\non the tree-tops; and the branches of the living trees slowly and\nmajestically waved over the dead and fallen tree.\n\n\n\n\nA PRISONER IN THE CAUCASUS.\n\n\nI.\n\nA Russian of rank was serving as an officer in the army of the Caucasus.\nHis name was Zhilin.\n\nThere came to him one day a letter from his home. His aged mother wrote\nhim: "I am now getting along in years, and before I die I should like to\nsee my beloved son. Come and bid me farewell, lay me in the ground, and\nthen with my blessing return again to your service. And I have been finding\na bride for you, and she is intelligent and handsome and has property. If\nyou like, you can marry and settle down together."\n\nZhilin cogitated, "It is very true: the old lady has been growing feeble;\nmaybe I shall not have a chance to see her again. Let us go, and if the\nbride is pretty--then I might marry."\n\nHe went to his colonel, got his leave of absence, took his farewell of his\ncomrades, gave the soldiers of his command nine gallons[95] of vodka as a\nfarewell treat, and made his arrangements to depart.\n\n[Footnote 95: Four _vedros_, equivalent exactly to 8.80 gallons.]\n\nThere was war at that time in the Caucasus. The roads were not open for\ntravel either by day or night. If any of the Russians rode or walked\noutside of the fortress, the Tatars were likely either to kill him or\ncarry him off to the mountains. And it was arranged that twice a week an\nescort of soldiers should go from fortress to fortress. In front and behind\nmarched the soldiers, and the travellers rode in the middle.\n\nIt was now summer-time. At sunrise the baggage-train was made up behind the\nfortification; the guard of soldiery marched ahead, and the procession\nmoved along the road.\n\nZhilin was on horseback, and his effects were on a cart that formed part of\nthe train.\n\nThey had twenty-five versts[96] to travel. The train marched slowly;\nsometimes the soldiers halted; sometimes a wagon-wheel came off, or a horse\nbalked, and all had to stop and wait.\n\n[Footnote 96: Sixteen and a half miles.]\n\nThe sun was already past the zenith, but the train had only gone half way,\nso great were the dust and heat. The sun was baking hot, and nowhere was\nthere shelter. A bald steppe; not a tree or a shrub on the road.\n\nZhilin rode on ahead, occasionally stopping and waiting till the train\ncaught up with him. He would listen, and hear the signal on the horn to\nhalt again. And Zhilin thought, "Would I better go on alone without the\nsoldiers? I have a good horse under me; if I fall in with the Tatars, I can\nescape. Or shall I wait?"\n\nHe kept stopping and pondering. And just then another officer, also on\nhorseback, rode up to him; his name was Kostuilin, and he had a musket.\n\nHe said, "Zhilin, let us ride on ahead together. I am so hungry that I\ncannot stand it any longer, and the heat too,--you could wring my shirt\nout!" Kostuilin was a heavy, stout, ruddy man, and the sweat was dripping\nfrom him.\n\nZhilin reflected, and said, "And your musket is loaded?"\n\n"It is."\n\n"All right, let us go. Only one condition: not to separate."\n\nAnd they started on up the road. They rode along the steppe, talking and\nlooking on each side. There was a wide sweep of view. As soon as the steppe\ncame to an end, the road went into a pass between two mountains.\n\nAnd Zhilin said, "I must ride up on that mountain, and reconnoitre,\notherwise you see they might come down from the mountain and surprise us."\n\nBut Kostuilin said, "What is there to reconnoitre? Let us go ahead."\n\nZhilin did not heed him.\n\n"No," says he, "you wait for me here below. I\'ll just glance around."\n\nAnd he spurred his horse up the mountain to the left.\n\nThe horse that Zhilin rode was a hunter; he had bought him out of a drove\nof colts, paying a hundred rubles for him, and he had himself trained him.\nHe bore him up the steep slope as on wings. He had hardly reached the\nsummit when before him less than seven hundred feet distant mounted Tatars\nwere standing,--thirty men.\n\nHe saw them, and started to turn back, but the Tatars had caught sight of\nhim; they set out in pursuit of him, unstrapping their weapons as they\ngallop. Zhilin dashes down the precipice with all the speed of his horse,\nand cries to Kostuilin, "Fire your gun!" and to his horse he says, though\nnot aloud, "Little mother, carry me safely, don\'t stumble; if you trip, I\nam lost. If we get back to the gun, we won\'t fall into their hands."\n\nBut Kostuilin, instead of waiting for him, as soon as he saw the Tatars,\ngalloped on with all his might toward the fortress. With his whip he\nbelabored his horse, first on one side, then on the other; all that could\nbe seen through the dust, was the horse switching her tail.\n\nZhilin saw that his case was desperate. The gun was gone; nothing was to be\ndone with a sabre alone. He turned his horse back toward the train; he\nthought he might escape that way.\n\nBut in front of him, he sees that six are galloping down the steep. His\nhorse is good, but theirs are better; and besides, they have got the start\nof him. He started to wheel about, and was going to dash ahead again, but\nhis horse had got momentum, and could not be held back; he flew straight\ndown toward them.\n\nHe sees a red-bearded Tatar approaching him on a gray mare. He is gaining\non him; he gnashes his teeth; he is getting his gun ready.\n\n"Well," thinks Zhilin, "I know you devils; if you should take me prisoner,\nyou would put me in a hole, and flog me with a whip. I won\'t give myself up\nalive."\n\nNow, Zhilin was not of great size, but he was an uhlan. He drew his sabre,\nspurred his horse straight at the red-bearded Tatar. He says to himself,\n"Either I will crush him with my horse, or I will hack him down with my\nsabre."\n\nZhilin, however, did not reach the place on horseback; suddenly behind him,\ngun-shots were fired at the horse. The horse fell headlong, and pinned\nZhilin\'s leg to the ground.\n\nHe tried to arise; but already ill-smelling Tatars were sitting on him, and\npinioning his hands behind his back.\n\nHe burst from them, knocking the Tatars over; but three others had\ndismounted from their horses, and began to beat him on the head with their\ngun-stocks.\n\nHis sight failed him, and he staggered.\n\nThe Tatars seized him, took from their saddles extra saddle-girths, bent\nhis arms behind his back, fastened them with a Tatar knot, and lifted him\nup.\n\nThey took his sabre from him, pulled off his boots, made a thorough search\nof him, pulled out his money and his watch, tore his clothes all to pieces.\n\nZhilin glanced at his horse. The poor beast lay as he had fallen, on his\nside, and was kicking, vainly trying to rise. In his head was a hole, and\nfrom the hole the black blood was pouring; the dust for an arshin around\nwas wet with it.\n\nA Tatar went to the horse to remove the saddle. He was still kicking, so\nthe man took out his dagger, and cut his throat. The throat gave a\nwhistling sound, a trembling ran over the body, and all was over.\n\nThe Tatars took off the saddle and the other trappings. The one with the\nred beard mounted his horse, and the others lifted Zhilin behind him to\nkeep him from falling; they fastened him with the reins to the Tatar\'s\nbelt, and thus they carried him off to the mountains.\n\nZhilin sat behind, swaying and bumping his face against the stinking\nTatar\'s back.\n\nAll that he could see before him was the healthy Tatar back, and the sinewy\nneck, and a smooth-shaven nape, showing blue beneath the cap.\n\nZhilin\'s head ached; the blood trickled into his eyes. And it was\nimpossible for him to get a more comfortable position on the horse, or wipe\naway the blood. His arms were so tightly bound that his collar-bones ached.\nThey rode long from mountain to mountain; they forded a river; then they\nentered a highway, and rode along a valley. Zhilin tried to follow the\nroute that they took him; but his eyes were glued together with blood, and\nit was impossible for him to turn round.\n\nIt began to grow dark; they crossed still another river, and began to climb\na rocky mountain. There was an odor of smoke. The barking of dogs was\nheard.\n\nThey had reached an _aul_.[97]\n\n[Footnote 97: _Aul_ = Tatar\'s village.--_Author\'s note._]\n\nThe Tatars dismounted. The Tatar children came running up, and surrounded\nZhilin, whistling and exulting. Finally they began to fling stones at him.\n\nThe Tatar drove away the children, lifted Zhilin from the horse, and called\na servant.\n\nA Nogai, with prominent cheek-bones, came at the call. He wore only a\nshirt. The shirt was torn; his whole breast was bare. The Tatar said\nsomething to him. The servant brought a foot-stock. It consisted of two\noaken blocks provided with iron rings, and in one of the rings was a clamp\nwith a lock. They unfastened Zhilin\'s arms, put on the stock, and took him\nto a barn, pushed him in, and shut the door.\n\nZhilin fell on the manure. As he lay there, he felt round in the darkness,\nand when he had found a place that was less foul, he stretched himself out.\n\n\nII.\n\nZhilin scarcely slept that night. The nights were short. He saw through a\ncrack that it was growing light. Zhilin got up, widened the crack, and\nmanaged to look out.\n\nThrough the crack he could see a road leading down from the mountain; at\nthe right, a Tatar _saklia_[98] with two trees near it. A black dog was\nlying on the road; a she-goat with her kids was walking by, all of them\nshaking their tails.\n\n[Footnote 98: A mountain-hut in the Caucasus.]\n\nHe saw coming down the mountain a young Tatar girl in a variegated shirt,\nungirdled, in pantalettes and boots; her head was covered with a kaftan,\nand on it she bore a great tin water-jug.\n\nShe walked along, swaying and bending her back, and holding by the hand a\nlittle Tatar urchin, with shaven head, who wore a single shirt.\n\nAfter the Tatar maiden had passed with her water-jug, the red-bearded Tatar\nof the evening before came out, wearing a silk beshmet, a silver dagger in\nhis belt, and sandals on his bare feet. On his head was a high cap of\nsheep-skin, dyed black, and with the point hanging down. He came out,\nstretched himself, stroked his red beard. He paused, gave some order to the\nservant, and went off somewhere.\n\nThen two children on horseback came along on their way to the\nwatering-trough. The hind-quarters of the horses were wet.\n\nOther shaven-headed youngsters, with nothing but shirts on, and nothing on\ntheir legs, formed a little band, and came to the barn; they got a dry\nstick, and stuck it through the crack.\n\nZhilin growled "_ukh_" at them. The children began to cry, and scatter in\nevery direction as fast as their legs would carry them; only their bare\nknees glistened. But Zhilin began to be thirsty; his throat was parched. He\nsaid to himself, "I wonder if they won\'t come to look after me?"\n\nSuddenly the barn-doors are thrown open.\n\nThe red Tatar came in, and with him another, of slighter stature and of\ndark complexion. His eyes were bright and black, his cheeks ruddy, his\nlittle beard well trimmed, his face jolly and always enlivened with a grin.\n\nThe dark man\'s clothing was still richer: a silk beshmet of blue silk,\nembroidered with gold lace. In his belt, a great silver dagger; handsome\nmorocco slippers embroidered with silver, and over the fine slippers he\nwore a larger pair of stout ones. His cap was tall, of white lamb\'s wool.\n\nThe red Tatar came in, muttered something, gave vent to some abusive\nlanguage, and then stood leaning against the wall, fingering his dagger,\nand scowling under his brows at Zhilin, like a wolf.\n\nBut the dark Tatar, nervous and active, and always on the go, as though he\nwere made of springs, came straight up to Zhilin, squatted down on his\nheels, showed his teeth, tapped him on the shoulder, began to gabble\nsomething in his own language, winked his eyes, and, clucking his tongue,\nkept saying, "A fine Russ, a fine Russ!"[99]\n\n[Footnote 99: _Urus_ in Tatar.]\n\nZhilin did not understand him, and said, "Drink; give me some water."\n\nThe dark one grinned.\n\n"A fine Russ!" and all the time he kept babbling.\n\nZhilin signified by his hands and lips that they should give him water.\n\nThe dark one understood, grinned, put his head out of the door, and cried,\n"Dina!"\n\nA young girl came running in,--a slender, lean creature of thirteen, with a\nface like the dark man\'s. Evidently she was his daughter.\n\nShe was dressed in a long blue shirt with wide sleeves and without a belt.\nOn the bottom, on the breast, and on the cuffs it was relieved with red\ntrimmings. She wore on her legs pantalettes and slippers, and over the\nslippers another pair with high heels. On her neck was a necklace wholly\ncomposed of half-ruble pieces. Her head was uncovered; she had her hair in\na black braid, and on the braid was a ribbon, and to the ribbon were\nattached various ornaments and a silver ruble.\n\nHer father gave her some command. She ran out, and quickly returned,\nbringing a little tin pitcher. After she had handed him the water, she also\nsquatted on her heels in such a way that her knees were higher than her\nshoulders.\n\nShe sits that way, and opens her eyes, and stares at Zhilin while he\ndrinks, as though he were some wild beast.\n\nZhilin offered to return the pitcher to her. She darted away like a wild\ngoat. Even her father laughed.\n\nHe sent her after something else. She took the pitcher, ran out, and\nbrought back some unleavened bread on a small round board, and again\nsquatted down, and stared without taking her eyes from him.\n\nThe Tatars went out, and again bolted the door.\n\nAfter a while the Nogai also comes to Zhilin, and says, "_Ai-da, khozyain,\nai-da!_"\n\nBut he does not know Russian either. Zhilin, however, perceived that he\nwished him to go somewhere.\n\nZhilin hobbled out with his clog; it was impossible to walk, so he had to\ndrag one leg. The Nogai led the way for him.\n\nHe sees before him a Tatar village, of half a score of houses, and the\nnative mosque with its minaret.\n\nIn front of one house stood three horses saddled. Lads held them by the\nbridle. From this house came the dark Tatar, and waved his hand, signifying\nthat Zhilin was to come to him. He grinned, and kept saying something in\nhis own tongue, and went into the house.\n\nZhilin followed him.\n\nThe room was decent; the walls were smoothly plastered with clay. Against\nthe front wall were placed feather-beds; on the sides hung costly rugs; on\nthe rugs were guns, pistols, and sabres, all silver-mounted.\n\nOn one side a little oven was set in, on a level with the floor.\n\nThe floor was of earth, clean as a threshing-floor, and the whole of the\nfront portion was covered with felt; rugs were distributed over the felt,\nand on the rugs were down pillows.\n\nOn the rugs were sitting some Tatars in slippers only,--the dark Tatar, the\nred-bearded one, and three guests. Behind their backs, down cushions were\nplaced; and before them on wooden plates were pancakes of millet-flour, and\nmelted butter in a cup, and the Tatar beer, called _buza_, in a pitcher.\nThey ate with their fingers, and all dipped into the butter.\n\nThe dark man leaped up, bade Zhilin sit on one side, not on a rug but on\nthe bare floor; going back again to his rug, he handed his guests cakes and\n_buza_.\n\nThe servant showed Zhilin his place; he himself took off his shoes, placed\nthem by the door in a row with the slippers of the other guests, and took\nhis seat on the felt as near as possible to his masters; and while they eat\nhe looks at them, and his mouth waters.\n\nAfter the Tatars had finished eating, a Tatar woman entered, dressed in the\nsame sort of shirt as the girl wore, and in pantalettes; her head was\ncovered with a handkerchief. She carried out the butter and the cakes, and\nbrought a handsome finger-bowl, and a pitcher with a narrow nose.\n\nThe Tatars finished washing their hands, then they folded their arms, knelt\ndown, and puffed on all sides, and said their prayers. They talked in their\nown tongue.\n\nThen one of the guests, a Tatar, approached Zhilin, and began to speak to\nhim in Russian. "Kazi Muhamet made you prisoner," said he, pointing to the\nred-bearded Tatar; "and he has given you to Abdul Murat," indicating the\ndark one. "_Abdul Murat is now your master._"[100]\n\n[Footnote 100: _khozyain._]\n\nZhilin said nothing.\n\nAbdul Murat began to talk, all the time pointing toward Zhilin, and grinned\nas he talked-: "_soldat Urus, korosho Urus_."\n\nThe interpreter went on to say, "He commands you to write a letter home,\nand have them send money to ransom you. As soon as money is sent, he will\nset you free."\n\nZhilin pondered a little, and then said, "Does he wish a large ransom?"\n\nThe Tatars took counsel together, and then the interpreter said,--\n\n"Three thousand silver rubles."\n\n"No," replied Zhilin, "I can\'t pay that."\n\nAbdul leaped up, began to gesticulate and talk to Zhilin; he seemed all the\ntime to think that Zhilin understood him.\n\nThe interpreter translated his words. "He means," says he, "how much will\nyou give?"\n\nZhilin after pondering a little said, "Five hundred rubles."\n\nThen the Tatars all began to talk at once. Abdul began to scream at the\nred-bearded Tatar. He grew so excited as he talked, that the spittle flew\nfrom his mouth.\n\nBut the red-bearded Tatar only frowned, and clucked with his tongue.\n\nWhen all became silent again, the interpreter said, "Five hundred rubles is\nnot enough to buy you of your master. He himself has paid two hundred for\nyou. Kazi Muhamet was in debt to him. He took you for the debt. Three\nthousand rubles; it is no use to send less. But if you don\'t write, they\nwill put you in a hole, and flog you with a whip."\n\n"_Ekh!_" thinks Zhilin, "the more cowardly one is, the worse it is for\nhim." He leaped to his feet, and said,--\n\n"Now you tell him, dog that he is, that if he thinks he is going to\nfrighten me, then I will not give him a single kopek nor will I write. I am\nnot afraid of you, and you will never make me afraid of you, you dog!" The\ninterpreter translated this, and again they all began to talk at once.\n\nThey gabbled a long time, then the dark one got up and came to Zhilin.\n\n"_Urus_," says he, "_jigit, jigit Urus!_"\n\nThe word _jigit_ among them signifies a brave young man. And he grinned,\nsaid something to the interpreter, and the interpreter said, "Give a\nthousand rubles." Zhilin would not give in. "I will not pay more than five\nhundred. But if you kill me, you will get nothing at all."\n\nThe Tatars consulted together, sent out the servant, and they themselves\nlooked first at the door, then at Zhilin.\n\nThe servant returned, followed by a rather stout man in bare feet and\nalmost stripped. His feet also were in stocks.\n\nZhilin made an exclamation: he recognized Kostuilin.\n\nAnd they brought him in, and placed him next his comrade; the two began to\ntalk together, and the Tatars looked on and listened in silence.\n\nZhilin told how it had gone with him; Kostuilin told how his horse had\nstood stock still, and his gun had missed fire, and that this same Abdul\nhad overtaken him and captured him.\n\nAbdul listened, pointed to Kostuilin, and muttered something. The\ninterpreter translated his words to mean that they now both belonged to the\nsame master, and that the one who paid the ransom first would be freed\nfirst. "Now," says he to Zhilin, "you lose your temper so easily, but your\ncomrade is calm; he has written a letter home; they will send five\nthousand silver rubles. And so he will be well fed, and he won\'t be hurt."\n\nAnd Zhilin said, "Let my comrade do as he pleases. Maybe he is rich. But I\nam not rich; I will do as I have already told you. Kill me if you wish, but\nit would not do you any good, and I will not pay you more than five hundred\nrubles."\n\nThey were silent.\n\nSuddenly Abdul leaped up, brought a little chest, took out a pen, a sheet\nof paper, and ink, and pushed them into Zhilin\'s hands, then tapped him on\nthe shoulder, and said by signs, "Write." He had agreed to take the five\nhundred rubles.\n\n"Wait a moment," said Zhilin to the interpreter. "Tell him that he must\nfeed us well, clothe us, and give us good decent foot-wear, and let us stay\ntogether. We want to have a good time. And lastly, that he take off these\nclogs."\n\nHe looked at his Tatar master, and smiled. The master also smiled, and when\nhe learned what was wanted, said,--\n\n"I will give you the very best clothes: a cherkeska[101] and boots, fit for\na wedding. And I will feed you like princes. And if you want to live\ntogether, why, you can live in the barn. But it won\'t do to take away the\nclogs: you would run away. Only at night will I have them taken off." Then\nhe jumped up, tapped him on the shoulder: "You good, me good."\n\n[Footnote 101: A sort of long Circassian cloak.]\n\nZhilin wrote his letter, but he put on it the wrong address so that it\nmight never reach its destination. He said to himself, "I shall run away."\n\nThey took Zhilin and Kostuilin to the barn, strewed corn-stalks, gave them\nwater in a pitcher, and bread, two old cherkeski, and some worn-out\nmilitary boots. It was evident that they had been stolen from some dead\nsoldier. When night came they took off their clogs, and locked them up in\nthe barn.\n\n\nIII.\n\nThus Zhilin and his comrade lived a whole month. Their master was always on\nthe grin.\n\n"You, Ivan, good--me, Abdul, good."\n\nBut he gave them wretched food; unleavened bread made of millet-flour,\ncooked in the form of cakes, but often not heated through.\n\nKostuilin wrote home again, and was anxiously awaiting the arrival of the\nmoney, and lost his spirits. Whole days at a time, he sat in the barn, and\ncounted the days till his money should arrive, or else he slept.\n\nBut Zhilin had no expectation that his letter would reach its destination,\nand he did not write another.\n\n"Where," he asked himself,--"where would my mother get the money for my\nransom? And besides, she lived for the most part on what I used to send\nher. If she made out to raise five hundred rubles, she would be in want\ntill the end of her days. If God wills it, I may escape."\n\nAnd all the time he kept his eyes open, and made plans to elude his\ncaptors.\n\nHe walked about the aul; he amused himself by whistling; or else he sat\ndown and fashioned things, either modelling dolls out of clay or plaiting\nbaskets of osiers, for Zhilin was a master at all sorts of handiwork.\n\nOne time he had made a doll with nose, and hands and feet, and dressed in a\nTatar shirt, and he set the doll on the roof. The Tatar women were going\nfor water. Dina, the master\'s daughter, caught sight of the doll. She\ncalled the Tatar girls. They set down their jugs, and looked and laughed.\n\nZhilin took the doll, and offered it to them. They keep laughing, but don\'t\ndare to take it.\n\nHe left the doll, went to the barn, and watched what would take place.\n\nDina ran up to the doll, looked around, seized the doll, and fled.\n\nThe next morning at dawn he sees Dina come out on the doorstep with the\ndoll. And she has already dressed it up in red rags, and was rocking it\nlike a little child, and singing a lullaby in her own language.\n\nAn old woman came out, gave her a scolding, snatched the doll away, broke\nit in pieces, and sent Dina to her work.\n\nZhilin made another doll, a still better one, and gave it to Dina.\n\nOne time Dina brought a little jug, put it down, took a seat, and looked at\nhim. Then she laughed, and pointed to the jug.\n\n"What is she so gay about?" thinks Zhilin.\n\nHe took the jug, and began to drink. He supposed that it was water, but it\nwas milk.\n\nHe drank up the milk.\n\n"Good," says he. How delighted Dina was! "Good, Ivan, good!"\n\nAnd she jumped up, clapped her hands, snatched the jug, and ran away. And\nfrom that time she began to bring him secretly fresh milk every day.\n\nNow, sometimes the Tatars would make cheesecakes out of goat\'s milk, and\ndry them on their roofs. Then she used to carry some of these cakes\nsecretly to him. And another time, when her father had killed a sheep, she\nbrought him a piece of mutton in her sleeve. She threw it down, and ran\naway.\n\nOne time there was a tremendous shower, and for a whole hour the rain\npoured as from buckets; and all the brooks grew roily. Wherever there had\nbeen a ford, the depth of the water increased to seven feet, and bowlders\nwere rolled along by it. Everywhere torrents were rushing, the mountains\nwere full of the roaring.\n\nNow, when the shower was over, streams were pouring all through the\nvillage. Zhilin asked his master for a knife, whittled out a cylinder and\nsome paddles, and made a water-wheel, and fastened manikins at the two\nends.\n\nThe little girls brought him some rags, and he dressed up the manikins, one\nlike a man, the other like a woman. He fastened them on, and put the wheel\nin a brook. The wheel revolved, and the dolls danced.\n\nThe whole village collected: the little boys and the little girls, the\nwomen, and even the Tatars, came and clucked with their tongues. "_Ai,\nUrus! ai, Ivan!_"\n\nAbdul had a Russian watch, which had been broken. He took it, and showed it\nto Zhilin, and clucked with his tongue. Zhilin said,--\n\n"Let me have it, I will fix it."\n\nHe took it, opened the penknife, took it apart. Then he put it together\nagain, and gave it back. The watch ran.\n\nThe Tatar was delighted, brought him his old beshmet which was all in rags,\nand gave it to him. Nothing else to be done,--he took it, and used it as a\ncovering at night.\n\nFrom that time, Zhilin\'s fame went abroad, that he was a "master." Even\nfrom distant villages, they came to him. One brought him a gun-lock or a\npistol to repair, another a watch.\n\nHis master furnished him with tools,--a pair of pincers and gimlets and a\nlittle file.\n\nOne time a Tatar fell ill; they came to Zhilin: "Come cure him!"\n\nZhilin knew nothing of medicine. He went, looked at the sick man, said to\nhimself, "Perhaps he will get well, anyway." He went into the barn, took\nwater and sand, and shook them up together. He whispered a few words to the\nwater in presence of the Tatars, and gave it to the sick man to drink.\n\nFortunately for him, the Tatar got well.\n\nZhilin had by this time learned something of their language. And some of\nthe Tatars became accustomed to him; when they wanted him, they called him\nby name, "Ivan, Ivan;" but others always looked at him as though he was a\nwild beast.\n\nThe red-bearded Tatar did not like Zhilin; when he saw him, he scowled and\nturned away, or else insulted him.\n\nThere was another old man among them; he did not live in the aul, but came\ndown from the mountain. Zhilin never saw him except when he came to the\nmosque to prayer. He was of small stature; on his cap, he wore a white\nhandkerchief as an ornament. His beard and mustaches were trimmed; they\nwere white as wool, and his face was wrinkled and brick-red. His nose was\nhooked like a hawk\'s, and his eyes were gray and cruel, and he had no teeth\nexcept two tusks.\n\nHe used to come in his turban, leaning on his staff, and glare like a\nwolf; whenever he saw Zhilin, he would snort, and turn his back.\n\nOne time Zhilin went to the mountain to see where the old man lived. He\ndescended a narrow path, and sees a little stone-walled garden. On the\nother side of the wall are cherry-trees, peach-trees, and a little hut with\na flat roof.\n\nHe went nearer; he sees bee-hives made of straw, and bees flying and\nhumming around them. And the old man is on his knees before the hives,\nhammering something.\n\nZhilin raised himself up, so as to get a better view, and his clog made a\nnoise.\n\nThe old man looked up,--squealed; he pulled his pistol from his belt, and\nfired at Zhilin, who had barely time to hide behind the wall.\n\nThe old man came to make his complaint to Zhilin\'s master. Abdul called him\nin, grinned, and asked him:\n\n"Why did you go to the old man\'s?"\n\n"I didn\'t do him any harm. I wanted to see how he lived."\n\nAbdul explained it to the old man; but he was angry, hissed, mumbled\nsomething, showed his tusks, and threatened Zhilin with his hands.\n\nZhilin did not understand it all; but he made out that the old man wished\nAbdul to kill the two Russians, and not have them in the aul.\n\nThe old man went off.\n\nZhilin began to ask his master, "Who is that old man?" And the master\nreplied,--\n\n"He is a great man. He used to be our first _jigit_; he has killed many\nRussians. He used to be rich. He had three wives and eight sons. All lived\nin one village. The Russians came, destroyed his village, and killed seven\nof his sons. One son was left, and surrendered to the Russians. The old man\nwent and gave himself up to the Russians also. He lived among them three\nmonths, found his son, killed him with his own hand, and escaped. Since\nthat time he has stopped fighting. He went to Mecca to pray to God, and\nthat\'s why he wears a turban. Whoever has been to Mecca is called a\n_hadji_, and wears a _chalma_. But he does not love you Russians. He has\nbade me kill you, but I don\'t intend to kill you. I have paid out money for\nyou, and besides, Ivan, I have come to like you. And so far from wishing to\nkill you, I would rather not let you go from me at all, if I had not given\nmy word."\n\nHe laughed, and began to repeat in Russian, "_Tvoya Ivan, khorosh, moya,\nAbdul, khorosh._"\n\n\nIV.\n\nThus Zhilin lived a month. In the daytime he walked about the aul or did\nsome handiwork, but when night came, and it grew quiet in the aul, he\nburrowed in his barn. It was hard work digging because of the stones, and\nhe sometimes had to use his file on them; and thus he dug a hole under the\nwall big enough to crawl through.\n\n"Only," he thought, "I must know the region a little first, so as to escape\nin the right direction. And the Tatars wouldn\'t tell me any thing."\n\nHe waited till one time when his master was absent, then he went after\ndinner behind the aul to a mountain. His idea was to reconnoitre the\ncountry.\n\nBut when Abdul returned he commanded a small boy to follow Zhilin, and not\ntake his eyes from him. The little fellow tagged after Zhilin, and kept\ncrying,--\n\n"Don\'t go there. Father won\'t allow it. I will call the men if you go!"\n\nZhilin began to reason with him. "I am not going far," says he,--"only to\nthat hill: I must get some herbs. Come with me; I can\'t run away with this\nclog. To-morrow I will make you a bow and arrows."\n\nHe persuaded the lad, they went together. To look at, the mountain is not\nfar, but it was hard work with the clog; he went a little distance at a\ntime, pulling himself up by main strength.\n\nZhilin sat down on the summit, and began to survey the ground.\n\nTo the south behind the barn lay a valley through which a herd was grazing,\nand another aul was in sight at the foot of it. Back of the village was\nanother hill still steeper, and back of that still another. Between the\nmountains lay a further stretch of forest, and then still other mountains\nconstantly rising higher and higher. And higher than all, stood snow-capped\npeaks white as sugar, and one snowy peak rose like a dome above them all.\n\nTo the east and west also were mountains. In every direction the smoke of\nauls was to be seen in the ravines.\n\n"Well," he said to himself, "this is all their country."\n\nHe began to look in the direction of the Russian possessions. At his very\nfeet was a little river, his village surrounded by gardens. By the river\nsome women, no larger in appearance than little dolls, were standing and\nwashing. Behind the aul was a lower mountain, and beyond it two other\nmountains covered with forests. And between the two mountains a plain\nstretched far, far away in the blue distance; and on the plain lay what\nseemed like smoke.\n\nZhilin tried to remember in what direction, when he lived at home in the\nfortress, the sun used to rise, and where it set. He looked. "Just about\nthere," says he, "in that valley, our fortress ought to be. There, between\nthose two mountains, I must make my escape."\n\nThe little sun began to slope toward the west. The snowy mountains changed\nfrom white to purple; the wooded mountains grew dark; a mist arose from\nthe valley; and the valley itself, where the Russian fortress must be,\nglowed in the sunset as though it were on fire. Zhilin strained his gaze.\nSomething seemed to hang waving in the air, like smoke arising from\nchimneys.\n\nAnd so it seemed to him that it must be from the fortress itself,--the\nRussian fortress.\n\nIt was already growing late. The voice of the mulla calling to prayer was\nheard. The herds began to return; the kine were lowing. The little lad kept\nrepeating, "Let us go!" but Zhilin could not tear himself away.\n\nThey returned home.\n\n"Well," thinks Zhilin, "now I know the place; I must make my escape."\n\nHe proposed to make his escape that very night. The nights were dark; it\nwas the wane of the moon.\n\nUnfortunately the Tatars returned in the evening. Usually they came in\ndriving the cattle with them, and came in hilarious. But this time they had\nno cattle; but they brought a Tatar, dead on his saddle. It was Kazi\nMuhamet\'s brother. They rode in solemnly, and collected for the burial.\n\nZhilin also went out to look.\n\nThey did not put the dead body in a coffin, but wrapped it in linen, and\nplaced it under a plane-tree in the village, where it lay on the sward.\n\nThe mulla came; the old men gathered together, their caps bound around with\nhandkerchiefs. They took off their shoes, and sat in rows on their heels\nbefore the dead.\n\nIn front was the mulla, behind him three old men in turbans, and behind\nthem the rest of the Tatars. The mulla lifted the dead man\'s head, and\nsaid, "Allah!" (That means God.) He said this one word, and let the head\nfall back. All were silent; they sat motionless.\n\nAgain the mulla lifted the head, saying, "Allah!" and all repeated it after\nhim,--\n\n"Allah!"\n\nThen silence again.\n\nThe dead man lay on the sward; he was motionless, and they sat as though\nthey were dead. Not one made a motion. The only sound was the rustling of\nthe foliage of the plane-tree, stirred by the breeze.\n\nThen the mulla offered a prayer. All got to their feet; they took the dead\nbody in their arms, and carried it away.\n\nThey brought it to a pit. The pit was not a mere hole, but was hollowed out\nunder the earth like a cellar.\n\nThey took the body under the armpits and by the legs, doubled it up, and\nlet it down gently, shoved it forcibly under the ground, and laid the arms\nalong the belly. The Nogai brought a green osier. They laid it in the pit;\nthen they quickly filled it up with earth, and over the dead man\'s head\nthey placed a gravestone. They smoothed the earth over, and again sat\naround the grave in rows. There was a long silence.\n\n"Allah! Allah! Allah!"\n\nThey sighed and got up. The red-bearded Tatar gave money to the old men,\nthen he got up, struck his forehead three times with a whip, and went home.\n\nThe next morning Zhilin sees the red-haired Tatar leading a mare through\nthe village, and three Tatars following him. They went behind the village.\nKazi Muhamet took off his beshmet, rolled up his sleeves,--his hands were\npowerful,--took out his dagger, and sharpened it on a whetstone. The Tatars\nheld back the mare\'s head. Kazi Muhamet approached, and cut the throat;\nthen he turned the animal over, and began to flay it, pulling away the hide\nwith his mighty fists.\n\nThe women and maidens came, and began to wash the intestines and the\nlights. Then they cut up the mare, and carried the meat to the hut. And the\nwhole village collected at the Kazi Muhamet\'s to celebrate the dead.\n\nFor three days they feasted on the mare and drank _buza_. Thus they\ncelebrated the dead. All the Tatars were at home.\n\nOn the fourth day about noon, Zhilin sees that they are collecting for some\nexpedition. Their horses are brought out. They put on their gear, and\nstarted off, ten men of them, under the command of the Kazi Muhamet; only\nAbdul staid at home. There was a new moon, but the nights were still dark.\n\n"Now," thinks Zhilin, "to-day we must escape." And he tells Kostuilin.\n\nBut Kostuilin was afraid. "How can we escape? We don\'t know the way."\n\n"I know the way."\n\n"But we should not get there during the night."\n\n"Well, if we don\'t get there we will spend the night in the woods. I have\nsome cakes. What are you going to do? It will be all right if they send you\nthe money, but you see, your friends may not collect so much. And the\nTatars are now angry because the Russians have killed one of their men.\nThey say they are thinking of killing us."\n\nKostuilin thought and thought. "All right, let us go!"\n\n\nV.\n\nZhilin crept down into his hole, and widened it so that Kostuilin also\ncould get through, and then they sat and waited till all should be quiet in\nthe aul.\n\nAs soon as the people were quiet in the aul, Zhilin crept under the wall,\nand came out on the other side. He whispers to Kostuilin, "Crawl under."\n\nKostuilin also crept under, but in doing so he hit a stone with his leg,\nand it made a noise.\n\nNow, the master had a brindled dog as a watch,--a most ferocious animal;\nthey called him Ulyashin.\n\nZhilin had been in the habit of feeding him. Ulyashin heard the noise, and\nbegan to bark and jump about, and the other dogs joined in.\n\nZhilin gave a little whistle, threw him a piece of cake. Ulyashin\nrecognized him, began to wag his tail, and ceased barking.\n\nAbdul had heard the disturbance, and cried from within the hut:--\n\n"_Hait! hait!_ Ulyashin."\n\nBut Zhilin scratched the dog behind the ears. The dog makes no more sound,\nrubs against his legs, and wags his tail.\n\nThey wait behind the corner.\n\nAll became silent again; the only sound was the bleating of a sheep in the\nfold, and far below them the water roaring over the pebbles.\n\nIt is dark, but the sky is studded with stars. Over the mountain the young\nmoon hung red, with its horns turned upward.\n\nIn the valleys a mist was rising, white as milk. Zhilin started up, and\nsaid to his comrade in Tatar, "Well, brother, _ai-da_!"\n\nThey set out again.\n\nBut as they get under way, they hear the call of the mulla on the\nminaret:--\n\n"_Allah! Bis\'m Allah! el Rakhman!_"\n\n"That means, the people will be going to the mosque."\n\nAgain they sat down and hid under the wall.\n\nThey sat there long, waiting until the people should pass. Again it grew\nstill.\n\n"Now for our fate!"\n\nThey crossed themselves, and started.\n\nThey went across the dvor, and down the steep bank to the stream, crossed\nthe stream, proceeded along the valley. The mist was thick, and closed in\nall around them, but above their heads the stars could still be seen.\n\nZhilin used the stars to guide him which way to go. It was cool in the\nmist, it was easy walking, only their boots were troublesome,--they were\nworn at the heels. Zhilin took his off, threw them away, and walked\nbarefoot. He sprang from stone to stone, and kept glancing at the stars.\n\nKostuilin began to grow weary. "Go slower," says he; "my boots chafe me, my\nwhole foot is raw."\n\n"Then take them off, it will be easier."\n\nKostuilin began to go barefoot, but that was still worse; he kept scraping\nhis feet on the stones and having to stop.\n\nZhilin said to him, "You may cut your feet, but you will save your life;\nbut if you are caught they will kill you, which would be worse."\n\nKostuilin said nothing, but crept along, groaning. For a long time they\nwent down the valley. Suddenly they hear dogs barking at the right. Zhilin\nhalted, looked around, climbed up the bank, and felt about with his hands.\n\n"_Ekh!_" says he, "we have made a mistake; we have gone too far to the\nright. Here is one of the enemy\'s villages. I could see it from the hill.\nWe must go back to the left, up the mountain. There must be a forest\nthere."\n\nBut Kostuilin objected. "Just wait a little while, let us get breath. My\nfeet are all blood."\n\n"Eh, brother! they will get well. You should walk more lightly. This way."\n\nAnd Zhilin turned back toward the left, and up hill toward the forest.\n\nKostuilin kept halting and groaning. Zhilin tried to hush him up, and still\nhastened on.\n\nThey climbed the mountain. And there they found the forest. They entered\nit; their clothes were all torn to pieces on the thorns. They found a\nlittle path through the woods. They walked along it.\n\n"Halt!"\n\nThere was the sound of hoofs on the path. They stopped to listen. It\nsounded like the tramping of a horse: then it also stopped. They set out\nonce more; again the tramping hoofs. When they stopped, it stopped.\n\nZhilin crept ahead, and investigated a light spot on the path.\n\nSomething is standing there. It may be a horse, or it may not, but on it\nthere is something strange, not at all like a man.\n\nIt snorted--plainly! "What a strange thing!"\n\nZhilin gave a slight whistle. There was a dash of feet from the path into\nthe forest, a crackling in the underbrush, and something rushed along like\na hurricane, with a crashing of dry boughs.\n\nKostuilin almost fell to the ground in fright. But Zhilin laughed, and\nsaid,--\n\n"That was a stag. Do you hear how it crashes through the woods with its\nhorns? We frightened him, and he frightened us."\n\nThey went on their way. Already the Great Bear was beginning to set; the\ndawn was not distant. And they were in doubt whether they should come out\nright or not. Zhilin was inclined to think that they were on the right\ntrack, and that it would be about ten versts farther before they reached\nthe Russian fortress, but there is no certain guide; you could not tell in\nthe night.\n\nThey came to a little clearing. Kostuilin sat down and said,--\n\n"Do as you please, but I will not go any farther; my legs won\'t carry me."\n\nZhilin tried to persuade him.\n\n"No," says he, "I won\'t go, I can\'t go."\n\nZhilin grew angry; he threatens him, he scolds him.\n\n"Then I will go on without you. Good-by!"\n\nKostuilin jumped up and followed. They went four versts farther. The fog\nbegan to grow thicker in the forest. Nothing could be seen before them; the\nstars were barely visible.\n\nSuddenly they hear the tramping of a horse just in front of them; they can\nhear his shoes striking on the stones.\n\nZhilin threw himself down on his belly, and tried to listen by laying his\near to the ground.\n\n"Yes, it is,--it is some one on horseback coming in our direction."\n\nThey slipped off to one side of the road, crouched down in the bushes, and\nwaited. Zhilin crept close to the path, and looked.\n\nHe sees a mounted Tatar riding along, driving a cow. The man is muttering\nto himself. When the Tatar had ridden by, Zhilin returned to Kostuilin.\n\n"Well, God has saved us. Up with you! Come along!"\n\nKostuilin tried to rise, and fell back.\n\n"I can\'t; by God, I can\'t. My strength is all gone."\n\nThe man was as though he were drunk. He was all of a sweat; and as they\nwere surrounded by the cold fog, and his feet were torn, he was quite used\nup. Zhilin tried to lift him by main force. Then Kostuilin cried, "_Ai!_ it\nhurt."\n\nZhilin was frightened to death.\n\n"What are you screaming for? Don\'t you know that Tatar is near? He will\nhear you." But he said to himself, "Now he is really played out, what can I\ndo with him? I can\'t abandon a comrade. Now," says he, "get up; climb on my\nback. I will carry you if you can\'t walk any longer." He took Kostuilin on\nhis shoulders, holding him by the thighs, and went along the path with his\nburden. "Only," says he, "don\'t put your hands on my throat, for Christ\'s\nsake! Lean on my shoulders."\n\nIt was hard for Zhilin. His feet were also bloody, and he was weary. He\nstopped, and made it a little easier for himself by setting Kostuilin down,\nand getting him better mounted. Then he went on again.\n\nEvidently the Tatar had heard them when Kostuilin screamed. Zhilin caught\nthe sound of some one following them and shouting in his language. Zhilin\nput into the bushes. The Tatar aimed his gun; he fired it off, but missed;\nbegan to whine in his native tongue, and galloped up the path.\n\n"Well," says Zhilin, "we are lost, brother. The dog,--he will be right back\nwith a band of Tatars on our track.... If we don\'t succeed in putting three\nversts between us, we are lost." And he thinks to himself, "The devil take\nit, that I had to bring this clod along with me! Alone, I should have got\nthere long ago."\n\nKostuilin said, "Go alone. Why should you be lost on my account?"\n\n"No, I will not go; it would not do to abandon a comrade." He lifted him\nagain on his shoulder, and started on. Thus he made a verst. It was forest\nall the way, and no sign of outlet. But the fog was now beginning to lift,\nand seemed to be floating away in little clouds: not a star could be seen.\nZhilin was tired out.\n\nA little spring gushed out by the road: it was walled in with stones. There\nhe stopped, and dropped Kostuilin.\n\n"Let me rest a little," says he, "and get a drink. We will eat our cakes.\nIt can\'t be very far now."\n\nHe had just stretched himself out to drink, when the sound of hoofs was\nheard behind them. Again they hid in the bushes at the right under the\ncrest, and crouched down.\n\nThey heard Tatar voices. The Tatars stopped at the very spot where they had\nturned in from the road. After discussing a while, they seemed to be\nsetting dogs on the scent.\n\nThe refugees hear the sound of a crashing through the bushes: a strange dog\ncomes directly to them. He stops and barks.\n\nThe Tatars followed on their track. They are also strangers.\n\nThey seized them, bound them, lifted them on horses, and carried them off.\n\nAfter they had ridden three versts, Abdul, with two Tatars, met them. He\nsaid something to their new captors. They were transferred to Abdul\'s\nhorses, and were brought back to the aul.\n\nAbdul was no longer grinning, and he said not a word to them.\n\nThey reached the village at daybreak; the prisoners were left in the\nstreet. The children gathered around them, tormenting them with stones and\nwhips, and howling.\n\nThe Tatars gathered around them in a circle, and the old man from the\nmountain was among them. They began to discuss. Zhilin made out that they\nwere deciding on what should be done with them. Some said that they ought\nto be sent farther into the mountains, but the old man declared that they\nmust be killed. Abdul argued against it. Says he, "I have paid out money\nfor them, I shall get a ransom for them."\n\nBut the old man said, "They won\'t pay any thing; it will only be an injury\nto us. And it is a sin to keep Russians alive. Kill them, and that is the\nend of it."\n\nThey separated. Abdul came to Zhilin, and reported the decision.\n\n"If," says he, "the ransom is not sent in two weeks, you will be flogged.\nAnd if you try to run away again, I will kill you like a dog. Write your\nletter, and write it good!"\n\nPaper was brought them; they wrote their letters. Clogs were put on their\nfeet again; they were taken behind the mosque.... There was a pit twelve\nfeet[102] deep, and they were thrust down into this pit.\n\n[Footnote 102: Five arshins, 11.65 feet.]\n\n\nVI.\n\nLife was made utterly wretched for them. Their clogs were not taken off\neven at night, and they were not let out at all.\n\nUnbaked dough was thrown down to them as though they were dogs, and water\nwas let down in a jug. In the pit it was damp and suffocating.\n\nKostuilin became ill, and swelled up, and had rheumatism all over his body,\nand he groaned or slept all the time.\n\nEven Zhilin lost his spirits; he sees that they are in desperate straits.\nAnd he does not know how to get out.\n\nHe had begun to make an excavation, but there was nowhere to hide the\nearth; Abdul discovered it, and threatened to kill him.\n\nHe was squatting down one time in the pit, and thinking about life and\nliberty, and he grew sad.\n\nSuddenly a cake[103] fell directly into his lap, then another, and some\ncherries followed. He looked up, and there was Dina. She peered down at\nhim, laughed, and then ran away. And Zhilin began to conjecture, "Couldn\'t\nDina help me?"\n\n[Footnote 103: _lepyoshka._]\n\nHe cleared out a little place in the pit, picked up some clay, and made\nsome dolls. He made men and women, horses and dogs; he said to himself,\n"When Dina comes, I will give them to her."\n\nBut Dina did not make her appearance on the next day. And Zhilin hears the\ntrampling of horses\' hoofs: men came riding up: the Tatars collected at the\nmosque, arguing, shouting, and talking about the Russians.\n\nThe voice of the old man was heard. Zhilin could not understand very well,\nbut he made out that the Russians were somewhere near, and the Tatars were\nafraid that they would attack the aul, and they did not know what to do\nwith the prisoners.\n\nThey talked a while, and went away. Suddenly Zhilin heard a rustling at the\nedge of the pit.\n\nHe sees Dina squatting on her heels, with her knees higher than her head;\nshe leaned over, her necklace hung down and swung over the pit. And her\nlittle eyes twinkled like stars. She took from her sleeve two cheesecakes,\nand threw them down to him. Zhilin accepted them, and said, "Why did you\nstay away so long? I have been making you some dolls. Here they are." He\nbegan to toss them up to her one at a time.\n\nBut she shook her head, and would not look at them. "I can\'t take them,"\nsaid she. She said nothing more for a time, but sat there: then she said,\n"Ivan, they want to kill you."\n\nShe made a significant motion across her throat.\n\n"Who wants to kill me?"\n\n"Father. The old man has ordered him to. But I am sorry for you."\n\nAnd Zhilin said, "Well, then, if you are sorry for me, bring me a long\nstick." She shook her head, meaning that it was impossible.\n\nHe clasped his hands in supplication to her. "Dina, please! Bring one to\nme, Dinushka!"\n\n"I can\'t," said she. "They would see me; they are all at home." And she ran\naway.\n\nAfterwards, Zhilin was sitting there in the evening, and wondering what he\nshould do. He kept raising his eyes. He could see the stars, but the moon\nwas not yet up. The mulla uttered his call, then all became silent.\n\nZhilin began already to doze, thinking to himself, "The little maid is\nafraid."\n\nSuddenly a piece of clay fell on his head; he glanced up; a long pole was\nsliding over the edge of the pit, it slid out, began to descend toward him,\nit reached the bottom of the pit. Zhilin was delighted. He seized it,\npulled it along,--it was a strong pole. He had noticed it before on Abdul\'s\nroof.\n\nHe gazed up; the stars were shining high in the heavens, and Dina\'s eyes,\nat the edge of the pit, gleamed in the darkness like a cat\'s.\n\nShe craned her head over, and whispered, "Ivan, Ivan." And she waved her\nhands before her face, meaning, "Softly, please."\n\n"What is it?" said Zhilin.\n\n"All have gone, there are only two at home."\n\nAnd Zhilin said, "Well, Kostuilin, let us go, let us make our last attempt.\nI will help you."\n\nKostuilin, however, would not hear to it.\n\n"No," says he, "it is not meant for me to get away from here. How could I\ngo when I haven\'t even strength to turn over?"\n\n"All right, then. Good-by.[104] Don\'t think me unkind."\n\n[Footnote 104: _proshchai._]\n\nHe kissed Kostuilin.\n\nHe clasped the pole, told Dina to hold it firmly, and tried to climb up.\nTwice he fell back,--his clog so impeded him. Kostuilin boosted him; he\nmanaged to get to the top: Dina pulled on the sleeves of his shirt with all\nher might, laughing heartily.\n\nZhilin pulled up the pole, and said, "Carry it back to its place, Dina, for\nif they found it they would flog you."\n\nShe dragged off the pole, and Zhilin began to go down the mountain. When he\nhad reached the bottom of the cliff, he took a sharp stone, and tried to\nbreak the padlock of his clog. But the lock was strong; he could not strike\nit fairly.\n\nHe hears some one hurrying down the hill, with light, skipping steps. He\nthinks, "That is probably Dina again."\n\nDina ran to him, took a stone, and says, "Let me try it."\n\nShe knelt down, and began to work with all her might. But her hands were as\ndelicate as osiers. She had no strength. She threw down the stone, and\nburst into tears.\n\nZhilin again tried to break the lock, and Dina squatted by his side, and\nleaned against his shoulder. Zhilin glanced up, and saw at the left behind\nthe mountain a red glow like a fire; it was the moon just rising.\n\n"Well," he says to himself, "I must cross the valley and get into the woods\nbefore the moon rises." He stood up, and threw away the stone. No matter\nfor the clog--he must take it with him.\n\n"Good-by," says he. "Dinushka, I shall always remember you."\n\nDina clung to him, reached with her hands for a place to stow away some\ncakes. He took the cakes.\n\n"Thank you," said he: "you are a thoughtful darling. Who will make you\ndolls after I am gone?" and he stroked her hair.\n\nDina burst into tears, hid her face in her hands, and scrambled up the\nhillside like a kid. He could hear, in the darkness, the jingling of the\ncoins on her braids.\n\nZhilin crossed himself, picked up the lock of his clog so that it might not\nmake a noise, and started on his way, dragging his leg all the time, and\nkeeping his eyes constantly on the glow where the moon was rising.\n\nHe knew the way. He had eight versts to go in a direct course, but he would\nhave to strike into the forest before the moon came entirely up. He crossed\nthe stream, and now the light was increasing behind the mountain.\n\nHe proceeded along the valley: it was growing light. He walks along,\nconstantly glancing around; but still the moon was not visible. The glow\nwas now changing to white light, and one side of the valley grew brighter\nand brighter. The shadow crept away from the mountain till it reached its\nvery foot.\n\nZhilin still hurried along, all the time keeping to the shadow.\n\nHe hurries as fast as he can, but the moon rises still faster; and now, at\nthe right, the mountain-tops are illuminated.\n\nHe struck into the forest just as the moon rose above the mountains. It\nbecame as light and white as day. On the trees all the leaves were visible.\nIt was warm and bright on the mountain-side; every thing seemed as though\nit were dead. The only sound was the roaring of a torrent far below. He\nwalked along in the forest; he had met no one. Zhilin found a little spot\nin the forest where it was still darker, and began to rest.\n\nWhile he rested he ate one of his cakes. He procured a stone and once more\ntried to break the padlock, but he only bruised his hands, and failed to\nbreak the lock.\n\nHe arose and went on his way. When he had gone a verst his strength gave\nout, his feet were sore. He had to walk ten steps at a time, and then rest.\n\n"There\'s nothing to be done for it," says he to himself. "I will push on as\nlong as my strength holds out; for if I sit down, then I shall not get up\nagain. If I do not reach the fortress before it is daylight, then I will\nlie down in the woods and spend the day, and start on to-morrow night\nagain."\n\nHe walked all night. Once he passed two Tatars on horseback, but he heard\nthem at some distance, and hid behind a tree.\n\nAlready the moon was beginning to pale, the dew had fallen, it was near\ndawn, and Zhilin had not reached the end of the forest.\n\n"Well," says he to himself, "I will go thirty steps farther, strike into\nthe forest, and sit down."\n\nHe went thirty steps, and sees the end of the forest. He went to the edge;\nit was broad daylight. Before him, as on the palm of his hand, were the\nsteppe and the fortress; and on the left, not far away on the\nmountain-side, fires were burning, or dying out; the smoke rose, and men\nwere moving around the watch-fires.\n\nHe looks, and sees the gleaming of fire-arms: Cossacks, soldiers!\n\nZhilin was overjoyed.\n\nHe gathered his remaining strength, and walked down the mountain. And he\nsays to himself, "God help me, if a mounted Tatar should get sight of me on\nthis bare field! I should not escape him, even though I am so near." Even\nwhile these thoughts are passing through his mind, he sees at the left, on\na hillock not fourteen hundred feet away, three Tatars on the watch. They\ncaught sight of him,--bore down upon him. Then his heart failed within him.\nWaving his arms, he shouted at the top of his voice, "Brothers! help,\nbrothers!"\n\nOur men heard him,--mounted Cossacks dashed out toward him. The Cossacks\nwere far off, the Tatars near. And now Zhilin collected his last remaining\nenergies, seized his clog with his hand, ran toward the Cossacks, and,\nwithout any consciousness of feeling, crossed himself and cried, "Brothers,\nbrothers, brothers!"\n\nThe Cossacks were fifteen in number.\n\nThe Tatars were dismayed. Before they reached him, they stopped short. And\nZhilin reached the Cossacks.\n\nThe Cossacks surrounded him, and questioned him: "Who are you?" "What is\nyour name?" "Where did you come from?"\n\nBut Zhilin was almost beside himself; he wept, and kept on shouting,\n"Brothers, brothers!"\n\nThe soldiers hastened up, and gathered around him; one brought him bread,\nanother kasha-gruel, another vodka, another threw a cloak around him, still\nanother broke his chains.\n\nThe officers recognized him, they brought him into the fortress. The\nsoldiers were delighted, his comrades pressed into Zhilin\'s room.\n\nZhilin told them what had happened to him, and he ended his tale with the\nwords,--\n\n"That\'s the way I went home and got married! No, I see that such is not to\nbe my fate."\n\nAnd he remained in the service in the Caucasus.\n\nAt the end of a month Kostuilin was ransomed for five thousand rubles.\n\nHe was brought home scarcely alive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nCOUNT TOLSTOI\'S WORKS.\n\n\nANNA KARENINA                     $1.75\n\nCHILDHOOD, BOYHOOD, AND YOUTH      1.50\n\nIVAN ILYITCH                       1.25\n\nMY RELIGION                        1.00\n\nMY CONFESSION                      1.00\n\nWHAT TO DO?                        1.25\n\nTHE INVADERS                       1.25\n\nA RUSSIAN PROPRIETOR               1.50\n\n\nTHOMAS Y CROWELL & CO.,\nPUBLISHERS.\n\n13 ASTOR PLACE, NEW YORK.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nCOUNT TOLSTOI\'S WORKS.\n\n\nThe demand for these Russian stories has but just fairly begun; but it is a\nliterary movement more widespread, more intense, than anything this country\nhas probably seen within the past quarter of a century.--_Boston\nTraveller._\n\n\n     ANNA KARENINA. 12mo, $1.75.\n\n     "Will take rank among the great works of fiction of the\n     age."--_Portland Transcript._\n\n     "As you read on, you say not, \'This is _like_ life\' but\n     \'This _is_ life.\'"--_W.

It is a world, and you live in it while you\n     read, and long afterward; but at no step have you been\n     betrayed, not because your guide has warned or exhorted you,\n     but because he has been true, and has shown you all things\n     as they are."--_W. D. Howells, in Harpers\' Monthly._\n\n     "The power of this book lies in the author\'s supreme control\n     of the influences which affect human action, in his vivid\n     apprehension of the operation of inexorable law, in his\n     intuitive knowledge of the action and reaction of spiritual\n     conditions. With a noble art he throws against the shadow,\n     that deepens ever to the end, a radiant soul development\n     that serenely grows brighter till we know it is Tolstoi\n     himself, his experience, his best. It is a great book, and\n     of such creations the most sincere admiration falls sadly\n     short of fitting expression."--_Washington Post._\n\n     "The effect of the whole is stimulating and elevating.

N. Tolstoi\'s collected works, and are representative of his\nliterary activity between 1852 and 1859.\n\nThe first story, though only a fragment of a projected novel to be called\n"A Russian Proprietor," is perfect and complete in itself. One cannot help\nfeeling that it is autobiographical; Count Tolstoi himself, it will be\nremembered, having suddenly quitted the University of Kazan, in spite of\nthe entreaties of his friends, and retired to his paternal estate of\nYasnaya Polyana, near Tula. The aunt whose letter is quoted in the first\nchapter must have been Count Tolstoi\'s aunt, mentioned in the second\nchapter of "My Confession."\n\nThe "Recollections of a Scorer" and "Two Hussars" are both evidently\nreminiscent of Count Tolstoi\'s gambling-days. Both must have been suggested\nby some such terrible experience as that told of the count\'s gambling-debt\nin the Caucasus.\n\n"Lucerne" and "Albert" are likewise evidently transcripts from the author\'s\nown experience. The strange benefactor in each, and the shadowy Prince\nNekhliudof, are all Count Tolstoi in phases quite distinct from what he is\nat present.\n\n"The Three Deaths," written in 1859, has little of the sombre power of\n"Ivan Ilyitch." The scalpel which was so remorselessly applied to the soul\nin the latter is wholly hidden. It is realism pure and simple; and the\ncontrast between the death of the peasant and of the lady is left to\ninference, made all the stronger by the unexpected and grandiose finale in\nthe death of the tree.\n\nIn interesting contrast to these characteristic stories is the little gem\nentitled "A Prisoner in the Caucasus," which is found in Vol. IV. of the\nCount\'s works under the heading "Tales for Children." The style is\nperfectly simple and lucid; the pictures of life in the Tatar village among\nthe mountains are intensely vivid, painted with strong and masterly\ntouches; and the reader will not soon forget the little laughing maiden\nDina, with the rubles jingling in her braided hair. She stands forth as one\nof the most fascinating of the author\'s creations.\n\nNATHAN HASKELL DOLE.\n\nBOSTON, Dec. 5, 1887.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS.\n\n\n                               PAGE\n\nA RUSSIAN PROPRIETOR              1\n\nLUCERNE                          87\n\nRECOLLECTIONS OF A SCORER       123\n\nALBERT                          148\n\nTWO HUSSARS                     190\n\nTHREE DEATHS                    286\n\nA PRISONER IN THE CAUCASUS      308\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nA RUSSIAN PROPRIETOR.\n\n\nI.\n\nPrince Nekhliudof was nineteen years of age when, at the end of his third\nterm at the university, he came to spend his summer vacation on his estate.\nHe was alone there all the summer.\n\nIn the autumn he wrote in his unformed, boyish hand, a letter to his aunt,\nthe Countess Bieloretskaia, who, according to his notion, was his best\nfriend, and the most genial woman in the world. The letter was in French,\nand was to the following effect:--\n\n     "DEAR AUNTIE,--I have adopted a resolution upon which must\n     depend the fate of my whole existence. I have left the\n     university in order to devote myself to a country life,\n     because I feel that I was born for it. For God\'s sake, dear\n     auntie, don\'t make sport of me. You say that I am young.\n     Perhaps I am still almost a child; but this does not prevent\n     me from feeling sure of my vocation, from wishing to\n     accomplish it successfully, and from loving it.\n\n     "As I have already written you, I found our affairs in\n     indescribable confusion. Wishing to bring order out of\n     chaos, I made an investigation, and discovered that the\n     principal trouble was due to the most wretched miserable\n     condition of the peasants, and that this trouble could be\n     remedied only by work and patience.\n\n     "If you could only see two of my peasants, David and Ivan,\n     and the way that they and their families live, I am\n     convinced that one glance at these two unfortunates would do\n     more to persuade you than all that I can tell you in\n     justification of my resolve. Is not my obligation sacred and\n     clear, to labor for the welfare of these seven hundred human\n     beings for whom I must be responsible to God? Would it not\n     be a sin to leave them to the mercy of harsh elders and\n     overseers, so as to carry out plans of enjoyment or\n     ambition? And why should I seek in any other sphere the\n     opportunity of being useful, and doing good, when such a\n     noble, brilliant, and paramount duty lies right at hand?\n\n     "I feel that I am capable of being a good farmer;[1] and in\n     order to make myself such an one as I understand the word to\n     mean, I do not need my diploma as B.A., nor the rank which\n     you so expect of me. Dear auntie, do not make ambitious\n     plans for me: accustom yourself to the thought that I am\n     going on an absolutely peculiar path, but one that is good,\n     and, I think, will bring me to happiness. I have thought and\n     thought about my future duties, have written out some rules\n     of conduct, and, if God only gives me health and strength, I\n     shall succeed in my undertaking.\n\n     [Footnote 1: _khozyain_.]\n\n     "Do not show this letter to my brother Vasya: I am afraid of\n     his ridicule. He generally dictates to me, and I am\n     accustomed to give way to him. Whilst Vanya may not approve\n     of my resolve, at least he will understand it."\n\nThe countess replied to her nephew in the following letter, also written in\nFrench:--\n\n     "Your letter, dear Dmitri, showed nothing else to me than\n     that you have a warm heart; and I have never had reason to\n     doubt that. But, my dear, our good tendencies do us more\n     harm in life than our bad ones. I will not tell you that you\n     are committing a folly, that your behavior annoys me; but I\n     will do my best to make one argument have an effect upon\n     you. Let us reason together, my dear.\n\n     "You say you feel that your vocation is for a country life;\n     that you wish to make your serfs happy, and that you hope to\n     be a good farmer.\n\n     "In the first place, I must tell you that we feel sure of\n     our vocation only when we have once made a mistake in one;\n     secondly, that it is easier to win happiness for ourselves\n     than for others; and thirdly, that, in order to be a good\n     master, it is necessary to be a cold and austere man, which\n     you will never in this world succeed in being, even though\n     you strive to make believe that you are.\n\n     "You consider your arguments irresistible, and go so far as\n     to adopt them as rules for the conduct of life; but at my\n     age, my dear, people don\'t care for arguments and rules, but\n     only for experience. Now, experience tells me that your\n     plans are childish.\n\n     "I am now in my fiftieth year, and I have known many fine\n     men; but I have never heard of a young man of good family\n     and ability burying himself in the country under the pretext\n     of doing good.\n\n     "You have always wished to appear original, but your\n     originality is nothing else than morbidly developed egotism.\n     And, my dear, choose some better-trodden path. It will lead\n     you to success; and success, if it is not necessary for you\n     as success, is at least indispensable in giving you the\n     possibility of doing good which you desire. The poverty of a\n     few serfs is an unavoidable evil, or, rather, an evil which\n     cannot be remedied by forgetting all your obligations to\n     society, to your relatives, and to yourself.\n\n     "With your intellect, with your kind heart, and your love\n     for virtue, no career would fail to bring you success; but\n     at all events choose one which would be worth your while,\n     and bring you honor.\n\n     "I believe that you are sincere, when you say that you are\n     free from ambition; but you are deceiving yourself. Ambition\n     is a virtue at your age, and with your means it becomes a\n     fault and an absurdity when a man is no longer in the\n     condition to satisfy this passion.\n\n     "And you will experience this if you do not change your\n     intention. Good-by, dear Mitya. It seems to me that I have\n     all the more love for you on account of your foolish but\n     still noble and magnanimous plan. Do as you please, but I\n     forewarn you that I shall not be able to sympathize with\n     you."\n\nThe young man read this letter, considered it long and seriously, and\nfinally, having decided that his genial aunt might be mistaken, sent in his\npetition for dismissal from the university, and took up his residence at\nhis estate.\n\n\nII.\n\nThe young proprietor had, as he wrote his aunt, devised a plan of action in\nthe management of his estate; and his whole life and activity were measured\nby hours, days, and months.\n\nSunday was reserved for the reception of petitioners, domestic servants,\nand peasants, for the visitation of the poor serfs belonging to the estate,\nand the distribution of assistance with the approval of the Commune, which\nmet every Sunday evening, and was obliged to decide who should have help,\nand what amount should be given.\n\nIn such employments passed more than a year, and the young man was now no\nlonger a novice either in the practical or theoretical knowledge of estate\nmanagement.\n\nIt was a clear July Sunday when Nekhliudof, having finished his coffee and\nrun through a chapter of "Maison Rustique," put his note-book and a packet\nof bank-notes into the pocket of his light overcoat, and started out of\ndoors. It was a great country-house with colonnades and terraces where he\nlived, but he occupied only one small room on the ground floor. He made his\nway over the neglected, weed-grown paths of the old English garden, toward\nthe village, which was distributed along both sides of the highway.\n\nNekhliudof was a tall, slender young man, with long, thick, wavy auburn\nhair, with a bright gleam in his dark eyes, a clear complexion, and rosy\nlips where the first down of young manhood was now beginning to appear.\n\nIn all his motions and gait, could be seen strength, energy, and the\ngood-natured self-satisfaction of youth.\n\nThe serfs, in variegated groups, were returning from church: old men,\nmaidens, children, mothers with babies in their arms, dressed in their\nSunday best, were scattering to their homes; and as they met the barin they\nbowed low and made room for him to pass.\n\nAfter Nekhliudof had walked some distance along the street, he stopped, and\ndrew from his pocket his note-book, on the last page of which, inscribed in\nhis own boyish hand, were a number of names of his serfs with memoranda. He\nread, "_Ivan Churis asks for aid_;" and then, proceeding still farther\nalong the street, entered the gate of the second hut[2] on the right.\n\n[Footnote 2: _izba_.]\n\nChuris\'s domicile consisted of a half-decayed structure, with musty\ncorners; the sides were rickety. It was so buried in the ground, that the\nbanking, made of earth and dung, almost hid the two windows. The one on the\nfront had a broken sash, and the shutters were half torn away; the other\nwas small and low, and was stuffed with flax. A boarded entry with rotting\nsills and low door, another small building still older and still\nlower-studded than the entry, a gate, and a barn were clustered about the\nprincipal hut.\n\nAll this had once been covered by one irregular roof; but now only over the\neaves hung the thick straw, black and decaying. Above, in places, could be\nseen the frame-work and rafters.\n\nIn front of the yard were a well with rotten curb, the remains of a post,\nand the wheel, and a mud-puddle stirred up by the cattle where some ducks\nwere splashing.\n\nNear the well stood two old willows, split and broken, with their\nwhitish-green foliage. They were witnesses to the fact that some one, some\ntime, had taken interest in beautifying this place. Under one of them sat a\nfair-haired girl of seven summers, watching another little girl of two, who\nwas creeping at her feet. The watch-dog gambolling about them, as soon as\nhe saw the barin, flew headlong under the gate, and there set up a\nquavering yelp expressive of panic.\n\n"Ivan at home?" asked Nekhliudof.\n\nThe little girl seemed stupefied at this question, and kept opening her\neyes wider and wider, but made no reply. The baby opened her mouth, and set\nup a yell.\n\nA little old woman, in a torn checkered skirt, belted low with an old red\ngirdle, peered out of the door, and also said nothing. Nekhliudof\napproached the entry, and repeated his inquiry.\n\n"Yes, he\'s at home," replied the little old woman in a quavering voice,\nbowing low, and evincing timidity and agitation.\n\nAfter Nekhliudof had asked after her health, and passed through the entry\ninto the little yard, the old woman, resting her chin in her hand, went to\nthe door, and, without taking her eyes off the barin, began gently to shake\nher head.\n\nThe yard was in a wretched condition, with heaps of old blackened manure\nthat had not been carried away: on the manure were thrown in confusion a\nrotting block, pitchforks, and two harrows.\n\nThere were pent-houses around the yard, under one side of which stood a\nwooden plough, a cart without a wheel, and a pile of empty\ngood-for-nothing bee-hives thrown one upon another. The roof was in\ndisrepair; and one side had fallen in so that the covering in front rested,\nnot on the supports, but on the manure.\n\nChuris, with the edge and head of an axe, was breaking off the wattles that\nstrengthened the roof. Ivan was a peasant, fifty years of age. In stature,\nhe was short. The features of his tanned oval face, framed in a dark auburn\nbeard and hair where a trace of gray was beginning to appear, were handsome\nand expressive. His dark blue eyes gleamed with intelligence and lazy\ngood-nature, from under half-shut lids. His small, regular mouth, sharply\ndefined under his sandy thin mustache when he smiled, betrayed a calm\nself-confidence, and a certain bantering indifference toward all around\nhim.\n\nBy the roughness of his skin, by his deep wrinkles, by the veins that stood\nout prominently on his neck, face, and hands, by his unnatural stoop and\nthe crooked position of his legs, it was evident that all his life had been\nspent in hard work, far beyond his strength.\n\nHis garb consisted of white hempen drawers, with blue patches on the knees,\nand a dirty shirt of the same material, which kept hitching up his back and\narms. The shirt was belted low in the waist by a girdle, from which hung a\nbrass key.\n\n"Good-day," said the barin, as he stepped into the yard. Churis glanced\naround, and kept on with his work; making energetic motions, he finished\nclearing away the wattles from under the shed, and then only, having struck\nthe axe into the block, he came out into the middle of the yard.\n\n"A pleasant holiday, your excellency!" said he, bowing low and smoothing\nhis hair.\n\n"Thanks, my friend. I came to see how your affairs[3] were progressing,"\nsaid Nekhliudof with boyish friendliness and timidity, glancing at the\npeasant\'s garb. "Just show me what you need in the way of supports that you\nasked me about at the last meeting."\n\n"Supports, of course, sir, your excellency, sir.[4] I should like it fixed\na little here, sir, if you will have the goodness to cast your eye on it:\nhere this corner has given way, sir, and only by the mercy of God the\ncattle didn\'t happen to be there. It barely hangs at all," said Churis,\ngazing with an expressive look at his broken-down, ramshackly, and ruined\nsheds. "Now the girders and the supports and the rafters are nothing but\nrot; you won\'t see a sound timber. But where can we get lumber nowadays, I\nshould like to know?"\n\n[Footnote 3: _khozyaistvo._]\n\n[Footnote 4: _batiushka._]\n\n"Well, what do you want with the five supports when the one shed has fallen\nin? the others will be soon falling in too, won\'t they? You need to have\nevery thing made new,--rafters and girders and posts; but you don\'t want\nsupports," said the barin, evidently priding himself on his comprehension\nof the case.\n\nChuris made no reply.\n\n"Of course you need lumber, but not supports. You ought to have told me\nso."\n\n"Surely I do, but there\'s nowhere to get it. Not all of us can come to the\nmanor-house. If we all should get into the habit of coming to the\nmanor-house and asking your excellency for every thing we wanted, what kind\nof serfs should we be? But if your kindness went so far as to let me have\nsome of the oak saplings that are lying idle over by the threshing-floor,"\nsaid the peasant, making a low bow and scraping with his foot, "then,\nmaybe, I might exchange some, and piece out others, so that the old would\nlast some time longer."\n\n"What is the good of the old? Why, you just told me that it was all old and\nrotten. This part has fallen in to-day; to-morrow, that one will; the day\nafter, a third. So, if any thing is to be done, it must be all made new, so\nthat the work may not be wasted. Now tell me what you think about it. Can\nyour premises[5] last out this winter, or not?"\n\n"Who can tell?"\n\n"No, but what do you think? Will they fall in, or not?"\n\nChuris meditated for a moment. "Can\'t help falling in," said he suddenly.\n\n"Well, now you see you had better have said that at the meeting, that you\nneeded to rebuild your whole place,[5] instead of a few props. You see, I\nshould be glad to help you."\n\n[Footnote 5: _dvor._]\n\n"Many thanks for your kindness," replied Churis, in an incredulous tone and\nnot looking at the barin. "If you would give me four joists and some props,\nthen, perhaps, I might fix things up myself; but if any one is hunting\nafter good-for-nothing timbers, then he\'d find them in the joists of the\nhut."\n\n"Why, is your hut so wretched as all that?"\n\n"My old woman and I are expecting it to fall in on us any day," replied\nChuris indifferently. "A day or two ago, a girder fell from the ceiling,\nand struck my old woman."\n\n"What! struck her?"\n\n"Yes, struck her, your excellency: whacked her on the back, so that she lay\nhalf dead all night."\n\n"Well, did she get over it?"\n\n"Pretty much, but she\'s been ailing ever since; but then she\'s always\nailing."\n\n"What, are you sick?" asked Nekhliudof of the old woman, who had been\nstanding all the time at the door, and had begun to groan as soon as her\nhusband mentioned her.\n\n"It bothers me here more and more, especially on Sundays," she replied,\npointing to her dirty lean bosom.\n\n"Again?" asked the young master in a tone of vexation, shrugging his\nshoulders. "Why, if you are so sick, don\'t you come and get advice at the\ndispensary? That is what the dispensary was built for. Haven\'t you been\ntold about it?"\n\n"Certainly we have, but I have not had any time to spare; have had to work\nin the field, and at home, and look after the children, and no one to help\nme; if I weren\'t all alone"....\n\n\nIII.\n\nNekhliudof went into the hut. The uneven smoke-begrimed walls of the\ndwelling were hung with various rags and clothes; and, in the living-room,\nwere literally covered with reddish cockroaches clustering around the holy\nimages and benches.\n\nIn the middle of this dark, fetid apartment, not fourteen feet square, was\na huge crack in the ceiling; and in spite of the fact that it was braced up\nin two places, the ceiling hung down so that it threatened to fall from\nmoment to moment.\n\n"Yes, the hut is very miserable," said the barin, looking into the face of\nChuris, who, it seems, had not cared to speak first about this state of\nthings.\n\n"It will crush us to death; it will crush the children," said the woman in\na tearful voice, attending to the stove which stood under the loft.\n\n"Hold your tongue," cried Churis sternly; and with a slight smile playing\nunder his mustaches, he turned to the master. "And I haven\'t the wit to\nknow what\'s to be done with it, your excellency,--with this hut and props\nand planks. There\'s nothing to be done with them."\n\n"How can we live through the winter here? _Okh, okh!_ Oh, oh!" groaned the\nold woman.\n\n"There\'s one thing--if we put in some more props and laid a new floor,"\nsaid the husband, interrupting her with a calm, practical expression, "and\nthrew over one set of rafters, then perhaps we might manage to get through\nthe winter. It is possible to live; but you\'d have to put some props all\nover the hut, like that: but if it gets shaken, then there won\'t be any\nthing left of it. As long as it stands, it holds together," he concluded,\nevidently perfectly contented that he appreciated this contingency.\n\nNekhliudof was both vexed and grieved that Churis had got himself into such\na condition, without having come to him long before; since he had more than\nonce, during his sojourn on the estate, told the peasants, and insisted\nupon it, that they should all apply directly to him for whatever they\nneeded.\n\nHe now felt some indignation against the peasant; he angrily shrugged his\nshoulders, and frowned. But the sight of the poverty in the midst of which\nhe found himself, and Churis\'s calm and self-satisfied appearance in\ncontrast with this poverty, changed his vexation into a sort of feeling of\nmelancholy and hopelessness.\n\n"Well, Ivan, why on earth didn\'t you tell me about this before?" he asked\nin a tone of reproach, as he took a seat on the filthy, unsteady bench.\n\n"I didn\'t dare to, your excellency," replied Churis with the same scarcely\nperceptible smile, shuffling with his black, bare feet over the uneven\nsurface of the mud floor; but this he said so fearlessly and with such\ncomposure, that it was hard to believe that he had any timidity about going\nto his master.\n\n"We are mere peasants; how could we be so presuming?" began the old woman,\nsobbing.\n\n"Hush up," said Churis, again addressing her.\n\n"It is impossible for you to live in this hut: it\'s all rotten," cried\nNekhliudof after a brief silence. "Now, this is how we shall manage it, my\nfriend"[6]....\n\n[Footnote 6: _bratets_, brother.]\n\n"I am listening."\n\n"Have you seen the improved stone cottages that I have been building at the\nnew farm,--the one with the undressed walls?"\n\n"Indeed I have seen them," replied Churis, with a smile that showed his\nwhite teeth still unimpaired. "Everybody\'s agog at the way they\'re built.\nFine cottages! The boys were laughing and wondering if they wouldn\'t be\nturned into granaries; they would be so secure against rats. Fine\ncottages," he said in conclusion, with an expression of absurd perplexity,\nshaking his head, "just like a jail!"\n\n"Yes, they\'re splendid cottages, dry and warm, and no danger of fire,"\nreplied the barin, a frown crossing his youthful face as he perceived the\npeasant\'s involuntary sarcasm.\n\n"Without question, your excellency, fine cottages."\n\n"Well, then, one of these cottages is just finished. It is twenty-four feet\nsquare, with an entry, and a barn, and it\'s entirely ready. I will let you\nhave it on credit if you say so, at cost price; you can pay for it at your\nown convenience," said the barin with a self-satisfied smile, which he\ncould not control, at the thought of his benevolence. "You can pull down\nthis old one," he went on to say; "it will make you a granary. We will also\nmove the pens. The water there is splendid. I will give you enough land for\na vegetable-garden, and I\'ll let you have a strip of land on all three\nsides. You can live there in a decent way. Now, does not that please you?"\nasked Nekhliudof, perceiving that as soon as he spoke of moving, Churis\nbecame perfectly motionless, and looked at the ground without even a\nshadow of a smile.\n\n"It\'s as your excellency wills," he replied, not raising his eyes.\n\nThe old woman came forward as though something had stung her to the quick,\nand began to speak; but her husband anticipated her.\n\n"It\'s as your excellency wills," he repeated resolutely, and at the same\ntime humbly glancing at his master, and tossing back his hair. "But it\nwould never do for us to live on a new farm."\n\n"Why not?"\n\n"Nay, your excellency, not if you move us over there: here we are wretched\nenough, but over there we could never in the world get along. What kind of\npeasants should we be there? Nay, nay, it is impossible for us to live\nthere."\n\n"But why not, pray?"\n\n"We should be totally ruined, your excellency."\n\n"But why can\'t you live there?"\n\n"What kind of a life would it be? Just think! it has never been lived in;\nwe don\'t know any thing about the water, no pasture anywhere. Here we have\nhad hemp-fields ever since we can remember, all manured; but what is there\nthere? Yes, what is there there? A wilderness! No hedges, no corn-kilns, no\nsheds, no nothing at all! Oh, yes, your excellency; we should be ruined if\nyou took us there; we should be perfectly ruined. A new place, all unknown\nto us," he repeated, shaking his head thoughtfully but resolutely.\n\nNekhliudof tried to point out to the peasant that the change, on the\ncontrary, would be very advantageous for him; that they would plant hedges,\nand build sheds; that the water there was excellent, and so on: but\nChuris\'s obstinate silence exasperated him, and he accordingly felt that he\nwas speaking to no purpose.\n\nChuris made no objection to what he said; but when the master finished\nspeaking, he remarked with a crafty smile, that it would be best of all to\nremove to that farm some of the old domestic servants, and Alyosha the\nfool, so that they might watch over the grain there.\n\n"That would be worth while," he remarked, and smiled once more. "This is\nfoolish business, your excellency."\n\n"What makes you think the place is not inhabitable?" insisted Nekhliudof\npatiently. "This place here isn\'t inhabitable, and hasn\'t been, and yet you\nlive here. But there, you will get settled there before you know it; you\nwill certainly find it easy"....\n\n"But, your excellency, kind sir,[7] how can it be compared?" replied Churis\neagerly, as though he feared that the master would not accept a conclusive\nargument. "Here is our place in the world; we are happy in it; we are\naccustomed to it, and the road and the pond--where would the old woman do\nher washing? where would the cattle get watered? And all our peasant ways\nare here; here from time out of mind. And here\'s the threshing-floor, and\nthe little garden, and the willows; and here my parents lived, and my\ngrandfather; and my father gave his soul into God\'s keeping here, and I too\nwould end my days here, your excellency. I ask nothing more than that. Be\ngood, and let the hut be put in order; we shall be always grateful for your\nkindness: but no, not for any thing, would we spend our last days anywhere\nelse. Let us stay here and say our prayers," he continued, bowing low; "do\nnot take us from our nest, kind sir."[8]\n\n[Footnote 7: _batiushka._]\n\n[Footnote 8: _batiushka._]\n\nAll the time that Churis was speaking, there was heard in the place under\nthe loft, where his wife was standing, sobs growing more and more violent;\nand when the husband said "_kind sir_," she suddenly darted forward, and\nwith tears in her eyes threw herself at the barin\'s feet.\n\n"Don\'t destroy us, benefactor; you are our father, you are our mother!\nWhere are you going to move us to? We are old folks; we have no one to help\nus. You are to us as God is," lamented the old woman.\n\nNekhliudof leaped up from the bench, and was going to lift the old woman;\nbut she, with a sort of passionate despair, beat her forehead on the earth\nfloor, and pushed aside the master\'s hand.\n\n"What is the matter with you? Get up, I beg of you. If you don\'t wish to\ngo, it is not necessary. I won\'t oblige you to," said he, waving his hand,\nand retreating to the door.\n\nWhen Nekhliudof sat down on the bench again, and silence was restored in\nthe room, interrupted only by the sobs of the old woman, who was once more\nbusy under the loft, and was wiping away her tears with the sleeves of her\nshirt, the young proprietor began to comprehend what was meant for the\npeasant and his wife by the dilapidated little hut, the crumbling well with\nthe filthy pool, the decaying stalls and sheds, and the broken willows\nwhich could be seen before the crooked window; and the feeling that arose\nin him was burdensome, melancholy, and touched with shame.\n\n"Why didn\'t you tell the Commune last Sunday, Ivan, that you needed a new\nhut? I don\'t know, now, how to help you. I told you all at the first\nmeeting, that I had come to live in the country, and devote my life to you,\nthat I was ready to deprive myself of every thing to make you happy and\ncontented; and I vowed before God, now, that I would keep my word," said\nthe young proprietor, not knowing that such a manner of opening the heart\nis incapable of arousing faith in any one, and especially in the Russian,\nwho loves not words but deeds, and is reluctant to be stirred up by\nfeelings, no matter how beautiful they may be.\n\nBut the simple-hearted young man was so pleased with this feeling that he\nexperienced, that he could not help speaking.\n\nChuris leaned his head to one side, and slowly blinking, listened with\nconstrained attention to his master, as to a man to whom he must needs\nlisten, even though he says things not entirely good, and absolutely\nforeign to his way of thinking.\n\n"But you see I cannot do all that everybody asks of me. If I did not refuse\nsome who ask me for wood, I myself should be left without any, and I could\nnot give to those who really needed. When I made this rule, I did it for\nthe regulation of the peasants\' affairs; and I put it entirely in the hands\nof the Commune. This wood now is not mine, but yours, you peasants\', and I\ncannot any longer dispose of it; but the Commune disposes of it, as you\nknow. Come to the meeting to-night. I will tell the Commune about your\nrequest: if they are disposed to give you a new hut, well and good; but I\nhaven\'t any more wood. I wish with all my soul to help you; but if you\naren\'t willing to move, then it is no longer my affair, but the Commune\'s.\nDo you understand me?"\n\n"Many thanks for your kindness," replied Churis in some agitation. "If you\nwill give me some lumber, then we can make repairs. What is the Commune?\nIt\'s a well-known fact that"....\n\n"No, you come."\n\n"I obey. I will come. Why shouldn\'t I come? Only this thing is sure: I\nwon\'t ask the Commune."\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe young proprietor evidently desired to ask some more questions of the\npeasants. He did not move from the bench; and he glanced irresolutely, now\nat Churis, now at the empty, unlighted stove.\n\n"Well, have you had dinner yet?" he asked at last.\n\nA mocking smile arose to Churis\'s lips, as though it were ridiculous to him\nfor his master to ask such foolish questions; he made no reply.\n\n"What do you mean,--dinner, benefactor?" said the old woman, sighing\ndeeply. "We\'ve eaten a little bread; that\'s our dinner. We couldn\'t get any\nvegetables to-day so as to boil some soup,[9] but we had a little\nkvas,--enough for the children."\n\n[Footnote 9: _shchets_ for _shchi_.]\n\n"To-day was a fast-day for us, your excellency," remarked Churis\nsarcastically, taking up his wife\'s words. "Bread and onions; that\'s the\nway we peasants live. Howsomever, praise be to the Lord, I have a little\ngrain yet, thanks to your kindness; it\'s lasted till now; but there\'s\nplenty of our peasants as ain\'t got any. Everywheres there\'s scarcity of\nonions. Only a day or two ago they sent to Mikhail the gardener, to get a\nbunch for a farthing: couldn\'t get any anywheres. Haven\'t been to God\'s\nchurch scarcely since Easter. Haven\'t had nothing to buy a taper for Mikola\n[St. Nicholas] with."\n\nNekhliudof, not by hearsay nor by trust in the words of others, but by the\nevidence of his own eyes, had long known the extreme depth of poverty into\nwhich his peasantry had sunken: but the entire reality was in such perfect\ncontrast to his own bringing-up, the turn of his mind, and the course of\nhis life, that in spite of himself he kept forgetting the truth of it; and\nevery time when, as now, it was brought vividly, tangibly, before him, his\nheart was torn with painful, almost unendurable melancholy, as though some\nabsolute and unavoidable punishment were torturing him.\n\n"Why are you so poor?" he exclaimed, involuntarily expressing his thought.\n\n"How could such as we help being poor, sir,[10] your excellency? Our land\nis so bad, you yourself may be pleased to know,--clay and sand-heaps; and\nsurely we must have angered God, for this long time, ever since the\ncholera, the corn won\'t grow. Our meadows and every thing else have been\ngrowing worse and worse. And some of us have to work for the farm, and some\ndetailed for the manor-lands. And here I am with no one to help me, and I\'m\ngetting old. I\'d be glad enough to work, but I hain\'t no strength. And my\nold woman\'s ailing; and every year there\'s a new girl born, and I have to\nfeed \'em all. I get tired out all alone, and here\'s seven dependent on me.\nI must be a sinner in the eyes of the Lord God, I often think to myself.\nAnd when God takes me off sudden-like, I feel it would be easier for me;\njust as it\'s better for them than to lead such a dog\'s life here"....\n\n[Footnote 10: _batiushka._]\n\n"Oh, _okh_!" groaned the old woman, as a sort of confirmation of her\nhusband\'s words.\n\n"And this is all the help I have," continued Churis, pointing to the\nwhite-headed, unkempt little boy of seven, with a huge belly, who at this\nmoment, timidly and quietly pushing the door open, came into the hut, and,\nresting his eyes in wonder and solemnity on the master, clung hold of\nChuris\'s shirt-band with both hands.\n\n"This is all the assistance I have here," continued Churis in a sonorous\nvoice, laying his shaggy hand on the little lad\'s white hair. "When will he\nbe good for any thing? But my work isn\'t much good. When I reach old age I\nshall be good for nothing; the rupture is getting the better of me. In wet\nweather it makes me fairly scream. I am getting to be an old man, and yet I\nhave to take care of my land.[11] And here\'s Yermilof, Demkin, Zabref, all\nyounger than I am, and they have been freed from their land long ago. Well,\nI haven\'t any one to help me with it; that\'s my misfortune. Have to feed so\nmany; that\'s where my struggle lies, your excellency."\n\n"I should be very glad to make it easier for you, truly. But how can I?"\nasked the young barin in a tone of sympathy, looking at the serf.\n\n"How make it easier? It\'s a well-known fact, if you have the land you must\ndo enforced labor also;[12] that\'s the regulation. I expect something from\nthis youngster. If only you\'d be good enough to let him off from going to\nschool. But just a day or two ago, the officer[13] came and said that your\nexcellency wanted him to go to school. Do let him off; he has no capacity\nfor learning, your excellency. He\'s too young yet; he won\'t understand any\nthing."\n\n[Footnote 11: The lands belonging to the Russian commune, or _mir_, were\nperiodically distributed by allotment, each full-grown peasant receiving as\nhis share a _tiaglo_ representing what the average man and his wife were\ncapable of cultivating. When the period was long--ten years for\ninstance--it sometimes happened that a serf, by reason of illness,\nlaziness, or other misfortune, would find it hard to cultivate his share,\npay the tax on it, and also do the work required of him on his barin\'s\nland. Such was Churis\'s complaint.]\n\n[Footnote 12: _barshchina_: work on the master\'s land.]\n\n[Footnote 13: _zemski._]\n\n"No, brother, you\'re wrong there," said the barin. "Your boy is old enough\nto understand; it\'s time for him to be learning. Just think of it! How\nhe\'ll grow up, and learn about farming; yes, and he\'ll know his a-b-c\'s,\nand know how to read; and read in church. He\'ll be a great help to you if\nGod lets him live," said Nekhliudof, trying to make himself as plain as\npossible, and at the same time blushing and stammering.\n\n"Very true, your excellency. You don\'t want to do us an injury, but there\'s\nno one to take care of the house; for while I and the old woman are doing\nthe enforced labor, the boy, though he\'s so young, is a great help, driving\nthe cattle and watering the horses. Whatever he is, he\'s a true muzhik;"\nand Churis, with a smile, took the lad\'s nose between his fat fingers, and\ndeftly removed the mucus.\n\n"Nevertheless, you must send him to school, for now you are at home, and he\nhas plenty of time,--do you hear? Don\'t you fail."\n\nChuris sighed deeply, and made no reply.\n\n\nV.\n\n"There\'s one other thing I wished to speak to you about," said Nekhliudof.\n"Why don\'t you haul out your manure?"\n\n"What manure, sir,[14] your excellency? There isn\'t any to haul out. What\ncattle have I got? One mare and colt; and last autumn I sold my heifer to\nthe porter,--that\'s all the cattle I\'ve got."\n\n[Footnote 14: _batiushka._]\n\n"I know you haven\'t much, but why did you sell your heifer?" asked the\nbarin in amazement.\n\n"What have I got to feed her on?"\n\n"Didn\'t you have some straw for feeding the cow? The others did."\n\n"The others have their fields manured, but my land\'s all clay. I can\'t do\nany thing with it."\n\n"Why don\'t you dress it, then, so it won\'t be clay? Then the land would\ngive you grain, and you\'d have something to feed to your stock."\n\n"But I haven\'t any stock, so how am I going to get dressing?"\n\n"That\'s an odd _cercle vicieux_," said Nekhliudof to himself; and he\nactually was at his wits\' ends to find an answer for the peasant.\n\n"And I tell you this, your excellency, it ain\'t the manure that makes the\ncorn grow, but God," continued the peasant. "Now, one summer I had six\nsheaves on one little unmanured piece of land, and only a twelfth as much\non that which was manured well. No one like God," he added with a sigh.\n"Yes, and my stock are always dying off. Five years past I haven\'t had any\nluck with \'em. Last summer one heifer died; had to sell another, hadn\'t any\nthing to feed her on; and last year my best cow perished. They were driving\nher home from pasture; nothing the matter, but suddenly she staggered and\nstaggered. And so now it\'s all empty here. Just my bad luck!"\n\n"Well, brother, since you say that you have no cattle to help you make\nfodder, and no fodder for your cattle, here\'s something towards a cow,"\nsaid Nekhliudof, reddening, and fetching forth from his pocket a packet of\ncrumpled bank-notes and untying it. "Buy you a cow at my expense, and get\nsome fodder from the granary: I will give orders. See to it that you have a\ncow by next Sunday. I shall come to see."\n\nChuris hesitated long; and when he did not offer to take the money,\nNekhliudof laid it down on the end of the table, and a still deeper flush\nspread over his face.\n\n"Many thanks for your kindness," said Churis, with his ordinary smile,\nwhich was somewhat sarcastic.\n\nThe old woman sighed heavily several times as she stood under the loft, and\nseemed to be repeating a prayer.\n\nThe situation was embarrassing for the young prince: he hastily got up from\nthe bench, went out into the entry, and called to Churis to follow him. The\nsight of the man whom he had been befriending was so pleasant that he found\nit hard to tear himself away.\n\n"I am glad to help you," said he, halting by the well. "It\'s in my power to\nhelp you, because I know that you are not lazy. You will work, and I will\nassist you; and, with God\'s aid, you will come out all right."\n\n"There\'s no hope of coming out all right, your excellency," said Churis,\nsuddenly assuming a serious and even stern expression of countenance, as\nthough the young man\'s assurance that he would come out all right had\nawakened all his opposition. "In my father\'s time my brothers and I did not\nsee any lack; but when he died, we broke all up. It kept going from bad to\nworse. Perfect wretchedness!"\n\n"Why did you break up?"\n\n"All on account of the women, your excellency. It was just after your\ngrandfather died; when he was alive, we should not have ventured to do it:\nthen the present order of things came in. He was just like you, he took an\ninterest in every thing; and we should not have dared to separate. The late\nmaster did not like to look after the peasants; but after your\ngrandfather\'s time, Andrei Ilyitch took charge. God forgive him! he was a\ndrunken, careless man. We came to him once and again with complaints,--no\nliving on account of the women,--begged him to let us separate. Well, he\nput it off, and put it off; but at last things came to such a pass, the\nwomen kept each to their own part; we began to live apart; and, of course,\nwhat could a single peasant do? Well, there wasn\'t no law or order. Andrei\nIlyitch managed simply to suit himself. \'Take all you can get.\' And\nwhatever he could extort from a peasant, he took without asking. Then the\npoll-tax was raised, and they began to exact more provisions, and we had\nless and less land, and the grain stopped growing. Well, when the new\nallotment was made, then he took away from us our manured land, and added\nit to the master\'s, the villain, and ruined us entirely. He ought to have\nbeen hung. Your father[15]--the kingdom of heaven be his!--was a good\nbarin, but it was rarely enough that we ever had sight of him: he always\nlived in Moscow. Well, of course they used to drive the carts in pretty\noften. Sometimes it would be the season of bad roads,[16] and no fodder;\nbut no matter! The barin couldn\'t get along without it. We did not dare to\ncomplain at this, but there wasn\'t system. But now your grace lets any of\nus peasants see your face, and so a change has come over us; and the\noverseer is a different kind of man. Now we know for sure that we have a\nbarin. And it is impossible to say how grateful your peasants are for your\nkindness. But before you came, there wasn\'t any real barin: every one was\nbarin. Ilyitch was barin, and his wife put on the airs of a lady,[17] and\nthe scribe from the police-station was barin. Too many of em! _ukh!_ the\npeasants had to put up with many trials."\n\nAgain Nekhliudof experienced a feeling akin to shame or remorse. He put on\nhis hat, and went on his way.\n\n[Footnote 15: _batiushka._]\n\n[Footnote 16: _rasputitsa._]\n\n[Footnote 17: _baruinya._]\n\n\nVI.\n\n"Yukhvanka the clever[18] wants to sell a horse," was what Nekhliudof next\nread in his note-book; and he proceeded along the street to Yukhvanka\'s\nplace.[19] Yukhvanka\'s hut was carefully thatched with straw from the\nthreshing-floor of the estate; the frame-work was of new light-gray\naspen-wood (also from stock belonging to the estate), had two handsome\npainted shutters for the window, and a porch with eaves and ingenious\nbalustrades cut out of deal planks.\n\n[Footnote 18: _Yukhvanka-Mudr\'yonui._]\n\n[Footnote 19: _dvor._]\n\nThe narrow entry and the cold hut were also in perfect order; but the\ngeneral impression of sufficiency and comfort given by this establishment\nwas somewhat injured by a barn enclosed in the gates, which had a\ndilapidated hedge and a sagging pent roof, appearing from behind it.\n\nJust as Nekhliudof approached the steps from one side, two peasant women\ncame up on the other carrying a tub full of water. One was Yukhvanka\'s\nwife, the other his mother.\n\nThe first was a robust, healthy-looking woman, with an extraordinarily\nexuberant bosom, and wide fat cheeks. She wore a clean shirt embroidered on\nthe sleeves and collar, an apron of the same material, a new linen skirt,\npeasant\'s shoes, a string of beads, and an elegant four-cornered head-dress\nof embroidered red paper and spangles.\n\nThe end of the water-yoke was not in the least unsteady, but was firmly\nsettled on her wide and solid shoulder. Her easy forcefulness, manifested\nin her rosy face, in the curvature of her back, and the measured swing of\nher arms and legs, made it evident that she had splendid health and rugged\nstrength.\n\nYukhvanka\'s mother, balancing the other end of the yoke, was, on the\ncontrary, one of those elderly women who seem to have reached the final\nlimit of old age and decrepitude. Her bony frame, clad in a black\ndilapidated shirt and a faded linen skirt, was bent so that the water-yoke\nrested rather on her back than on her shoulder. Her two hands, whose\ndistorted fingers seemed to clutch the yoke, were of a strange dark\nchestnut color, and were convulsively cramped. Her drooping head, wrapped\nup in some sort of a clout, bore the most monstrous evidences of indigence\nand extreme old age.\n\nFrom under her narrow brow, perfectly covered with deep wrinkles, two red\neyes, unprotected by lashes, gazed with leaden expression to the ground.\nOne yellow tooth protruded from her sunken upper lip, and, constantly\nmoving, sometimes came in contact with her sharp chin. The wrinkles on the\nlower part of her face and neck hung down like little bags, quivering at\nevery motion.\n\nShe breathed heavily and hoarsely; but her bare, distorted legs, though it\nseemed as if they would have barely strength to drag along over the ground,\nmoved with measured steps.\n\n\nVII.\n\nAlmost stumbling against the prince, the young wife precipitately set down\nthe tub, showed a little embarrassment, dropped a courtesy, and then with\nshining eyes glanced up at him, and, endeavoring to hide a slight smile\nbehind the sleeve of her embroidered shirt, ran up the steps, clattering in\nher wooden shoes.\n\n"Mother,[20] you take the water-yoke to aunt Nastasia," said she, pausing\nat the door, and addressing the old woman.\n\n[Footnote 20: _matushka._]\n\nThe modest young proprietor looked sternly but scrutinizingly at the rosy\nwoman, frowned, and turned to the old dame, who, seizing the yoke with her\ncrooked fingers, submissively lifted it to her shoulder, and was about to\ndirect her steps to the adjacent hut.\n\n"Your son at home?" asked the prince.\n\nThe old woman, her bent form bent more than usual, made an obeisance, and\ntried to say something in reply, but, suddenly putting her hand to her\nmouth, was taken with such a fit of coughing, that Nekhliudof without\nwaiting went into the hut.\n\nYukhvanka, who had been sitting on the bench in the "red corner,"[21] when\nhe saw the prince, threw himself upon the oven, as though he were anxious\nto hide from him, hastily thrust something away in the loft, and, with\nmouth and eyes twitching, squeezed himself close to the wall, as though to\nmake way for the prince.\n\n[Footnote 21: Where the holy images and the lighted taper are to be found.]\n\nYukhvanka was a light-complexioned fellow, thirty years of age, spare, with\na young, pointed beard. He was well proportioned, and rather handsome, save\nfor the unpleasant expression of his hazel eyes, under his knitted brow,\nand for the lack of two front teeth, which immediately attracted one\'s\nattention because his lips were short and constantly parted.\n\nHe wore a Sunday shirt with bright red gussets, striped print drawers, and\nheavy boots with wrinkled legs.\n\nThe interior of Vanka\'s hut was not as narrow and gloomy as that of\nChuris\'s, though it was fully as stifling, as redolent of smoke and\nsheep-skin, and showing as disorderly an array of peasant garments and\nutensils.\n\nTwo things here strangely attracted the attention,--a small damaged samovar\nstanding on the shelf, and a black frame near the _ikon_, with the remains\nof a dirty mirror and the portrait of some general in a red uniform.\n\nNekhliudof looked with distaste on the samovar, the general\'s portrait, and\nthe loft, where stuck out, from under some rags, the end of a\ncopper-mounted pipe. Then he turned to the peasant.\n\n"How do you do, Yepifan?" said he, looking into his eyes.\n\nYepifan bowed low, and mumbled, "Good-morning, \'slency,"[22] with a\npeculiar abbreviation of the last word, while his eyes wandered restlessly\nfrom the prince to the ceiling, and from the ceiling to the floor, and not\npausing on any thing. Then he hastily ran to the loft, dragged out a coat,\nand began to put it on.\n\n[Footnote 22: _vaciaso_ for _vashe siatelstvo_ (your excellency).]\n\n"Why are you putting on your coat?" asked Nekhliudof, sitting down on the\nbench, and evidently endeavoring to look at Yepifan as sternly as possible.\n\n"How can I appear before you without it, \'slency? You see we can\nunderstand"....\n\n"I have come to ask you why you need to sell a horse? Have you many horses?\nWhat horse do you wish to sell?" said the prince without wasting words, but\npropounding questions that he had evidently pre-considered.\n\n"We are greatly beholden to you, \'slency, that you do not think it beneath\nyou to visit me, a mere peasant," replied Yukhvanka, casting hasty glances\nat the general\'s portrait, at the stove, at the prince\'s boots, and every\nthing else except Nekhliudof\'s face. "We always pray God for your \'slency."\n\n"Why sell the horse?" repeated Nekhliudof, raising his voice, and coughing.\n\nYukhvanka sighed, tossed back his hair (again his glance roved about the\nhut), and noticing the cat that lay on the bench contentedly purring, he\nshouted out to her, "Scat, you rubbish!" and quickly addressed himself to\nthe barin. "A horse, \'slency, which ain\'t worth any thing. If the beast was\ngood for any thing, I shouldn\'t think of selling him, \'slency."\n\n"How many horses have you in all?"\n\n"Three horses, \'slency."\n\n"No colts?"\n\n"Of course, \'slency. There is one colt."\n\n\nVIII.\n\n"Come, show me your horses. Are they in the yard?"[23]\n\n[Footnote 23: _dvor._]\n\n"Indeed they are, \'slency. I have done as I was told, \'slency. Could we\nfail to heed you, \'slency? Yakof Ilyitch told me not to send the horses out\nto pasture. \'The prince,\' says he, \'is coming to look at them,\' and so we\ndidn\'t send them. For, of course, we shouldn\'t dare to disobey you,\n\'slency."\n\nWhile Nekhliudof was on his way to the door, Yukhvanka snatched down his\npipe from the loft, and flung it into the stove. His lips were still drawn\nin with the same expression of constraint as when the prince was looking at\nhim.\n\nA wretched little gray mare, with thin tail, all stuck up with burrs, was\nsniffing at the filthy straw under the pent roof. A long-legged colt two\nmonths old, of some nondescript color, with bluish hoofs and nose, followed\nclose behind her.\n\nIn the middle of the yard stood a pot-bellied brown gelding with closed\neyes and thoughtfully pendent head. It was apparently an excellent little\nhorse for a peasant.\n\n"So these are all your horses?"\n\n"No, indeed, \'slency. Here\'s still another mare, and here\'s the little\ncolt," replied Yukhvanka, pointing to the horses, which the prince could\nnot help seeing.\n\n"I see. Which one do you propose to sell?"\n\n"This here one, \'slency," he replied, waving his jacket in the direction of\nthe somnolent gelding, and constantly winking and sucking in his lips.\n\nThe gelding opened his eyes, and lazily switched his tail.\n\n"He does not seem to be old, and he\'s fairly plump," said Nekhliudof.\n"Bring him up, and show me his teeth. I can tell if he\'s old."\n\n"You can\'t tell by one indication, \'slency. The beast isn\'t worth a\nfarthing. He\'s peculiar. You have to judge both by tooth and limb,\n\'slency," replied Yukhvanka, smiling very gayly, and letting his eyes rove\nin all directions.\n\n"What nonsense! Bring him here, I tell you."\n\nYukhvanka stood still smiling, and made a deprecatory gesture; and it was\nonly when Nekhliudof cried angrily, "Well, what are you up to?" that he\nmoved toward the shed, seized the halter, and began to pull at the horse,\nscaring him, and getting farther and farther away as the horse resisted.\n\nThe young prince was evidently vexed to see this, and perhaps, also, he\nwished to show his own shrewdness.\n\n"Give me the halter," he cried.\n\n"Excuse me. It\'s impossible for you, \'slency,--don\'t"....\n\nBut Nekhliudof went straight up to the horse\'s head, and, suddenly seizing\nhim by the ears, threw him to the ground with such force, that the gelding,\nwho, as it seems, was a very peaceful peasant steed, began to kick and\nstrangle in his endeavors to get away.\n\nWhen Nekhliudof perceived that it was perfectly useless to exert his\nstrength so, and looked at Yukhvanka, who was still smiling, the thought\nmost maddening at his time of life occurred to him,--that Yukhvanka was\nlaughing at him, and regarding him as a mere child.\n\nHe reddened, let go of the horse\'s ears, and, without making use of the\nhalter, opened the creature\'s mouth, and looked at his teeth: they were\nsound, the crowns full, so far as the young man had time to make his\nobservations. No doubt the horse was in his prime.\n\nMeantime Yukhvanka came to the shed, and, seeing that the harrow was lying\nout of its place, seized it, and stood it up against the wattled hedge.\n\n"Come here," shouted the prince, with an expression of childish annoyance\nin his face, and almost with tears of vexation and wrath in his voice.\n"What! call this horse old?"\n\n"Excuse me, \'slency, very old, twenty years old at least. A horse that"....\n\n"Silence! You are a liar and a good-for-nothing. No decent peasant will\nlie, there\'s no need for him to," said Nekhliudof, choking with the angry\ntears that filled his throat.\n\nHe stopped speaking, lest he should be detected in weeping before the\npeasant. Yukhvanka also said nothing, and had the appearance of a man who\nwas almost on the verge of tears, blew his nose, and slowly shook his head.\n\n"Well, how are you going to plough when you have disposed of this horse?"\ncontinued Nekhliudof, calming himself with an effort, so as to speak in his\nordinary voice. "You are sent out into the field on purpose to drive the\nhorses for ploughing, and you wish to dispose of your last horse? And I\nshould like to know why you need to lie about it."\n\nIn proportion as the prince calmed down, Yukhvanka also calmed down. He\nstraightened himself up, and, while he sucked in his lips constantly, he\nlet his eyes rove about from one object to another.\n\n"Lie to you, \'slency? We are no worse off than others in going to work."\n\n"But what will you go on?"\n\n"Don\'t worry. We will do your work, \'slency," he replied, starting up the\ngelding, and driving him away. "Even if we didn\'t need money, I should want\nto get rid of him."\n\n"Why do you need money?"\n\n"Haven\'t no grain, \'slency; and besides, we peasants have to pay our debts,\n\'slency."\n\n"How is it you have no grain? Others who have families have corn enough;\nbut you have no family, and you are in want. Where is it all gone?"\n\n"Ate it up, \'slency, and now we haven\'t a bit. I will buy a horse in the\nautumn, \'slency."\n\n"Don\'t for a moment think of selling your horse."\n\n"But if we don\'t then what\'ll become of us, \'slency? No grain, and\nforbidden to sell any thing," he replied, turning his head to one side,\nsucking in his lips, and suddenly glancing boldly into the prince\'s face.\n"Of course we shall die of starvation."\n\n"Look here, brother," cried Nekhliudof, paling, and experiencing a feeling\nof righteous indignation against the peasant. "I can\'t endure such peasants\nas you are. It will go hard with you."\n\n"Just as you will, \'slency," he replied, shutting his eyes with an\nexpression of feigned submission: "I should not think of disobeying you.\nBut it comes not from any fault of mine. Of course, I may not please you,\n\'slency; at all events, I can do as you wish; only I don\'t see why I\ndeserve to be punished."\n\n"This is why: because your yard is exposed, your manure is not ploughed in,\nyour hedges are broken down, and yet you sit at home smoking your pipe, and\ndon\'t work; because you don\'t give a crust of bread to your mother, who\ngave you your whole place,[24] and you let your wife beat her, and she has\nto come to me with her complaints."\n\n[Footnote 24: _khozyaistvo._]\n\n"Excuse me, \'slency, I don\'t know what you mean by smoking your pipe,"\nreplied Yukhvanka in a constrained tone, showing beyond peradventure that\nthe complaint about his smoking touched him to the quick. "It is possible\nto say any thing about a man."\n\n"Now you\'re lying again! I myself saw"....\n\n"How could I venture to lie to you, \'slency?"\n\nNekhliudof made no answer, but bit his lip, and began to walk back and\nforth in the yard. Yukhvanka, standing in one place, and not lifting his\neyes, followed the prince\'s legs.\n\n"See here, Yepifan," said Nekhliudof in a childishly gentle voice, coming\nto a pause before the peasant, and endeavoring to hide his vexation, "it is\nimpossible to live so, and you are working your own destruction. Just\nthink. If you want to be a good peasant, then turn over a new leaf, cease\nyour evil courses, stop lying, don\'t get drunk any more, honor your mother.\nYou see, I know all about you. Take hold of your work; don\'t steal from the\ncrown woods, for the sake of going to the tavern. Think how well off you\nmight be. If you really need any thing, then come to me; tell me honestly,\nwhat you need and why you need it; and don\'t tell lies, but tell the whole\ntruth, and then I won\'t refuse you any thing that I can possibly grant."\n\n"Excuse me, \'slency, I think I understand you, \'slency," replied Yukhvanka\nsmiling as though he comprehended the entire significance of the prince\'s\nwords.\n\nThat smile and answer completely disenchanted Nekhliudof so far as he had\nany hope of reforming the man and of turning him into the path of virtue by\nmeans of moral suasion. It seemed to him hard that it should be wasted\nenergy when he had the power to warn the peasant, and that all that he had\nsaid was exactly what he should not have said.\n\nHe shook his head gravely, and went into the house. The old woman was\nsitting on the threshold and groaning heavily, as it seemed to the young\nproprietor as a sign of approbation of his words which she had overheard.\n\n"Here\'s something for you to get bread with," said Nekhliudof in her ear,\npressing a bank-note into her hand. "But keep it for yourself, and don\'t\ngive it to Yepifan, else he\'ll drink it up."\n\nThe old woman with her distorted hand laid hold of the door-post, and tried\nto get up. She began to pour out her thanks to the prince; her head began\nto wag, but Nekhliudof was already on the other side of the street when she\ngot to her feet.\n\n\nIX.\n\n"Davidka Byelui[25] asks for grain and posts," was what followed\nYukhvanka\'s case in the note-book.\n\n[Footnote 25: Little David White.]\n\nAfter passing by a number of places, Nekhliudof came to a turn in the lane,\nand there fell in with his overseer Yakof Alpatitch, who, while the prince\nwas still at a distance, took off his oiled cap, and pulling out a crumpled\nbandanna handkerchief began to wipe his fat red face.\n\n"Cover yourself, Yakof! Yakof, cover yourself, I tell you."\n\n"Where do you wish to go, your excellency?" asked Yakof, using his cap to\nshield his eyes from the sun, but not putting it on.\n\n"I have been at Yukhvanka\'s. Tell me, pray, why does he act so?" asked the\nprince as he walked along the street.\n\n"Why indeed, your excellency!" echoed the overseer as he followed behind\nthe prince in a respectful attitude. He put on his cap, and began to twist\nhis mustache.\n\n"What\'s to be done with him? He\'s thoroughly good for nothing, lazy,\nthievish, a liar; he persecutes his mother, and to all appearances he is\nsuch a confirmed good-for-nothing that there is no reforming him."\n\n"I didn\'t know, your excellency, that he displeased you so."\n\n"And his wife," continued the prince, interrupting the overseer, "seems\nlike a bad woman. The old mother is dressed worse than a beggar, and has\nnothing to eat; but she wears all her best clothes, and so does he. I\nreally don\'t know what is to be done with them."\n\nYakof knit his brows thoughtfully when Nekhliudof spoke of Yukhvanka\'s\nwife.\n\n"Well, if he behaves so, your excellency," began the overseer, "then it\nwill be necessary to find some way to correct things. He is in abject\npoverty like all the peasants who have no assistance, but he seems to\nmanage his affairs quite differently from the others. He\'s a clever fellow,\nknows how to read, and he\'s far from being a dishonest peasant. At the\ncollection of the poll-taxes he was always on hand. And for three years,\nwhile I was overseer he was bailiff, and no fault was found with him. In\nthe third year the warden took it into his head to depose him, so he was\nobliged to take to farming. Perhaps when he lived in town at the station he\ngot drunk sometimes, so we had to devise some means. They used to threaten\nhim, in fun, and he came to his senses again. He was good-natured, and got\nalong well with his family. But as it does not please you to use these\nmeans, I am sure I don\'t know what we are to do with him. He has really got\nvery low. He can\'t be sent into the army, because, as you may be pleased to\nremember, two of his teeth are missing. Yes, and there are others besides\nhim, I venture to remind you, who absolutely haven\'t any"....\n\n"Enough of that, Yakof," interrupted Nekhliudof, smiling shrewdly. "You and\nI have discussed that again and again. You know what ideas I have on this\nsubject; and whatever you may say to me, I still remain of the same\nopinion."\n\n"Certainly, your excellency, you understand it all," said Yakof, shrugging\nhis shoulders, and looking askance at the prince as though what he saw were\nworthy of no consideration. "But as far as the old woman is concerned, I\nbeg you to see that you are disturbing yourself to no purpose," he\ncontinued. "Certainly it is true that she has brought up the orphans, she\nhas fed Yukhvanka, and got him a wife, and so forth; but you know that is\ncommon enough among peasants. When the mother or father has transferred the\nproperty[26] to the son, then the new owners get control, and the old\nmother is obliged to work for her own living to the utmost of her strength.\nOf course they are lacking in delicate feelings, but this is common enough\namong the peasantry; and so I take the liberty of explaining to you that\nyou are stirred up about the old woman all for nothing. She is a clever old\nwoman, and a good housewife;[27] is there any reason for a gentleman to\nworry over her? Well, she has quarrelled with her daughter-in-law; maybe\nthe young woman struck her: that\'s like a woman, and they would make up\nagain while you torment yourself. You really take it all too much to\nheart," said the overseer looking with a certain expression of fondness\nmingled with condescension at the prince, who was walking silently with\nlong strides before him up the street.\n\n[Footnote 26: _khozyaistvo._]\n\n[Footnote 27: _khozyaika._]\n\n"Will you go home now?" he added.\n\n"No, to Davidka Byelui\'s or Kazyol\'s--what is his name?"\n\n"Well, he\'s a good-for-nothing, I assure you. All the race of the Kazyols\nare of the same sort. I haven\'t had any success with him; he cares for\nnothing. Yesterday I rode past the peasant\'s field, and his buckwheat\nwasn\'t even sowed yet. What do you wish done with such people? The old man\ntaught his son, but still he\'s a good-for-nothing just the same; whether\nfor himself or for the estate, he makes a bungle of every thing. Neither\nthe warden nor I have been able to do any thing with him: we\'ve sent him to\nthe station-house, and we\'ve punished him at home, because you are pleased\nnow to like"....\n\n"Who? the old man?"\n\n"Yes, the old man. The warden more than once has punished him before the\nwhole assembly, and, would you believe it? he would shake himself, go home,\nand be as bad as ever. And Davidka, I assure your excellency, is a\nlaw-abiding peasant, and a quick-witted peasant; that is, he doesn\'t smoke\nand doesn\'t drink," explained Yakof; "and yet he\'s worse than the other who\ngets drunk. There\'s nothing else to do with him than to make a soldier of\nhim or send him to Siberia. All the Kazyols are the same; and Matriushka\nwho lives in the village belongs to their family, and is the same sort of\ncursed good-for-nothing. Don\'t you care to have me here, your excellency?"\ninquired the overseer, perceiving that the prince did not heed what he was\nsaying.\n\n"No, go away," replied Nekhliudof absent-mindedly, and turned his steps\ntoward Davidka Byelui\'s.\n\nDavidka\'s hovel[28] stood askew and alone at the very edge of the village.\nIt had neither yard, nor cornkiln, nor barn. Only some sort of dirty stalls\nfor cattle were built against one side. On the other a heap of brush-wood\nand logs was piled up, in imitation of a yard.[29]\n\n[Footnote 28: _izba._]\n\n[Footnote 29: _dvor._]\n\nTall green steppe-grass was growing in the place where the court-yard\nshould have been.\n\nThere was no living creature to be seen near the hovel, except a sow lying\nin the mire at the threshold, and grunting.\n\nNekhliudof tapped at the broken window; but as no one made answer, he went\ninto the entry and shouted, "Holloa there!"[30]\n\n[Footnote 30: _khozyaeva_; literally, "master and mistress."]\n\nThis also brought no response. He passed through the entry, peered into the\nempty stalls, and entered the open hut.\n\nAn old red cock and two hens with ruffs were scratching with their legs,\nand strutting about over the floor and benches. When they saw a man they\nspread their wings, and, cackling with terror, flew against the walls, and\none took refuge on the oven.\n\nThe whole hut, which was not quite fourteen feet[31] square, was occupied\nby the oven with its broken pipe, a loom, which in spite of its being\nsummer-time was not taken down, and a most filthy table made of a split and\nuneven plank.\n\n[Footnote 31: Six _arshin_.]\n\nAlthough it was a dry situation, there was a filthy puddle at the door,\ncaused by the recent rain, which had leaked through roof and ceiling. Loft\nthere was none. It was hard to realize that this was a human habitation,\nsuch decided evidence of neglect and disorder was impressed upon both the\nexterior and the interior of the hovel; nevertheless, in this hovel lived\nDavidka Byelui and all his family.\n\nAt the present moment, notwithstanding the heat of the June day, Davidka,\nwith his head covered by his sheep-skin,[32] was fast asleep, curled up on\none corner of the oven. The panic-stricken hen, skipping up on the oven,\nand growing more and more agitated, took up her position on Davidka\'s back,\nbut did not awaken him.\n\n[Footnote 32: _polushubok._]\n\nNekhliudof, seeing no one in the hovel, was about to go, when a prolonged\nhumid sigh betrayed the sleeper.[33]\n\n[Footnote 33: _khozyain._]\n\n"Holloa! who\'s there?" cried the prince.\n\nA second prolonged sigh was heard from the oven.\n\n"Who\'s there? Come here!"\n\nStill another sigh, a sort of a bellow, and a heavy yawn responded to the\nprince\'s call.\n\n"Well, who are you?"\n\nSomething moved slightly on the oven. The skirt of a torn sheep-skin[34]\nwas lifted; one huge leg in a dilapidated boot was put down, then another,\nand finally Davidka\'s entire figure emerged. He sat up on the oven, and\nrubbed his eyes drowsily and morosely with his fist.\n\n[Footnote 34: _tulup._]\n\nSlowly shaking his head, and yawning, he looked down into the hut, and,\nseeing the prince, began to make greater haste than before; but still his\nmotions were so slow, that Nekhliudof had time to walk back and forth three\ntimes from the puddle to the loom before Davidka got down from the oven.\n\nDavidka Byelui or David White was white in reality: his hair, and his body,\nand his face all were perfectly white.\n\nHe was tall and very stout, but stout as peasants are wont to be, that is,\nnot in the waist alone, but in the whole body. His stoutness, however, was\nof a peculiar flabby, unhealthy kind. His rather comely face, with\npale-blue good-natured eyes, and a wide trimmed beard, bore the impress of\nill health. There was not the slightest trace of tan or blood: it was of a\nuniform yellowish ashen tint, with pale livid circles under the eyes, quite\nas though his face were stuffed with fat or bloated.\n\nHis hands were puffy and yellow, like the hands of men afflicted with\ndropsy, and they wore a growth of fine white hair. He was so drowsy that he\ncould scarcely open his eyes or cease from staggering and yawning.\n\n"Well, aren\'t you ashamed of yourself," began Nekhliudof, "sleeping in the\nvery best part of the day,[35] when you ought to be attending to your work,\nwhen you haven\'t any corn?"\n\n[Footnote 35: Literally, "middle of the white day."]\n\nAs Davidka little by little shook off his drowsiness, and began to realize\nthat it was the prince who was standing before him, he folded his arms\nacross his stomach, hung his head, inclining it a trifle to one side, and\ndid not move a limb or say a word; but the expression of his face and the\npose of his whole body seemed to say, "I know, I know; it is an old story\nwith me. Well, strike me, if it must be: I will endure it."\n\nHe evidently was anxious for the prince to get through speaking and give\nhim his thrashing as quickly as possible, even if he struck him severely on\nhis swollen cheeks, and then leave him in peace.\n\nPerceiving that Davidka did not understand him, Nekhliudof endeavored by\nvarious questions to rouse the peasant from his vexatiously obstinate\nsilence.\n\n"Why have you asked me for wood when you have enough to last you a whole\nmonth here, and you haven\'t had any thing to do? What?"\n\nDavidka still remained silent, and did not move.\n\n"Well, answer me."\n\nDavidka muttered something, and blinked his white eyelashes.\n\n"You must go to work, brother. What will become of you if you don\'t work?\nNow you have no grain, and what\'s the reason of it? Because your land is\nbadly ploughed, and not harrowed, and no seed put in at the right\ntime,--all from laziness. You asked me for grain: well, let us suppose that\nI gave it to you, so as to keep you from starving to death, still it is not\nbecoming to do so. Whose grain do I give you? whose do you think? Answer\nme,--whose grain do I give you?" demanded Nekhliudof obstinately.\n\n"The Lord\'s," muttered Davidka, raising his eyes timidly and questioningly.\n\n"But where did the Lord\'s grain come from? Think for yourself, who ploughed\nfor it? who harrowed? who planted it? who harvested it? The peasants, hey?\nJust look here: if the Lord\'s grain is given to the peasants, then those\npeasants who work most will get most; but you work less than anybody. You\nare complained about on all sides. You work less than all the others, and\nyet you ask for more of the Lord\'s grain than all the rest. Why should it\nbe given to you, and not to the others? Now, if all, like you, lay on their\nbacks, it would not be long before everybody in the world died of\nstarvation. Brother, you\'ve got to labor. This is disgraceful. Do you hear,\nDavid?"\n\n"I hear you," said the other slowly through his teeth.\n\n\nX.\n\nAt this moment, the window was darkened by the head of a peasant woman who\npassed carrying some linen on a yoke, and presently Davidka\'s mother came\ninto the hovel. She was a tall woman, fifty years old, very fresh and\nlively. Her ugly face was covered with pock-marks and wrinkles; but her\nstraight, firm nose, her delicate, compressed lips, and her keen gray eyes\ngave witness to her mental strength and energy.\n\nThe angularity of her shoulders, the flatness of her chest, the thinness of\nher hands, and the solid muscles of her black bare legs, made it evident\nthat she had long ago ceased to be a woman, and had become a mere drudge.\n\nShe came hurrying into the hovel, shut the door, set down her linen, and\nlooked angrily at her son.\n\nNekhliudof was about to say something to her, but she turned her back on\nhim, and began to cross herself before the black wooden _ikon_, that was\nvisible behind the loom.\n\nWhen she had thus done, she adjusted the dirty checkered handkerchief which\nwas tied around her head, and made a low obeisance to the prince.\n\n"A pleasant Lord\'s day to you, excellency," she said. "God spare you; you\nare our father."\n\nWhen Davidka saw his mother he grew confused, bent his back a little, and\nhung his head still lower.\n\n"Thanks, Arina," replied Nekhliudof. "I have just been talking with your\nson about your affairs."[36]\n\nArina or Arishka Burlak,[37] as the peasants used to call her when she was\na girl, rested her chin on the clinched fist of her right hand, which she\nsupported with the palm of the left, and, without waiting for the prince to\nspeak further, began to talk so sharply and loud that the whole hovel was\nfilled with the sound of her voice; and from outside it might have been\nconcluded that several women had suddenly fallen into a discussion.\n\n[Footnote 36: _khozyaistvo._]\n\n[Footnote 37: clod-hopper.]\n\n"What, my father, what is then to be said to him? You can\'t talk to him as\nto a man. Here he stands, the lout," she continued contemptuously, wagging\nher head in the direction of Davidka\'s woe-begone, stolid form.\n\n"How are _my_ affairs, your excellency? We are poor. In your whole village\nthere are none so bad off as we are, either for our own work or for yours.\nIt\'s a shame! And it\'s all his fault. I bore him, fed him, gave him to\ndrink. Didn\'t expect to have such a lubber. There is but one end to the\nstory. Grain is all gone, and no more work to be got out of him than from\nthat piece of rotten wood. All he knows is to lie on top of the oven, or\nelse he stands here, and scratches his empty pate," she said, mimicking\nhim.\n\n"If you could only frighten him, father! I myself beseech you: punish him,\nfor the Lord God\'s sake! send him off as a soldier,--it\'s all one. But he\'s\nno good to me,--that\'s the way it is."\n\n"Now, aren\'t you ashamed, Davidka, to bring your mother to this?" said\nNekhliudof reproachfully, addressing the peasant.\n\nDavidka did not move.\n\n"One might think that he was a sick peasant," continued Arina, with the\nsame eagerness and the same gestures; "but only to look at him you can see\nhe\'s fatter than the pig at the mill. It would seem as if he might have\nstrength enough to work on something, the lubber! But no, not he! He\nprefers to curl himself up on top of the oven. And even when he undertakes\nto do any thing, it would make you sick even to look at him, the way he\ngoes about the work! He wastes time when he gets up, when he moves, when he\ndoes any thing," said she, dwelling on the words, and awkwardly swaying\nfrom side to side with her angular shoulders.\n\n"Now, here to-day my old man himself went to the forest after wood, and\ntold him to dig a hole; but he did not even put his hand to the shovel."\n\nShe paused for a moment.\n\n"He has killed me," she suddenly hissed, gesticulating with her arms, and\nadvancing toward her son with threatening gesture. "Curse your smooth, bad\nface!"\n\nShe scornfully, and at the same time despairingly, turned from him, spat,\nand again addressed the prince with the same animation, still swinging her\narms, but with tears in her eyes.\n\n"I am the only one, benefactor. My old man is sick, old: yes, and I get no\nhelp out of him; and I am the only one at all. And this fellow hangs around\nmy neck like a stone. If he would only die, then it would be easier; that\nwould be the end of it. He lets me starve, the poltroon. You are our\nfather. There\'s no help for me. My daughter-in-law died of work, and I\nshall too."\n\n\nXI.\n\n"How did she die?" inquired Nekhliudof, somewhat sceptically.\n\n"She died of hard work, as God knows, benefactor. We brought her last year\nfrom Baburin," she continued, suddenly changing her wrathful expression to\none of tearfulness and grief. "Well, the woman[38] was young, fresh,\nobliging, good stuff. As a girl, she lived at home with her father in\nclover, never knew want; and when she came to us, then she learned to do\nour work,--for the estate and at home and everywhere.... She and I--that\nwas all to do it. What was it to me? I was used to it. She was going to\nhave a baby, good father; and she began to suffer pain; and all because she\nworked beyond her strength. Well, she did herself harm, the poor little\nsweetheart. Last summer, about the time of the feast of Peter and Paul, she\nhad a poor little boy born. But there was no bread. We ate whatever we\ncould get, my father. She went to work too soon: her milk all dried up. The\nbaby was her first-born. There was no cow, and we were mere peasants. She\nhad to feed him on rye. Well, of course, it was sheer folly. It kept pining\naway on this. And when the child died, she became so down-spirited,--she\nwould sob and sob, and howl and howl; and then it was poverty and work, and\nall the time going from bad to worse. So she passed away in the summer,\nthe sweetheart, at the time of the feast of St. Mary\'s Intercession. He\nbrought her to it, the beast," she cried, turning to her son with wrathful\ndespair. "I wanted to ask your excellency a favor," she continued after a\nshort pause, lowering her voice, and making an obeisance.\n\n[Footnote 38: _baba._]\n\n"What?" asked Nekhliudof in some constraint.\n\n"You see he\'s a young peasant still. He demands so much work of me. To-day\nI am alive, to-morrow I may die. How can he live without a wife? He won\'t\nbe any good to you at all. Help us to find some one for him, good father."\n\n"That is, you want to get a wife for him? What? What an idea!"\n\n"God\'s will be done! You are in the place of parents to us."\n\nAnd after making a sign to her son, she and the man threw themselves on the\nfloor at the prince\'s feet.\n\n"Why do you stoop to the ground?" asked Nekhliudof peevishly, taking her by\nthe shoulder. "You know I don\'t like this sort of thing. Marry your son, of\ncourse, if you have a girl in view. I should be very glad if you had a\ndaughter-in-law to help you."\n\nThe old woman got up, and began to rub her dry eyes with her sleeves.\nDavidka followed her example, and, rubbing his eyes with his weak fist,\nwith the same patiently-submissive expression, continued to stand, and\nlisten to what Arina said.\n\n"Plenty of brides, certainly. Here\'s Vasiutka Mikheikin\'s daughter, and a\nright good girl she is; but the girl would not come to us without your\nconsent."\n\n"Isn\'t she willing?"\n\n"No, benefactor, she isn\'t."\n\n"Well, what\'s to be done? I can\'t compel her. Select some one else. If you\ncan\'t find one at home, go to another village. I will pay for her, only she\nmust come of her own free will. It is impossible to marry her by force.\nThere\'s no law allows that; that would be a great sin."\n\n"_E-e-kh!_ benefactor! Is it possible that any one would come to us of her\nown accord, seeing our way of life, our wretchedness? Not even the wife of\na soldier would like to undergo such want. What peasant would let us have\nhis daughter?[39] It is not to be expected. You see we\'re in the very\ndepths of poverty. They will say, \'Since you starved one to death, it will\nbe the same with my daughter.\' Who is to give her?" she added, shaking her\nhead dubiously. "Give us your advice, excellency."\n\n[Footnote 39: _dyevka_, marriageable girl.]\n\n"Well, what can I do?"\n\n"Think of some one for us, kind sir," repeated Arina urgently. "What are we\nto do?"\n\n"How can I think of any one? I can\'t do any thing at all for you as things\nare."\n\n"Who will help us if you do not?" said Arina, drooping her head, and\nspreading her palms with an expression of melancholy discontent.\n\n"Here you ask for grain, and so I will give orders for some to be delivered\nto you," said the prince after a short silence, during which Arina sighed,\nand Davidka imitated her. "But I cannot do any thing more."\n\nNekhliudof went into the entry. Mother and son with low bows followed the\nprince.\n\n\nXII.\n\n"O-okh! alas for my wretchedness!" exclaimed Arina, sighing deeply.\n\nShe paused, and looked angrily at her son. Davidka immediately turned\naround, and, clumsily lifting his stout leg incased in a huge dirty boot\nover the threshold, took refuge in the opposite door.\n\n"What shall I do with him, father?" continued Arina, turning to the prince.\n"You yourself see what he is. He is not a bad man;[40] doesn\'t get drunk,\nand is peaceable; wouldn\'t hurt a little child. It\'s a sin to say hard\nthings of him. There\'s nothing bad about him, and God knows what has taken\nplace in him to make him so bad to himself. You see he himself does not\nlike it. Would you believe it, father,[41] my heart bleeds when I look at\nhim, and see what suffering he undergoes. You see, whatever he is, he is my\nson. I pity him. Oh, how I pity him!... You see, it isn\'t as though he had\ndone any thing against me or his father or the authorities. But, no: he\'s a\nbashful man, almost like a child. How can he bear to be a widower? Help us\nout, benefactor," she said once more, evidently desirous of removing the\nunfavorable impression which her bitter words might have left upon the\nprince. "Father, your excellency, I"--She went on to say in a confidential\nwhisper, "My wit does not go far enough to explain him. It seems as though\nbad men had spoiled him."\n\n[Footnote 40: _muzhik._]\n\n[Footnote 41: _batiushka._]\n\nShe paused for a moment.\n\n"If we could find the men, we might cure him."\n\n"What nonsense you talk, Arina! How can he be spoiled?"\n\n"My father, they spoil him so that they make him a no-man forever! Many bad\npeople in the world! Out of ill-will they take a handful of earth from out\nof one\'s path, or something of that sort; and one is made a no-man forever\nafter. Isn\'t that a sin? I think to myself, Might I not go to the old man\nDanduk, who lives at Vorobyevka? He knows all sorts of words; and he knows\nherbs, and he can make charms; and he finds water with a cross. Wouldn\'t he\nhelp me?" said the woman. "Maybe he will cure him."\n\n"What abjectness and superstition!" thought the young prince, shaking his\nhead gloomily, and walking back with long strides through the village.\n\n"What\'s to be done with him? To leave him in this situation is impossible,\nboth for myself and for the others and for him,--impossible," he said to\nhimself, counting off on his fingers these reasons.\n\n"I cannot bear to see him in this plight; but how extricate him? He renders\nnugatory all my best plans for the management of the estate. If such\npeasants are allowed, none of my dreams will ever be realized," he went on,\nexperiencing a feeling of despite and anger against the peasant in\nconsequence of the ruin of his plans. "To send him to Siberia, as Yakof\nsuggests, against his will, would that be good for him? or to make him a\nsoldier? That is best. At least I should be quit of him, and I could\nreplace him by a decent peasant."\n\nSuch was his decision.\n\nHe thought about this with satisfaction; but at the same time something\nobscurely told him that he was thinking with only one side of his mind, and\nnot wholly right.\n\nHe paused.\n\n"I will think about it some more," he said to himself. "To send him off as\na soldier--why? He is a good man, better than many; and I know.... Shall I\nfree him?" he asked himself, putting the question from a different side of\nhis mind. "It wouldn\'t be fair. Yes, it\'s impossible."\n\nBut suddenly a thought occurred to him that greatly pleased him. He smiled\nwith the expression of a man who has decided a difficult question.\n\n"I will take him to the house," he said to himself. "I will look after him\nmyself; and by means of kindness and advice, and selecting his employment,\nI will teach him to work, and reform him."\n\n\nXIII.\n\n"That\'s the way I\'ll do," said Nekhliudof to himself with a pleasant\nself-consciousness; and then, recollecting that he had still to go to the\nrich peasant Dutlof, he directed his steps toward a lofty and ample\nestablishment, with two chimneys, standing in the midst of the village.\n\nAs he passed a neighboring hut on his way thither, he stopped to speak with\na tall, disorderly-looking peasant-woman of forty summers, who came to meet\nhim.\n\n"A pleasant holiday, father,"[42] she said, with some show of assurance,\nstopping at a little distance from him with a pleased smile and a low\nobeisance.\n\n"Good-morning, my nurse. How are you? I was just going to see your\nneighbor."\n\n"Pretty well, your excellency, my father. It\'s a good idea. But won\'t you\ncome in? I beg you to. My old man would be very pleased."\n\n"Well, I\'ll come; and we\'ll have a little talk with you, nurse. Is this\nyour house?"\n\n"It is, sir."[42]\n\n[Footnote 42: _batiushka._]\n\nAnd the nurse led the way into the hut. Nekhliudof followed her into the\nentry, and sat down on a tub, and began to smoke a cigarette.\n\n"It\'s hot inside. It\'s better to sit down here, and have our talk," he said\nin reply to the woman\'s invitation to go into the hut.\n\nThe nurse was a well-preserved and handsome woman. In the features of her\ncountenance, and especially in her big black eyes, there was a strong\nresemblance to the prince himself. She folded her hands under her apron,\nand looking fearlessly at him, and incessantly moving her head, began to\ntalk with him.\n\n"Why is it, father? why do you wish to visit Dutlof?"\n\n"Oh, I am anxious for him to take thirty desiatins[43] of land of me, and\nenlarge his domain; and moreover I want him to buy some wood from me also.\nYou see, he has money, so why should it be idle? What do you think about\nit, nurse?"\n\n[Footnote 43: eighty-one acres.]\n\n"Well, what can I say? The Dutlofs are strong people: he\'s the leading\npeasant in the whole estate," replied the nurse, shaking her head. "Last\nsummer he built another building out of his own lumber. He did not call\nupon the estate at all. He has horses, and yearling colts besides, at least\nsix troikas, and cattle, cows, and sheep; so that it is a sight worth\nseeing when they are driven along the street from pasture, and the women of\nthe house come out to get them into the yard. There is such a crush of\nanimals at the gate that they can scarcely get through, so many of them\nthere are. And two hundred bee-hives at the very least. He is a strong\npeasant, and must have money."\n\n"But what do you think,--has he much money?" asked the prince.\n\n"Men say, out of spite of course, that the old man has no little money. But\nhe does not go round talking about it, and he does not tell even his sons,\nbut he must have. Why shouldn\'t he take hold of the woodland? Perhaps he\nis afraid of getting the reputation for money. Five years ago he went into\na small business with Shkalik the porter. They got some meadow-land; and\nthis Shkalik, some way or other, cheated him, so that the old man was three\nhundred rubles out of pocket. And from that time he has sworn off. How can\nhe help being forehanded, your excellency, father?" continued the nurse.\n"He has three farms, a big family, all workers; and besides, the old\nman--it is hard to say it--is a capital manager. He is lucky in every\nthing; it is surprising,--in his grain and in his horses and in his cattle\nand in his bees, and he\'s lucky in his children. Now he has got them all\nmarried off. He has found husbands for his daughters; and he has just\nmarried Ilyushka, and given him his freedom. He himself bought the letter\nof enfranchisement. And so a fine woman has come into his house."\n\n"Well, do they live harmoniously?" asked the prince.\n\n"As long as there\'s the right sort of a head to the house, they get along.\nYet even the Dutlofs--but of course that\'s among the women. The\ndaughters-in-law bark at each other a little behind the oven, but the old\nman generally holds them in hand; and the sons live harmoniously."\n\nThe nurse was silent for a little.\n\n"Now, the old man, we hear, wants to leave his eldest son, Karp, as master\nof the house. \'I am getting old,\' says he. \'It\'s my business to attend to\nthe bees.\' Well, Karp is a good peasant, a careful peasant; but he doesn\'t\nmanage to please the old man in the least. There\'s no sense in it."\n\n"Well, perhaps Karp wants to speculate in land and wood. What do you think\nabout it?", pursued the prince, wishing to learn from the woman all that\nshe knew about her neighbors.\n\n"Scarcely, sir,"[44] continued the nurse. "The old man hasn\'t disclosed his\nmoney to his son. As long as he lives, of course, the money in the house\nwill be under the old man\'s control; and it will increase all the time\ntoo."\n\n[Footnote 44: _batiushka._]\n\n"But isn\'t the old man willing?"\n\n"He is afraid."\n\n"What is he afraid of?"\n\n"How is it possible, sir, for a seignorial peasant to make a noise about\nhis money? And it\'s a hard question to decide what to do with money anyway.\nHere he went into business with the porter, and was cheated. Where was he\nto get redress? And so he lost his money. But with the proprietor he would\nhave any loss made good immediately, of course."\n\n"Yes, hence," ... said Nekhliudof, reddening. "But good-by, nurse."\n\n"Good-by, sir, your excellency. Greatly obliged to you."\n\n\nXIV.\n\n"Hadn\'t I better go home?" mused Nekhliudof, as he strode along toward the\nDutlof enclosure, and felt a boundless melancholy and moral weariness.\n\nBut at this moment the new deal gates were thrown open before him with a\ncreaking sound; and a handsome, ruddy fellow of eighteen in wagoner\'s\nattire appeared, leading a troika of powerful-limbed and still sweaty\nhorses. He hastily brushed back his blonde hair, and bowed to the prince.\n\n"Well, is your father at home, Ilya?" asked Nekhliudof.\n\n"At the bee-house, back of the yard," replied the youth, driving the\nhorses, one after the other, through the half-opened gates.\n\n"I will not give it up. I will make the proposal. I will do the best I\ncan," reflected Nekhliudof; and, after waiting till the horses had passed\nout, he entered Dutlof\'s spacious yard.\n\nIt was plain to see that the manure had only recently been carried away.\nThe ground was still black and damp; and in places, particularly in the\nhollows, were left red fibrous clots.\n\nIn the yard and under the high sheds, many carts stood in orderly rows,\ntogether with ploughs, sledges, harrows, barrels, and all sorts of farming\nimplements. Doves were flitting about, cooing in the shadows under the\nbroad solid rafters. There was an odor of manure and tar.\n\nIn one corner Karp and Ignat were fitting a new cross-bar to a large\niron-mounted, three-horse cart.\n\nAll three of Dutlof\'s sons bore a strong family resemblance. The youngest,\nIlya, who had met Nekhliudof at the gate, was beardless, of smaller\nstature, ruddier complexion, and more neatly dressed, than the others. The\nsecond, Ignat, was rather taller and darker. He had a wedge-shaped beard;\nand though he wore boots, a driver\'s shirt, and a lamb\'s-skin cap, he had\nnot such a festive, holiday appearance as his brother had.\n\nThe eldest, Karp, was still taller. He wore clogs, a gray kaftan, and a\nshirt without gussets. He had a reddish beard, trimmed; and his expression\nwas serious, even to severity.\n\n"Do you wish my father sent for, your excellency?" he asked, coming to meet\nthe prince, and bowing slightly and awkwardly.\n\n"No, I will go to him at the hives: I wish to see what he\'s building there.\nBut I should like a talk with you," said Nekhliudof, drawing him to the\nother side of the yard, so that Ignat might not overhear what he was about\nto talk about with Karp.\n\nThe self-confidence and degree of pride noticeable in the deportment of the\ntwo peasants, and what the nurse had told the young prince, so troubled\nhim, that it was difficult for him to make up his mind to speak with them\nabout the matter proposed.\n\nHe had a sort of guilty feeling, and it seemed to him easier to speak with\none brother out of the hearing of the other. Karp seemed surprised that the\nprince took him to one side, but he followed him.\n\n"Well, now," began Nekhliudof awkwardly,--"I wished to inquire of you if\nyou had many horses."\n\n"We have about five troikas, also some colts," replied Karp in a\nfree-and-easy manner, scratching his back.\n\n"Well, are your brothers going to take out relays of horses for the post?"\n\n"We shall send out three troikas to carry the mail. And there\'s Ilyushka,\nhe has been off with his team; but he\'s just come back."\n\n"Well, is that profitable for you? How much do you earn that way?"\n\n"What do you mean by profit, your excellency? We at least get enough to\nlive on and bait our horses, thank God for that!"\n\n"Then, why don\'t you take hold of something else? You see, you might buy\nwood, or take more land."\n\n"Of course, your excellency: we might rent some land if there were any\nconvenient."\n\n"I wish to make a proposition to you. Since you only make enough out of\nyour teaming to live on, you had better take thirty desiatins of land from\nme. All that strip behind Sapof I will let you have, and you can carry on\nyour farming better."\n\nAnd Nekhliudof, carried away by his plan for a peasant farm, which more\nthan once he had proposed to himself, and deliberated about, began fluently\nto explain to the peasant his proposition about it.\n\nKarp listened attentively to the prince\'s words.\n\n"We are very grateful for your kindness," said he, when Nekhliudof stopped,\nand looked at him in expectation of his answer. "Of course here there\'s\nnothing very bad. To occupy himself with farming is better for a peasant\nthan to go off as a whip. He goes among strangers; he sees all sorts of\nmen; he gets wild. It\'s the very best thing for a peasant, to occupy\nhimself with land."\n\n"You think so, do you?"\n\n"As long as my father is alive, how can I think, your excellency? It\'s as\nhe wills."\n\n"Take me to the bee-hives. I will talk with him."\n\n"Come with me this way," said Karp, slowly directing himself to the barn\nback of the house. He opened a low gate which led to the apiary, and after\nletting the prince pass through, he shut it, and returned to Ignat, and\nsilently took up his interrupted labors.\n\n\nXV.\n\nNekhliudof, stooping low, passed through the low gate, under the gloomy\nshed, to the apiary, which was situated behind the yard.\n\nA small space, surrounded by straw and a wattled hedge, through the chinks\nof which the light streamed, was filled with bee-hives symmetrically\narranged, and covered with shavings, while the golden bees were humming\naround them. Every thing was bathed in the warm and brilliant rays of the\nJuly sun.\n\nFrom the gate a well-trodden footway led through the middle to a wooden\nside-building, with a tin-foil image on it gleaming brightly in the sun.\n\nA few orderly young lindens lifting, above the thatched roof of the\nneighboring court-yard, their bushy tops, almost audibly rustled their\ndark-green, fresh foliage, in unison with the sound of the buzzing bees.\nAll the shadows from the covered hedge, from the lindens, and from the\nhives, fell dark and short on the delicate curling grass springing up\nbetween the planks.\n\nThe bent, small figure of the old man, with his gray hair and bald spot\nshining in the sun, was visible near the door of a straw-thatched structure\nsituated among the lindens. When he heard the creaking of the gate, the old\nman looked up, and wiping his heated, sweaty face with the flap of his\nshirt, and smiling with pleasure, came to meet the prince.\n\nIn the apiary it was so comfortable, so pleasant, so warm, so free! The\nfigure of the gray-haired old man, with thick wrinkles radiating from his\neyes, and wearing wide shoes on his bare feet, as he came waddling along,\ngood-naturedly and contentedly smiling, to welcome the prince to his own\nprivate possessions, was so ingenuously soothing that Nekhliudof for a\nmoment forgot the trying impressions of the morning, and his cherished\ndream came vividly up before him. He already saw all his peasants just as\nprosperous and contented as the old man Dutlof, and all smiling soothingly\nand pleasantly upon him, because to him alone they were indebted for their\nprosperity and happiness.\n\n"Would you like a net, your excellency? The bees are angry now," said the\nold man, taking down from the fence a dirty gingham bag fragrant of honey,\nand handing it to the prince. "The bees know me, and don\'t sting," he\nadded, with the pleasant smile that rarely left his handsome sunburned\nface.\n\n"I don\'t need it either. Well, are they swarming yet?" asked Nekhliudof,\nalso smiling, though without knowing why.\n\n"Yes, they are swarming, father, Mitri Mikolayevitch,"[45] replied the old\nman, throwing an expression of peculiar endearment into this form of\naddressing his barin by his name and patronymic. "They have only just begun\nto swarm; it has been a cold spring, you know."\n\n[Footnote 45: _batiushka_; Mitri Mikolayevitch, rustic for Dmitri\nNikolayevitch.]\n\n"I have just been reading in a book," began Nekhliudof, defending himself\nfrom a bee which had got entangled in his hair, and was buzzing under his\near, "that if the wax stands straight on the bars, then the bees swarm\nearlier. Therefore such hives as are made of boards ... with cross-b--"\n\n"You don\'t want to gesticulate; that makes it worse," said the little old\nman. "Now don\'t you think you had better put on the net?"\n\nNekhliudof felt a sharp pain, but by some sort of childish egotism he did\nnot wish to give in to it; and so, once more refusing the bag, continued to\ntalk with the old man about the construction of hives, about which he had\nread in "Maison Rustique," and which, according to his idea, ought to be\nmade twice as large. But another bee stung him in the neck, and he lost the\nthread of his discourse and stopped short in the midst of it.\n\n"That\'s well enough, father, Mitri Mikolayevitch," said the old man,\nlooking at the prince with paternal protection; "that\'s well enough in\nbooks, as you say. Yes; maybe the advice is given with some deceit, with\nsome hidden meaning; but only just let him do as he advises, and we shall\nbe the first to have a good laugh at his expense. And this happens! How are\nyou going to teach the bees where to deposit their wax? They themselves put\nit on the cross-bar, sometimes straight and sometimes aslant. Just look\nhere!" he continued, opening one of the nearest hives, and gazing at the\nentrance-hole blocked by a bee buzzing and crawling on the crooked comb.\n"Here\'s a young one. It sees; at its head sits the queen, but it lays the\nwax straight and sideways, both according to the position of the block,"\nsaid the old man, evidently carried away by his interest in his occupation,\nand not heeding the prince\'s situation. "Now, to-day, it will fly with the\npollen. To-day is warm; it\'s on the watch," he continued, again covering up\nthe hive and pinning down with a cloth the crawling bee; and then brushing\noff into his rough palm a few of the insects from his wrinkled neck.\n\nThe bees did not sting him; but as for Nekhliudof, he could scarcely\nrefrain from the desire to beat a retreat from the apiary. The bees had\nalready stung him in three places, and were buzzing angrily on all sides\naround his head and neck.\n\n"You have many hives?" he asked as he retreated toward the gate.\n\n"What God has given," replied Dutlof sarcastically. "It is not necessary to\ncount them, father; the bees don\'t like it. Now, your excellency, I wanted\nto ask a favor of you," he went on to say, pointing to the small posts\nstanding by the fence. "It was about Osip, the nurse\'s husband. If you\nwould only speak to him. In our village it\'s so hard to act in a neighborly\nway; it\'s not good."\n\n"How so?... Ah, how they sting!" exclaimed the prince, already seizing the\nlatch of the gate.\n\n"Every year now, he lets his bees out among my young ones. We could stand\nit, but strange bees get away their comb and kill them," said the old man,\nnot heeding the prince\'s grimaces.\n\n"Very well, by and by; right away," said Nekhliudof. And having no longer\nstrength of will to endure, he hastily beat a retreat through the gate,\nfighting his tormentors with both hands.\n\n"Rub it with dirt. It\'s nothing," said the old man, coming to the door\nafter the prince. The prince took some earth, and rubbed the spot where he\nhad been stung, and reddened as he cast a quick glance at Karp and Ignat,\nwho did not deign to look at him. Then he frowned angrily.\n\n\nXVI.\n\n"I wanted to ask you something about my sons, your excellency," said the\nold man, either pretending not to notice, or really not noticing, the\nprince\'s angry face.\n\n"What?"\n\n"Well, we are well provided with horses, praise the Lord! and that\'s our\ntrade, and so we don\'t have to work on your land."\n\n"What do you mean?"\n\n"If you would only be kind enough to let my sons have leave of absence,\nthen Ilyushka and Ignat would take three troikas, and go out teaming for\nall summer. Maybe they\'d earn something."\n\n"Where would they go?"\n\n"Just as it happened," replied Ilyushka, who at this moment, having put the\nhorses under the shed, joined his father. "The Kadminski boys went with\neight horses to Romen. Not only earned their own living, they say, but\nbrought back a gain of more than three hundred per cent. Fodder, they say,\nis cheap at _Odest_."\n\n"Well, that\'s the very thing I wanted to talk with you about," said the\nprince, addressing the old man, and anxious to draw him shrewdly into a\ntalk about the farm. "Tell me, please, if it would be more profitable to go\nto teaming than farming at home?"\n\n"Why not more profitable, your excellency?" said Ilyushka, again putting in\nhis word, and at the same time quickly shaking back his hair. "There\'s no\nway of keeping horses at home."\n\n"Well, how much do you earn in the summer?"\n\n"Since spring, as feed was high, we went to Kief with merchandise, and to\nKursk, and back again to Moscow with grits; and in that way we earned our\nliving. And our horses had enough, and we brought back fifteen rubles in\nmoney."\n\n"There\'s no harm in taking up with an honorable profession, whatever it\nis," said the prince, again addressing the old man. "But it seems to me\nthat you might find another form of activity. And besides, this work is\nsuch that a young man goes everywhere. He sees all sorts of people,--may\nget wild," he added, quoting Karp\'s words.\n\n"What can we peasants take up with, if not teaming?" objected the old man\nwith his sweet smile. "If you are a good driver, you get enough to eat, and\nso do your horses; but, as regards mischief, they are just the same as at\nhome, thank the Lord! It isn\'t the first time that they have been. I have\nbeen myself, and never saw any harm in it, nothing but good."\n\n"How many other things you might find to do at home! with fields and\nmeadows"--\n\n"How is it possible?" interrupted Ilyushka with animation. "We were born\nfor this. All the regulations are at our fingers\' ends. We like the work.\nIt\'s the most enjoyable we have, your excellency. How we like to go\nteaming!"\n\n"Your excellency, will you not do us the honor of coming into the house?\nYou have not yet seen our new domicile," said the old man, bowing low, and\nwinking to his son.\n\nIlyushka hastened into the house, and Nekhliudof and the old man followed\nafter him.\n\n\nXVII.\n\nAs soon as he got into the house, the old man bowed once more; then using\nhis coat-tail to dust the bench in the front of the room, he smiled, and\nsaid,--\n\n"What do you want of us, your excellency?"\n\nThe hut was bright and roomy, with a chimney; and it had a loft and berths.\nThe fresh aspen-wood beams, between which could be seen the moss, scarcely\nfaded, were as yet not turned dark. The new benches and the loft were not\npolished smooth, and the floor was not worn. One young peasant woman,\nrather lean, with a serious oval face, was sitting on a berth, and using\nher foot to rock a hanging cradle that was suspended from the ceiling by a\nlong hook. This was Ilya\'s wife.\n\nIn the cradle lay at full length a suckling child, scarcely breathing, and\nwith closed eyes.\n\nAnother young woman, robust and rosy-cheeked, with her sleeves rolled up\nabove her elbows, showing strong arms and hands red even higher than her\nwrists, was standing in front of the oven, and mincing onions in a wooden\ndish. This was Karp\'s wife.\n\nA pock-marked woman, showing signs of pregnancy, which she tried to\nconceal, was standing near the oven. The room was hot, not only from the\nsummer sun, but from the heat of the oven; and there was a strong smell of\nbaking bread.\n\nTwo flaxen-headed little boys and a girl gazed down from the loft upon the\nprince, with faces full of curiosity. They had come in, expecting something\nto eat.\n\nNekhliudof was delighted to see this happy household; and at the same time\nhe felt a sense of constraint in presence of these peasants, men and women,\nall looking at him. He flushed a little as he sat down on the bench.\n\n"Give me a crust of hot bread: I am fond of it," said he, and the flush\ndeepened.\n\nKarp\'s wife cut off a huge slice of bread, and handed it on a plate to the\nprince. Nekhliudof said nothing, not knowing what to say. The women also\nwere silent, the old man smiled benevolently.\n\n"Well, now why am I so awkward? as though I were to blame for something,"\nthought Nekhliudof. "Why shouldn\'t I make my proposition about the farm?\nWhat stupidity!" Still he remained silent.\n\n"Well, father Mitri Mikolayevitch, what are you going to say about my boys\'\nproposal?" asked the old man.\n\n"I should advise you absolutely not to send them away, but to have them\nstay at home, and work," said Nekhliudof, suddenly collecting his wits.\n"You know what I have proposed to you. Go in with me, and buy some of the\ncrown woods and some more land"--\n\n"But how are we going to get money to buy it, your excellency?" he asked,\ninterrupting the prince.\n\n"Why, it isn\'t very much wood, only two hundred rubles\' worth," replied\nNekhliudof.\n\nThe old man gave an indignant laugh.\n\n"Very good, if that\'s all. Why not buy it?" said he.\n\n"Haven\'t you money enough?" asked the prince reproachfully.\n\n"_Okh!_ Sir, your excellency!" replied the old man, with grief expressed in\nhis tone, looking apprehensively toward the door. "Only enough to feed my\nfamily, not enough to buy woodland."\n\n"But you know you have money,--what do you do with it?" insisted\nNekhliudof.\n\nThe old man suddenly fell into a terrible state of excitement: his eyes\nflashed, his shoulders began to twitch.\n\n"Wicked men may say all sorts of things about me," he muttered in a\ntrembling voice. "But, so may God be my witness!" he said, growing more and\nmore animated, and turning his eyes toward the ikon, "may my eyes crack,\nmay I perish with all my family, if I have any thing more than the fifteen\nsilver rubles which Ilyushka brought home; and we have to pay the poll-tax,\nyou yourself know that. And we built the hut"--\n\n"Well, well, all right," said the prince, rising from the bench. "Good-by,\nfriends."[46]\n\n[Footnote 46: _Proshchaite_, _khozyaeva_.]\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n"My God! my God!" was Nekhliudof\'s mental exclamation, as with long strides\nhe hastened home through the shady alleys of his weed-grown garden, and,\nabsent-mindedly, snapped off the leaves and branches which fell in his way.\n\n"Is it possible that my dreams about the ends and duties of my life are all\nidle nonsense? Why is it hard for me, and mournful, as though I were\ndissatisfied with myself because I imagined that having once begun this\ncourse I should constantly experience the fulness of the morally pleasant\nfeeling which I had when, for the first time, these thoughts came to me?"\n\nAnd with extraordinary vividness and distinctness he saw in his imagination\nthat happy moment which he had experienced a year before.\n\nHe had arisen very early, before every one else in the house, and feeling\npainfully those secret, indescribable impulses of youth, he had gone\naimlessly out into the garden, and from there into the woods; and, amid the\nenergetic but tranquil nature pulsing with the new life of Maytime, he had\nwandered long alone, without thought, and suffering from the exuberance of\nsome feeling, and not finding any expression for it.\n\nThen, with all the allurement of what is unknown, his youthful imagination\nbrought up before him the voluptuous form of a woman; and it seemed to him\nthat was the object of his indescribable longing. But another, deeper\nsentiment said, _Not that_, and impelled him to search and be disturbed in\nmind.\n\nWithout thought or desire, as always happens after extra activity, he lay\non his back under a tree, and looked at the diaphanous morning-clouds\ndrifting over him across the deep, endless sky.\n\nSuddenly, without any reason, the tears sprang to his eyes, and God knows\nin what way the thought came to him with perfect clearness, filling all his\nsoul and giving him intense delight,--the thought that love and\nrighteousness are the same as truth and enjoyment, and that there is only\none truth, and only one possible happiness, in the world.\n\nThe deeper feeling this time did not say, _Not that_. He sat up, and began\nto verify this thought.\n\n"That is it, that is it," said he to himself, in a sort of ecstasy,\nmeasuring all his former convictions, all the phenomena of his life, by the\ntruth just discovered to him, and as it seemed to him absolutely new.\n\n"What stupidity! All that I knew, all that I believed in, all that I\nloved," he had said to himself. "Love is self-denying; this is the only\ntrue happiness independent of chance," he had said over and over again,\nsmiling and waving his hands.\n\nApplying this thought on every side to life, and finding in it confirmation\nboth of life and that inner voice which told him that this was _it_, he had\nexperienced a new feeling of pleasant agitation and enthusiasm.\n\n"And so I ought to do good if I would be happy," he thought; and all his\nfuture vividly came up before him, not as an abstraction, but in images in\nthe form of the life of a proprietor.\n\nHe saw before him a huge field, conterminous with his whole life, which he\nwas to consecrate to the good, and in which really he should find\nhappiness. There was no need for him to search for a sphere of activity; it\nwas all ready. He had one out-and-out obligation: he had his serfs....\n\nAnd what comfortable and beneficent labor lay before him! "To work for this\nsimple, impressionable, incorruptible class of people; to lift them from\npoverty; to give them pleasure; to give them education which, fortunately,\nI will turn to use in correcting their faults, which arise from ignorance\nand superstition; to develop their morals; to induce them to love the\nright.... What a brilliant, happy future! And besides all this, I, who am\ngoing to do this for my own happiness, shall take delight in their\nappreciation, shall see how every day I shall go farther and farther toward\nmy predestined end. A wonderful future! Why could I not have seen this\nbefore?\n\n"And besides," so he had thought at the same time, "who will hinder me from\nbeing happy in love for a woman, in enjoyment of family?"\n\nAnd his youthful imagination portrayed before him a still more bewitching\nfuture.\n\n"I and my wife, whom I shall love as no one ever loved a wife before in the\nworld, we shall always live amid this restful, poetical, rural nature, with\nour children, maybe, and with my old aunt. We have our love for each other,\nour love for our children; and we shall both know that our aim is the\nright. We shall help each other in pressing on to this goal. I shall make\ngeneral arrangements; I shall give general aid when it is right; I shall\ncarry on the farm, the savings bank, the workshop. And she, with her dear\nlittle head, and dressed in a simple white dress, which she lifts above\nher dainty ankle as she steps through the mud, will go to the peasants\'\nschool, to the hospital, to some unfortunate peasant who in truth does not\ndeserve help, and everywhere carry comfort and aid.... Children, old men,\nwomen, will wait for her, and look on her as on some angel, as on\nProvidence. Then she will return, and hide from me the fact that she has\nbeen to see the unfortunate peasant, and given him money; but I shall know\nall, and give her a hearty hug, and rain kisses thick and fast on her\nlovely eyes, her modestly-blushing cheeks, and her smiling, rosy lips."\n\n\nXIX.\n\n"Where are those dreams?" the young man now asked himself as he walked home\nafter his round of visits. "Here more than a year has passed since I have\nbeen seeking for happiness in this course, and what have I found? It is\ntrue, I sometimes feel that I can be contented with myself; but this is a\ndry, doubtful kind of content. Yet, no; I am simply dissatisfied! I am\ndissatisfied because I find no happiness here; and I desire, I passionately\nlong for, happiness. I have not experienced delight, I have cut myself off\nfrom all that gives it. Wherefore? for what end? Does that make it easier\nfor any one?\n\n"My aunt was right when she wrote that it is easier to find happiness than\nto give it to others. Have my peasants become any richer? Have they learned\nany thing? or have they shown any moral improvement? Not the least. They\nare no better off, but it grows harder and harder every day for me. If I\nsaw any success in my undertakings, if I saw any signs of gratitude, ...\nbut, no! I see falsely directed routine, vice, untruthfulness,\nhelplessness. I am wasting the best years of my life."\n\nThus he said to himself, and he recollected that his neighbors, as he heard\nfrom his nurse, called him "a mere boy;" that he had no money left in the\ncounting-room; that his new threshing-machine, which he had invented, much\nto the amusement of the peasants, only made a noise, and did not thresh\nany thing when it had been set in motion for the first time in presence of\nnumerous spectators, who had gathered at the threshing-floor; that from day\nto day he had to expect the coming of the district judge for the list of\ngoods and chattels, which he had neglected to make out, having been\nengrossed in various new enterprises on his estate.\n\nAnd suddenly there arose before him, just as vividly as, before, that walk\nthrough the forest and his ideal of rural life had arisen,--just as vividly\nthere appeared his little university room at Moscow, where he used to sit\nhalf the night before a solitary candle, with his chum and his favorite boy\nfriend.\n\nThey used to read for five hours on a stretch, and study such stupid\nlessons in civil law; and when they were done with them, they would send\nfor supper, open a bottle of champagne, and talk about the future which\nawaited them.\n\nHow entirely different the young student had thought the future would be!\nThen the future was full of enjoyment, of varied occupation, brilliant with\nsuccess, and beyond a peradventure sure to bring them both to what seemed\nto them the greatest blessing in the world,--to fame.\n\n"He will go on, and go on rapidly, in that path," thought Nekhliudof of his\nfriend; "but I"....\n\nBut by this time he was already mounting the steps to his house; and near\nit were standing a score of peasants and house-servants, waiting with\nvarious requests to the prince. And this brought him back from dreams to\nthe reality.\n\nAmong the crowd was a ragged and blood-stained peasant-woman, who was\nlamenting and complaining of her father-in-law, who had been beating her.\nThere were two brothers, who for two years past had been going on shares in\ntheir domestic arrangements, and now looked at each other with hatred and\ndespair. There was also an unshaven, gray-haired domestic serf, with hands\ntrembling from the effects of intoxication; and this man was brought to the\nprince by his son, a gardener, who complained of his disorderly conduct.\nThere was a peasant, who had driven his wife out of the house because she\nhad not worked any all the spring. There was also the wife, a sick woman,\nwho sobbed, but said nothing, as she sat on the grass by the steps,--only\nshowed her inflamed and swollen leg, carelessly wrapped up in a filthy rag.\n\nNekhliudof listened to all the petitions and complaints; and after he had\ngiven advice to one, blamed others, and replied to still others, he began\nto feel a sort of whimsical sensation of weariness, shame, weakness, and\nregret. And he went to his room.\n\n\nXX.\n\nIn the small room occupied by Nekhliudof stood an old leather sofa\ndecorated with copper nails, a few chairs of the same description, an\nold-fashioned inlaid extension-table with scallops and brass mountings, and\nstrewn with papers, and an old-fashioned English grand with narrow keys,\nbroken and twisted.\n\nBetween the windows hung a large mirror with an old carved frame gilded. On\nthe floor, near the table, lay packages of papers, books, and accounts.\n\nThis room, on the whole, had a characterless and disorderly appearance; and\nthis lively disorder presented a sharp contrast with the affectedly\naristocratic arrangement of the other rooms of the great mansion.\n\nWhen Nekhliudof reached his room, he flung his hat angrily on the table,\nand sat down in a chair which stood near the piano, crossed his legs, and\nshook his head.\n\n"Will you have lunch, your excellency?" asked a tall, thin, wrinkled old\nwoman, who entered just at this instant, dressed in a cap, a great\nkerchief, and a print dress.\n\nNekhliudof looked at her for a moment or two in silence, as though\ncollecting his thoughts.\n\n"No: I don\'t wish any thing, nurse," said he, and again fell into thought.\n\nThe nurse shook her head at him in some vexation, and sighed.\n\n"Eh! Father, Dmitri Nikolayevitch, are you melancholy? Such tribulation\ncomes, but it will pass away. God knows"....\n\n"I am not melancholy. What have you brought, Malanya Finogenovna?" replied\nNekhliudof, endeavoring to smile.\n\n"Ain\'t melancholy! can\'t I see?" the old woman began to say with warmth.\n"The whole livelong day to be all sole alone! And you take every thing to\nheart so, and look out for every thing; and besides, you scarcely eat any\nthing. What\'s the reason of it? If you\'d only go to the city, or visit your\nneighbors, as others do! You are young, and the idea of bothering over\nthings so! Pardon me, little father, I will sit down," pursued the old\nnurse, taking a seat near the door. "You see, we have got into such a habit\nthat we lose fear. Is that the way gentlemen do? There\'s no good in it. You\nare only ruining yourself, and the people are spoiled. That\'s just like our\npeople: they don\'t understand it, that\'s a fact. You had better go to your\nauntie. What she wrote was good sense," said the old nurse, admonishing\nhim.\n\nNekhliudof kept growing more and more dejected. His right hand, resting on\nhis knee, lazily struck the piano, making a chord, a second, a third.\n\nNekhliudof moved nearer, drew his other hand from his pocket, and began to\nplay. The chords which he made were sometimes not premeditated, were\noccasionally not even according to rule, often remarkable for absurdity,\nand showed that he was lacking in musical talent; but the exercise gave him\na certain indefinable melancholy enjoyment.\n\nAt every modification in the harmony, he waited with muffled heart-beat for\nwhat would come out of it; and when any thing came, he, in a dark sort of\nway, completed with his imagination what was missing.\n\nIt seemed to him that he heard a hundred melodies, and a chorus, and an\norchestra simultaneously joining in with his harmony. But his chief\npleasure was in the powerful activity of his imagination; confused and\nbroken, but bringing up with striking clearness before him the most varied,\nmixed, and absurd images and pictures from the past and the future.\n\nNow it presents the puffy figure of Davidka Byelui, timidly blinking his\nwhite eyelashes at the sight of his mother\'s black fist with its net-work\nof veins; his bent back, and huge hands covered with white hairs,\nexhibiting a uniform patience and submission to fate, sufficient to\novercome torture and deprivation.\n\nThen he saw the brisk, presuming nurse, and, somehow, seemed to picture her\ngoing through the villages, and announcing to the peasants that they ought\nto hide their money from the proprietors; and he unconsciously said to\nhimself, "Yes, it is necessary to hide money from the proprietors."\n\nThen suddenly there came up before him the fair head of his future wife,\nfor some reason weeping and leaning on his shoulder in deep grief.\n\nThen he seemed to see Churis\'s kindly blue eyes looking affectionately at\nhis pot-bellied little son. Yes, he saw in him a helper and savior, apart\nfrom his son. "That is love," he whispered.\n\nThen he remembered Yukhvanka\'s mother, remembered the expression of\npatience and conciliation which, notwithstanding her prominent teeth and\nher irregular features, he recognized on her aged face.\n\n"It must be that I have been the first during her seventy years of life, to\nrecognize her good qualities," he said to himself, and whispered\n"Strange;" but he continued still to drum on the piano, and to listen to\nthe sounds.\n\nThen he vividly recalled his retreat from the bees, and the expressions on\nthe faces of Karp and Ignat, who evidently wanted to laugh though they made\nbelieve not look at him. He reddened, and involuntarily glanced at the old\nnurse, who still remained sitting by the door, looking at him with silent\nattention, occasionally shaking her gray head.\n\nHere, suddenly, he seemed to see a troika of sleek horses, and Ilyushka\'s\nhandsome, robust form, with bright curls, gayly shining, narrow blue eyes,\nfresh complexion, and delicate down just beginning to appear on lip and\nchin.\n\nHe remembered how Ilyushka was afraid that he would not be permitted to go\nteaming, and how eagerly he argued in favor of the work that he liked so\nwell. And he saw the gray early morning, that began with mist, and the\nsmooth paved road, and the long lines of three-horse wagons, heavily laden\nand protected by mats, and marked with big black letters. The stout,\ncontented, well-fed horses, thundering along with their bells, arching\ntheir backs, and tugging on the traces, pulled in unison up the hill,\nforcefully straining on their long-nailed shoes over the smooth road.\n\nAs the train of wagons reached the foot of the hill, the postman had\nquickly dashed by with jingling bells, which were echoed far and wide by\nthe great forest extending along on both sides of the road.\n\n"_A-a-ai!_" in a loud, boyish voice, shouts the head driver, who has a\nbadge on his lambskin cap, and swings his whip around his head.\n\nBeside the front wheel of the front team, the redheaded, cross-looking\nKarp is walking heavily in huge boots. In the second team Ilyushka shows\nhis handsome head, as he sits on the driver\'s seat playing the bugle. Three\ntroika-wagons loaded with boxes, with creaking wheels, with the sound of\nbells and shouts, file by. Ilyushka once more hides his handsome face under\nthe matting, and falls off to sleep.\n\nNow it is a fresh, clear evening. The deal gates open for the weary horses\nas they halt in front of the tavern yard; and one after the other, the high\nmat-covered teams roll in across the planks that lie at the gates, and come\nto rest under the wide sheds.\n\nIlyushka gayly exchanges greetings with the light-complexioned,\nwide-bosomed landlady, who asks, "Have you come far? and will there be many\nof you to supper?" and at the same time looks with pleasure on the handsome\nlad, with her bright, kindly eyes.\n\nAnd now, having unharnessed the horses, he goes into the warm house[47]\ncrowded with people, crosses himself, sits down at the generous wooden\nbowl, and enters into lively conversation with the landlady and his\ncompanions.\n\n[Footnote 47: _izba_.]\n\nAnd then he goes to bed in the open air, under the stars which gleam down\ninto the shed. His bed is fragrant hay, and he is near the horses, which,\nstamping and snorting, eat their fodder in the wooden cribs. He goes to the\nshed, turns toward the east, and after crossing himself thirty times in\nsuccession on his broad brawny chest, and throwing back his bright curls,\nhe repeats "Our Father" and "Lord have mercy" a score of times, and\nwrapping himself, head and all, in his cloak, sleeps the healthy, dreamless\nsleep of strong, fresh manhood.\n\nAnd here he sees in his vision the city of Kief, with its saints and\nthrongs of priests; Romen, with its merchants and merchandise; he sees\n_Odest_, and the distant blue sea studded with white sails, and the city of\nTsar-grad,[48] with its golden palaces, and the white-breasted, dark-browed\nTurkish maidens; and thither he flies, lifting himself on invisible wings.\n\n[Footnote 48: Constantinople.]\n\nHe flies freely and easily, always farther and farther away, and sees below\nhim golden cities bathed in clear effulgence, and the blue sky with bright\nstars, and a blue sea with white sails; and smoothly and pleasantly he\nflies, always farther and farther away....\n\n"Splendid!" whispers Nekhliudof to himself; and the thought, "Why am I not\nIlyushka?" comes to him.\n\n\n\n\nLUCERNE.\n\n_FROM THE RECOLLECTIONS OF PRINCE NEKHLIUDOF._\n\n\nJULY 20,1857.\n\nYesterday evening I arrived at Lucerne, and put up at the best inn there,\nthe Schweitzerhof.\n\n"Lucerne, the chief city of the canton, situated on the shore of the\nVierwaldstaetter See," says Murray, "is one of the most romantic places of\nSwitzerland: here cross three important highways, and it is only an hour\'s\ndistance by steamboat to Mount Righi, from which is obtained one of the\nmost magnificent views in the world."\n\nWhether that be true or no, other Guides say the same thing, and\nconsequently at Lucerne there are throngs of travellers of all\nnationalities, especially the English.\n\nThe magnificent five-storied building of the Hotel Schweitzerhof is\nsituated on the quay, at the very edge of the lake, where in olden times\nthere used to be the crooked covered wooden bridge[49] with chapels on the\ncorners and pictures on the roof. Now, thanks to the tremendous inroad of\nEnglishmen, with their necessities, their tastes, and their money, the old\nbridge has been torn down, and in its place has been erected a granite\nquay, straight as a stick. On the quay are built the long, quadrangular\nfive-storied houses; in front of the houses two rows of lindens have been\nset out and provided with supports, and between the lindens are the usual\nsupply of green benches.\n\n[Footnote 49: Hofbruecke, torn down in 1852.]\n\nThis is the promenade; and here back and forth stroll the Englishwomen in\ntheir Swiss straw hats, and the Englishmen in simple and comfortable\nattire, and rejoice in that which they have caused to be created. Possibly\nthese quays and houses and lindens and Englishmen would be excellent in\ntheir way anywhere else, but here they seem discordant amid this strangely\ngrandiose and at the same time indescribably harmonious and smiling nature.\n\nAs soon as I went up to my room, and opened the window facing the lake, the\nbeauty of the sheet of water, of these mountains, and of this sky, at the\nfirst moment literally dazzled and overwhelmed me. I experienced an inward\nunrest, and the necessity of expressing in some manner the feelings that\nsuddenly filled my soul to overflowing. I felt a desire to embrace,\npowerfully to embrace, some one, to tickle him, or to pinch him; in short,\nto do to him and to myself something extraordinary.\n\nIt was seven o\'clock in the evening. The rain had been falling all day, but\nnow it had cleared off.\n\nThe lake, blue as heated sulphur, spread out before my windows smooth and\nmotionless, like a concave mirror between the variegated green shores; its\nsurface was dotted with boats, which left behind them vanishing trails.\nFarther away it was contracted between two monstrous headlands, and,\ndarkling, set itself against and disappeared behind a confused pile of\nmountains, clouds, and glaciers. In the foreground stretched a panorama of\nmoist, fresh green shores, with reeds, meadows, gardens, and villas.\nFarther away, the dark-green wooded heights, crowned with the ruins of\nfeudal castles; in the background, the rolling, pale-lilac-colored vista of\nmountains, with fantastic peaks built up of crags and dead white mounds of\nsnow. And every thing was bathed in a fresh, transparent atmosphere of\nazure blue, and kindled by the warm rays of the setting sun, bursting forth\nthrough the riven skies.\n\nNot on the lake nor on the mountains nor in the skies was there a single\ncompleted line, a single unmixed color, a single moment of repose;\neverywhere motion, irregularity, fantasy, endless conglomeration and\nvariety of shades and lines; and above all, a calm, a softness, a unity,\nand a striving for the beautiful.\n\nAnd here amid this indefinable, confused, unfettered beauty, before my very\nwindow, stretched in stupid kaleidoscopic confusion the white line of the\nquay, the lindens with their supports, and the green seats,--miserable,\ntasteless creations of human ingenuity, not subordinated, like the distant\nvillas and ruins, to the general harmony of the beautiful scene, but on the\ncontrary brutally contradicting it.... Constantly, though against my will,\nmy eyes were attracted to that horribly straight line of the quay; and\nmentally I should have liked to spurn it, to demolish it like a black spot\ndisfiguring the nose beneath one\'s eye.\n\nBut the quay with the sauntering Englishmen remained where it was, and I\ninvoluntarily tried to find a point of view where it would be out of my\nsight. I succeeded in finding such a view; and till dinner was ready I took\ndelight, alone by myself, in this incomplete and therefore the more\nenjoyable feeling of oppression that one experiences in the solitary\ncontemplation of natural beauty.\n\nAbout half-past seven I was called to dinner. Two long tables,\naccommodating at least a hundred persons, were spread in the great,\nmagnificently decorated dining-room on the first floor.... The silent\ngathering of the guests lasted three minutes,--the _frou-frou_ of women\'s\ndresses, the soft steps, the softly-spoken words addressed to the courtly\nand elegant waiters. And all the places were occupied by ladies and\ngentlemen dressed elegantly, even richly, and for the most part in perfect\ntaste.\n\nAs is apt to be the case in Switzerland, the majority of the guests were\nEnglish, and this gave the ruling characteristics of the common table: that\nis, a strict decorum regarded as an obligation, a reserve founded not in\npride but in the absence of any necessity for social relationship, and\nfinally a uniform sense of satisfaction felt by each in the comfortable and\nagreeable gratification of his wants.\n\nOn all sides gleamed the whitest laces, the whitest collars, the whitest\nteeth,--natural and artificial,--the whitest complexions and hands. But the\nfaces, many of which were very handsome, bore the expression merely of\nindividual prosperity, and absolute absence of interest in all that\nsurrounded them unless it bore directly on their own individual selves; and\nthe white hands glittering with rings, or protected by mitts, moved only\nfor the purpose of straightening collars, cutting meat, or filling\nwine-glasses; no soul-felt emotion was betrayed in these actions.\n\nOccasionally members of some one family would exchange remarks in subdued\nvoices, about the excellence of such and such a dish or wine, or about the\nbeauty of the view from Mount Righi.\n\nIndividual tourists, whether men or women, sat alongside of each other in\nsilence, and did not even seem to see each other. If it happened\noccasionally, that, out of this five-score human beings, two spoke to each\nother, the topic of their conversation consisted uniformly in the weather,\nor the ascent of the Righi.\n\nKnives and forks scarcely rattled on the plates, so perfect was the\nobservance of propriety; and no one dared to convey pease and vegetables to\nthe mouth otherwise than on the fork. The waiters, involuntarily subdued by\nthe universal silence, asked in a whisper what wine you would be pleased to\norder.\n\nSuch dinners invariably depress me: I dislike them, and before they are\nover I become blue.... It always seems to me as if I were in some way to\nblame; just as when I was a boy I was set upon a chair in consequence of\nsome naughtiness, and bidden ironically, "Now rest a little while, my dear\nyoung fellow." And all the time my young blood was pulsing through my\nveins, and in the other room I could hear the merry shouts of my brothers.\n\nI used to try to rebel against this feeling of being choked down, which I\nexperienced at such dinners, but in vain. All these dead-and-alive faces\nhave an irresistible ascendency over me, and I myself become also as one\ndead. I have no desires, I have no thoughts: I do not even observe.\n\nAt first I attempted to enter into conversation with my neighbors; but I\ngot no response beyond the phrases which had been repeated in that place a\nhundred times, a thousand times, with absolutely no variation of\ncountenance.\n\nAnd yet these people were by no means all stupid and feelingless; but\nevidently many of them, though they seemed so dead, had got into the habit\nof leading self-centred lives, which in reality were far more complicated\nand interesting than my own. Why, then, should they deprive themselves of\none of the greatest enjoyments of life,--the enjoyment that comes from the\nintercourse of man with man?\n\nHow different it used to be in our _pension_ at Paris, where twenty of us,\nbelonging to as many different nationalities, professions, and\nindividualities, met together at a common table, and, under the influence\nof the Gallic sociability, found the keenest zest!\n\nThere, from the very moment that we sat down, from one end of the table to\nthe other, was general conversation, sandwiched with witticisms and puns,\nthough often in a broken speech. There every one, without being solicitous\nfor the proprieties, said whatever came into his head. There we had our own\nphilosopher, our own disputant, our own _bel esprit_, our own butt,--all\ncommon property.\n\nThere, immediately after dinner, we would move the table to one side, and,\nwithout paying too much attention to rhythm, take to dancing the polka on\nthe dusty carpet, and often keep it up till evening. There, though we were\nrather flirtatious, and not over-wise, but perfectly respectable, still we\nwere human beings.\n\nAnd the Spanish countess with romantic proclivities, and the Italian\n_abbate_ who insisted on declaiming from the Divine Comedy after dinner,\nand the American doctor who had the _entree_ into the Tuileries, and the\nyoung dramatic author with long hair, and the pianist who, according to her\nown account, had composed the best polka in existence, and the unhappy\nwidow who was a beauty, and wore three rings on every finger,--all of us\nenjoyed this society, which, though somewhat superficial, was human and\npleasant. And we each carried away from it hearty recollections of each\nother, perhaps lighter in some cases, and more serious in others.\n\nBut at these English _table-d\'hote_ dinners, as I look at all these laces,\nribbons, jewels, pomaded locks, and silken dresses, I often think how many\nliving women would be happy, and would make others happy, with these\nadornments.\n\nStrange to think how many friends and lovers--most fortunate friends and\nlovers--are sitting here side by side, without, perhaps, knowing it! And\nGod knows why they never come to this knowledge, and never give each other\nthis happiness, which they might so easily give, and which they so long\nfor.\n\nI began to feel blue, as invariably happens after such a dinner; and,\nwithout waiting for dessert, I sallied out in the same frame of mind for a\nconstitutional through the city. My melancholy frame of mind was not\nrelieved, but rather confirmed by the narrow, muddy streets without\nlanterns, the shuttered shops, the encounters with drunken workmen, and\nwith women hastening after water, or in bonnets, glancing around them as\nthey turned the corners.\n\nIt was perfectly dark in the streets, when I returned to the hotel without\ncasting a glance about me, or having an idea in my head. I hoped that sleep\nwould put an end to my melancholy. I experienced that peculiar spiritual\nchill and loneliness and heaviness, which, without any reason, beset those\nwho are just arrived in any new place.\n\nLooking steadfastly down, I walked along the quay to the Schweitzerhof,\nwhen suddenly my ear was struck by the strains of a peculiar but thoroughly\nagreeable and sweet music.\n\nThese strains had an immediately enlivening effect upon me. It was as\nthough a bright, cheerful light had poured into my soul. I felt contented,\ngay. My slumbering attention was awakened again to all surrounding objects;\nand the beauty of the night and the lake, to which till then I had been\nindifferent, suddenly came over me with quickening force like a novelty.\n\nI involuntarily took in at a glance the dark sky with gray clouds flecking\nits deep blue, now lighted by the rising moon, the glassy dark-green lake\nwith its surface reflecting the lighted windows, and far away the snowy\nmountains; and I heard the croaking of the frogs over on the Freshenburg\nshore, and the dewy fresh call of the quail.\n\nDirectly in front of me, in the spot whence the sounds of music had first\ncome, and which still especially attracted my attention, I saw, amid the\nsemi-darkness on the street, a throng of people standing in a semi-circle,\nand in front of the crowd, at a little distance, a small man in dark\nclothes.\n\nBehind the throng and the man, there stood out harmoniously against the\ndark, ragged sky, gray and blue, the black tops of a few Lombardy poplars\nin some garden, and, rising majestically on high, the two stern spires that\nstand on the towers of the ancient cathedral.\n\nI drew nearer, and the strains became more distinct. At some distance I\ncould clearly distinguish the full accords of a guitar, sweetly swelling in\nthe evening air, and several voices, which, while taking turns with each\nother, did not sing any definite theme, but gave suggestions of one in\nplaces wherever the melody was most pronounced.\n\nThe theme was in somewhat the nature of a mazurka, sweet and graceful. The\nvoices sounded now near at hand, now far distant; now a bass was heard, now\na tenor, now a falsetto such as the Tyrolese warblers are wont to sing.\n\nIt was not a song, but the graceful masterly sketch of a song. I could not\ncomprehend what it was, but it was beautiful.\n\nThose voluptuous, soft chords of the guitar, that sweet, gentle melody, and\nthat solitary figure of the man in black, amid the fantastic environment of\nthe lake, the gleaming moon, and the twin spires of the cathedral rising in\nmajestic silence, and the black tops of the poplars,--all was strange and\nperfectly beautiful, or at least seemed so to me.\n\nAll the confused, arbitrary impressions of life suddenly became full of\nmeaning and beauty. It seemed to me as though a fresh fragrant flower had\nsprung up in my soul. In place of the weariness, dulness, and indifference\ntoward every thing in the world, which I had been feeling the moment\nbefore, I experienced a necessity for love, a fulness of hope, and an\nunbounded enjoyment of life.\n\n"What dost thou desire, what dost thou long for?" an inner voice seemed to\nsay. "Here it is. Thou art surrounded on all sides by beauty and poetry.\nBreathe it in, in full, deep draughts, as long as thou hast strength. Enjoy\nit to the full extent of thy capacity. \'Tis all thine, all blessed!"\n\nI drew nearer. The little man was, as it seemed, a travelling Tyrolese. He\nstood before the windows of the hotel, one leg a little advanced, his head\nthrown back; and, as he thrummed on the guitar, he sang his graceful song\nin all those different voices.\n\nI immediately felt an affection for this man, and a gratefulness for the\nchange which he had brought about in me.\n\nThe singer, so far as I was able to judge, was dressed in an old black\ncoat. He had short black hair, and he wore a civilian\'s hat that was no\nlonger new. There was nothing artistic in his attire, but his clever and\nyouthfully gay motions and pose, together with his diminutive stature,\nformed a pleasing and at the same time pathetic spectacle.\n\nOn the steps, in the windows, and on the balconies of the brilliantly\nlighted hotel, stood ladies handsomely decorated and attired, gentlemen\nwith polished collars, porters and lackeys in gold-embroidered liveries; in\nthe street, in the semi-circle of the crowd, and farther along on the\nsidewalk, among the lindens, were gathered groups of well-dressed waiters,\ncooks in white caps and aprons, and young girls wandering about with arms\nabout each other\'s waists.\n\nAll, it seemed, were under the influence of the same feeling that I myself\nexperienced. All stood in silence around the singer, and listened\nattentively. Silence reigned, except in the pauses of the song, when there\ncame from far away across the waters the regular click of a hammer, and\nfrom the Freshenburg shore rang in fascinating monotone the voices of the\nfrogs, interrupted by the mellow, monotonous call of the quail.\n\nThe little man in the darkness, in the midst of the street, poured out his\nheart like a nightingale, in couplet after couplet, song after song. Though\nI had come close to him, his singing continued to give me greater and\ngreater gratification.\n\nHis voice, which was not of great power, was extremely pleasant and tender;\nthe taste and feeling for rhythm which he displayed in the control of it\nwere extraordinary, and proved that he had great natural gifts.\n\nAfter he sung each couplet, he invariably repeated the theme in variation,\nand it was evident that all his graceful variations came to him at the\ninstant, spontaneously.\n\nAmong the crowd, and above on the Schweitzerhof, and near by on the\nboulevard, were heard frequent murmurs of approval, though generally the\nmost respectful silence reigned.\n\nThe balconies and the windows kept filling more and more with handsomely\ndressed men and women leaning on their elbows, and picturesquely\nilluminated by the lights in the house.\n\nPromenaders came to a halt, and in the darkness on the quay stood men and\nwomen in little groups. Near me, at some distance from the common crowd,\nstood an aristocratic cook and lackey, smoking their cigars. The cook was\nforcibly impressed by the music, and at every high falsetto note\nenthusiastically nodded his head to the lackey, and nudged him with his\nelbow with an expression of astonishment that seemed to say, "How he sings!\nhey?"\n\nThe lackey, whose careless smile betrayed the depth of feeling that he\nexperienced, replied to the cook\'s nudges by shrugging his shoulders, as if\nto show that it was hard enough for him to be made enthusiastic, and that\nhe had heard much better music.\n\nIn one of the pauses of his song, while the minstrel was clearing his\nthroat, I asked the lackey who he was, and if he often came there.\n\n"Twice this summer he has been here," replied the lackey. "He is from\nAargau; he goes round begging."\n\n"Well, do many like him come round here?" I asked.\n\n"Oh, yes," replied the lackey, not comprehending the full force of what I\nasked; but, immediately after, recollecting himself, he added, "Oh, no.\nThis one is the only one I ever heard here. No one else."\n\nAt this moment the little man had finished his first song, briskly twanged\nhis guitar, and said something in his German patois, which I could not\nunderstand, but which brought forth a hearty round of laughter from the\nsurrounding throng.\n\n"What was that he said?" I asked.\n\n"He says that his throat is dried up, he would like some wine," replied the\nlackey who was standing near me.\n\n"What? is he rather fond of the glass?"\n\n"Yes, all that sort of people are," replied the lackey, smiling and\npointing at the minstrel.\n\nThe minstrel took off his cap, and swinging his guitar went toward the\nhotel. Raising his head, he addressed the ladies and gentlemen standing by\nthe windows and on the balconies, saying in a half-Italian, half-German\naccent, and with the same intonation that jugglers use in speaking to their\naudiences,--\n\n"_Messieurs et mesdames, si vous croyez que je gagne quelque chose, vous\nvous trompez: je ne suis qu\'un pauvre tiaple._"\n\nHe stood in silence a moment, but as no one gave him any thing, he once\nmore took up his guitar and said,--\n\n"_A present, messieurs et mesdames, je vous chanterai l\'air du Righi._"\n\nHis hotel audience made no response, but stood in expectation of the coming\nsong. Below on the street a laugh went round, probably in part because he\nhad expressed himself so strangely, and in part because no one had given\nhim any thing.\n\nI gave him a few centimes, which he deftly changed from one hand to the\nother, and bestowed them in his vest-pocket; and then, replacing his cap,\nbegan once more to sing the graceful, sweet Tyrolese melody which he had\ncalled _l\'air du Righi_.\n\nThis song, which formed the last on his programme, was even better than the\npreceding, and from all sides in the wondering throng were heard sounds of\napprobation.\n\nHe finished. Again he swung his guitar, took off his cap, held it out in\nfront of him, went two or three steps nearer to the windows, and again\nrepeated his stock phrase,--\n\n"_Messieurs et mesdames, si vous croyez que je gagne quelque chose_," which\nhe evidently considered to be very shrewd and witty; but in his voice and\nmotions I perceived a certain irresolution and childish timidity which were\nespecially touching in a person of such diminutive stature.\n\nThe elegant public, still picturesquely grouped in the lighted windows and\non the balconies, were shining in their rich attire; a few conversed in\nsoberly discreet tones, apparently about their singer who was standing\nthere below them with outstretched hand; others gazed down with attentive\ncuriosity on the little black figure; on one balcony could be heard the\nmerry, ringing laughter of some young girl.\n\nIn the surrounding crowd the talk and laughter grew constantly louder and\nlouder.\n\nThe singer for the third time repeated his phrase, but in a still weaker\nvoice, and did not even end the sentence; and again he stretched his hand\nwith his cap, but instantly drew it back. Again not one of those\nbrilliantly dressed scores of people standing to listen to him threw him a\npenny.\n\nThe crowd laughed heartlessly.\n\nThe little singer, so it seemed to me, shrunk more into himself, took his\nguitar into his other hand, lifted his cap, and said,--\n\n"_Messieurs et mesdames, je vous remercie, et je vous souhais une bonne\nnuit._" Then he put on his hat.\n\nThe crowd cackled with laughter and satisfaction. The handsome ladies and\ngentlemen, calmly exchanging remarks, withdrew gradually from the\nbalconies. On the boulevard the promenading began once more. The street,\nwhich had been still during the singing, assumed its wonted liveliness; a\nfew men, however, stood at some distance, and, without approaching the\nsinger, looked at him and laughed.\n\nI heard the little man muttering something between his teeth as he turned\naway; and I saw him, apparently growing more and more diminutive, hurry\ntoward the city with brisk steps. The promenaders who had been looking at\nhim followed him at some distance, still making merry at his expense. My\nmind was in a whirl; I could not comprehend what it all meant; and still\nstanding in the same place, I gazed abstractedly into the darkness after\nthe little man, who was fast disappearing, as he went with ever-increasing\nswiftness with long strides into the city, followed by the merry-making\npromenaders.\n\nI was overmastered by a feeling of pain, of bitterness, and above all, of\nshame for the little man, for the crowd, for myself, as though it were I\nwho had asked for money and received none; as though it were I who had been\nturned to ridicule.\n\nWithout looking any longer, feeling my heart oppressed, I also hurried with\nlong strides toward the entrance of the Schweitzerhof. I could not explain\nthe feeling that overmastered me; only there was something like a stone,\nfrom which I could not free myself, weighing down my soul and oppressing\nme.\n\nAt the ample, well-lighted entrance, I met the porter, who politely made\nway for me. An English family was also at the door. A portly, handsome, and\ntall gentleman, with black side-whiskers, in a black hat, and with a plaid\non one arm, while in his hand he carried a costly cane, came out slowly and\nfull of importance. Leaning on his arm was a lady, who wore a raw silk\ndress and bonnet with bright ribbons and the most costly laces. Together\nwith them was a pretty, fresh-looking young lady, in a graceful Swiss hat\nwith a feather _a la mousquetaire_; from under it escaped long light-yellow\ncurls softly encircling her fair face. In front of them skipped a buxom\ngirl of ten, with round white knees which showed from under her thin\nembroideries. "Magnificent night!" the lady was saying in a sweet, happy\nvoice, as I passed them.\n\n"Oh, yes," growled the Englishman lazily; and it was evident that he found\nit so enjoyable to be alive in the world, that it was too much trouble even\nto speak.\n\nAnd it seemed as though all of them alike found it so comfortable and easy,\nso light and free, to be alive in the world, their faces and motions\nexpressed such perfect indifference to the lives of every one else, and\nsuch absolute confidence that it was to them that the porter made way and\nbowed so profoundly, and that when they returned they would find clean,\ncomfortable beds and rooms, and that all this was bound to be, and was\ntheir indefeasible right, that I involuntarily contrasted them with the\nwandering minstrel who weary, perhaps hungry, full of shame, was retreating\nbefore the laughing crowd. And then suddenly I comprehended what it was\nthat oppressed my heart with such a load of heaviness, and I felt an\nindescribable anger against these people.\n\nTwice I walked up and down past the Englishman, and each time, without\nturning out for him, my elbow punched him, which gave me a feeling of\nindescribable satisfaction; and then, darting down the steps, I hastened\nthrough the darkness in the direction toward the city taken by the little\nman.\n\nOvertaking the three men who had been walking together, I asked them where\nthe singer was; they laughed, and pointed straight ahead. There he was,\nwalking alone with brisk steps; no one was with him; all the time, as it\nseemed to me, he was indulging in bitter monologue.\n\nI caught up with him, and proposed to him to go somewhere with me and drink\na bottle of wine. He kept on with his rapid walk, and scarcely deigned to\nlook at me; but when he perceived what I was saying, he halted.\n\n"Well, I would not refuse, if you would be so kind," said he; "here is a\nlittle cafe, we can go in there. It\'s not fashionable," he added, pointing\nto a drinking-saloon that was still open.\n\nHis expression "not fashionable" involuntarily suggested the idea of not\ngoing to an unfashionable cafe, but to go to the Schweitzerhof, where those\nwho had been listening to him were. Notwithstanding the fact that several\ntimes he showed a sort of timid disquietude at the idea of going to the\nSchweitzerhof, declaring that it was too fine for him there, still I\ninsisted in carrying out my purpose; and he, putting the best face on the\nmatter, gayly swinging his guitar, went back with me across the quay.\n\nA few loiterers who had happened along as I was talking with the minstrel,\nand had stopped to hear what I had to say, now, after arguing among\nthemselves, followed us to the very entrance of the hotel, evidently\nexpecting from the Tyrolese some further demonstration.\n\nI ordered a bottle of wine of a waiter whom I met in the hall. The waiter\nsmiled and looked at us, and went by without answering. The head waiter, to\nwhom I addressed myself with the same order, listened to me solemnly, and,\nmeasuring the minstrel\'s modest little figure from head to foot, sternly\nordered the waiter to take us to the room at the left.\n\nThe room at the left was a bar-room for simple people. In the corner of\nthis room a hunch-backed maid was washing dishes. The whole furniture\nconsisted of bare wooden tables and benches.\n\nThe waiter who came to serve us looked at us with a supercilious smile,\nthrust his hands in his pockets, and exchanged some remarks with the\nhumpbacked dish-washer. He evidently tried to give us to understand that he\nfelt himself immeasurably higher than the minstrel, both in dignity and\nsocial position, so that he considered it not only an indignity, but even\nan actual joke, that he was called upon to serve us.\n\n"Do you wish _vin ordinaire_?" he asked with a knowing look, winking toward\nmy companion, and switching his napkin from one hand to the other.\n\n"Champagne, and your very best," said I, endeavoring to assume my\nhaughtiest and most imposing appearance.\n\nBut neither my champagne, nor my endeavor to look haughty and imposing, had\nthe least effect on the servant: he smiled incredulously, loitered a moment\nor two gazing at us, took time enough to glance at his gold watch, and with\nleisurely steps, as though going out for a walk, left the room.\n\nSoon he returned with the wine, bringing two other waiters with him. These\ntwo sat down near the dish-washer, and gazed at us with amused attention\nand a bland smile, just as parents gaze at their children when they are\ngently playing. Only the dish-washer, it seemed to me, did not look at us\nscornfully but sympathetically.\n\nThough it was trying and awkward to lunch with the minstrel, and to play\nthe entertainer, under the fire of all these waiters\' eyes, I tried to do\nmy duty with as little constraint as possible. In the lighted room I could\nsee him better. He was a small but symmetrically built and muscular man,\nthough almost a dwarf in stature; he had bristly black hair, teary big\nblack eyes, bushy eyebrows, and a thoroughly pleasant, attractively shaped\nmouth. He had little side-whiskers, his hair was short, his attire was very\nsimple and mean. He was not over-clean, was ragged and sunburnt, and in\ngeneral had the look of a laboring-man. He was far more like a poor\ntradesman than an artist.\n\nOnly in his ever humid and brilliant eyes, and in his firm mouth, was there\nany sign of originality or genius. By his face it might be conjectured that\nhis age was between twenty-five and forty; in reality, he was\nthirty-seven.\n\nHere is what he related to me, with good-natured readiness and evident\nsincerity, of his life. He was a native of Aargau. In early childhood he\nhad lost father and mother; other relatives he had none. He had never owned\nany property. He had been apprenticed to a carpenter; but twenty-two years\npreviously one of his hands had been attacked by caries, which had\nprevented him from ever working again.\n\nFrom childhood he had been fond of singing, and he began to be a singer.\nOccasionally strangers had given him money. With this he had learned his\nprofession, bought his guitar, and now for eighteen years he had been\nwandering about through Switzerland and Italy, singing before hotels. His\nwhole luggage consisted of his guitar, and a little purse in which, at the\npresent time, there was only half a franc. That would have to suffice for\nsupper and lodgings this night.\n\nEvery year now for eighteen years he had made the round of the best and\nmost popular resorts of Switzerland,--Zurich, Lucerne, Interlaken,\nChamounix, etc.; by the way of the St. Bernard he would go down into Italy,\nand return over the St. Gothard, or through Savoy. Just at present it was\nrather hard for him to walk, as he had caught a cold, causing him to suffer\nfrom some trouble in his legs,--he called it rheumatism,--which grew more\nsevere from year to year; and, moreover, his voice and eyes had grown\nweaker. Nevertheless, he was on his way to Interlaken, Aix-les-Bains, and\nthence over the Little St. Bernard to Italy, which he was very fond of. It\nwas evident that on the whole he was well content with his life.\n\nWhen I asked him why he returned home, if he had any relatives there, or a\nhouse and land, his mouth parted in a gay smile, and he replied, "_Oui, le\nsucre est bon, il est doux pour les enfants!_" and he winked at the\nservants.\n\nI did not catch his meaning, but the group of servants burst out laughing.\n\n"No, I have nothing of the sort, but still I should always want to go\nback," he explained to me. "I go home because there is always a something\nthat draws one to one\'s native place." And once more he repeated with a\nshrewd, self-satisfied smile, his phrase, "_Oui, le sucre est bon_," and\nthen laughed good-naturedly.\n\nThe servants were very much amused, and laughed heartily; only the\nhunch-backed dish-washer looked earnestly from her big kindly eyes at the\nlittle man, and picked up his cap for him, when, as we talked, he once\nknocked it off the bench. I have noticed that wandering minstrels,\nacrobats, even jugglers, delight in calling themselves artists, and several\ntimes I hinted to my comrade that he was an artist; but he did not at all\naccept this designation, but with perfect simplicity looked upon his work\nas a means of existence.\n\nWhen I asked him if he had not himself written the songs which he sang, he\nshowed great surprise at such a strange question, and replied that the\nwords of whatever he sang were all of old Tyrolese origin.\n\n"But how about that song of the Righi? I think that cannot be very\nancient," I suggested.\n\n"Oh, that was composed about fifteen years ago. There was a German in\nBasel; he was a clever man; it was he who composed it. A splendid song. You\nsee he composed it especially for travellers." And he began to repeat the\nwords of the Righi song, which he liked so well, translating them into\nFrench as he went along.\n\n    "_If you wish to go to Righi,\n    You will not need shoes to Wegis,\n    (For you go that far by steamboat),\n    But from Wegis take a stout staff,\n    Also take upon your arm a maiden;\n    Drink a glass of wine on starting,\n    Only do not drink too freely,\n    For if you desire to drink here,\n    You must earn the right to, first._"\n\n"Oh! a splendid song!" he exclaimed, as he finished.\n\nThe servants, evidently, also found the song much to their mind, because\nthey came up closer to us.\n\n"Yes, but who was it composed the music?" I asked.\n\n"Oh, no one at all; you know you must have something new when you are going\nto sing for strangers."\n\nWhen the ice was brought, and I had given my comrade a glass of champagne,\nhe seemed somewhat ill at ease, and, glancing at the servants, he turned\nand twisted on the bench.\n\nWe touched our glasses to the health of all artists; he drank half a glass,\nthen he seemed to be collecting his ideas, and knit his brows in deep\nthought.\n\n"It is long since I have tasted such wine, _je ne vous dis que ca_. In\nItaly the _vino d\'Asti_ is excellent, but this is still better. Ah! Italy;\nit is splendid to be there!" he added.\n\n"Yes, there they know how to appreciate music and artists," said I, trying\nto bring him round to the evening\'s mischance before the Schweitzerhof.\n\n"No," he replied. "There, as far as music is concerned, I cannot give\nanybody satisfaction. The Italians are themselves musicians,--none like\nthem in the world; but I know only Tyrolese songs. They are something of a\nnovelty to them, though."\n\n"Well, you find rather more generous gentlemen there, don\'t you?" I went on\nto say, anxious to make him share in my resentment against the guests of\nthe Schweitzerhof. "There it would not be possible to find a big hotel\nfrequented by rich people, where, out of a hundred listening to an artist\'s\nsinging, not one would give him any thing."\n\nMy question utterly failed of the effect that I expected. It did not enter\nhis head to be indignant with them: on the contrary, he saw in my remark an\nimplied slur upon his talent which had failed of its reward, and he\nhastened to set himself right before me. "It is not every time that you get\nany thing," he remarked; "sometimes one isn\'t in good voice, or you are\ntired; now to-day I have been walking ten hours, and singing almost all the\ntime. That is hard. And these important aristocrats do not always care to\nlisten to Tyrolese songs."\n\n"But still, how can they help giving?" I insisted.\n\nHe did not comprehend my remark.\n\n"That\'s nothing," he said; "but here the principal thing is, _on est tres\nserre pour la police_, that\'s what\'s the trouble. Here, according to these\nrepublican laws, you are not allowed to sing; but in Italy you can go\nwherever you please, no one says a word. Here, if they want to let you,\nthey let you; but if they don\'t want to, then they can throw you into\njail."\n\n"What? That\'s incredible!"\n\n"Yes, it is true. If you have been warned once, and are found singing\nagain, they may put you in jail. I was kept there three months once," he\nsaid, smiling as though that were one of his pleasantest recollections.\n\n"Oh! that is terrible!" I exclaimed. "What was the reason?"\n\n"That was in consequence of one of the new republican laws," he went on to\nexplain, growing animated. "They cannot comprehend here that a poor fellow\nmust earn his living somehow. If I were not a cripple, I would work. But\nwhat harm do I do to any one in the world by my singing? What does it mean?\nThe rich can live as they wish, _un pauvre tiaple_ like myself can\'t live\nat all. What kind of laws are these republican ones? If that is the way\nthey run, then we don\'t want a republic: isn\'t that so, my dear sir? We\ndon\'t want a republic, but we want--we simply want--we want"--he hesitated\na little,--"we want natural laws."\n\nI filled up his glass. "You are not drinking," I said.\n\nHe took the glass in his hand, and bowed to me.\n\n"I know what you wish," he said, blinking his eyes at me, and threatening\nme with his finger. "You wish to make me drunk, so as to see what you can\nget out of me; but no, you sha\'n\'t have that gratification."\n\n"Why should I make you drunk?" I inquired. "All I wished was to give you a\npleasure."\n\nHe seemed really sorry that he had offended me by interpreting my\ninsistence so harshly. He grew confused, stood up, and touched my elbow.\n\n"No, no," said he, looking at me with a beseeching expression in his moist\neyes. "I was only joking."\n\nAnd immediately after he made use of some horribly uncultivated slang\nexpression, intended to signify that I was, nevertheless, a fine young man.\n"_Je ne vous dis que ca_," he said in conclusion. In this fashion the\nminstrel and I continued to drink and converse; and the waiters continued\nunceremoniously to stare at us, and, as it seemed, to make ridicule of us.\n\nIn spite of the interest which our conversation aroused in me, I could not\navoid taking notice of their behavior; and I confess I began to grow more\nand more angry.\n\nOne of the waiters arose, came up to the little man, and, regarding the top\nof his head, began to smile. I was already full of wrath against the\ninmates of the hotel, and had not yet had a chance to pour it out on any\none; and now I confess I was in the highest degree irritated by this\naudience of waiters.\n\nThe porter, not removing his hat, came into the room, and sat down near me,\nleaning his elbows on the table. This last circumstance, which was so\ninsulting to my dignity or my vainglory, completely enraged me, and gave an\noutlet for all the wrath which all the evening long had been boiling within\nme. I asked myself why he had so humbly bowed when he had met me before,\nand now, because I was sitting with the travelling minstrel, he came and\ntook his place near me so rudely? I was entirely overmastered by that\nboiling, angry indignation which I enjoy in myself, which I sometimes\nendeavor to stimulate when it comes over me, because it has an exhilarating\neffect upon me, and gives me, if only for a short time, a certain\nextraordinary flexibility, energy, and strength in all my physical and\nmoral faculties.\n\nI leaped to my feet.\n\n"Whom are you laughing at?" I screamed at the waiter; and I felt my face\nturn pale, and my lips involuntarily set together.\n\n"I am not laughing," replied the waiter, moving away from me.\n\n"Yes, you are: you are laughing at this gentleman. And what right have you\nto come, and to take a seat here, when there are guests? Don\'t you dare to\nsit down!"\n\nThe porter, muttering something, got up, and turned to the door.\n\n"What right have you to make sport of this gentleman, and to sit down by\nhim, when he is a guest, and you are a waiter? Why didn\'t you laugh at me\nthis evening at dinner, and come and sit down beside me? Because he is\nmeanly dressed, and sings in the streets? Is that the reason? and because I\nhave better clothes? He is poor, but he is a thousand times better than you\nare; that I am sure of, because he has never insulted any one, but you have\ninsulted him."\n\n"I didn\'t mean any thing," replied my enemy the waiter. "Perhaps I\ndisturbed him by sitting down."\n\nThe waiter did not understand me, and my German was wasted on him. The rude\nporter was about to take the waiter\'s part; but I fell upon him so\nimpetuously that the porter pretended not to understand me, and waved his\nhand.\n\nThe hunch-backed dish-washer, either because she perceived my wrathful\nstate, and feared a scandal, or possibly because she shared my views, took\nmy part, and, trying to force her way between me and the porter, told him\nto hold his tongue, saying that I was right, but at the same time urging me\nto calm myself.\n\n"_Der Herr hat Recht; Sie haben Recht_," she said over and over again. The\nminstrel\'s face presented a most pitiable, terrified expression; and\nevidently he did not understand why I was angry, and what I wanted: and he\nurged me to let him go away as soon as possible.\n\nBut the eloquence of wrath burned within me more and more. I understood it\nall,--the throng that had made merry at his expense, and his auditors who\nhad not given him any thing; and not for all the world would I have held my\npeace.\n\nI believe, that, if the waiters and the porter had not been so submissive,\nI should have taken delight in having a brush with them, or striking the\ndefenceless English lady on the head with a stick. If at that moment I had\nbeen at Sevastopol, I should have taken delight in devoting myself to\nslaughtering and killing in the English trench.\n\n"And why did you take this gentleman and me into this room, and not into\nthe other? What?" I thundered at the porter, seizing him by the arm so that\nhe could not escape from me. "What right had you to judge by his appearance\nthat this gentleman must be served in this room, and not in that? Have not\nall guests who pay, equal rights in hotels? Not only in a republic, but in\nall the world! Your scurvy republic!... Equality, indeed! You would not\ndare to take an Englishman into this room, not even those Englishmen who\nhave heard this gentleman free of cost; that is, who have stolen from him,\neach one of them, the few centimes which ought to have been given to him.\nHow did you dare to take us to this room?"\n\n"That room is closed," said the porter.\n\n"No," I cried, "that isn\'t true; it isn\'t closed."\n\n"Then you know best."\n\n"I know,--I know that you are lying."\n\nThe porter turned his back on me.\n\n"Eh! What is to be said?" he muttered.\n\n"What is to be said?" I cried. "You conduct us instanter into that room!"\n\nIn spite of the dish-washer\'s warning, and the entreaties of the minstrel,\nwho would have preferred to go home, I insisted on seeing the head waiter,\nand went with my guest into the big dining-room. The head waiter, hearing\nmy angry voice, and seeing my menacing face, avoided a quarrel, and, with\ncontemptuous servility, said that I might go wherever I pleased. I could\nnot prove to the porter that he had lied, because he had hastened out of\nsight before I went into the hall.\n\nThe dining-room was, in fact, open and lighted; and at one of the tables\nsat an Englishman and a lady, eating their supper. Although we were shown\nto a special table, I took the dirty minstrel to the very one where the\nEnglishman was, and bade the waiter bring to us there the unfinished\nbottle.\n\nThe two guests at first looked with surprised, then with angry, eyes at the\nlittle man, who, more dead than alive, was sitting near me. They talked\ntogether in a low tone; then the lady pushed back her plate, her silk dress\nrustled, and both of them left the room. Through the glass doors I saw the\nEnglishman saying something in an angry voice to the waiter, and pointing\nwith his hand in our direction. The waiter put his head through the door,\nand looked at us. I waited with pleasurable anticipation for some one to\ncome and order us out, for then I could have found a full outlet for all my\nindignation. But fortunately, though at the time I felt injured, we were\nleft in peace. The minstrel, who before had fought shy of the wine, now\neagerly drank all that was left in the bottle, so that he might make his\nescape as quickly as possible.\n\nHe, however, expressed his gratitude with deep feeling, as it seemed to me,\nfor his entertainment. His teary eyes grew still more humid and brilliant,\nand he made use of a most strange and complicated phrase of gratitude. But\nstill very pleasant to me was the sentence in which he said that if\neverybody treated artists as I had been doing, it would be very good, and\nended by wishing me all manner of happiness. We went out into the hall\ntogether. There stood the servants, and my enemy the porter apparently\nairing his grievances against me before them. All of them, I thought,\nlooked at me as though I were a man who had lost his wits. I treated the\nlittle man exactly like an equal, before all that audience of servants; and\nthen, with all the respect that I was able to express in my behavior, I\ntook off my hat, and pressed his hand with its dry and hardened fingers.\n\nThe servants made believe not pay the slightest attention to me. One of\nthem only indulged in a sarcastic laugh.\n\nAs soon as the minstrel had bowed himself out, and disappeared in the\ndarkness, I went up-stairs to my room, intending to sleep off all these\nimpressions and the foolish childish anger which had come upon me so\nunexpectedly. But finding that I was too much excited to sleep, I once more\nwent down into the street with the intention of walking until I should have\nrecovered my equanimity, and, I must confess, with the secret hope that I\nmight accidentally come across the porter or the waiter or the Englishman,\nand show them all their rudeness, and, most of all, their unfairness. But\nbeyond the porter, who when he saw me turned his back, I met no one; and I\nbegan to promenade in absolute solitude along the quay.\n\n"This is an example of the strange fate of poetry," said I to myself,\nhaving grown a little calmer. "All love it, all are in search of it; it is\nthe only thing in life that men love and seek, and yet no one recognizes\nits power, no one prizes this best treasure of the world, and those who\ngive it to men are not rewarded. Ask any one you please, ask all these\nguests of the Schweitzerhof, what is the most precious treasure in the\nworld, and all, or ninety-nine out of a hundred, putting on a sardonic\nexpression, will say that the best thing in the world is money.\n\n"\'Maybe, though, this does not please you, or coincide with your elevated\nideas,\' it will be urged, \'but what is to be done if human life is so\nconstituted that money alone is capable of giving a man happiness? I cannot\nforce my mind not to see the world as it is,\' it will be added, \'that is,\nto see the truth.\'\n\n"Pitiable is your intellect, pitiable the happiness which you desire! And\nyou yourselves, unhappy creatures, not knowing what you desire, ... why\nhave you all left your fatherland, your relatives, your money-making trades\nand occupations, and come to this little Swiss city of Lucerne? Why did you\nall this evening gather on the balconies, and in respectful silence listen\nto the little beggar\'s song? And if he had been willing to sing longer, you\nwould have been silent and listened longer. What! could money, even\nmillions of it, have driven you all from your country, and brought you all\ntogether in this little nook of Lucerne? Could money have gathered you all\non the balconies to stand for half an hour silent and motionless? No! One\nthing compels you to do it, and will forever have a stronger influence than\nall the other impulses of life: the longing for poetry which you know,\nwhich you do not realize, but feel, always will feel so long as you have\nany human sensibilities. The word \'poetry\' is a mockery to you; you make\nuse of it as a sort of ridiculous reproach; you regard the love for poetry\nas something meet for children and silly girls, and you make sport of them\nfor it. For yourselves you must have something more definite.\n\n"But children look upon life in a healthy way: they recognize and love what\nman ought to love, and what gives happiness. But life has so deceived and\nperverted you, that you ridicule the only thing that you really love, and\nyou seek for what you hate and for what gives you unhappiness.\n\n"You are so perverted that you did not perceive what obligations you were\nunder to the poor Tyrolese who rendered you a pure delight; but at the same\ntime you feel yourselves needlessly obliged to bow before some lord, which\ngives you neither pleasure nor profit, but rather causes you to sacrifice\nyour comfort and convenience. What absurdity! what incomprehensible lack of\nreason!\n\n"But it was not this that made the most powerful impression upon me this\nevening. This blindness to all that gives happiness, this unconsciousness\nof poetic enjoyment, I can almost comprehend, or at least I have become\nwonted to it, since I have almost everywhere met with it in the course of\nmy life; the harsh, unconscious churlishness of the crowd was no novelty to\nme: whatever those who argue in favor of popular sentiment may say, the\nthrong is a conglomeration of very possibly good people, but of people who\ntouch each other only on their coarse animal sides, and express only the\nweakness and harshness of human nature. But how was it that you, children\nof a humane people, you Christians, you simple people, repaid with coldness\nand ridicule the poor beggar who gave you a pure enjoyment? But no, in\nyour country there are asylums for beggars. There are no beggars, there can\nbe none; and there can be no feelings of sympathy, since that would be a\nconfession that beggary existed.\n\n"But he labored, he gave you enjoyment, he besought you to give him\nsomething of your superfluity in payment for his labor of which you took\nadvantage. But you looked upon him with a cool smile as upon one of the\ncuriosities in your lofty brilliant palaces; and though there were a\nhundred of you, favored with happiness and wealth, not one man or one woman\namong you gave him a _sou_. Abashed he went away from you, and the\nthoughtless throng, laughing, followed and ridiculed not you, but him,\nbecause you were cold, harsh, and dishonorable; because you robbed him in\nreceiving the entertainment which he gave you: for this they jeered _him_.\n\n"\'_On the 19th of July, 1857, before the Schweitzerhof Hotel, in which were\nlodging very opulent people, a wandering beggar minstrel sang for half an\nhour his songs, and played his guitar. About a hundred people listened to\nhim. The minstrel thrice asked you all to give him something. No one person\ngave him a thing, and many made sport of him._\'\n\n"This is not an invention, but an actual fact, as those who desire can find\nout for themselves by consulting the papers for the list of those who were\nat the Schweitzerhof on the 19th of July.\n\n"This is an event which the historians of our time ought to describe in\nletters of inextinguishable flame. This event is more significant and more\nserious, and fraught with far deeper meaning, than the facts that are\nprinted in newspapers and histories. That the English have killed several\nthousand Chinese because the Chinese would not sell them any thing for\nmoney while their land is overflowing with ringing coins; that the French\nhave killed several thousand Kabyles because the wheat grows well in\nAfrica, and because constant war is essential for the drill of an army;\nthat the Turkish ambassador in Naples must not be a Jew; and that the\nEmperor Napoleon walks about in Plombieres, and gives his people the\nexpress assurance that he rules only in direct accordance with the will of\nthe people,--all these are words which darken or reveal something long\nknown. But the episode that took place in Lucerne on the 19th of July seems\nto me something entirely novel and strange, and it is connected not with\nthe everlastingly ugly side of human nature, but with a well-known epoch in\nthe development of society. This fact is not for the history of human\nactivities, but for the history of progress and civilization.\n\n"Why is it that this inhuman fact, impossible in any country,--Germany,\nFrance, or Italy,--is quite possible here where civilization, freedom, and\nequality are carried to the highest degree of development, where there are\ngathered together the most civilized travellers from the most civilized\nnations? Why is it that these cultivated human beings, generally capable of\nevery honorable human action, had no hearty, human feeling for one good\ndeed? Why is it that these people who in their palaces, their meetings, and\ntheir societies, labor warmly for the condition of the celibate Chinese in\nIndia, about the spread of Christianity and culture in Africa, about the\nformation of societies for attaining all perfection,--why is it that they\nshould not find in their souls the simple, primitive feeling of human\nsympathy? Has such a feeling entirely disappeared, and has its place been\ntaken by vainglory, ambition, and cupidity, governing these men in their\npalaces, meetings, and societies? Has the spreading of that reasonable,\negotistical association of people, which we call civilization, destroyed\nand rendered nugatory the desire for instinctive and loving association?\nAnd is this that boasted equality for which so much innocent blood has been\nshed, and so many crimes have been perpetrated? Is it possible that\nnations, like children, can be made happy by the mere sound of the word\n\'equality\'?\n\n"Equality before the law? Does the whole life of a people revolve within\nthe sphere of law? Only the thousandth part of it is subject to the law:\nthe rest lies outside of it, in the sphere of the customs and intuitions of\nsociety.\n\n"But in society the lackey is better dressed than the minstrel, and insults\nhim with impunity. I am better dressed than the lackey, and insult him with\nimpunity. The porter considers me higher, but the minstrel lower, than\nhimself; when I made the minstrel my companion, he felt that he was on an\nequality with us both, and behaved rudely. I was impudent to the porter,\nand the porter acknowledged that he was inferior to me. The waiter was\nimpudent to the minstrel, and the minstrel accepted the fact that he was\ninferior to the waiter.\n\n"And is that government free, even though men seriously call it free, where\na single citizen can be thrown into prison because, without harming any\none, without interfering with any one, he does the only thing that he can\nto prevent himself from dying of starvation?\n\n"A wretched, pitiable creature is man with his craving for positive\nsolutions, thrown into this everlastingly tossing, limitless ocean of\n_good_ and _evil_, of combinations and contradictions. For centuries men\nhave been struggling and laboring to put the _good_ on one side, the _evil_\non the other. Centuries will pass, and no matter how much the unprejudiced\nmind may strive to decide where the balance lies between the _good_ and the\n_evil_, the scales will refuse to tip the beam, and there will always be\nequal quantities of the _good_ and the _evil_ on each scale.\n\n"If only man would learn to form judgments, and not to indulge in rash and\narbitrary thoughts, and not to make reply to questions that are propounded\nmerely to remain forever unanswered! If only he would learn that every\nthought is both a lie and a truth!--a lie from the one-sidedness and\ninability of man to recognize all truth; and true because it expresses one\nside of mortal endeavor. There are divisions in this everlastingly\ntumultuous, endless, endlessly confused chaos of the _good_ and the _evil_.\nThey have drawn imaginary lines over this ocean, and they contend that the\nocean is really thus divided.\n\n"But are there not millions of other possible subdivisions from absolutely\ndifferent standpoints, in other planes? Certainly these novel subdivisions\nwill be made in centuries to come, just as millions of different ones have\nbeen made in centuries past.\n\n"Civilization is _good_, barbarism is _evil_; freedom, _good_; slavery,\n_evil_. Now, this imaginary knowledge annihilates the instinctive,\nbeatific, primitive craving for the _good_ that is in human nature. And who\nwill explain to me what is freedom, what is despotism, what is\ncivilization, what is barbarism?\n\n"Where are the boundaries that separate them? And whose soul possesses so\nabsolute a standard of good and evil as to measure these fleeting,\ncomplicated facts? Whose wit is so great as to comprehend and weigh all the\nfacts in the irretrievable past? And who can find any circumstance in which\nthere is no union of _good_ and _evil_? And because I know that I see more\nof one than of the other, is it not because my standpoint is wrong? And who\nhas the ability to separate himself so absolutely from life, even for a\nmoment, as to look upon it from above?\n\n"One, only one infallible Guide we have,--the universal Spirit which\npenetrates all collectively and as units, which has endowed each of us with\nthe craving for the right; the Spirit which impels the tree to grow toward\nthe sun, which stimulates the flower in autumn-tide to scatter its seed,\nand which obliges each one of us unconsciously to draw closer together. And\nthis one unerring, inspiring voice rings out louder than the noisy, hasty\ndevelopment of culture.\n\n"Who is the greater man, and who the greater barbarian,--that lord, who,\nseeing the minstrel\'s well-worn clothes, angrily left the table, who gave\nhim not the millionth part of his possessions in payment of his labor, and\nnow lazily sitting in his brilliant, comfortable room, calmly opines about\nthe events that are happening in China, and justifies the massacres that\nhave been done there; or the little minstrel, who, risking imprisonment,\nwith a franc in his pocket, and doing no harm to any one, has been going\nabout for a score of years, up hill and down dale, rejoicing men\'s hearts\nwith his songs, though they have jeered at him, and almost cast him out of\nthe pale of humanity; and who, in weariness and cold and shame, has gone\noff to sleep, no one knows where, on his filthy straw?"\n\nAt this moment, from the city, through the dead silence of the night, far,\nfar away, I caught the sound of the little man\'s guitar and his voice.\n\n"No," something involuntarily said to me, "you have no right to commiserate\nthe little man, or to blame the lord for his well-being. Who can weigh the\ninner happiness which is found in the soul of each of these men? There he\nstands somewhere in the muddy road, and gazes at the brilliant moonlit sky,\nand gayly sings amid the smiling, fragrant night; in his soul there is no\nreproach, no anger, no regret. And who knows what is transpiring now in the\nhearts of all these men within those opulent, brilliant rooms? Who knows if\nthey all have as much unencumbered, sweet delight in life, and as much\nsatisfaction with the world, as dwells in the soul of that little man?\n\n"Endless are the mercy and wisdom of Him who has permitted and formed all\nthese contradictions. Only to thee, miserable little worm of the dust,\naudaciously, lawlessly attempting to fathom His laws, His designs,--only to\nthee do they seem like contradictions.\n\n"Full of love He looks down from His bright, immeasurable height, and\nrejoices in the endless harmony in which you all move in endless\ncontradictions. In thy pride thou hast thought thyself able to separate\nthyself from the laws of the universe. No, thou also, with thy petty,\nridiculous anger against the waiters,--thou also hast disturbed the\nharmonious craving for the eternal and the infinite."....\n\n\n\n\nRECOLLECTIONS OF A SCORER.\n\n_A STORY._\n\n\nWell, it happened about three o\'clock. The gentlemen were playing. There\nwas the big stranger, as our men called him. The prince was there,--the two\nare always together. The whiskered barin was there; also the little hussar,\nOliver, who was an actor, and there was the _pan_.[50] It was a pretty good\ncrowd.\n\n[Footnote 50: Polish name for lord or gentleman.]\n\nThe big stranger and the prince were playing together. Now, here I was\nwalking up and down around the billiard-table with my stick, keeping\ntally,--ten and forty-seven, twelve and forty-seven.\n\nEverybody knows it\'s our business to score. You don\'t get a chance to get a\nbite of any thing, and you don\'t get to bed till two o\'clock o\' nights, but\nyou\'re always being screamed at to bring the balls.\n\nI was keeping tally; and I look, and see a new barin comes in at the door.\nHe gazed and gazed, and then sat down on the sofa. Very well!\n\n"Now, who can that be?" thinks I to myself. "He must be somebody."\n\nHis dress was neat,--neat as a pin,--checkered tricot pants, stylish little\nshort coat, plush vest, and gold chain and all sorts of trinkets dangling\nfrom it.\n\nHe was dressed neat; but there was something about the man neater still;\nslim, tall, his hair brushed forward in style, and his face fair and\nruddy,--well, in a word, a fine young fellow.\n\nYou must know our business brings us into contact with all sorts of people.\nAnd there\'s many that ain\'t of much consequence, and there\'s a good deal of\npoor trash. So, though you\'re only a scorer, you get used to telling folks;\nthat is, in a certain way you learn a thing or two.\n\nI looked at the barin. I see him sit down, modest and quiet, not knowing\nanybody; and the clothes on him are so bran-new, that thinks I, "Either\nhe\'s a foreigner,--an Englishman maybe,--or some count just come. And\nthough he\'s so young, he has an air of some distinction." Oliver sat down\nnext him, so he moved along a little.\n\nThey began a game. The big man lost. He shouts to me. Says he, "You\'re\nalways cheating. You don\'t count straight. Why don\'t you pay attention?"\n\nHe scolded away, then threw down his cue, and went out. Now, just look\nhere! Evenings, he and the prince plays for fifty silver rubles a game; and\nhere he only lost a bottle of Makon wine, and got mad. That\'s the kind of a\ncharacter he is.\n\nAnother time he and the prince plays till two o\'clock. They don\'t bank down\nany cash; and so I know neither of them\'s got any cash, but they are simply\nplaying a bluff game.\n\n"I\'ll go you twenty-five rubles," says he.\n\n"All right."\n\nJust yawning, and not even stopping to place the ball,--you see, he was not\nmade of stone,--now just notice what he said. "We are playing for money,"\nsays he, "and not for chips."\n\nBut this man puzzled me worse than all the rest. Well, then, when the big\nman left, the prince says to the new barin, "Wouldn\'t you like," says he,\n"to play a game with me?"\n\n"With pleasure," says he.\n\nHe sat there, and looked rather foolish, indeed he did. He may have been\ncourageous in reality; but, at all events, he got up, went over to the\nbilliard-table, and did not seem flustered as yet. He was not exactly\nflustered, but you couldn\'t help seeing that he was not quite at his ease.\n\nEither his clothes were a little too new, or he was embarrassed because\neverybody was looking at him; at any rate, he seemed to have no energy. He\nsort of sidled up to the table, caught his pocket on the edge, began to\nchalk his cue, dropped his chalk.\n\nWhenever he hit the ball, he always glanced around, and reddened. Not so\nthe prince. He was used to it; he chalked and chalked his hand, tucked up\nhis sleeve; he goes and sits down when he pockets the ball, even though he\nis such a little man.\n\nThey played two or three games; then I notice the prince puts up the cue,\nand says, "Would you mind telling me your name?"\n\n"Nekhliudof," says he.\n\nSays the prince, "Was your father commander in the corps of cadets?"\n\n"Yes," says the other.\n\nThen they began to talk in French, and I could not understand them. I\nsuppose they were talking about family affairs.\n\n"_Au revoir_," says the prince. "I am very glad to have made your\nacquaintance." He washed his hands, and went to get a lunch; but the other\nstood by the billiard-table with his cue, and was knocking the balls about.\n\nIt\'s our business, you know, when a new man comes along, to be rather\nsharp: it\'s the best way. I took the balls, and go to put them up. He\nreddened, and says, "Can\'t I play any longer?"\n\n"Certainly you can," says I. "That\'s what billiards is for." But I don\'t\npay any attention to him. I straighten the cues.\n\n"Will you play with me?"\n\n"Certainly, sir," says I.\n\nI place the balls.\n\n"Shall we play for odds?"\n\n"What do you mean,--\'play for odds\'?"\n\n"Well," says I, "you give me a half-ruble, and I crawl under the table."\n\nOf course, as he had never seen that sort of thing, it seemed strange to\nhim: he laughs.\n\n"Go ahead," says he.\n\n"Very well," says I, "only you must give me odds."\n\n"What!" says he, "are you a worse player than I am?"\n\n"Most likely," says I. "We have few players who can be compared with you."\n\nWe began to play. He certainly had the idea that he was a crack shot. It\nwas a caution to see him shoot; but the Pole sat there, and kept shouting\nout every time,--\n\n"Ah, what a chance! ah, what a shot!"\n\nBut what a man he was! His ideas were good enough, but he didn\'t know how\nto carry them out. Well, as usual I lost the first game, crawled under the\ntable, and grunted.\n\nThereupon Oliver and the Pole jumped down from their seats, and applauded,\nthumping with their cues.\n\n"Splendid! Do it again," they cried, "once more."\n\nWell enough to cry "once more," especially for the Pole. That fellow would\nhave been glad enough to crawl under the billiard-table, or even under the\nBlue bridge, for a half-ruble! Yet he was the first to cry, "Splendid! but\nyou haven\'t wiped off all the dust yet."\n\nI, Petrushka the marker, was pretty well known to everybody.\n\nOnly, of course, I did not care to show my hand yet. I lost my second game.\n\n"It does not become me at all to play with you, sir," says I.\n\nHe laughs. Then, as I was playing the third game, he stood forty-nine and I\nnothing. I laid the cue on the billiard-table, and said, "Barin, shall we\nplay off?"\n\n"What do you mean by playing off?" says he. "How would you have it?"\n\n"You make it three rubles or nothing," says I.\n\n"Why," says he, "have I been playing with you for money?" The fool!\n\nHe turned rather red.\n\nVery good. He lost the game. He took out his pocket-book,--quite a new one,\nevidently just from the English shop,--opened it: I see he wanted to make a\nlittle splurge. It is stuffed full of bills,--nothing but hundred-ruble\nnotes.\n\n"No," says he, "there\'s no small stuff here."\n\nHe took three rubles from his purse. "There," says he, "there\'s your two\nrubles; the other pays for the games, and you keep the rest for vodka."\n\n"Thank you, sir, most kindly." I see that he is a splendid fellow. For such\na one I would crawl under any thing. For one thing, it\'s a pity that he\nwon\'t play for money. For then, thinks I, I should know how to work him for\ntwenty rubles, and maybe I could stretch it out to forty.\n\nAs soon as the Pole saw the young man\'s money, he says, "Wouldn\'t you like\nto try a little game with me? You play so admirably." Such sharpers prowl\naround.\n\n"No," says the young man, "excuse me: I have not the time." And he went\nout.\n\nI don\'t know who that man was, that Pole. Some one called him _Pan_ or the\nPole, and so it stuck to him. Every day he used to sit in the\nbilliard-room, and always look on. He was no longer allowed to take a hand\nin any game whatever; but he always sat by himself, and got out his pipe,\nand smoked. But then he could play well.\n\nVery good. Nekhliudof came a second time, a third time; he began to come\nfrequently. He would come morning and evening. He learned to play French\ncarom and pyramid pool,--every thing in fact. He became less bashful, got\nacquainted with everybody, and played tolerably well. Of course, being a\nyoung man of a good family, with money, everybody liked him. The only\nexception was the "big guest:" he quarrelled with him.\n\nAnd the whole thing grew out of a trifle.\n\nThey were playing pool,--the prince, the big guest, Nekhliudof, Oliver, and\nsome one else. Nekhliudof was standing near the stove talking with some\none. When it came the big man\'s turn to play, it happened that his ball\nwas just opposite the stove. There was very little space there, and he\nliked to have elbow-room.\n\nNow, either he didn\'t see Nekhliudof, or he did it on purpose; but, as he\nwas flourishing his cue, he hit Nekhliudof in the chest, a tremendous rap.\nIt actually made him groan. What then? He did not think of apologizing, he\nwas so boorish. He even went further: he didn\'t look at him; he walks off\ngrumbling,--\n\n"Who\'s jostling me there? It made me miss my shot. Why can\'t we have some\nroom?"\n\nThen the other went up to him, pale as a sheet, but quite self-possessed,\nand says so politely,--\n\n"You ought first, sir, to apologize: you struck me," says he.\n\n"Catch me apologizing now! I should have won the game," says he, "but now\nyou have spoiled it for me."\n\nThen the other one says, "You ought to apologize."\n\n"Get out of my way! I insist upon it, I won\'t."\n\nAnd he turned away to look after his ball.\n\nNekhliudof went up to him, and took him by the arm.\n\n"You\'re a boor," says he, "my dear sir."\n\nThough he was a slender young fellow, almost like a girl, still he was all\nready for a quarrel. His eyes flash fire; he looks as if he could eat him\nalive. The big guest was a strong, tremendous fellow, no match for\nNekhliudof.\n\n"Wha-at!" says he, "you call me a boor?" Yelling out these words, he raises\nhis hand to strike him.\n\nThen everybody there rushed up, and seized them both by the arms, and\nseparated them.\n\nAfter much talk, Nekhliudof says, "Let him give me satisfaction: he has\ninsulted me."\n\n"Not at all," said the other. "I don\'t care a whit about any satisfaction.\nHe\'s nothing but a boy, a mere nothing. I\'ll pull his ears for him."\n\n"If you aren\'t willing to give me satisfaction, then you are no gentleman."\n\nAnd, saying this, he almost cried.\n\n"Well, and you, you are a little boy: nothing you say or do can offend me."\n\nWell, we separated them,--led them off, as the custom is, to different\nrooms. Nekhliudof and the prince were friends.\n\n"Go," says the former; "for God\'s sake make him listen to reason."\n\nThe prince went. The big man says, "I ain\'t afraid of any one," says he. "I\nam not going to have any explanation with such a baby. I won\'t do it, and\nthat\'s the end of it."\n\nWell, they talked and talked, and then the matter died out, only the big\nguest ceased to come to us any more.\n\nAs a result of this,--this row, I might call it,--he was regarded as quite\nthe cock of the walk. He was quick to take offence,--I mean Nekhliudof,--as\nto so many other things, however, he was as unsophisticated as a new-born\nbabe.\n\nI remember once, the prince says to Nekhliudof, "Whom do you keep here?"\n\n"No one," says he.\n\n"What do you mean,--\'no one\'!"\n\n"Why should I?" says Nekhliudof.\n\n"How so,--why should you?"\n\n"I have always lived thus. Why shouldn\'t I continue to live the same way?"\n\n"You don\'t say so? Did you ever!"\n\nAnd saying this, the prince burst into a peal of laughter, and the\nwhiskered barin also roared. They couldn\'t get over it.\n\n"What, never?" they asked.\n\n"Never!"\n\nThey were dying with laughter. Of course I understood well enough what they\nwere laughing at him for. I keep my eyes open. "What," thinks I, "will come\nof it?"\n\n"Come," says the prince, "come right off."\n\n"No; not for any thing," was his answer.\n\n"Now, that is absurd," says the prince. "Come along!"\n\nThey went out.\n\nThey came back at one o\'clock. They sat down to supper; quite a crowd of\nthem were assembled. Some of our very best customers,--Atanof, Prince\nRazin, Count Shustakh, Mirtsof. And all congratulate Nekhliudof, laughing\nas they do so. They call me in: I see that they are pretty jolly.\n\n"Congratulate the barin," they shout.\n\n"What on?" I ask.\n\nHow did he call it? His initiation or his enlightenment; I can\'t remember\nexactly.\n\n"I have the honor," says I, "to congratulate you."\n\nAnd he sits there very red in the face, yet he smiles. Didn\'t they have fun\nwith him though!\n\nWell and good. They went afterwards to the billiard-room, all very gay; and\nNekhliudof went up to the billiard-table, leaned on his elbow, and said,--\n\n"It\'s amusing to you, gentlemen," says he, "but it\'s sad for me. Why," says\nhe, "did I do it? Prince," says he, "I shall never forgive you or myself\nas long as I live."\n\nAnd he actually burst into tears. Evidently he did not know himself what he\nwas saying. The prince went up to him with a smile.\n\n"Don\'t talk nonsense," says he. "Let\'s go home, Anatoli."\n\n"I won\'t go anywhere," says the other. "Why did I do that?"\n\nAnd the tears poured down his cheeks. He would not leave the\nbilliard-table, and that was the end of it. That\'s what it means for a\nyoung and inexperienced man to....\n\nIn this way he used often to come to us. Once he came with the prince, and\nthe whiskered man who was the prince\'s crony; the gentlemen always called\nhim "Fedotka." He had prominent cheek-bones, and was homely enough, to be\nsure; but he used to dress neatly and ride in a carriage. What was the\nreason that the gentlemen were so fond of him? I really could not tell.\n\n"Fedotka! Fedotka!" they\'d call, and ask him to eat and to drink, and\nthey\'d spend their money paying up for him; but he was a thorough-going\nbeat. If ever he lost, he would be sure not to pay; but if he won, you bet\nhe wouldn\'t fail to collect his money. Often too he came to grief: yet\nthere he was, walking arm in arm with the prince.\n\n"You are lost without me," he would say to the prince. "I am, Fedot,"[51]\nsays he; "but not a Fedot of that sort."\n\n[Footnote 51: _Fedot, da nye tot_, an untranslatable play on the word.]\n\nAnd what jokes he used to crack, to be sure! Well, as I said, they had\nalready arrived that time, and one of them says, "Let\'s have the balls for\nthree-handed pool."\n\n"All right," says the other.\n\nThey began to play at three rubles a stake. Nekhliudof and the prince play,\nand chat about all sorts of things meantime.\n\n"Ah!" says one of them, "you mind only what a neat little foot she has."\n\n"Oh," says the other, "her foot is nothing; her beauty is her wealth of\nhair."\n\nOf course they paid no attention to the game, only kept on talking to one\nanother.\n\nAs to Fedotka, that fellow was alive to his work; he played his very best,\nbut they didn\'t do themselves justice at all.\n\nAnd so he won six rubles from each of them. God knows how many games he had\nwon from the prince, yet I never knew them to pay each other any money; but\nNekhliudof took out two greenbacks, and handed them over to him.\n\n"No," says he, "I don\'t want to take your money. Let\'s square it: play\n\'quits or double,\'[52]--either double or nothing."\n\n[Footnote 52: _Kitudubl_ = Fr. _quitte ou double_.]\n\nI set the balls. Fedotka began to play the first hand. Nekhliudof seemed to\nplay only for fun: sometimes he would come very near winning a game, yet\njust fail of it. Says he, "It would be too easy a move, I won\'t have it\nso." But Fedotka did not forget what he was up to. Carelessly he proceeded\nwith the game, and thus, as if it were unexpectedly, won.\n\n"Let us play double stakes once more," says he.\n\n"All right," says Nekhliudof.\n\nOnce more Fedotka won the game.\n\n"Well," says he, "it began with a mere trifle. I don\'t wish to win much\nfrom you. Shall we make it once more or nothing?"\n\n"Yes."\n\nSay what you may, but fifty rubles is a pretty sum, and Nekhliudof himself\nbegan to propose, "Let us make it double or quit." So they played and\nplayed.\n\nIt kept going worse and worse for Nekhliudof. Two hundred and eighty rubles\nwere written up against him. As to Fedotka, he had his own method: he would\nlose a simple game, but when the stake was doubled, he would win sure.\n\nAs for the prince, he sits by and looks on. He sees that the matter is\ngrowing serious.\n\n"Enough!"[53] says he, "hold on."\n\n[Footnote 53: _ase_ = _assez_.]\n\nMy! they keep increasing the stake.\n\nAt last it went so far that Nekhliudof was in for more than five hundred\nrubles. Fedotka laid down his cue, and said,--\n\n"Aren\'t you satisfied for to-day? I\'m tired," says he.\n\nYet I knew he was ready to play till dawn of day, provided there was money\nto be won. Stratagem, of course. And the other was all the more anxious to\ngo on. "Come on! Come on!"\n\n"No,--\'pon my honor, I\'m tired. Come," says Fedot; "let\'s go up-stairs;\nthere you shall have your revanche."\n\nUp-stairs with us meant the place where the gentlemen used to play cards.\nFrom that very day, Fedotka wound his net round him so that he began to\ncome every day. He would play one or two games of billiards, and then\nproceed up-stairs,--every day up-stairs.\n\nWhat they used to do there, God only knows; but it is a fact that from that\ntime he began to be an entirely different kind of man, and seemed hand in\nglove with Fedotka. Formerly he used to be stylish, neat in his dress, with\nhis hair slightly curled even; but now it would be only in the morning that\nhe would be any thing like himself; but as soon as he had paid his visit\nup-stairs, he would not be at all like himself.\n\nOnce he came down from up-stairs with the prince, pale, his lips trembling,\nand talking excitedly.\n\n"I cannot permit such a one as _he_ is," says he, "to say that I am\nnot"--How did he express himself? I cannot recollect, something like "not\nrefined enough," or what,--"and that he won\'t play with me any more. I tell\nyou I have paid him ten thousand, and I should think that he might be a\nlittle more considerate, before others, at least."\n\n"Oh, bother!" says the prince, "is it worth while to lose one\'s temper with\nFedotka?"\n\n"No," says the other, "I will not let it go so."\n\n"Why, old fellow, how can you think of such a thing as lowering yourself to\nhave a row with Fedotka?"\n\n"That is all very well; but there were strangers there, mind you."\n\n"Well, what of that?" says the prince; "strangers? Well, if you wish, I\nwill go and make him ask your pardon."\n\n"No," says the other.\n\nAnd then they began to chatter in French, and I could not understand what\nit was they were talking about.\n\nAnd what would you think of it? That very evening he and Fedotka ate supper\ntogether, and they became friends again.\n\nWell and good. At other times again he would come alone.\n\n"Well," he would say, "do I play well?"\n\nIt\'s our business, you know, to try to make everybody contented, and so I\nwould say, "Yes, indeed;" and yet how could it be called good play, when he\nwould poke about with his cue without any sense whatever?\n\nAnd from that very evening when he took in with Fedotka, he began to play\nfor money all the time. Formerly he didn\'t care to play for stakes, either\nfor a dinner or for champagne. Sometimes the prince would say,--\n\n"Let\'s play for a bottle of champagne."\n\n"No," he would say. "Let us rather have the wine by itself. Hollo there!\nbring a bottle!"\n\nAnd now he began to play for money all the time; he used to spend his\nentire days in our establishment. He would either play with some one in the\nbilliard-room, or he would go "up-stairs."\n\nWell, thinks I to myself, every one else gets something from him, why don\'t\nI get some advantage out of it?\n\n"Well, sir," says I one day, "it\'s a long time since you have had a game\nwith me."\n\nAnd so we began to play. Well, when I won ten half-rubles of him, I says,--\n\n"Don\'t you want to make it double or quit, sir?"\n\nHe said nothing. Formerly, if you remember, he would call me a fool for\nsuch a boldness. And we went to playing "quit or double."\n\nI won eighty rubles of him.\n\nWell, what would you think? Since that first time he used to play with me\nevery day. He would wait till there was no one about, for of course he\nwould have been ashamed to play with a mere marker in presence of others.\nOnce he had got rather warmed up by the play (he already owed me sixty\nrubles), and so he says,--\n\n"Do you want to stake all you have won?"\n\n"All right," says I.\n\nI won. "One hundred and twenty to one hundred and twenty?"\n\n"All right," says I.\n\nAgain I won. "Two hundred and forty against two hundred and forty?"\n\n"Isn\'t that too much?" I ask.\n\nHe made no reply. We played the game. Once more it was mine. "Four hundred\nand eighty against four hundred and eighty?"\n\nI says, "Well, sir, I don\'t want to wrong you. Let us make it a hundred\nrubles that you owe me, and call it square."\n\nYou ought to have heard how he yelled at this, and yet he was not a proud\nman at all. "Either play, or don\'t play!" says he.\n\nWell, I see there\'s nothing to be done. "Three hundred and eighty, then, if\nyou please," says I.\n\nI really wanted to lose. I allowed him forty points in advance. He stood\nfifty-two to my thirty-six. He began to cut the yellow one, and missed\neighteen points; and I was standing just at the turning-point. I made a\nstroke so as to knock the ball off of the billiard-table. No--so luck would\nhave it. Do what I might, he even missed the doublet. I had won again.\n\n"Listen," says he. "Peter,"--he did not call me _Petrushka_ then,--"I can\'t\npay you the whole right away. In a couple of months I could pay three\nthousand even, if it were necessary."\n\nAnd there he stood just as red, and his voice kind of trembled.\n\n"Very good, sir," says I.\n\nWith this he laid down the cue. Then he began to walk up and down, up and\ndown, the perspiration running down his face.\n\n"Peter," says he, "let\'s try it again, double or quit."\n\nAnd he almost burst into tears.\n\n"What, sir, what! would you play against such luck?"\n\n"Oh, let us play, I beg of you." And he brings the cue, and puts it in my\nhand.\n\nI took the cue, and I threw the balls on the table so that they bounced\nover on to the floor; I could not help showing off a little, naturally. I\nsay, "All right, sir."\n\nBut he was in such a hurry that he went and picked up the balls himself,\nand I thinks to myself, "Anyway, I\'ll never be able to get the seven\nhundred rubles from him, so I can lose them to him all the same." I began\nto play carelessly on purpose. But no--he won\'t have it so. "Why," says he,\n"you are playing badly on purpose."\n\nBut his hands trembled, and when the ball went towards a pocket, his\nfingers would spread out and his mouth would screw up to one side, as if he\ncould by any means force the ball into the pocket. Even I couldn\'t stand\nit, and I say, "That won\'t do any good, sir."\n\nVery well. As he won this game I says, "This will make it one hundred and\neighty rubles you owe me, and fifty games; and now I must go and get my\nsupper." So I laid down my cue, and went off.\n\nI went and sat down all by myself, at a small table opposite the door; and\nI look in and see, and wonder what he will do. Well, what would you think?\nHe began to walk up and down, up and down, probably thinking that no one\'s\nlooking at him; and then he would give a pull at his hair, and then walk up\nand down again, and keep muttering to himself; and then he would pull his\nhair again.\n\nAfter that he wasn\'t seen for a week. Once he came into the dining-room as\ngloomy as could be, but he didn\'t enter the billiard-room. The prince\ncaught sight of him.\n\n"Come," says he, "let\'s have a game."\n\n"No," says the other, "I am not going to play any more."\n\n"Nonsense! come along."\n\n"No," says he, "I won\'t come, I tell you. For you it\'s all one whether I go\nor not, yet for me it\'s no good to come here."\n\nAnd so he did not come for ten days more. And then, it being the holidays,\nhe came dressed up in a dress suit: he\'d evidently been into company. And\nhe was here all day long; he kept playing, and he came the next day, and\nthe third....\n\nAnd it began to go in the old style, and I thought it would be fine to have\nanother trial with him.\n\n"No," says he, "I\'m not going to play with you; and as to the one hundred\nand eighty rubles that I owe you, if you\'ll come at the end of a month, you\nshall have it."\n\nVery good. So I went to him at the end of a month.\n\n"By God," says he, "I can\'t give it to you; but come back on Thursday."\n\nWell, I went on Thursday. I found that he had a splendid suite of\napartments.\n\n"Well," says I, "is he at home?"\n\n"He hasn\'t got up yet," I was told.\n\n"Very good, I will wait."\n\nFor a body-servant he had one of his own serfs, such a gray-haired old man!\nThat servant was perfectly single-minded, he didn\'t know any thing about\nbeating about the bush. So we got into conversation.\n\n"Well," says he, "what is the use of our living here, master and I? He\'s\nsquandered all his property, and it\'s mighty little honor or good that we\nget out of this Petersburg of yours. As we started from the country, I\nthought it would be as it was with the last barin (may his soul rest in\npeace!), we would go about with princes and counts and generals; he thought\nto himself, \'I\'ll find a countess for a sweetheart, and she\'ll have a big\ndowry, and we\'ll live on a big scale.\' But it\'s quite a different thing\nfrom what he expected; here we are, running about from one tavern to\nanother as bad off as we could be! The Princess Rtishcheva, you know, is\nhis own aunt, and Prince Borotintsef is his godfather. What do you think?\nHe went to see them only once, that was at Christmas-time; he never shows\nhis nose there. Yes, and even their people laugh about it to me. \'Why,\'\nsays they, \'your barin is not a bit like his father!\' And once I take it\nupon myself to say to him,--\n\n"\'Why wouldn\'t you go, sir, and visit your aunt? They are feeling bad\nbecause you haven\'t been for so long.\'\n\n"\'It\'s stupid there, Demyanitch,\' says he. Just to think, he found his only\namusement here in the saloon! If he only would enter the service! yet, no:\nhe has got entangled with cards and all the rest of it. When men get going\nthat way, there\'s no good in any thing; nothing comes to any good....\n_E-ekh!_ we are going to the dogs, and no mistake.... The late mistress\n(may her soul rest in peace!) left us a rich inheritance: no less than a\nthousand souls, and about three hundred thousand rubles worth of\ntimber-lands. He has mortgaged it all, sold the timber, let the estate go\nto rack and ruin, and still no money on hand. When the master is away, of\ncourse, the overseer is more than the master. What does he care? He only\ncares to stuff his own pockets.\n\n"A few days ago, a couple of peasants brought complaints from the whole\nestate. \'He has wasted the last of the property,\' they say. What do you\nthink? he pondered over the complaints, and gave the peasants ten rubles\napiece. Says he, \'I\'ll be there very soon. I shall have some money, and I\nwill settle all accounts when I come,\' says he.\n\n"But how can he settle accounts when we are getting into debt all the time?\nMoney or no money, yet the winter here has cost eighty thousand rubles, and\nnow there isn\'t a silver ruble in the house. And all owing to his\nkind-heartedness. You see, he\'s such a simple barin that it would be hard\nto find his equal: that\'s the very reason that he\'s going to ruin,--going\nto ruin, all for nothing." And the old man almost wept.\n\nNekhliudof woke up about eleven, and called me in.\n\n"They haven\'t sent me any money yet," says he. "But it isn\'t my fault. Shut\nthe door," says he.\n\nI shut the door.\n\n"Here," says he, "take my watch or this diamond pin, and pawn it. They\nwill give you more than one hundred and eighty rubles for it, and when I\nget my money I will redeem it," says he.\n\n"No matter, sir," says I. "If you don\'t happen to have any money, it\'s no\nconsequence; let me have the watch if you don\'t mind. I can wait for your\nconvenience."\n\nI can see that the watch is worth more than three hundred.\n\nVery good. I pawned the watch for a hundred rubles, and carried him the\nticket. "You will owe me eighty rubles," says I, "and you had better redeem\nthe watch."\n\nAnd so it happened that he still owed me eighty rubles.\n\nAfter that he began to come to us again every day. I don\'t know how matters\nstood between him and the prince, but at all events he kept coming with him\nall the time, or else they would go and play cards up-stairs with Fedotka.\nAnd what queer accounts those three men kept between them! this one would\nlend money to the other, the other to the third, yet who it was that owed\nthe money you never could find out.\n\nAnd in this way he kept on coming our way for well-nigh two years; only it\nwas to be plainly seen that he was a changed man, such a devil-may-care\nmanner he assumed at times. He even went so far at times as to borrow a\nruble of me to pay a hack-driver; and yet he would still play with the\nprince for a hundred rubles stake.\n\nHe grew gloomy, thin, sallow. As soon as he came he used to order a little\nglass of absinthe, take a bite of something, and drink some port wine, and\nthen he would grow more lively.\n\nHe came one time before dinner; it happened to be carnival time, and he\nbegan to play with a hussar.\n\nSays he, "Do you want to play for a stake?"\n\n"Very well," says he. "What shall it be?"\n\n"A bottle of Claude Vougeaux? What do you say?"\n\n"All right."\n\nVery good. The hussar won, and they went off for their dinner. They sat\ndown at table, and then Nekhliudof says, "Simon, a bottle of Claude\nVougeaux, and see that you warm it to the proper point."\n\nSimon went out, brought in the dinner, but no wine.\n\n"Well," says he, "where\'s the wine?"\n\nSimon hurried out, brought in the roast.\n\n"Let us have the wine," says he.\n\nSimon makes no reply.\n\n"What\'s got into you? Here we\'ve almost finished dinner, and no wine. Who\nwants to drink with dessert?"\n\nSimon hurried out. "The landlord," says he, "wants to speak to you."\n\nNekhliudof turned scarlet. He sprang up from the table.\n\n"What\'s the need of calling me?"\n\nThe landlord is standing at the door.\n\nSays he, "I can\'t trust you any more, unless you settle my little bill."\n\n"Well, didn\'t I tell you that I would pay the first of the month?"\n\n"That will be all very well," says the landlord, "but I can\'t be all the\ntime giving credit, and having no settlement. There are more than ten\nthousand rubles of debts outstanding now," says he.\n\n"Well, that\'ll do, _monshoor_, you know that you can trust me! Send the\nbottle, and I assure you that I will pay you very soon."\n\nAnd he hurried back.\n\n"What was it? Why did they call you out?" asked the hussar.\n\n"Oh, some one wanted to ask me a question."\n\n"Now it would be a good time," says the hussar, "to have a little warm wine\nto drink."\n\n"Simon, hurry up!"\n\nSimon came back, but still no wine, nothing. Too bad! He left the table,\nand came to me.\n\n"For God\'s sake," says he, "Petrushka, let me have six rubles!"\n\nHe was pale as a sheet. "No, sir," says I: "by God, you owe me quite too\nmuch now."\n\n"I will give forty rubles for six, in a week\'s time."\n\n"If only I had it," says I, "I should not think of refusing you, but I\nhaven\'t."\n\nWhat do you think! He rushed away, his teeth set, his fist doubled up, and\nran down the corridor like one mad, and all at once he gave himself a knock\non the forehead.\n\n"O my God!" says he, "what has it come to?"\n\nBut he did not return to the dining-room; he jumped into a carriage, and\ndrove away. Didn\'t we have our laugh over it! The hussar asks,--\n\n"Where is the gentleman who was dining with me?"\n\n"He has gone," said some one.\n\n"Where has he gone? What message did he leave?"\n\n"He didn\'t leave any; he just took to his carriage, and went off."\n\n"That\'s a fine way of entertaining a man!" says he.\n\nNow, thinks I to myself, it\'ll be a long time before he comes again after\nthis; that is, on account of this scandal. But no. On the next day he came\nabout evening. He came into the billiard-room. He had a sort of a box in\nhis hand. Took off his overcoat.\n\n"Now let us have a game," says he.\n\nHe looked out from under his eyebrows, rather fierce like.\n\nWe played a game. "That\'s enough now," says he: "go and bring me a pen and\npaper; I must write a letter."\n\nNot thinking any thing, not suspecting any thing, I bring some paper, and\nput it on the table in the little room.\n\n"It\'s all ready, sir," says I.\n\n"Very good." He sat down at the table. He kept on writing and writing, and\nmuttering to himself all the time: then he jumps up, and, frowning, says,\n"Look and see if my carriage has come yet."\n\nIt was on a Friday, during carnival time, and so there weren\'t any of the\ncustomers on hand; they were all at some ball. I went to see about the\ncarriage, and just as I was going out of the door, "Petrushka! Petrushka!"\nhe shouted, as if something suddenly frightened him.\n\nI turn round. I see he\'s pale as a sheet, standing here and looking at me.\n\n"Did you call me, sir?" says I.\n\nHe makes no reply.\n\n"What do you want?" says I.\n\nHe says nothing. "Oh, yes!" says he. "Let\'s have another game."\n\nThen says he, "Haven\'t I learned to play pretty well?"\n\nHe had just won the game. "Yes," says I.\n\n"All right," says he; "go now, and see about my carriage." He himself\nwalked up and down the room.\n\nWithout thinking any thing, I went down to the door. I didn\'t see any\ncarriage at all. I started to go up again.\n\nJust as I am going up, I hear what sounds like the thud of a billiard-cue.\nI go into the billiard-room. I notice a peculiar smell.\n\nI look around; and there he is lying on the floor in a pool of blood, with\na pistol beside him. I was so scared that I could not speak a word.\n\nHe keeps twitching, twitching his leg; and stretched himself a little. Then\nhe sort of snored, and stretched out his full length in such a strange way.\nAnd God knows why such a sin came about,--how it was that it occurred to\nhim to ruin his own soul,--but as to what he left written on this paper, I\ndon\'t understand it at all. Truly, you can never account for what is going\non in the world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n"God gave me all that a man can desire,--wealth, name, intellect, noble\naspirations. I wanted to enjoy myself, and I trod in the mire all that was\nbest in me. I have done nothing dishonorable, I am not unfortunate, I have\nnot committed any crime; but I have done worse: I have destroyed my\nfeelings, my intellect, my youth. I became entangled in a filthy net, from\nwhich I could not escape, and to which I could not accustom myself. I feel\nthat I am falling lower and lower every moment, and I cannot stop my fall.\n\n"And what ruined me? Was there in me some strange passion which I might\nplead as an excuse? No!\n\n"My recollections are pleasant. One fearful moment of forgetfulness, which\ncan never be erased from my mind, led me to come to my senses. I shuddered\nwhen I saw what a measureless abyss separated me from what I desired to be,\nand might have been. In my imagination arose the hopes, the dreams, and the\nthoughts of my youth.\n\n"Where are those lofty thoughts of life, of eternity, of God, which at\ntimes filled my soul with light and strength? Where that aimless power of\nlove which kindled my heart with its comforting warmth?...\n\n"But how good and happy I might have been, had I trodden that path which,\nat the very entrance of life, was pointed out to me by my fresh mind and\ntrue feelings! More than once did I try to go from the ruts in which my\nlife ran, into that sacred path.\n\n"I said to myself, Now I will use my whole strength of will; and yet I\ncould not do it. When I happened to be alone, I felt awkward and timid.\nWhen I was with others, I no longer heard the inward voice; and I fell all\nthe time lower and lower.\n\n"At last I came to a terrible conviction that it was impossible for me to\nlift myself from this low plane. I ceased to think about it, and I wished\nto forget all; but hopeless repentance worried me still more and more.\nThen, for the first time, the thought of suicide occurred to me....\n\n"I once thought that the nearness of death would rouse my soul. I was\nmistaken. In a quarter of an hour I shall be no more, yet my view has not\nin the least changed. I see with the same eyes, I hear with the same ears,\nI think the same thoughts; there is the same strange incoherence,\nunsteadiness, and lightness in my thoughts."....\n\n\n\n\nALBERT.\n\n_A STORY._\n\n1857.\n\n\nI.\n\nFive rich young men went at three o\'clock in the morning to a ball in\nPetersburg to have a good time.\n\nMuch champagne was drunk; a majority of the gentlemen were very young; the\ngirls were pretty; a pianist and a fiddler played indefatigably one polka\nafter another; there was no cease to the noise of conversation and dancing.\nBut there was a sense of awkwardness and constraint; every one felt somehow\nor other--and this is not unusual--that all was not as it should be.\n\nThere were several attempts made to make things more lively, but simulated\nliveliness is much worse than melancholy.\n\nOne of the five young men, who was more discontented than any one else,\nboth with himself and with the others, and who had been feeling all the\nevening a sense of disgust, took his hat, and went out noiselessly on\npurpose, intending to go home.\n\nThere was no one in the ante-room, but in the next room at the door he\nheard two voices disputing. The young man paused, and listened.\n\n"It is impossible, there are guests in there," said a woman\'s voice.\n\n"Come, let me in, please. I will not do any harm," urged a man in a gentle\nvoice.\n\n"Indeed I will not without madame\'s permission," said the woman. "Where are\nyou going? Oh, what a man you are!"\n\nThe door was flung open, and on the threshold appeared the figure of a\nstranger. Seeing a guest, the maid ceased to detain the man; and the\nstranger, timidly bowing, came into the room with a somewhat unsteady gait.\n\nHe was a man of medium stature, with a lank, crooked back, and long\ndishevelled hair. He wore a short paletot, and tight ragged pantaloons over\ncoarse dirty boots. His necktie, twisted into a string, exposed his long\nwhite neck. His shirt was filthy, and the sleeves came down over his lean\nhands.\n\nBut, notwithstanding his thoroughly emaciated body, his face was attractive\nand fair; and a fresh color even mantled his cheeks under his thin dark\nbeard and side-whiskers. His dishevelled locks, thrown back, exposed a low\nand remarkably pure forehead. His dark, languid eyes looked unswervingly\nforward with an expression of serenity, submission, and sweetness, which\nmade a fascinating combination with the expression of his fresh, curved\nlips, visible under his thin moustache.\n\nAdvancing a few steps, he paused, turned to the young man, and smiled. He\nfound it apparently rather hard to smile. But his face was so lighted up by\nit, that the young man, without knowing why, smiled in return.\n\n"Who is that man?" he asked of the maid in a whisper, as the stranger\nwalked toward the room where the dancing was going on.\n\n"A crazy musician from the theatre," replied the maid. "He sometimes comes\nto call upon madame."\n\n"Where are you going, Delesof?" some one at this moment called from the\ndrawing-room.\n\nThe young man who was called Delesof returned to the drawing-room. The\nmusician was now standing at the door; and, as his eyes fell on the\ndancers, he showed by his smile and by the beating of his foot how much\npleasure this spectacle afforded him.\n\n"Won\'t you come, and have a dance too?" said one of the guests to him. The\nmusician bowed, and looked at the hostess inquiringly.\n\n"Come, come. Why not, since the gentlemen have invited you?" said the\nhostess. The musician\'s thin, weak face suddenly assumed an expression of\ndecision; and smiling and winking, and shuffling his feet, he awkwardly,\nclumsily went to join the dancers in the drawing-room.\n\nIn the midst of a quadrille a jolly officer, who was dancing very\nbeautifully and with great liveliness, accidentally hit the musician in the\nback. His weak, weary legs lost their equilibrium; and the musician, making\nineffectual struggles to keep his balance, measured his length on the\nfloor.\n\nNotwithstanding the sharp, hard sound made by his fall, almost everybody at\nthe first moment laughed.\n\nBut the musician did not rise. The guests grew silent, even the piano\nceased to sound. Delesof and the hostess were the first to reach the\nprostrate musician. He was lying on his elbow, and gloomily looking at the\nground. When he had been lifted to his feet, and set in a chair, he threw\nback his hair from his forehead with a quick motion of his bony hand, and\nbegan to smile without replying to the questions that were put.\n\n"Mr. Albert! Mr. Albert!" exclaimed the hostess. "Were you hurt? Where?\nNow, I told you that you had better not try to dance.... He is so weak,"\nshe added, addressing her guests. "It takes all his strength."\n\n"Who is he?" some one asked the hostess.\n\n"A poor man, an artist. A very nice young fellow; but he\'s a sad case, as\nyou can see."\n\nShe said this without paying the least heed to the musician\'s presence. He\nsuddenly opened his eyes as though frightened at something, collected\nhimself, and remarked to those who were standing about him, "It\'s nothing\nat all," said he suddenly, arising from the chair with evident effort.\n\nAnd in order to show that he had suffered no injury, he went into the\nmiddle of the room, and was going to dance; but he tottered, and would have\nfallen again, had he not been supported.\n\nEverybody felt constrained. All looked at him, and no one spoke. The\nmusician\'s glance again lost its vivacity; and, apparently forgetting that\nany one was looking, he put his hand to his knee. Suddenly he raised his\nhead, advanced one faltering foot, and, with the same awkward gesture as\nbefore, tossed back his hair, and went to a violin-case, and took out the\ninstrument.\n\n"It was nothing at all," said he again, waving the violin. "Gentlemen, we\nwill have a little music."\n\n"What a strange face!" said the guests among themselves.\n\n"Maybe there is great talent lurking in that unhappy creature," said one of\nthem.\n\n"Yes: it\'s a sad case,--a sad case," said another.\n\n"What a lovely face!... There is something extraordinary about it," said\nDelesof. "Let us have a look at him."...\n\n\nII.\n\nAlbert by this time, not paying attention to any one, had raised his violin\nto his shoulder, and was slowly crossing over to the piano, and tuning his\ninstrument. His lips were drawn into an expression of indifference, his\neyes were almost shut; but his lank, bony back, his long white neck, his\ncrooked legs, and disorderly black hair presented a strange but somehow not\nentirely ridiculous appearance. After he had tuned his violin, he struck a\nquick chord, and, throwing back his head, turned to the pianist who was\nwaiting to accompany him. "_Melancholie, G sharp_," he said, turning to the\npianist with a peremptory gesture. And immediately after, as though in\napology for his peremptory gesture, he smiled sweetly, and with the same\nsmile turned to his audience again.\n\nTossing back his hair with the hand that held the bow, Albert stood at one\nside of the piano, and, with a flowing motion of the bow, touched the\nstrings. Through the room there swept a pure, harmonious sound, which\ninstantly brought absolute silence.\n\nAt first, it was as though a ray of unexpectedly brilliant light had\nflashed across the inner world of each hearer\'s consciousness; and the\nnotes of the theme immediately followed, pouring forth abundant and\nbeautiful.\n\nNot one discordant or imperfect note distracted the attention of the\nlisteners. All the tones were clear, beautiful, and full of meaning. All\nsilently, with trembling expectation, followed the development of the\ntheme. From a state of tedium, of noisy gayety, or of deep drowsiness, into\nwhich these people had fallen, they were suddenly transported to a world\nwhose existence they had forgotten.\n\nIn one instant there arose in their souls, now a sentiment as though they\nwere contemplating the past, now of passionate remembrance of some\nhappiness, now the boundless longing for power and glory, now the feelings\nof humility, of unsatisfied love, and of melancholy.\n\nNow bitter-sweet, now vehemently despairing, the notes, freely\nintermingling, poured forth and poured forth, so sweetly, so powerfully,\nand so spontaneously, that it was not so much that sounds were heard, as\nthat some sort of beautiful stream of poetry, long known, but now for the\nfirst time expressed, gushed through the soul.\n\nAt each note that he played, Albert grew taller and taller. At a little\ndistance, he had no appearance of being either crippled or peculiar.\nPressing the violin to his chin, and with an expression of listening with\npassionate attention to the tones that he produced, he convulsively moved\nhis feet. Now he straightened himself up to his full height, now\nthoughtfully leaned forward.\n\nHis left hand, curving over spasmodically on the strings, seemed as though\nit had swooned in its position, while it was only the bony fingers that\nchanged about spasmodically; the right hand moved smoothly, gracefully,\nwithout effort.\n\nHis face shone with complete, enthusiastic delight; his eyes gleamed with a\nradiant, steely light; his nostrils quivered, his red lips were parted in\nrapture.\n\nSometimes his head bent down closer to his violin, his eyes almost closed,\nand his face, half shaded by his long locks, lighted up with a smile of\ngenuine blissfulness. Sometimes he quickly straightened himself up, changed\nfrom one leg to the other, and his pure forehead, and the radiant look\nwhich he threw around the room, were alive with pride, greatness, and the\nconsciousness of power. Once the pianist made a mistake, and struck a false\nchord. Physical pain was apparent in the whole form and face of the\nmusician. He paused for a second, and with an expression of childish anger\nstamped his foot, and cried, "_Moll, ce moll!_" The pianist corrected his\nmistake; Albert closed his eyes, smiled, and, again forgetting himself and\neverybody else, gave himself up with beatitude to his work. Everybody who\nwas in the room while Albert was playing preserved an attentive silence,\nand seemed to live and breathe only in the music.\n\nThe gay officer sat motionless in a chair by the window, with his eyes\nfixed upon the floor, and drawing long heavy sighs. The girls, awed by the\nuniversal silence, sat along by the walls, only occasionally exchanging\nglances expressive of satisfaction or perplexity.\n\nThe fat smiling face of the hostess was radiant with happiness. The pianist\nkept his eyes fixed on Albert\'s face, and while his whole figure from head\nto foot showed his solicitude lest he should make some mistake, he did his\nbest to follow him. One of the guests, who had been drinking more heavily\nthan the rest, lay at full length on the sofa, and tried not to move lest\nhe should betray his emotion. Delesof experienced an unusual sensation. It\nseemed as though an icy band, now contracting, now expanding, were pressed\nupon his head. The roots of his hair seemed endued with consciousness; the\ncold shivers ran down his back, something rose higher and higher in his\nthroat, his nose and palate were full of little needles, and the tears\nstole down his cheeks.\n\nHe shook himself, tried to swallow them back and wipe them away without\nattracting attention, but fresh tears followed and streamed down his face.\nBy some sort of strange association of impressions, the first tones of\nAlbert\'s violin carried Delesof back to his early youth.\n\nOld before his time, weary of life, a broken man, he suddenly felt as\nthough he were a boy of seventeen again, self-satisfied and handsome,\nblissfully dull, unconsciously happy. He remembered his first love for his\ncousin who wore a pink dress, he remembered his first confession of it in\nthe linden alley; he remembered the warmth and the inexpressible charm of\nthe fortuitous kiss; he remembered the immensity and enigmatical mystery of\nNature as it surrounded them then.\n\nIn his imagination as it went back in its flight, _she_ gleamed in a mist\nof indefinite hopes, of incomprehensible desires, and the indubitable faith\nin the possibility of impossible happiness. All the priceless moments of\nthat time, one after the other, arose before him, not like unmeaning\ninstants of the fleeting present, but like the immutable, full-formed,\nreproachful images of the past.\n\nHe contemplated them with rapture, and wept,--wept not because the time had\npassed and he might have spent it more profitably (if that time had been\ngiven to him again he would not have spent it any more profitably), but he\nwept because it had passed and would never return. His recollections\nevolved themselves without effort, and Albert\'s violin was their\nmouthpiece. It said, "They have passed, forever passed, the days of thy\nstrength, of love, and of happiness; passed forever, and never will return.\nWeep for them, shed all thy tears, let thy life pass in tears for these\ndays; this is the only and best happiness that remains to thee."\n\nAt the end of the next variation, Albert\'s face grew serene, his eyes\nflushed, great clear drops of sweat poured down his cheeks. The veins\nswelled on his forehead; his whole body swayed more and more; his pale lips\nwere parted, and his whole figure expressed an enthusiastic craving for\nenjoyment. Despairingly swaying with his whole body, and throwing back his\nhair, he laid down his violin, and with a smile of proud satisfaction and\nhappiness gazed at the bystanders. Then his back assumed its ordinary\ncurve, his head sank, his lips grew set, his eyes lost their fire; and as\nthough he were ashamed of himself, timidly glancing round, and stumbling,\nhe went into the next room.\n\n\nIII.\n\nSomething strange came over all the audience, and something strange was\nnoticeable in the dead silence that succeeded Albert\'s playing. It was as\nthough each desired, and yet dared not, to acknowledge the meaning of it\nall.\n\nWhat did it mean,--this brightly lighted, warm room, these brilliant women,\nthe dawn just appearing at the windows, these hurrying pulses, and the pure\nimpressions made by the fleeting tones of music? But no one ventured to\nacknowledge the meaning of it all; on the contrary, almost all, feeling\nincapable of throwing themselves completely under the influence of what the\nnew impression concealed from them, rebelled against it.\n\n"Well, now, he plays mighty well," said the officer.\n\n"Wonderfully," replied Delesof, stealthily wiping his cheek with his\nsleeve.\n\n"One thing sure, it\'s time to be going, gentlemen," said the gentleman who\nhad been lying on the sofa, straightening himself up a little. "We\'ll have\nto give him something, gentlemen. Let us make a collection."\n\nAt this time, Albert was sitting alone in the next room, on the sofa. As he\nsupported himself with his elbows on his bony knees, he smoothed his face\nwith his dirty, sweaty hand, tossed back his hair, and smiled at his own\nhappy thoughts.\n\nA large collection was taken up, and Delesof was chosen to present it.\nAside from this, Delesof, who had been so keenly and unwontedly affected by\nthe music, had conceived the thought of conferring some benefit upon this\nman.\n\nIt came into his head to take him home with him, to feed him, to establish\nhim somewhere,--in other words, to lift him from his vile position.\n\n"Well, are you tired?" asked Delesof, approaching him. Albert replied with\na smile. "You have creative talent; you ought seriously to devote yourself\nto music, to play in public."\n\n"I should like to have something to drink," exclaimed Albert, as though\nsuddenly waking up.\n\nDelesof brought him some wine, and the musician greedily drained two\nglasses.\n\n"What splendid wine!" he exclaimed.\n\n"What a lovely thing that _Melancholie_ is!" said Delesof.\n\n"Oh, yes, yes," replied Albert with a smile. "But pardon me, I do not know\nwith whom I have the honor to be talking; maybe you are a count or a\nprince. Couldn\'t you let me have a little money?" He paused for a moment.\n"I have nothing--I am a poor man: I couldn\'t pay it back to you."\n\nDelesof flushed, grew embarrassed, and hastened to hand the musician the\nmoney that had been collected for him.\n\n"Very much obliged to you," said Albert, seizing the money. "Now let us\nhave some more music; I will play for you as much as you wish. Only let me\nhave something to drink, something to drink," he repeated, as he started to\nhis feet.\n\nDelesof gave him some more wine, and asked him to sit down by him.\n\n"Pardon me if I am frank with you," said Delesof. "Your talent has\ninterested me so much. It seems to me that you are in a wretched position."\n\nAlbert glanced now at Delesof, now at the hostess, who just then came into\nthe room.\n\n"Permit me to help you," continued Delesof. "If you need any thing, then I\nshould be very glad if you would come and stay with me for a while. I live\nalone, and maybe I could be of some service to you."\n\nAlbert smiled, and made no reply.\n\n"Why don\'t you thank him?" said the hostess. "It seems to me that this\nwould be a capital thing for you.--Only I would not advise you," she\ncontinued, turning to Delesof, and shaking her head warningly.\n\n"Very much obliged to you," said Albert, seizing Delesof\'s hand with both\nhis moist ones. "Only now let us have some music, please."\n\nBut the rest of the guests were already making their preparations to\ndepart; and as Albert did not address them, they came out into the\nante-room.\n\nAlbert bade the hostess farewell; and having taken his worn hat with wide\nbrim, and a last summer\'s _alma viva_, which composed his only protection\nagainst the winter, he went with Delesof down the steps.\n\nAs soon as Delesof took his seat in his carriage with his new friend, and\nbecame conscious of that unpleasant odor of intoxication and filthiness\nexhaled by the musician, he began to repent of the step that he had taken,\nand to curse himself for his childish softness of heart and lack of reason.\nMoreover, all that Albert said was so foolish and in such bad taste, and he\nseemed so near a sudden state of beastly intoxication, that Delesof was\ndisgusted. "What shall I do with him?" he asked himself.\n\nAfter they had been driving for a quarter of an hour, Albert relapsed into\nsilence, took off his hat, and laid it on his knee, then threw himself into\na corner of the carriage, and began to snore.... The wheels crunched\nmonotonously over the frozen snow, the feeble light of dawn scarcely made\nits way through the frosty windows.\n\nDelesof glanced at his companion. His long body, wrapped in his mantle, lay\nalmost lifeless near him. It seemed to him that a long head with large\nblack nose was swaying on his trunk; but on examining more closely he\nperceived that what he took to be nose and face was the man\'s hair, and\nthat his actual face was lower down.\n\nHe bent over, and studied the features of Albert\'s face. Then the beauty of\nhis brow and of his peacefully closed mouth once more charmed him. Under\nthe influence of nervous excitement caused by the sleepless hours of the\nlong night and the music, Delesof, as he looked at that face, was once more\ncarried back to the blessed world of which he had caught a glimpse once\nbefore that night; again he remembered the happy and magnanimous time of\nhis youth, and he ceased to repent of his rashness. At that moment he loved\nAlbert truly and warmly, and firmly resolved to be a benefactor to him.\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe next morning when Delesof was awakened to go to his office, he saw,\nwith an unpleasant feeling of surprise, his old screen, his old servant,\nand his clock on the table.\n\n"What did I expect to see if not the usual objects that surround me?" he\nasked himself.\n\nThen he recollected the musician\'s black eyes and happy smile; the motive\nof the _Melancholie_ and all the strange experiences of the night came back\ninto his consciousness. It was never his way, however, to reconsider\nwhether he had done wisely or foolishly in taking the musician home with\nhim. After he had dressed, he carefully laid out his plans for the day: he\ntook some paper, wrote out some necessary directions for the house, and\nhastily put on his cloak and galoshes.\n\nAs he went by the dining-room he glanced in at the door. Albert, with his\nface buried in the pillow and lying at full length in his dirty, tattered\nshirt, was buried in the profoundest slumber on the saffron sofa, where in\nabsolute unconsciousness he had been laid the night before.\n\nDelesof felt that something was not right: it disturbed him. "Please go for\nme to Boriuzovsky, and borrow his violin for a day or two," said he to his\nman; "and when he wakes up, bring him some coffee, and get him some clean\nlinen and some old suit or other of mine. Fix him up as well as you can,\nplease."\n\nWhen he returned home in the afternoon, Delesof, to his surprise, found\nthat Albert was not there.\n\n"Where is he?" he asked of his man.\n\n"He went out immediately after dinner," replied the servant. "He took the\nviolin, and went out, saying that he would be back again in an hour; but\nsince that time we have not seen him."\n\n"Ta, ta! how provoking!" said Delesof. "Why did you let him go, Zakhar?"\n\nZakhar was a Petersburg lackey, who had been in Delesof\'s service for eight\nyears. Delesof, as a single young bachelor, could not help intrusting him\nwith his plans; and he liked to get his judgment in regard to each of his\nundertakings.\n\n"How should I have ventured to detain him?" replied Zakhar, playing with\nhis watch-charms. "If you had intimated, Dmitri Ivanovitch, that you wished\nme to keep him here, I might have kept him at home. But you only spoke of\nhis wardrobe."\n\n"Ta! how vexatious! Well, what has he been doing while I was out?"\n\nZakhar smiled.\n\n"Indeed, he\'s a real artist, as you may say, Dmitri Ivanovitch. As soon as\nhe woke up he asked for some madeira: then he began to keep the cook and me\npretty busy. Such an absurd.... However, he\'s a very interesting character.\nI brought him some tea, got some dinner ready for him; but he would not eat\nalone, so he asked me to sit down with him. But when he began to play on\nthe fiddle, then I knew that you would not find many such artists at\nIzler\'s. One might well keep such a man. When he played \'Down the Little\nMother Volga\' for us, why, it was enough to make a man weep. It was too\ngood for any thing! The people from all the floors came down into our\nentry to listen."\n\n"Well, did you give him some clothes?" asked the barin.\n\n"Certainly I did: I gave him your dress-shirt, and I put on him an overcoat\nof mine. You want to help such a man as that, he\'s a fine fellow." Zakhar\nsmiled. "He asked me what rank you were, and if you had had important\nacquaintances, and how many _souls_ of peasantry you had."\n\n"Very good: but now we must send and find him; and henceforth don\'t give\nhim any thing to drink, otherwise you\'ll do him more harm than good."\n\n"That is true," said Zakhar in assent. "He doesn\'t seem in very robust\nhealth: we used to have an overseer who, like him"....\n\nDelesof, who had already long ago heard the story of the drunken overseer,\ndid not give Zakhar time to finish, but bade him make every thing ready for\nthe night, and then go out and bring the musician back.\n\nHe threw himself down on his bed, and put out the candle; but it was long\nbefore he fell asleep, for thinking about Albert.\n\n"This may seem strange to some of my friends," said Delesof to himself,\n"but how seldom it is that I can do any thing for any one beside myself!\nand I ought to thank God for a chance when one presents itself. I will not\nsend him away. I will do every thing, at least every thing that I can, to\nhelp him. Maybe he is not absolutely crazy, but only inclined to get drunk.\nIt certainly will not cost me very much. Where one is, there is always\nenough to satisfy two. Let him live with me a while, and then we will find\nhim a place, or get him up a concert; we\'ll help him off the shoals, and\nthen there will be time enough to see what will come of it." An agreeable\nsense of self-satisfaction came over him after making this resolution.\n\n"Certainly I am not a bad man: I might say I am far from being a bad man,"\nhe thought. "I might go so far as to say that I am a good man, when I\ncompare myself with others."\n\nHe was just dropping off to sleep when the sound of opening doors, and\nsteps in the ante-room, roused him again. "Well, shall I treat him rather\nseverely?" he asked himself; "I suppose that is best, and I ought to do\nit."\n\nHe rang.\n\n"Well, did you find him?" he asked of Zakhar, who answered his call.\n\n"He\'s a poor, wretched fellow, Dmitri Ivanovitch," said Zakhar, shaking his\nhead significantly, and closing his eyes.\n\n"What! is he drunk?"\n\n"Very weak."\n\n"Had he the violin with him?"\n\n"I brought it: the lady gave it to me."\n\n"All right. Now please don\'t bring him to me to-night: let him sleep it\noff; and to-morrow don\'t under any circumstances let him out of the house."\n\nBut before Zakhar had time to leave the room, Albert came in.\n\n\nV.\n\n"You don\'t mean to say that you\'ve gone to bed at this time," said Albert\nwith a smile. "I was there again, at Anna Ivanovna\'s. I spent a very\npleasant evening. We had music, told stories; there was a very pleasant\ncompany there. Please let me have a glass of something to drink," he added,\nseizing a carafe of water that stood on the table, "only not water."\n\nAlbert was just as he had been the night before,--the same lovely smiling\neyes and lips, the same fresh inspired brow, and weak features. Zakhar\'s\novercoat fitted him as though it had been made for him, and the clean,\ntall, stiffly-starched collar of the dress-shirt picturesquely fitted\naround his delicate white neck, giving him a peculiarly childlike and\ninnocent appearance.\n\nHe sat down on Delesof\'s bed, smiling with pleasure and gratitude, and\nlooked at him without speaking. Delesof gazed into Albert\'s eyes, and\nsuddenly felt himself once under the sway of that smile. All desire for\nsleep vanished from him, he forgot his resolution to be stern: on the\ncontrary, he felt like having a gay time, to hear some music, and to talk\nconfidentially with Albert till morning. Delesof bade Zakhar bring a bottle\nof wine, cigarettes, and the violin.\n\n"This is excellent," said Albert. "It\'s early yet, we\'ll have a little\nmusic. I will play whatever you like."\n\nZakhar, with evident satisfaction, brought a bottle of Lafitte, two\nglasses, some mild cigarettes such as Albert smoked, and the violin. But,\ninstead of going off to bed as his barin bade him, he lighted a cigar, and\nsat down in the next room.\n\n"Let us talk instead," said Delesof to the musician, who was beginning to\ntune the violin.\n\nAlbert sat down submissively on the bed, and smiled pleasantly.\n\n"Oh, yes!" said he, suddenly striking his forehead with his hand, and\nputting on an expression of anxious curiosity. The expression of his face\nalways foretold what he was going to say. "I wanted to ask you,"--he\nhesitated a little,--"that gentleman who was there with you last\nevening.... You called him N. Was he the son of the celebrated N.?"\n\n"His own son," replied Delesof, not understanding at all what Albert could\nfind of interest in him.\n\n"Indeed!" he exclaimed, smiling with satisfaction. "I instantly noticed\nthat there was something peculiarly aristocratic in his manners. I love\naristocrats. There is something splendid and elegant about an aristocrat.\nAnd that officer who danced so beautifully," he went on to ask. "He also\npleased me very much, he was so gay and noble looking. It seems he is\ncalled Adjutant N. N."\n\n"Who?" asked Delesof.\n\n"The one who ran into me when we were dancing. He must be a splendid man."\n\n"No, he is a silly fellow," replied Delesof.\n\n"Oh, no! it can\'t be," rejoined Albert hotly. "There\'s something very, very\npleasant about him. And he\'s a fine musician," added Albert. "He played\nsomething from an opera. It\'s a long time since I have seen any one who\npleased me so much."\n\n"Yes, he plays very well; but I don\'t like his playing," said Delesof,\nanxious to bring his companion to talk about music. "He does not understand\nclassic music, but only Donizetti and Bellini; and that\'s no music, you\nknow. You agree with me, don\'t you?"\n\n"Oh, no, no! Pardon me," replied Albert with a gentle expression of\nvindication. "The old music is music; but modern music is music too. And in\nthe modern music there are extraordinarily beautiful things. Now,\n\'Somnambula,\' and the _finale_ of \'Lucia,\' and Chopin, and \'Robert\'! I\noften think,"--he hesitated, apparently collecting his thoughts,--"that if\nBeethoven were alive, he would weep tears of joy to hear \'Somnambula.\' It\'s\nso beautiful all through. I heard \'Somnambula\' first when Viardot and\nRubini were here. That was something worth while," he said, with shining\neyes, and making a gesture with both hands, as though he were casting\nsomething from his breast. "I\'d give a good deal, but it would be\nimpossible, to bring it back."\n\n"Well, but how do you like the opera nowadays?" asked Delesof.\n\n"Bosio is good, very good," was his reply, "exquisite beyond words; but she\ndoes not touch me here," he said, pointing to his sunken chest. "A singer\nmust have passion, and she hasn\'t any. She is enjoyable, but she doesn\'t\ntorture you."\n\n"Well, how about Lablache?"\n\n"I heard him in Paris, in \'The Barber of Seville.\' Then he was the only\none, but now he is old. He can\'t be an artist, he is old."\n\n"Well, supposing he is old, still he is fine in _morceaux d\'ensemble_,"\nsaid Delesof, still speaking of Lablache.\n\n"Who said that he was old?" said Albert severely. "He can\'t be old. The\nartist can never be old. Much is needed in an artist, but fire most of\nall," he declared with glistening eyes, and raising both hands in the air.\nAnd, indeed, a terrible inner fire seemed to glow throughout his whole\nframe. "Ah, my God!" he exclaimed suddenly. "You don\'t know Petrof, do\nyou,--Petrof, the artist?"\n\n"No, I don\'t know him," replied Delesof with a smile.\n\n"How I wish that you and he might become acquainted! You would enjoy\ntalking with him. How he does understand art! He and I often used to meet\nat Anna Ivanovna\'s, but now she is vexed with him for some reason or other.\nBut I really wish that you might make his acquaintance. He has great, great\ntalent."\n\n"Oh! Does he paint pictures?" asked Delesof.\n\n"I don\'t know. No, I think not; but he was an artist of the Academy. What\nthoughts he had! Whenever he talks, it is wonderful. Oh, Petrof has great\ntalent, only he leads a very gay life!... It\'s too bad," said Albert with a\nsmile. The next moment he got up from the bed, took the violin, and began\nto play.\n\n"Have you been at the opera lately?" asked Delesof.\n\nAlbert looked round, and sighed.\n\n"Ah, I have not been able to!" he said, clutching his head. Again he sat\ndown by Delesof. "I will tell you," he went on to say, almost in a whisper.\n"I can\'t go: I can\'t play there. I have nothing, nothing at all,--no\nclothes, no home, no violin. It\'s a wretched life,--a wretched life!" he\nrepeated the phrase. "Yes, and why have I got into such a state? Why,\nindeed? It ought not to have been," said he, smiling. "_Akh! Don Juan._"\n\nAnd he struck his head.\n\n"Now let us have something to eat," said Delesof.\n\nAlbert, without replying, sprang up, seized the violin, and began to play\nthe _finale_ of the first act of "Don Juan," accompanying it with a\ndescription of the scene in the opera.\n\nDelesof felt the hair stand up on his head, when he played the voice of the\ndying commander.\n\n"No, I cannot play to-night," said Albert, laying down the instrument. "I\nhave been drinking too much." But immediately after he went to the table,\npoured out a brimming glass of wine, drank it at one gulp, and again sat\ndown on the bed near Delesof.\n\nDelesof looked steadily at Albert. The latter occasionally smiled, and\nDelesof returned his smile. Neither of them spoke, but the glance and smile\nbrought them close together into a reciprocity of affection. Delesof felt\nthat he was growing constantly fonder and fonder of this man, and he\nexperienced an inexpressible pleasure.\n\n"Were you ever in love?" he asked suddenly. Albert remained sunk in thought\nfor a few seconds, then his face lighted up with a melancholy smile. He\nbent over toward Delesof, and gazed straight into his eyes.\n\n"Why did you ask me that question?" he whispered. "But I will tell you all\nabout it. I like you," he added, after a few moments of thought, and\nglancing around. "I will not deceive you, I will tell you all, just as it\nwas, from the beginning." He paused, and his eyes took on a strange wild\nappearance. "You know that I am weak in judgment," he said suddenly. "Yes,\nyes," he continued. "Anna Ivanovna has told you about it. She tells\neverybody that I am crazy. It isn\'t true, she says it for a joke; she is a\ngood woman, but I really have not been quite well for some time." Albert\npaused again, and stood up, gazing with wide-opened eyes at the dark door.\n"You asked me if I had ever been in love. Yes, I have been in love," he\nwhispered, raising his brows. "That happened long ago; it was at a time\nwhen I still had a place at the theatre. I went to play second violin at\nthe opera, and she came into a parquet box at the left."\n\nAlbert stood up, and bent over to Delesof\'s ear. "But no," said he, "why\nshould I mention her name? You probably know her, everybody knows her. I\nsaid nothing, but simply looked at her: I knew that I was a poor artist,\nand she an aristocratic lady. I knew that very well. I only looked at her,\nand had no thoughts."\n\nAlbert paused for a moment, as though making sure of his recollections.\n\n"How it happened I know not, but I was invited once to accompany her on my\nviolin.... Now I was only a poor artist!" he repeated, shaking his head and\nsmiling. "But no, I cannot tell you, I cannot!" he exclaimed, again\nclutching his head. "How happy I was!"\n\n"What? did you go to her house often?" asked Delesof.\n\n"Once, only once.... But it was my own fault; I wasn\'t in my right mind. I\nwas a poor artist, and she an aristocratic lady. I ought not to have spoken\nto her. But I lost my senses, I committed a folly. Petrof told me the\ntruth: \'It would have been better only to have seen her at the theatre.\'"\n\n"What did you do?" asked Delesof.\n\n"Ah! wait, wait, I cannot tell you that."\n\nAnd, hiding his face in his hands, he said nothing for some time.\n\n"I was late at the orchestra. Petrof and I had been drinking that evening,\nand I was excited. She was sitting in her box, and talking with some\ngeneral. I don\'t know who that general was. She was sitting at the very\nedge of the box, with her arm resting on the rim. She wore a white dress,\nwith pearls on her neck. She was talking with him, but she looked at me.\nTwice she looked at me. She had arranged her hair in such a becoming way! I\nstopped playing, and stood near the bass, and gazed at her. Then, for the\nfirst time, something strange took place in me. She smiled on the general,\nbut she looked at me. I felt certain that she was talking about me; and\nsuddenly I seemed to be not in my place in the orchestra, but was standing\nin her box, and seizing her hand in that place. What was the meaning of\nthat?" asked Albert, after a moment\'s silence.\n\n"A powerful imagination," said Delesof.\n\n"No, no, ... I cannot tell," said Albert frowning. "Even then I was poor. I\nhadn\'t any room; and when I went to the theatre, I sometimes used to sleep\nthere."\n\n"What, in the theatre?" asked Delesof.\n\n"Ah! I am not afraid of these stupid things. Ah! just wait a moment. As\nsoon as everybody was gone, I went to that box where she had been sitting,\nand slept there. That was my only pleasure. How many nights I spent there!\nOnly once again did I have that experience. At night many things seemed to\ncome to me. But I cannot tell you much about them." Albert contracted his\nbrows, and looked at Delesof. "What did it mean?" he asked.\n\n"It was strange," replied the other.\n\n"No, wait, wait!" he bent over to his ear, and said in a whisper,--\n\n"I kissed her hand, wept there before her, and said many things to her. I\nheard the fragrance of her sighs, I heard her voice. She said many things\nto me that one night. Then I took my violin, and began to play softly. And\nI played beautifully. But it became terrible to me. I am not afraid of such\nstupid things, and I don\'t believe in them, but my head felt terribly," he\nsaid, smiling sweetly, and moving his hand over his forehead. "It seemed\nterrible to me on account of my poor mind; something happened in my head.\nMaybe it was nothing; what do you think?"\n\nNeither spoke for several minutes.\n\n    _"Und wenn die Wolken sie verhuellen,\n    Die Sonne bleibt doch ewig klar._[54]"\n\nhummed Albert, smiling gently. "That is true, isn\'t it?" he asked.\n\n    _"Ich auch habe gelebt und genossen."_[55]\n\n[Footnote 54:\n\n    E\'en though the clouds may veil it,\n      The sun shines ever clear.\n\n]\n\n[Footnote 55:\n\n    I also have lived and rejoiced.\n\n]\n\n"Ah, old man Petrof! how this would have made things clear to you!"\n\nDelesof, in silence and with dismay, looked at his companion\'s excited and\ncolorless face.\n\n"Do you know the Juristen waltzes?" suddenly asked Albert in a loud voice,\nand without waiting for an answer, jumped up, seized the violin, and began\nto play the waltz. In absolute self-forgetfulness, and evidently imagining\nthat a whole orchestra was playing for him, Albert smiled, began to dance,\nto shuffle his feet, and to play admirably.\n\n"Hey, we will have a good time!" he exclaimed, as he ended, and waved his\nviolin. "I am going," said he, after sitting down in silence for a little.\n"Won\'t you come along too?"\n\n"Where?" asked Delesof in surprise.\n\n"Let us go to Anna Ivanovna\'s again. It\'s gay there,--bustle, people,\nmusic."\n\nDelesof for a moment was almost persuaded. However, coming to his senses,\nhe promised Albert that he would go with him the next day.\n\n"I should like to go this minute."\n\n"Indeed, I wouldn\'t go."\n\nAlbert sighed, and laid down the violin.\n\n"Shall I stay, then?" He looked over at the table, but the wine was gone;\nand so, wishing him a good-night, he left the room.\n\nDelesof rang. "Look here," said he to Zakhar, "don\'t let Mr. Albert go\nanywhere without asking me about it first."\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe next day was a holiday. Delesof, on waking, sat in his parlor, drinking\nhis coffee and reading a book. Albert, who was in the next room, had not\nyet moved. Zakhar discreetly opened the door, and looked into the\ndining-room.\n\n"Would you believe it, Dmitri Ivanovitch, there he lies asleep on the bare\nsofa. I would not send him away for any thing, God knows. He\'s like a\nlittle child. Indeed, he\'s an artist!"\n\nAt twelve o\'clock, there was a sound of yawning and coughing on the other\nside of the door.\n\nZakhar again crept into the dining-room; and the barin heard his wheedling\nvoice, and Albert\'s gentle, beseeching voice.\n\n"Well, how is he?" asked Delesof, when Zakhar came out.\n\n"He feels blue, Dmitri Ivanovitch. He doesn\'t want to get dressed. He\'s so\ncross. All he asks for is something to drink."\n\n"Now, if we are to get hold of him, we must strengthen his character," said\nDelesof to himself. And, forbidding Zakhar to give him any wine, he again\ndevoted himself to his book; in spite of himself, however, listening all\nthe time for developments in the dining-room.\n\nBut there was no movement there, only occasionally were heard a heavy chest\ncough and spitting. Two hours passed. Delesof, after dressing to go out,\nresolved to look in upon his guest. Albert was sitting motionless at the\nwindow, leaning his head on his hands.\n\nHe looked round. His face was sallow, morose, and not only melancholy but\ndeeply unhappy. He tried to welcome his host with a smile, but his face\nassumed a still more woe-begone expression. It seemed as though he were on\nthe point of tears.\n\nWith effort he stood up and bowed. "If I might have just a little glass of\nsimple vodka," he exclaimed with a supplicating expression. "I am so weak.\nIf you please!"\n\n"Coffee will be more strengthening, I would advise you."\n\nAlbert\'s face lost its childish expression; he gazed coldly, sadly, out of\nthe window, and fell back into the chair.\n\n"Wouldn\'t you like some breakfast?"\n\n"No, thank you, I haven\'t any appetite."\n\n"If you want to play on the violin, you will not disturb me," said Delesof,\nlaying the instrument on the table. Albert looked at the violin with a\ncontemptuous smile.\n\n"No, I am too weak, I cannot play," he said, and pushed the instrument from\nhim.\n\nAfter that, in reply to all Delesof\'s propositions to go to walk, to go to\nthe theatre in the evening, or any thing else, he only shook his head\nmournfully, and refused to speak.\n\nDelesof went out, made a few calls, dined out, and before the theatre hour,\nhe returned to his rooms to change his attire and find out how the musician\nwas getting along.\n\nAlbert was sitting in the dark ante-room, and, with his head resting on his\nhand, was gazing at the heated stove. He was neatly dressed, washed and\ncombed; but his eyes were sad and vacant, and his whole form expressed even\nmore weakness and debility than in the morning.\n\n"Well, have you had dinner, Mr. Albert?" asked Delesof.\n\nAlbert nodded his head, and, after looking with a terrified expression at\nDelesof, dropped his eyes. It made Delesof feel uncomfortable.\n\n"I have been talking to-day with a manager," said he, also dropping his\neyes. "He would be very glad to make terms with you, if you would like to\naccept an engagement."\n\n"I thank you, but I cannot play," said Albert, almost in a whisper; and he\nwent into his room, and closed the door as softly as possible. After a few\nminutes, lifting the latch as softly as possible, he came out of the room,\nbringing the violin. Casting a sharp, angry look at Delesof, he laid the\ninstrument on the table, and again disappeared.\n\nDelesof shrugged his shoulders, and smiled.\n\n"What am I to do now? Wherein am I to blame?" he asked himself.\n\n"Well, how is the musician?" was his first question when he returned home\nlate that evening.\n\n"Bad," was Zakhar\'s short and ringing reply. "He sighs all the time, and\ncoughs, and says nothing at all, only he has asked for vodka four or five\ntimes, and once I gave him some. How can we avoid killing him this way,\nDmitri Ivanovitch? That was the way the overseer"....\n\n"Well, hasn\'t he played on the fiddle?"\n\n"Didn\'t even touch it. I took it to him, twice--Well, he took it up slowly,\nand carried it out," said Zakhar with a smile. "Do you still bid me refuse\nhim something to drink?"\n\n"Don\'t give him any thing to-day; we\'ll see what\'ll come of it. What is he\ndoing now?"\n\n"He has shut himself into the parlor."\n\nDelesof went into his library, took down a few French books, and the\nTestament in German. "Put these books to-morrow in his room; and look out,\ndon\'t let him get away," said he to Zakhar.\n\nThe next morning Zakhar informed his barin that the musician had not slept\na wink all night. "He kept walking up and down his rooms, and going to the\nsideboard to try to open the cupboard and door; but every thing, in spite\nof his efforts, remained locked."\n\nZakhar told how, while he was going to sleep, he heard Albert muttering to\nhimself in the darkness and gesticulating.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEach day Albert grew more gloomy and taciturn. It seemed as though he were\nafraid of Delesof, and his face expressed painful terror whenever their\neyes met. He did not touch either book or violin, and made no replies to\nthe questions put to him.\n\nOn the third day after the musician came to stay with him, Delesof returned\nhome late in the evening, tired and worried. He had been on the go all day,\nattending to his duties. Though they had seemed very simple and easy, yet,\nas is often the case, he had not made any progress at all, in spite of his\nstrenuous endeavors. Afterwards he had stopped at the club, and lost at\nwhist. He was out of spirits.\n\n"Well, God be with him," he replied to Zakhar, who had been telling him of\nAlbert\'s pitiable state. "To-morrow I shall be really worried about him. Is\nhe willing or not to stay with me, and follow my advice? No? Then it\'s\nidle. I have done the best that I could."\n\n"That\'s what comes of trying to be a benefactor to people," said he to\nhimself. "I am putting myself to inconvenience for him. I have taken this\nfilthy creature into my rooms, which keeps me from receiving strangers in\nthe morning; I work and trot; and yet he looks upon me as some enemy who,\nagainst his will, would keep him in pound. But the worst is, that he is not\nwilling to take a step in his own behalf. That\'s the way with them all."\n\nThat word _all_ referred to people in general, and especially to those with\nwhom he had been associated in business that day. "But what is to be done\nfor him now? What is he contemplating? Why is he melancholy? Is he\nmelancholy on account of the debauch from which I rescued him? on account\nof the degradation in which he has been? the humiliation from which I saved\nhim? Can it be that he has fallen so low that it is a burden for him to\nlook on a pure life?...\n\n"No, this was a childish action," reasoned Delesof. "Why should I undertake\nto direct others, when it is as much as I can do to manage my own affairs?"\n\nThe impulse came over him to let him go immediately, but after a little\ndeliberation he postponed it till the morning.\n\nDuring the night Delesof was aroused by the noise of a falling table in the\nante-room, and the sound of voices and stamping feet.\n\n"Just wait a little, I will tell Dmitri Ivanovitch," said Zakhar\'s voice;\nAlbert\'s voice replied passionately and incoherently.\n\nDelesof leaped up, and went with a candle into the ante-room. Zakhar in his\nnightdress was standing against the door; Albert in cap and _alma viva_ was\ntrying to pull him away, and was screaming at him in a pathetic voice.\n\n"You have no right to detain me; I have a passport; I have not stolen any\nthing from you. You must let me go. I will go to the police."\n\n"I beg of you, Dmitri Ivanovitch," said Zakhar, turning to his barin, and\ncontinuing to stand guard at the door. "He got up in the night, found the\nkey in my overcoat-pocket, and he has drunk up the whole decanter of sweet\nvodka. Was that good? And now he wants to go. You didn\'t give me orders,\nand so I could not let him out."\n\nAlbert, seeing Delesof, began to pull still more violently on Zakhar. "No\none has the right to detain me! He cannot do it," he screamed, raising his\nvoice more and more.\n\n"Let him go, Zakhar," said Delesof. "I do not wish to detain you, and I\nhave no right to, but I advise you to stay till to-morrow," he added,\naddressing Albert.\n\n"No one has the right to detain me. I am going to the police," screamed\nAlbert more and more furiously, addressing only Zakhar, and not heeding\nDelesof. "Guard!" he suddenly shouted at the top of his voice.\n\n"Now, what are you screaming like that for? You see you are free to go,"\nsaid Zakhar, opening the door.\n\nAlbert ceased screaming. "How did they dare? They were going to murder me!\nNo!" he muttered to himself as he put on his galoshes. Not offering to say\ngood-by, and still muttering something unintelligible, he went out of the\ndoor. Zakhar accompanied him to the gate, and came back.\n\n"Thank the Lord, Dmitri Ivanovitch! Any longer would have been a sin," said\nhe to his barin. "And now we must count the silver."\n\nDelesof only shook his head, and made no reply. There came over him a\nlively recollection of the first two evenings which he and the musician had\nspent together; he remembered the last wretched days which Albert had spent\nthere; and above all he remembered the sweet but absurd sentiment of\nwonder, of love, and of sympathy, which had been aroused in him by the very\nfirst sight of this strange man; and he began to pity him.\n\n"What will become of him now?" he asked himself. "Without money, without\nwarm clothing, alone at midnight!" He thought of sending Zakhar after him,\nbut now it was too late.\n\n"Is it cold out doors?" he asked.\n\n"A healthy frost, Dmitri Ivanovitch," replied the man. "I forgot to tell\nyou that you will have to buy some more firewood to last till spring."\n\n"But what did you mean by saying that it would last?"\n\n\nVII.\n\nOut of doors it was really cold; but Albert did not feel it, he was so\nexcited by the wine that he had taken and by the quarrel.\n\nAs he entered the street, he looked around him, and rubbed his hands with\npleasure. The street was empty, but the long lines of lights were still\nbrilliantly gleaming; the sky was clear and beautiful. "What!" he cried,\naddressing the lighted window in Delesof\'s apartments; and then thrusting\nhis hands in his trousers pockets under his coat, and looking straight\nahead, he walked with heavy and uncertain steps straight up the street.\n\nHe felt an absolute weight in his legs and abdomen, something hummed in his\nhead, some invisible power seemed to hurl him from side to side; but he\nstill plunged ahead in the direction of where Anna Ivanovna lived.\n\nStrange, disconnected thoughts rushed through his head. Now he remembered\nhis quarrel with Zakhar, now something recalled the sea and his first\nvoyage in the steamboat to Russia; now the merry night that he had spent\nwith some friend in the wine-shop by which he was passing; then suddenly\nthere came to him a familiar air singing itself in his recollections, and\nhe seemed to see the object of his passion and the terrible night in the\ntheatre.\n\nBut notwithstanding their incoherence, all these recollections presented\nthemselves before his imaginations with such distinctness that when he\nclosed his eyes he could not tell which was nearer to the reality: what he\nwas doing, or what he was thinking. He did not realize and he did not feel\nhow his legs moved, how he staggered and hit against a wall, how he looked\naround him, and how he made his way from street to street.\n\nAs he went along the Little Morskaya, Albert tripped and fell. Collecting\nhimself in a moment, he saw before him some huge and magnificent edifice,\nand he went toward it.\n\nIn the sky not a star was to be seen, nor sign of dawn, nor moon, neither\nwere there any street-lights there; but all objects were perfectly\ndistinguishable. The windows of the edifice, which loomed up at the corner\nof the street, were brilliantly lighted, but the lights wavered like\nreflections. The building kept coming nearer and nearer, clearer and\nclearer, to Albert.\n\nBut the lights vanished the moment that Albert entered the wide portals.\nInside it was dark. He took a few steps under the vaulted ceiling, and\nsomething like shades glided by and fled at his approach.\n\n"Why did I come here?" wondered Albert; but some irresistible power dragged\nhim forward into the depths of the immense hall.\n\nThere stood some lofty platform, and around it in silence stood what seemed\nlike little men. "Who is going to speak?" asked Albert. No one answered,\nbut some one pointed to the platform. There stood now on the platform a\ntall, thin man, with bushy hair and dressed in a variegated gown. Albert\nimmediately recognized his friend Petrof.\n\n"How strange! what is he doing here?" said Albert to himself.\n\n"No, brethren," said Petrof, pointing to something, "you did not appreciate\nthe man while he was living among you; you did not appreciate him! He was\nnot a cheap artist, not a merely mechanical performer, not a crazy, ruined\nman. He was a genius, a great musical genius, who perished among you\nunknown and unvalued."\n\nAlbert immediately understood of whom his friend was speaking; but not\nwishing to interrupt him, he hung his head modestly. "He, like a sheaf of\nstraw, was wholly consumed by the sacred fire which we all serve,"\ncontinued the voice. "But he has completely fulfilled all that God gave\nhim; therefore he ought to be considered a great man. You may despise him,\ntorture him, humiliate him," continued the voice, more and more\nenergetically, "but he has been, is, and will be immeasurably higher than\nyou all. He is happy, he is good. He loved you all alike, or cared for you,\nit is all the same; but he has served only that with which he was so highly\nendowed. He loved one thing,--beauty, the only infinite good in the world.\nOh, yes, what a man he is! Fall all of you before him. On your knees!"\ncried Petrof in a thundering voice.\n\nBut another voice mildly answered from another corner of the hall. "I do\nnot wish to bow my knee before him," said the voice.\n\nAlbert instantly recognized Delesof.\n\n"Why is he great? And why should we bow before him? Has he conducted\nhimself in an honorable and righteous manner? Has he brought society any\nadvantage? Do we not know how he borrowed money, and never returned it;\nhow he carried off a violin that belonged to a brother artist, and pawned\nit?"\n\n"My God! how did he know all that?" said Albert to himself, drooping his\nhead still lower.\n\n"Do we not know," the voice went on, "how he pandered to the lowest of the\nlow, pandered to them for money? Do we not know how he was driven out of\nthe theatre? How Anna Ivanovna threatened to hand him over to the police?"\n\n"My God! that is all true, but protect me," cried Albert. "You are the only\none who knows why I did so."\n\n"Stop, for shame!" cried Petrof\'s voice again. "What right have you to\naccuse him? Have you lived his life? Have you experienced his enthusiasms?"\n\n"Right! right!" whispered Albert.\n\n"Art is the highest manifestation of power in man. It is given only to the\nfavored few, and it lifts the chosen to such an eminence that the head\nswims, and it is hard to preserve its integrity. In art, as in every\nstruggle, there are heroes who bring all under subjection to them, and\nperish if they do not attain their ends."\n\nPetrof ceased speaking; and Albert lifted his head, and tried to shout in a\nloud voice, "Right! right!" but his voice died without a sound.\n\n"That is not the case with you. This does not concern you," sternly said\nthe artist Petrof, addressing Delesof. "Yes, humble him, despise him," he\ncontinued, "for he is better and happier than all the rest of you."\n\nAlbert, with rapture in his heart at hearing these words, could not contain\nhimself, but went up to his friend, and was about to kiss him.\n\n"Get thee gone, I do not know you," replied Petrof. "Go your own way, you\ncannot come here."\n\n"Here, you drunken fellow, you cannot come here," cried a policeman at the\ncrossing.\n\nAlbert hesitated, then collected all his forces, and, endeavoring not to\nstumble, crossed over to the next street.\n\nIt was only a few steps to Anna Ivanovna\'s. From the hall of her house a\nstream of light fell on the snowy _dvor_, and at the gate stood sledges and\ncarriages.\n\nClinging with both hands to the balustrade, he made his way up the steps,\nand rang the bell.\n\nThe maid\'s sleepy face appeared at the open door, and looked angrily at\nAlbert.\n\n"It is impossible," she cried; "I have been forbidden to let you in," and\nshe slammed the door. The sounds of music and women\'s voices floated down\nto him.\n\nAlbert sat down on the ground, and leaned his head against the wall, and\nshut his eyes. At that very instant a throng of indistinct but correlated\nvisions took possession of him with fresh force, mastered him, and carried\nhim off into the beautiful and free domain of fancy.\n\n"Yes! he is better and happier," involuntarily the voice repeated in his\nimagination.\n\nFrom the door were heard the sounds of a polka. These sounds also told him\nthat he was better and happier. In a neighboring church was heard the sound\nof a prayer-bell; and the prayer-bell also told him that he was better and\nhappier.\n\n"Now I will go back to that hall again," said Albert to himself. "Petrof\nmust have many things still to tell me."\n\nThere seemed to be no one now in the hall; and in the place of the artist\nPetrof, Albert himself stood on the platform, and was playing on his violin\nall that the voice had said before.\n\nBut his violin was of strange make: it was composed of nothing but glass,\nand he had to hold it with both hands, and slowly rub it on his breast to\nmake it give out sounds. The sounds were so sweet and delicious, that\nAlbert felt he had never before heard any thing like them. The more tightly\nhe pressed the violin to his breast, the more sweet and consoling they\nbecame. The louder the sounds, the more swiftly the shadows vanished, and\nthe more brilliantly the walls of the hall were illuminated. But it was\nnecessary to play very cautiously on the violin, lest it should break.\n\nAlbert played on the instrument of glass cautiously and well. He played\nthings the like of which he felt no one would ever hear again.\n\nHe was growing tired, when a heavy distant sound began to annoy him. It was\nthe sound of a bell, but this sound seemed to have a language.\n\n"Yes," said the bell, with its notes coming from somewhere far off and high\nup, "yes, he seems to you wretched; you despise him, but he is better and\nhappier than you. No one ever will play more on that instrument!"\n\nThese words which he understood seemed suddenly so wise, so novel, and so\ntrue, to Albert, that he stopped playing, and, while trying not to move,\nlifted his eyes and his arms toward heaven. He felt that he was beautiful\nand happy. Although no one was in the hall, Albert expanded his chest, and\nproudly lifted his head, and stood on the platform so that all might see\nhim.\n\nSuddenly some one\'s hand was gently laid on his shoulder; he turned around,\nand in the half light saw a woman. She looked pityingly at him, and shook\nher head. He immediately became conscious that what he was doing was wrong,\nand a sense of shame came over him.\n\n"Where shall I go?" he asked her. Once more she gazed long and fixedly at\nhim, and bent her head pityingly. She was the one, the very one whom he\nloved, and her dress was the same; on her round white neck was the pearl\nnecklace, and her lovely arms were bare above the elbows.\n\nShe took him in her arms, and bore him away through the hall. At the\nentrance of the hall, Albert saw the moon and water. But the water was not\nbelow as is usually the case, and the moon was not above; there was a white\ncircle in one place as sometimes happens. The moon and the water were\ntogether,--everywhere, above and below, and on all sides and around them\nboth. Albert and his love darted off toward the moon and the water, and he\nnow realized that she whom he loved more than all in the world was in his\narms: he embraced her, and felt inexpressible felicity.\n\n"Is not this a dream?" he asked himself. But no, it was the reality, it was\nmore than reality: it was reality and recollection combined.\n\nThen he felt that the indescribable pleasure which he had felt during the\nlast moment was gone, and would never be renewed.\n\n"Why am I weeping?" he asked of her. She looked at him in silence, with\npitying eyes. Albert understood what she desired to say in reply. "Just as\nwhen I was alive," he went on to say. She, without replying, looked\nstraight forward.\n\n"This is terrible! How can I explain to her that I _am_ alive?" he asked\nhimself in horror. "My God, I am alive! Do understand me," he whispered.\n\n"He is better and happier," said a voice.\n\nBut something kept oppressing Albert ever more powerfully. Whether it was\nthe moon or the water, or her embrace or his tears, he could not tell, but\nhe was conscious that he could not say all that it was his duty to say, and\nthat all would be quickly over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo guests coming out from Anna Ivanovna\'s rooms stumbled against Albert\nlying on the threshold. One of them went back to Anna Ivanovna, and called\nher. "That was heartless," he said. "You might let a man freeze to death\nthat way."\n\n"_Akh!_ why, that is my Albert. See where he was lying!" exclaimed the\nhostess. "Annushka, have him brought into the room; find a place for him\nsomewhere," she added, addressing the maid.\n\n"Oh! I am alive, why do you bury me?" muttered Albert, as they brought him\nunconscious into the room.\n\n\n\n\nTWO HUSSARS.\n\n_A TALE._\n\n1856.\n\n        Jomini, ay, Jomini,\n    But not a single word of vodka.[56]\n\nD. DAVUIDOF.\n\n\nAt the very beginning of this century, when there were no railways, no\nmacadamized roads, no gas or stearine candles, no low and springy sofas, no\nunvarnished furniture, no disillusionized young men with eye-glasses, no\nwomen philosophers of liberal tendencies, no dear Camilles, such as our\ntime has produced in abundance; in those naive days when travellers made\nthe journey from Moscow to Petersburg by stage or carriage, and took with\nthem a whole kitchen of domestic preparations, and travelled for a week,\nnight and day, over soft roads, muddy or dusty as the case might be, pinned\ntheir faith to Pozharsky cutlets, Valdai bluebells, and pretzels; when\nduring the long autumn evenings tallow candles burned till they had to be\nsnuffed, and cast their rays on family circles of twenty or thirty people\n(at balls, wax or spermaceti candles were set up in candelabra); when\nfurniture was placed with stiff precision; when our fathers were still\nyoung, not merely by the absence of wrinkles and gray hair, but fought\nduels for women, and were fain to rush from one end of a room to the other\nto pick up a handkerchief dropped accidentally or otherwise, and our\nmothers wore short waists and huge sleeves, and decided family affairs by\nthe drawing of lots; when charming Camilles avoided the light of day; in\nthe naive period of Masonic lodges, of Martinists, and of the _Tugendbund_;\nat the time of the Miloradovitches, Davuidofs, and Pushkins,--a meeting of\nlanded proprietors took place in the governmental city of K., and the\nelection of the college of nobles was drawing to a close.\n\n[Footnote 56: From the poem entitled, "The Song of an Old Hussar," in which\na veteran contrasts the mighty days of the past with the dilettanti\npresent. Denis Vasilyevitch Davuidof, who was an officer of hussars, died\nin 1839.--TR.]\n\n\nI.\n\n"Well, all right, it\'s all the same, be it in the hall," said a young\nofficer dressed in a shuba, and wearing a hussar\'s helmet, as he dismounted\nfrom a travelling sledge in front of the best hotel of the city of K.\n\n"A great meeting, little father, your excellency,--a tremendous crowd,"\nsaid the hall-boy, who had already learned from the officer\'s man that it\nwas Count Turbin, and therefore honored him with the address of "your\nexcellency." "Madame Afrimova and her daughters have expressed the\nintention of going away this evening; you can be accommodated with their\nroom as soon as it is vacated,--No. 11," the hall-boy went on to say,\nnoiselessly showing the count the way, and constantly turning round to look\nat him.\n\nIn the sitting-room, at a small table under a blackened full-length\nportrait of the Emperor Alexander, sat a number of men, evidently belonging\nto the local aristocracy, drinking champagne; and on one side were some\ntravelling merchants in blue shubas.\n\nThe count entered the room, and calling Bluecher, a huge gray boarhound that\naccompanied him, he threw off his cloak, the collar of which was covered\nwith frost, and, after ordering vodka, sat down at the table in a short\nblue-satin jacket, and entered into conversation with the gentlemen sitting\nthere. The latter, attracted toward the new-comer by his handsome and frank\nexterior, offered him a glass of champagne.\n\nThe count had begun to drink his glass of vodka; but now he also ordered a\nbottle of champagne, in order to return the courtesy of his new companions.\n\nThe driver came in to ask for vodka-money.\n\n"Sashka,"[57] cried the count, "give it to him."\n\n[Footnote 57: Diminished diminutive of Aleksandr.]\n\nThe driver went out with Sashka, but quickly returned, holding the money in\nhis hands.\n\n"What! little father, \'slency, is that right? I did my best for you. You\npromised me a half-ruble, and you have only given me a quarter!"\n\n"Sashka, give him a ruble."\n\nSashka, hanging down his head, gazed at the driver\'s feet.\n\n"He will have enough," said he in his deep voice. "Besides, I haven\'t any\nmore money."\n\nThe count drew from his pocket-book the two solitary blue notes[58] which\nwere in it, and gave one to the driver, who kissed his hand, and went off.\n"I have come to the end," said the count, "my last five rubles."\n\n[Footnote 58: Blue notes were five rubles.]\n\n"True hussar style, count," said one of the nobles, whose mustaches, voice,\nand a certain energetic freedom in the use of his legs, proclaimed him,\nbeyond a peradventure, to be a retired cavalryman. "Are you going to spend\nsome time here, count?"\n\n"I must have some money if I stay, otherwise I should not be very likely\nto. Besides, there are no spare rooms, the Devil take it, in this cursed\ntavern."\n\n"I beg of you, count," pursued the cavalryman, "wouldn\'t you like to come\nin with me? My room is No. 7. If you wouldn\'t object to sleep there for the\npresent. We shall be here three days at least. To-day I was at the\nmarshal\'s: how glad he would be to see you!"\n\n"That\'s right, count, stay with us," urged another of the table companions,\na handsome young man. "What is your hurry? And besides, this happens only\nonce in three years,--these elections. We might get a glimpse of some of\nour girls, count!"\n\n"Sashka, get me some clean linen. I am going to have a bath," said the\ncount, rising. "And then we will see; perhaps I may decide to pay my\nrespects to the marshal."\n\nThen he called the waiter, and said something to him in an undertone. The\nwaiter replied, with a laugh, "That is within human possibility," and went\nout.\n\n"Well, then, little father, I have given orders to have my trunk taken to\nyour room," cried the count, as he went out of the door.\n\n"I shall consider it a favor: it delights me," replied the cavalryman as he\nhastened to the door, and cried, "No.7; don\'t forget!"\n\nWhen the count was out of hearing, the cavalryman returned to his place,\nand drawing his chair nearer to the _chinovnik_, and looking him straight\nin his smiling eyes, said,--\n\n"Well, he\'s the very one."\n\n"What one?"\n\n"I tell you that he\'s that very same hussar duellist,--let me see, the\nfamous Turbin. He knew me. I\'ll wager he knew me. I assure you, at Lebedyan\nhe and I were on a spree for three weeks, and were never sober once. That\nwas when I lost my remount. There was one little affair at that time,--we\nwere engaged in it together. Ah, he is a gay lad! isn\'t he, though?"\n\n"Indeed he is. What pleasant manners he has! There\'s no fault to be found\nwith him," replied the handsome young man. "How quickly we became\nacquainted!... He isn\'t more than twenty-two, is he?"\n\n"He certainly would not seem so, would he?... But he\'s really more than\nthat. Well, now you want to know who he is, don\'t you? Who carried off\nMegunova? He did. He killed Sablin. He kicked Matnyef out of the window. He\n\'did\' Prince Nesterof out of three hundred thousand rubles. He\'s a regular\nmadcap. You ought to know him,--a gambler, duellist, seducer, but a\nwhole-souled fellow, a genuine hussar. We got talked about a good deal, but\nif any one really understood what it meant to be a genuine hussar! Those\nwere great times."\n\nAnd the cavalryman began to tell his comrade of a drinking-bout with the\ncount, which had never taken place, nor could have taken place. It could\nnot have taken place, first, because he had never seen the count before,\nand had retired from the service two years before the count had entered it;\nand secondly, because this cavalryman had never served in the cavalry, but\nhad served four years as a very insignificant yunker in the Bielevsky\nregiment; and just as soon as he was promoted to be ensign, he retired.\n\nBut ten years before he had received an inheritance, and actually went to\nLebedyan; and there he spent seven hundred rubles with the cavalry\nofficers, and had had made for him an uhlan\'s uniform with orange lapels,\nwith the intention of entering the uhlans. His thought of entering the\ncavalry, and his three weeks spent with the officers at Lebedyan, made the\nvery happiest and most brilliant period of his life; so that he began to\ntransfer his thought into a reality. Then, as he added remembrance to it,\nhe began actually to believe in his military past,--which did not prevent\nhim from being a worthy man through his kindness of heart and uprightness.\n\n"Yes, any one who has never served in the cavalry," he went on to say,\n"will never understand us fellows."\n\nHe sat astride of his chair, and, thrusting out his lower lip, went on in a\ndeep voice, "It happens you are riding along in front of the battalion. A\ndevil is under you, not a horse, prancing along; thus you sit on this\nperfect devil. The battalion commander comes along. \'Lieutenant,\' says he,\n\'I beg of you--your service is absolutely indispensable. You must lead the\nbattalion for the parade.\' Very well, and so it goes. You look around, you\ngive a shout, you lead the brave fellows who are under your command. Ah!\nthe deuce take it! \'twas a glorious time!"\n\nThe count came back from the bath, all ruddy, and with his hair wet, and\nwent directly to No. 7, where the cavalryman was already sitting in his\ndressing-gown, with his pipe, and thinking with delight and some little\nanxiety of the good fortune that had befallen him in sharing his room with\nthe famous Turbin. "Well, now," the thought came into his head, "suppose he\nshould take me, and strip me naked, and carry me outside the town limits,\nand set me down in the snow, ... or smear me with tar ... or simply ...\nBut, no: he would not do such a thing to a comrade," he said, trying to\ncomfort himself.\n\n"Sashka, give Bluecher something to eat," cried the count.\n\nSashka made his appearance. He had been drinking glasses of vodka ever\nsince his arrival, and was beginning to be genuinely tipsy.\n\n"You have not been able to control yourself. You have been getting drunk,\n_canaillya_!... Feed Bluecher."\n\n"It won\'t kill him to fast.... You see, ... he\'s so plump," replied Sashka,\ncaressing the dog.\n\n"Now, none of your impudence. Go, and feed him."\n\n"All you care for is to have your dog fat; but if a man drinks a little\nglass, then you pitch into him."\n\n"Hey! I\'ll strike you," cried the count with a voice that made the\nwindow-panes rattle, and even scared the cavalryman somewhat.\n\n"You would better ask if _Sashka_ has had any thing to eat to-day. All\nright, strike away, if a dog is more to you than a man," continued Sashka.\n\nBut at that instant he received such a violent blow of the fist across the\nface that he staggered, struck his head against the partition, and,\nclutching his nose, leaped through the door, and threw himself down on a\nbench in the corridor.\n\n"He has broken my teeth," he growled, wiping his bloody nose with one hand,\nand with the other scratching Bluecher\'s back, as the dog licked him. "He\nhas broken my teeth, Bluechka; and yet he is my count, and I would jump into\nthe fire for him, that\'s a fact. Because he\'s my count, do you understand,\nBluechka? And do you want something to eat?"\n\nAfter lying there a while, he got up, gave the dog his dinner, and, almost\nsobered, went to serve his master, and get him his tea.\n\n"You would simply offend me," said the cavalryman timidly, standing in\nfront of the count, who was lying on the bed with his feet propped against\nthe partition. "Now, you see, I am an old soldier and comrade, I may say;\ninstead of letting you borrow of any one else, it would give me great\npleasure to let you have two hundred rubles. I haven\'t them with me\nnow,--only a hundred,--but I can get the rest to-day; don\'t refuse, you\nwould simply offend me, count!"\n\n"Thanks, little father," said Turbin, instantly perceiving what sort of\nrelationship would exist between them, and slapping the cavalryman on the\nshoulder. "Thanks. Well, then, we\'ll go to the ball if you say so. But now\nwhat shall we do? Tell me whom you have in your city: any pretty girls?\nanybody ready for a spree? Who plays cards?"\n\nThe cavalryman explained that there would be a crowd of pretty girls at the\nball; that the police commissioner,[59] Kolkof, who had just been\nre-elected, was the greatest hand for sprees, only he lacked the spirit of\na genuine hussar, but still was a first-rate fellow; that Ilyushka\'s chorus\nof gypsies had been singing at K. ever since the elections began; that\nStioshka[60] was the soloist, and that after the marshal\'s reception\neverybody went there nowadays. And the stakes were pretty high. "Lukhnof, a\nvisitor here," he said, "is sweeping in the money; and Ilyin, a cornet of\nuhlans, who rooms in No. 8, has already lost a pile. The game has already\nbegun there. They play there every evening; and he\'s a wonderfully fine\nyoung fellow, I tell you, count, this Ilyin is. There\'s nothing mean about\nhim--he\'d give you his last shirt."\n\n[Footnote 59: ispravnik.]\n\n[Footnote 60: Diminutive of Stepanida, Stephanie.]\n\n"Then let us go to his room. We will see what sort of men you have," said\nthe count.\n\n"Come on! come on! they will be mighty glad."\n\n\nII.\n\nIlyin, the cornet of uhlans, had not long been awake. The evening before,\nhe had sat down at the gambling-table at eight o\'clock, and lost for\nfifteen consecutive hours, till eleven o\'clock that day. He had lost a\ngreat amount, but exactly how much he did not know, because he had had\nthree thousand rubles of his money, and fifteen thousand belonging to the\ntreasury, which he had long ago mixed up with his own, and he did not dare\nto settle his accounts lest his anticipations that he had made too great\ninroads on the public money should be confirmed.\n\nHe went to sleep about noon, and slept that heavy, dreamless sleep,\npeculiar to very young men who have been losing heavily. Waking at six,\nabout the time that Count Turbin had arrived at the hotel, and seeing cards\nand chalk and soiled tables scattered around him in confusion in the room,\nhe remembered with horror the evening\'s games, and the last card, a knave,\nwhich had lost him five hundred rubles; but, still scarcely believing in\nthe reality, he drew out from under his pillow his money, and began to\ncount it. He recognized a few notes which, with corners turned down and\nindorsements, had gone from hand to hand around the table; he remembered\nall the particulars. He had lost his own three thousand rubles, and\ntwenty-five hundred belonging to the treasury had disappeared.\n\nThe uhlan had been playing for four nights in succession.\n\nHe had come from Moscow, where the public money had been intrusted to him.\nAt K. the post-superintendent had detained him under the pretext that there\nwere no post-horses, but in reality in accordance with his agreement with\nthe hotel-keeper to detain all visitors for a day.\n\nThe uhlan, who was a gay young fellow, and had just received from his\nparent three thousand rubles for his military equipment, was glad to spend\na few days in the city of K. during the elections, and counted on having a\ngood time.\n\nHe knew a landed proprietor whose family lived there, and he was preparing\nto call upon him and pay his addresses to his daughter, when the cavalryman\nappeared, and made his acquaintance. That very evening, without malice\nprepense, he took him down into the parlor, and introduced him to his\nfriends, Lukhnof and several other gamblers. From that time, the uhlan had\nkept steadily at gaming, and not only had not called on the proprietor, but\nhad not thought of inquiring further for horses, and for four days had not\nleft his room.\n\nAfter he had dressed, and taken his tea, he went to the window. He felt an\ninclination to go out so as to dispel the importunate recollections of the\ngame. He put on his cloak, and went into the street.\n\nThe sun had just sunk behind the white houses with their red roofs. It was\nalready twilight. It was warm. The snow was softly falling in big, damp\nflakes, in the muddy streets. His mind suddenly became filled with\nunendurable melancholy at the thought that he had spent all that day in\nsleep, and now the day was done.\n\n"This day which has gone, will never come back again," he said to himself.\n\n"I have wasted my youth," he suddenly exclaimed, not because he really felt\nthat he had wasted his youth,--he did not think about it at all,--but\nsimply this phrase came into his head.\n\n"What shall I do now?" he reasoned; "borrow of some one, and go away?"\n\nA lady was passing along the sidewalk.\n\n"What a stupid woman!" he said to himself for some reason.\n\n"There\'s no one I can borrow of. I have wasted my youth."\n\nHe came to a block of stores. A merchant in a fox-skin shuba was standing\nat the door of his shop, and inviting custom.\n\n"If I hadn\'t taken the eight, I should have won."\n\nA little old beggar-woman followed him, snivelling.\n\n"I have no one to borrow of."\n\nA gentleman in a bear-skin shuba passed him. A policeman was standing on\nthe corner.\n\n"What can I do that will make sensation? Fire a pistol at them? No! That\nwould be stupid. I have wasted my youth. _Akh!_ what a splendid harness\nthat is hanging in that shop! I should like to be riding behind a\ntroika!... _Ekh!_ you fine fellows![61] I am going back. Lukhnof will be\nthere pretty soon, and we\'ll have a game."\n\n[Footnote 61: _golubchiki_, little pigeons.]\n\nHe returned to the hotel, and once more counted his money. No, he was not\nmistaken the first time; twenty-five hundred rubles of public money were\nmissing, just as before.\n\n"I will put up twenty-five rubles first; the next time, a quarter stake;\nthen on seven, on fifteen, on thirty, and on sixty ... three thousand. I\nwill buy that harness, and start. He won\'t give me any odds, the villain!\nI have wasted my youth!"\n\nThis was what was passing through the uhlan\'s mind just as Lukhnof himself\ncame into the room.\n\n"Well, have you been up long, Mikhailo Vasilyitch?" inquired Lukhnof,\ndeliberately removing from his thin nose his gold eye-glasses, and\ncarefully wiping them with a red silk handkerchief.\n\n"No, only just this minute. I had a splendid sleep!"\n\n"A new hussar has just come. He is staying with Zavalshevsky. Had you heard\nabout it?"\n\n"No, I hadn\'t. Well, no one seems to be here yet. I believe they have gone\nto call on Priakhin. They\'ll be here very soon."\n\nIn fact, in a short time there came into the room an officer of the\ngarrison, who was always hovering round Lukhnof; a Greek merchant with a\nhuge hooked nose, cinnamon complexion, and deep-set black eyes; a stout,\npuffy proprietor, a brandy-distiller who gambled all night long, and always\nmade his stakes on the basis of half a ruble. All of these wished to begin\nplaying as promptly as possible, but the more daring players said nothing\nabout it; Lukhnof, in particular, with perfect equanimity, told stories of\nrascality in Moscow.\n\n"Just think of it," said he, "Moscow, the metropolis, the capital; and\nthere they go out at night with crooks, dressed like demons; and they scare\nthe stupid people, and rob pedestrians, and that is the end of it. Do the\npolice notice it? No! It is astonishing!"\n\nThe uhlan listened attentively to the tales of these highwaymen, but\nfinally got up and unobtrusively ordered cards to be brought. The stout\nproprietor was the first to notice it.\n\n"Well, gentlemen, we are wasting golden moments. To work, let us to work!"\n\n"Yes, you won by the half-ruble last evening, and so you like it,"\nexclaimed the Greek.\n\n"It\'s a good time to begin," said the garrison officer.\n\nIlyin looked at Lukhnof. Lukhnof, returning his gaze, went on calmly with\nhis story of the robbers who dressed themselves up like devils. "Will you\nstart the bank?" asked the uhlan.\n\n"Isn\'t it rather early?"\n\n"Byelof!" cried the uhlan, reddening for some reason or other; "bring me\nsomething to eat.... I haven\'t had any dinner to-day, gentlemen. Bring some\nchampagne, and distribute the cards."\n\nA this moment, the count and Zavalshevsky entered. It proved that Turbin\nand Ilyin were in the same division. They immediately struck up an\nacquaintance, drank a glass of champagne, clinking their glasses together,\nand in five minutes were calling each other "thou."\n\nIt was evident that Ilyin made a very pleasant impression on the count. The\ncount smiled whenever he looked at him, and was amused at his freshness.\n\n"What a fine young uhlan!" he said, "what a mustache! what a splendid\nmustache!"\n\nIlyin\'s upper lip bore the first down of a mustache, that was as yet almost\nwhite.\n\n"You were preparing to play, were you not?" asked the count. "Well, I\nshould like to win from you, Ilyin. I think that you must be a master," he\nadded smiling.\n\n"Yes, we were just starting in," replied Lukhnof, opening a pack of\ncards.... "Aren\'t you going to join us, count?"\n\n"No, I won\'t to-night. If I did there wouldn\'t be any thing left of any of\nyou! When I take a hand I always break the bank. But I haven\'t any money\njust now. I lost at Volotchok, at the station-house. It was by some sort of\ninfantry-man who wore rings; what a cheat he was! and he cleaned me out\ncompletely."\n\n"Were you long there at the station?" asked Ilyin.\n\n"I staid there twenty-two hours. I shall not forget that station, curse it!\nand the superintendent won\'t forget it either."\n\n"Why?"\n\n"I got there, you see; the superintendent comes out, rascally face, the\nliar! \'There are no horses,\' said he. Well, now I must tell you, I have\nmade a rule in such cases: when there are no horses, I keep on my shuba,\nand go straight to the superintendent\'s room,--not the waiting-room, mind\nyou, but the superintendent\'s own room,--and I have all the windows and\ndoors opened, as though it were stifling. Well, that\'s what I did here.\nCold! you remember how cold it has been this last month; twenty degrees\nbelow. The superintendent began to remonstrate. I knock his teeth in for\nhim. There was some old woman there; and some young girls and\npeasant-women[62] set up a piping, were going to seize their pots and fly\nto the village.... I go to the door, and say, \'Let me have horses, and I\'ll\ngo away: if you don\'t, I won\'t let you out, I\'ll freeze you all to death.\'"\n\n[Footnote 62: _babas._]\n\n"What an admirable way!" said the puffy proprietor, bursting out into a\nlaugh. "That\'s the way one would freeze out cockroaches."\n\n"But I wasn\'t sufficiently on my guard: the superintendent and all his\nwomen managed to get out and run away. Only the old woman remained on the\noven as my hostage. She kept sniffing, and offering prayers to God. Then we\nentered into negotiations. The superintendent came back, and, standing at a\ndistance, tried to persuade me to let the old woman go. But I set Bluecher\non him: Bluecher is a magnificent dog to take care of superintendents. Even\nthen the rascal did not let me have horses till the next morning. And then\ncame along that footpad! I went into the next room, and began to play. Have\nyou seen Bluecher?--Bluecher! _Fiu_!" Bluecher came running in. The players\nreceived him with flattering attention, although it was evident that they\nwere anxious to get to work at entirely different matters.\n\n"By the way, gentlemen, why don\'t you begin your game? I beg of you, don\'t\nlet me interfere with you. You see I am a chatterbox," said Turbin.\n"_Whether you love or not_, \'tis an excellent thing."\n\n\nIII.\n\nLukhnof took two candles, brought out a huge dark-colored pocket-book full\nof money; slowly, as though performing some sacrament, opened it on the\ntable; took out two one-hundred-ruble notes, and laid them on the cards.\n\n"There, just the same as last evening; the bank begins with two hundred,"\nsaid he, adjusting his glasses, and opening a pack of cards.\n\n"Very well," said Ilyin, not glancing at him, or interrupting his\nconversation with Turbin.\n\nThe game began. Lukhnof kept the bank with mechanical regularity,\noccasionally pausing, and deliberately making notes, or looking sternly\nover his glasses, and saying in a weak voice, "Throw."\n\nThe stout proprietor talked louder than the rest, making various\ncalculations at the top of his voice, while he wet his clumsy fingers and\ndog-eared his cards.\n\nThe garrison officer silently wrote in a fine hand his account on a card,\nturned down small corners, pressing them against the table.\n\nThe Greek sat next the banker, attentively following the game with his deep\nblack eyes, as though waiting for something.\n\nZavalshevsky, as he stood by the table, would suddenly become all of a\ntremble, draw from his trousers-pocket a blue note or a red,[63] lay a card\non it, pound on it with his palm, and say, "Bring me luck, little seven!"\nthen he would bite his mustache, change from one leg to the other, and be\nin a continual state of excitement until the card came out.\n\n[Footnote 63: Five or ten rubles.]\n\nIlyin, who had been eating veal and cucumbers placed near him on the\nhaircloth sofa, briskly wiped his hands on his coat, and began to put down\none card after another.\n\nTurbin, who had taken his seat at first on the sofa, immediately noticed\nthat something was wrong. Lukhnof did not look at the uhlan, or say any\nthing to him; but occasionally his eyes for an instant rested on the\nuhlan\'s hands. The most of his cards lost.\n\n"If I could only trump that little card," exclaimed Lukhnof in reference to\none of the stout proprietor\'s cards. He was still making half-ruble wagers.\n\n"Trump Ilyin\'s instead: what would be the use of trumping mine?" replied\nthe proprietor.\n\nAnd, in point of fact, Ilyin\'s cards were trumped oftener than the others\'.\nHe nervously tore up his losing card under the table, and with trembling\nhands chose another.\n\nTurbin arose from the sofa, and asked the Greek to give him his place next\nthe banker. The Greek changed places; and the count, taking his chair, and\nnot moving his eyes, began to watch Lukhnof\'s hands attentively.\n\n"Ilyin," said he suddenly in his ordinary voice, which, entirely contrary\nto his desire, drowned out the others, "why do you stick to those routine\ncards? You don\'t know how to play!"\n\n"Supposing I don\'t, it\'s all the same."\n\n"You\'ll lose that way surely. Let me play against the bank for you."\n\n"No, excuse me, I beg of you. I\'m always this way. Play for yourself if you\nlike."\n\n"I have told you that I am not going to play. But I should like to play for\nyou. I hate to see you losing so."\n\n"Ah, well! you see it\'s my luck."\n\nThe count said nothing more, and leaning on his elbow began once more to\nwatch the banker\'s hand just as attentively as before.\n\n"Shameful!" he suddenly cried in a loud voice, dwelling on the word.\n\nLukhnof glared at him.\n\n"Shameful, shameful!" he repeated still louder, staring straight into\nLukhnof\'s eyes.\n\nThe game continued.\n\n"That is not right!" said Turbin again, as Lukhnof trumped one of Ilyin\'s\nhigh cards.\n\n"What displeases you, count?" politely asked the banker with an air of\nindifference.\n\n"Because you give Ilyin a simplum, and turn down your corners. That\'s what\nis shameful!"\n\nLukhnof made a slight motion with his shoulders and brows, signifying that\nhe was resigned to any fate, and then he went on with the game.\n\n"Bluecher, _fiu_!" cried the count, rising; "over with him!" he added\nquickly. Bluecher, bumping against the sofa with his back, and almost\nknocking the garrison officer from his feet, came leaping toward his\nmaster, looking at every one and wagging his tail as though he would ask,\n"Who is misbehaving here, hey?"\n\nLukhnof laid down the cards, and moved his chair away. "This is no way to\nplay," said he. "I detest dogs. What kind of a game can you have if a whole\npack of hounds is to be brought in?"\n\n"Especially that kind of dog: they are called blood-suckers, if I am not\nmistaken," suggested the garrison officer.\n\n"Well, are we to play or not, Mikhailo Vasilyitch?" asked Lukhnof,\naddressing the uhlan.\n\n"Don\'t bother us, count, I beg of you," said Ilyin, turning to Turbin.\n\n"Come here for a moment," said Turbin, taking Ilyin\'s arm, and drawing him\ninto the next room.\n\nThere the count\'s words were perfectly audible, though he spoke in his\nordinary tone. But his voice was so powerful that it could always be heard\nthree rooms off.\n\n"Are you beside yourself? Don\'t you see that that man with the glasses is a\ncheat of the worst order?"\n\n"Hey? Nonsense! Be careful what you say."\n\n"No nonsense! but quit it, I tell you. It makes no difference to me.\nAnother time I myself would have plucked you; but now I am sorry to see you\nruining yourself. Have you any public money left?"\n\n"No. What makes you think so about him?"\n\n"Brother, I have been over this same road, and I know the ways of these\nprofessional gamblers. I tell you that the man in the glasses is a cheat.\nQuit, please. I ask you as a comrade."\n\n"All right; I\'ll have just one more hand, and then have done with it."\n\n"I know what that \'one more\' means: very well, we will see."\n\nThey returned to the gaming-table. In one deal he laid down so many cards,\nand they were trumped so badly, that he lost a large amount.\n\nTurbin rested his hand in the middle of the table, and said, "That\'s\nenough! now let us be going."\n\n"No, I can\'t go yet; leave me, please," said Ilyin in vexation, shuffling\nthe bent cards and not looking at Turbin.\n\n"All right! the Devil be with you! Lose all you\'ve got, if that please you;\nbut it\'s time for me to be going.--Come, Zavalshevsky, let us go to the\nmarshal\'s."\n\nAnd they went out. No one spoke, and Lukhnof did not make the bank until\nthe noise of their feet and of Bluecher\'s paws had died away down the\ncorridor.\n\n"That\'s a madcap," said the proprietor, smiling.\n\n"Well, now he won\'t bother us any more," said the garrison officer in a\nhurried whisper.\n\nAnd the game went on.\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe band, composed of the marshal\'s domestic serfs, were stationed in the\nbutler\'s pantry, which had been put in order on account of the ball, and,\nhaving turned up the sleeves of their coats, had begun at the signal of\ntheir leader to play the ancient polonaise "Aleksandr, Yelisavieta;" and\nunder the soft, brilliant light of the wax candles, the couples began to\nmove in tripping measure through the great ballroom; a governor-general of\nCatherine\'s time, with a star, taking out the gaunt wife of the marshal,\nthe marshal with the governor\'s wife, and so on through all the hierarchy\nof the government in various combinations and variations,--when\nZavalshevsky in a blue coat with a huge collar, and epaulets on his\nshoulders, and wearing stockings and pumps, and exhaling about him an odor\nof jasmine with which he had plentifully drenched his mustaches, the\nfacings of his coat, and his handkerchief, entered with the handsome count,\nwho wore tight-fitting blue trousers and a red pelisse embroidered with\ngold, and wearing on his breast the cross of Vladimir and a medal of 1812.\n\nThe count was of medium height, but had an extremely handsome figure. His\nclear blue eyes of remarkable brilliancy, and dark hair which was rather\nlong and fell in thick ringlets, gave his beauty a peculiar character.\n\nThe count\'s presence at the ball was not unexpected. The handsome young\nman who had seen him at the hotel had already spoken of him to the marshal.\n\nThe impressions made by this announcement were of various kinds, but on the\nwhole were not altogether pleasant.\n\n"I suppose this young man will turn us into ridicule," was what the old\nwomen and the men said to themselves.\n\n"Suppose he should run off with me," was what the wives and young ladies\nthought, with more or less apprehension.\n\nAs soon as the polonaise was finished, and the couples had made each other\nlow bows, once more the women formed little groups by themselves, and the\nmen by themselves. Zavalshevsky, proud and happy, led the count up to the\nhostess.\n\nThe marshal\'s wife, conscious of a certain inward trepidation lest this\nhussar should make her the cause of some scandal before everybody, said\nproudly and scornfully, as she turned away, "Very glad to see you. I hope\nthat you will dance." And then she looked at the count mistrustfully with\nan expression that seemed to say, "Now, if you insult any woman, then you\nare a perfect scoundrel after this."\n\nThe count, however, quickly overcame this prejudice by his amiability, his\npoliteness, and his handsome jovial appearance; so that in five minutes the\nexpression on the face of the marshal\'s wife plainly declared to all who\nstood around her, "I know how to manage all these men. He immediately\nrealized whom he was talking with. And now he will be charming to me all\nthe rest of the evening."\n\nMoreover, just then the governor, who had known his father, came up to the\ncount, and very graciously drew him to one side, and entered into\nconversation with him, which still more pleased the fashionable society of\nthe town, and raised the count in their estimation.\n\nThen Zavalshevsky presented the count to his sister, a plump young widow,\nwho, ever since the count entered the room, had kept her big black eyes\nfastened upon him.\n\nThe count asked the little widow for the waltz which at that moment the\nmusicians had struck up, and it was his artistic dancing that conquered the\nlast vestiges of the popular prejudice.\n\n"Ah, he\'s a master at dancing!" said a stout lady, following the legs in\nblue trousers which were flashing through the ballroom, and mentally\ncounting, "One, two, three; one, two, three,--he\'s a master."\n\n"How gracefully he moves his feet! how gracefully!" said another guest, who\ndid not stand very high in the governmental society. "How does he manage to\nnot hit any one with his spurs? Wonderful, very skilful!"\n\nThe count, by his skill in dancing, eclipsed the three best dancers of the\ncity. These were, a governor\'s aide, a tall albino, who was famous for his\nrapid dancing and because he held the lady pressed very close to his\nbreast; secondly, the cavalryman, who was famous for his graceful swaying\nduring the waltz, and for his frequent but light tapping with his heels;\nand thirdly, a civilian of whom everybody said, that, though he was not\nvery strong-minded, yet he was an admirable dancer and the life of all\nballs.\n\nIn point of fact, this civilian from the beginning to the end of a ball\ninvariably invited all the ladies in the order in which they sat, did not\ncease for a moment to dance, and only occasionally paused to wipe his\nweary but still radiant face with his cambric handkerchief, which would\nbecome wet through.\n\nThe count had surpassed them all, and had danced with the three principal\nladies,--with the stout one, who was rich, handsome, and stupid; with the\nmiddle-sized one, who was lean, and not particularly good-looking, but\nhandsomely dressed; and with the little one, who was not pretty, but very\nwitty.\n\nHe had danced also with others,--with all the pretty women, and there were\nmany pretty women there.\n\nBut the little widow, Zavalshevsky\'s sister, pleased the count more than\nall the rest; with her he danced a quadrille and a schottische and a\nmazurka.\n\nAt first, when they took their places for the quadrille, he overwhelmed her\nwith compliments, comparing her to Venus and Diana, and to a rosebush, and\nto some other flower besides.\n\nTo all these amenities the little widow only bent her white neck, modestly\ndropped her eyes, and, looking at her white muslin dress, changed her fan\nfrom one hand to the other.\n\nWhen, at last, she said, "This is too much, count; you are jesting," etc.,\nher voice, which was rather guttural, betrayed such _naive_ simplicity of\nheart and amusing naturalness that the count, as he looked at her, actually\ncompared her, not to a flower or to a rosebush, but to some kind of a\npinkish-white wild-flower, exuberant and odorless, growing alone on a\nvirgin snow-drift in some far, far-distant land.\n\nSuch a strange impression was made upon the count by this union of\n_naivete_ and unconventionality together with fresh beauty, that several\ntimes, in the pauses of the conversation, when he looked silently into her\neyes or contemplated the loveliness of her arms and neck, the desire came\nover him with such vehemence to take her into his arms and kiss her again\nand again, that he was really obliged to restrain himself.\n\nThe little widow was quite satisfied with the impression which she\nperceived that she had made; but there was something in the count\'s\nbehavior that began to disquiet her, and fill her with apprehensions,\nthough the young hussar was not only flatteringly amiable, but even, to an\nextravagant degree, deferential in his treatment of her.\n\nHe ran to get orgeat for her, picked up her handkerchief, snatched a chair\nfrom the hands of a scrofulous young proprietor, who was also anxious to\npay her attention, and who was not quick enough. But perceiving that these\nassiduities, which were fashionable at that period, had little effect in\nmaking the lady well-disposed, he began to amuse her by telling her\nridiculous anecdotes: he assured her that he was ready at a moment\'s notice\nto stand on his head, or to crow like a cock, or to jump out of the window,\nor to fling himself into a hole in the ice.\n\nThis procedure was a brilliant success: the little widow became very gay;\nshe rippled with laughter, displaying her marvellous white teeth, and\nbecame entirely satisfied with her cavalier. The count each moment grew\nmore and more enchanted with her, so that at the end of the quadrille he\nwas really in love with her.\n\nAfter the quadrille, when she was approached by her former admirer, a young\nman of eighteen, the son of a very rich proprietor, the same scrofulous\nyoung man from whom Turbin had snatched away the chair, she received him\nwith perfect coolness, and not one-tenth part of the constraint was\nnoticeable in her which she felt when she was with the count.\n\n"You are very kind," she said, all the time gazing at Turbin\'s back, and\nunconsciously reckoning how many yards[64] of gold-lace were used for his\nwhole jacket. "You are very kind; you promised to come to take me for a\nwalk, and to bring me some comfits."\n\n[Footnote 64: _arshins._]\n\n"Well, I did come, Anna Fedorovna, but you weren\'t at home, and I left the\nvery best comfits for you," said the young man, in a voice that was very\nthin, considering his height.\n\n"You always are provided with excuses; I don\'t need your comfits. Please do\nnot think"....\n\n"I begin to see, Anna Fedorovna, how you have changed toward me, and I know\nwhy. But it is not right," he added, but without finishing his remark,\nevidently owing to some powerful interior emotion, which caused his lips to\ntremble strangely.\n\nAnna Fedorovna did not heed him, and continued to follow Turbin with her\neyes. The marshal, at whose house the ball was given,--a big, stout old\nman, who had lost his teeth,--came up to the count, and, taking him by the\narm, invited him into his library to smoke and drink if he so desired.\n\nAs soon as Turbin disappeared, Anna Fedorovna felt that there was\nabsolutely nothing for her to do in the ballroom, and slipping her hand\nthrough the arm of a dried-up old maid, who was a friend of hers, went with\nher into the dressing-room.\n\n"Well, what do you think of him? Is he nice?" asked the old maid.\n\n"Only it\'s terrible--the way he follows you up!" said Anna Fedorovna, going\nto the mirror, and contemplating herself in it.\n\nHer face was aglow, her eyes were full of mischief, her color was\nheightened; then suddenly imitating one of the ballet-dancers whom she had\nseen during election time, she pirouetted round on one toe, and, laughing\nher guttural but sweet laugh, she leaped up in the air, crossing her knees.\n\n"What a man he is! he even asked me for a _souvenir_," she confided to her\nfriend. "But he will ne-e-ver get one," she said, singing the last words,\nand lifting one finger in the lilac-colored glove that reached to her\nelbow.\n\nIn the library where Turbin was conducted by the marshal, stood various\nkinds of vodka, liqueurs, edibles,[65] and champagne. In a cloud of\ntobacco-smoke the nobility were sitting, or walking up and down, talking\nabout the elections.\n\n[Footnote 65: _zakuski._]\n\n"When the whole of the high nobility of our district has honored him with\nan election," exclaimed the newly elected ispravnik who was already\ntolerably tipsy, "he certainly ought not to fail in his duties toward\nsociety in general."\n\nThe conversation was interrupted by the count\'s coming. All were presented\nto him, and the ispravnik especially pressed his hand long between both of\nhis, and asked him several times to go with him after the ball to the new\ntavern, where he would treat the gentlemen of the nobility, and where they\nwould hear the gypsies sing.\n\nThe count accepted his invitation, and drank with him several glasses of\nchampagne.\n\n"Why aren\'t you dancing, gentlemen?" he asked, as he was about to leave the\nlibrary.\n\n"We aren\'t dancers," replied the ispravnik, laughing. "We prefer the wine,\ncount; and besides, all these young ladies have grown up under my eyes,\ncount. But still, I do sometimes take part in a schottische, count. I can\ndo it, count."\n\n"Come on then for a while," said Turbin. "Let us have some sport before we\ngo to the gypsies."\n\n"What say you, gentlemen? Let us come! Let us delight our host!"\n\nAnd the three gentlemen who, since the beginning of the ball, had been\ndrinking in the library and had very red faces, began to draw on their\ngloves, some of black kid, another of knit silk, and were just going with\nthe count to the ballroom, when they were detained by the scrofulous young\nman, who, pale as a sheet, and scarcely able to refrain from tears, came\nstraight up to Turbin.\n\n"You have an idea, because you are a count, you can run into people as if\nyou were at a fair," said he, with difficulty drawing his breath; "hence it\nisn\'t fitting"--\n\nOnce more the stream of his speech was interrupted by the involuntary\ntrembling of his lips.\n\n"What?" cried Turbin, frowning suddenly, "what?... You\'re a baby," he\ncried, seizing him by the arm, and squeezing it so that the blood rushed to\nthe young man\'s head, not so much from vexation as from fright. "What is\nit? Do you want to fight? If so, I am at your service."\n\nTurbin had scarcely let go of his arm, which he had squeezed so powerfully,\nwhen two nobles seized the young man by the sleeve, and carried him off\nthrough a back door.\n\n"What! have you lost your wits? You\'ve surely been drinking too much. We\nshall have to tell your papa. What\'s the matter with you?" they asked.\n\n"No, I haven\'t been drinking; but he ran into me, and did not apologize.\nHe\'s a hog, that\'s what he is," whined the young man, now actually in\ntears.\n\nNevertheless they paid no attention to him, but carried him off home.\n\n"Never mind, count," said the ispravnik and Zavalshevsky assuringly. "He\'s\na mere child. They still whip him: he\'s only sixteen years old. It\'s hard\nto tell what is to be done with him. What fly stung him? And his father is\nsuch an honorable man! He\'s our candidate."\n\n"Well, the Devil take him if he refuses"....\n\nAnd the count returned to the ballroom, and, as gayly as before, danced the\nschottische with the pretty little widow, and laughed heartily when he saw\nthe antics of the gentlemen who had come with him out of the library. There\nwas a general burst of merriment all through the ballroom when the\nispravnik tripped, and measured his length on the floor in the midst of the\ndancers.\n\n\nV.\n\nAnna Fedorovna, while the count was in the library, went to her brother,\nand, for the very reason of her conviction that she ought to pretend to\nfeel very little interest in the count, she began to question him.\n\n"Who is this hussar that has been dancing with me? Tell me, brother."\n\nThe cavalryman explained, to the best of his ability, what a great man this\nhussar was, and in addition he told his sister that the count had stopped\nthere simply because his money had been stolen on the route: he himself had\nloaned him a hundred rubles, but that was not enough. Couldn\'t his sister\nlet him have two hundred more? Zavalshevsky asked her not to say any thing\nabout this to any one, and, above all, not to the count.\n\nAnna Fedorovna promised to send the money the next day, and to keep it a\nsecret; but somehow or other, during the schottische, she had a terrible\ndesire to offer the count as much money as he needed.\n\nShe deliberated, blushed, and at last, mastering her confusion, thus\naddressed herself to the task:--\n\n"My brother told me, count, that you had met with a misfortune on the road,\nand hadn\'t any money. Now, if you need some, wouldn\'t you take some of me?\nI should be terribly glad."\n\nBut after she had thus spoken, Anna Fedorovna suddenly was overcome with\nfright, and blushed. All the gayety had instantly vanished from the\ncount\'s face.\n\n"Your brother is a fool!" said he in a cutting tone. "You know, when a man\ninsults a man, then they fight a duel; but when a woman insults a man, then\nwhat do they do? Do you know?"\n\nPoor Anna Fedorovna blushed to her ears with confusion. She dropped her\neyes, and made no reply.\n\n"They kiss the woman in public," said the count softly, bending over to\nwhisper in her ear. "Permit me, however, to kiss your little hand," he\nadded almost inaudibly, after a long silence, having some pity on his\nlady\'s confusion.\n\n"Ah! only not quite yet," urged Anna Fedorovna, with a deep sigh.\n\n"But when, then? To-morrow I am going away early.... But really, you owe it\nto me."\n\n"Well, then, of course it is impossible," said Anna Fedorovna smiling.\n\n"Only give me a chance to see you before to-morrow, so that I may kiss your\nhand. I will find one."\n\n"How will you find one?"\n\n"That is my affair. I can do any thing to see you.... Is it agreed?"\n\n"Agreed."\n\nThe schottische came to an end; they danced through the mazurka, and in it\nthe count did marvels, purloining handkerchiefs, bending on one knee, and\nclinking his spurs in an extraordinary manner, after the Warsaw style, so\nthat all the old men came from their _boston_ to look into the ballroom;\nand the cavalryman who was the best dancer confessed himself outdone. After\nthey had eaten supper, they danced still the _gross vater_, and began to\ndisperse.\n\nThe count all this time did not take his eyes from the little widow. He had\nnot been insincere when he declared his readiness to throw himself into a\nhole in the ice.\n\nWhether it was caprice or love or stubbornness, but that evening all the\nstrength of his mind had been concentrated into one desire,--to see and to\nlove her.\n\nAs soon as he perceived that Anna Fedorovna was taking her farewell of the\nhostess, he hastened to the servants\' quarters, and thence, without his\nshuba, to the place where the carriages were drawn up.\n\n"Anna Fedorovna Zaitsova\'s equipage," he cried.\n\nA high four-seated carriage with lanterns moved out, and started to drive\nup to the doorstep.\n\n"Stop!" shouted the count to the coachman, rushing up toward the carriage\nthrough snow that was knee-deep.\n\n"What is wanted?" called the driver.\n\n"I want to get into the carriage," replied the count, opening the door as\nthe carriage moved, and trying to climb in.\n\n"Stop, you devil! stupid! Vaska![66] stop!" cried the coachman to the\npostilion, and reining in the horses. "What are you getting into another\nperson\'s carriage for? This belongs to the Lady Anna Fedorovna, and not to\nyour grace."\n\n[Footnote 66: Diminutive of Vasili.]\n\n"Hush up, blockhead! _Na!_ there\'s a ruble for you; now come down and shut\nthe door!" said the count.\n\nBut as the coachman did not move, he lifted the steps himself, and,\nshutting the window, managed to pull the door to.\n\nIn this, as in all ancient carriages, especially those upholstered in\nyellow galloon, there was an odor of mustiness and burnt bristles.\n\nThe count\'s legs were wet to the knees from melting snow, and almost\nfreezing in his thin boots and trousers; and his whole body was penetrated\nby a cold like that of winter.\n\nThe coachman was grumbling on his box, and seemed to be getting ready to\nget down. But the count heard nothing and felt nothing. His face was aglow,\nhis heart was beating violently. He convulsively clutched the yellow strap,\nthrust his head out of the side-window, and his whole being was\nconcentrated in expectation.\n\nHe was not doomed to wait long. At the door-steps, they shouted,\n"Zaitsova\'s carriage!" The coachman shook his reins, the carriage swung on\nits high springs; the lighted windows of the house passed one after another\nby the carriage-windows.\n\n"See here, rogue, if you tell the lackey that I am here," said the count,\nthrusting his head through the front window, and addressing the coachman,\n"you\'ll feel my whip; but if you hold your tongue, I will give you ten\nrubles more."\n\nHe had scarcely time to close the window, when the carriage shook again\nstill more violently, and then the wheels came to a stop.\n\nHe drew back as far as possible into the corner; he ceased to breathe; he\neven shut his eyes, so apprehensive was he, lest his passionate expectation\nshould be disappointed.\n\nThe door was opened; one after the other, with a creak, the steps were let\ndown; a woman\'s dress rustled, and the close atmosphere of the carriage\nwas impregnated by the odor of jasmine; a woman\'s dainty feet hurried up\nthe steps, and Anna Fedorovna, brushing against the count\'s leg with the\nskirt of her cloak, which was loosely thrown about her, silently, and with\na deep sigh, took her place on the cushioned seat next him.\n\nWhether she saw him or not, no one could decide, not even Anna Fedorovna\nherself: but when he took her hand, and said, "Now I will kiss your little\nhand anyway," she evinced very little dismay. She said nothing, but let him\ntake her hand, which he covered with kisses, not stopping at the glove.\n\nThe carriage rolled off.\n\n"Tell me something. You are not angry?" said he to her.\n\nShe silently sank back into her corner, but suddenly, for some reason or\nother, burst into tears, and let her head fall on his breast.\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe newly elected ispravnik, with his company, the cavalryman, and other\nmembers of the nobility, had already been listening for some time to the\ngypsies, and drinking at the new tavern, when the count, in a blue-lined\nbear-skin shuba which had belonged to Anna Fedorovna\'s late husband, joined\nthem.\n\n"Little father, your excellency! we have almost given up expecting you,"\nsaid a squint-eyed black gypsy with brilliant teeth, who met him in the\nentry and divested him of his shuba. "We haven\'t met since we were at\nLebedyan.... Stioshka has pined away on account of you."\n\nStioshka, a slender young gypsy-girl[67] with a cherry red bloom on her\ncinnamon-colored cheeks, with brilliant deep black eyes, shaded by long\neyelashes, also hurried to meet him.\n\n"Ah! dear little count![68] my sweetheart! This is a pleasure," she\nexclaimed through her teeth, with a joyous smile.\n\n[Footnote 67: _tsiganotchka._]\n\n[Footnote 68: _grafchik! golubchik!_]\n\nIlyushka himself came to greet Turbin, pretending that he was very glad to\nsee him. The old women, the wives, the young girls, hastened to the spot\nand surrounded the guest.\n\nOne would have said that he was a relative or a god-brother to them.\n\nTurbin kissed all the young gypsy girls on the lips; the old women and the\nmen kissed him on the shoulder or on the hand.\n\nThe gentlemen were also very glad of the count\'s arrival; the more because\nthe festivity, having passed its apogee, was now becoming tame; every one\nbegan to feel a sense of satiety. The wine, having lost its exhilarating\neffect on the nerves, only served to load the stomach. Everybody had\ndischarged the last cannon of his wildness, and was looking around moodily.\nAll the songs had been sung, and ran in the heads of each, leaving a mere\nimpression of noise and confusion.\n\nWhatever any one did that was strange and wild, the rest began to look upon\nit as nothing very entertaining or amusing.\n\nThe ispravnik stretched out on the floor in shameless fashion at the feet\nof some old woman, kicked his leg in the air, and began to cry,--\n\n"Champagne!... The count has come!... Champagne!... He has come!... Now\ngive us champagne!... I will make a bath of champagne, and swim in it!\nGentlemen of the nobility, I love your admirable society!... Stioshka, sing\n\'The Narrow Road.\'"\n\nThe cavalryman was also very gay, but in a different fashion. He was\nsitting in a corner of a sofa with a tall, handsome gypsy, Liubasha; and\nwith the consciousness that intoxication was beginning to cloud his eyes,\nhe kept blinking them, and swinging his head, and repeating the same words\nover and over again: he was proposing in a whisper to the gypsy to fly with\nhim somewhere.\n\nLiubasha, smiling, listened to him as though what he said were very amusing\nto her, and at the same time rather melancholy. Occasionally she cast her\nglances at her husband, the squint-eyed Sashka, who was standing behind a\nchair near her. In reply to the cavalryman\'s declaration of love, she bent\nover to his ear, and begged him to buy her some perfume and a ribbon\nwithout any one knowing it, so that the others should not see it.\n\n"Hurrah!" cried the cavalryman when the count came in.\n\nThe handsome young man, with an expression of anxiety, was walking up and\ndown the room with solicitously steady steps, and humming an air from the\n"Revolt in the Seraglio."\n\nAn old _paterfamilias_, dragged out to see the gypsies through the\nirresistible entreaties of the gentlemen of the nobility, who had told him\nthat if he staid away every thing would go to pieces, and in that case they\nhad better not go, was lying on a sofa where he had stretched himself out\nimmediately on his arrival; and no one paid any attention to him.\n\nA chinovnik, who had been there before, had taken off his coat, was sitting\nwith his legs on the table, and was rumpling up his hair, and thus proving\nthat he understood how to be dissipated.\n\nAs soon as the count came in, the official unbuttoned his shirt-collar, and\nlifted his legs still higher. The count\'s arrival generally gave new life\nto the festivities.\n\nThe gypsy girls, who had been scattered about the room, again formed their\ncircle. The count seated Stioshka, the soloist, on his knee, and ordered\nmore champagne to be brought. Ilyushka, with his guitar, stood in front of\nthe soloist, and began the _plyaska_, that is, the gypsy song and dance,\n"When I walk upon the Street," "Hey! you Hussars," "Do you hear, do you\nunderstand?" and others of the usual order.\n\nStioshka sang splendidly. Her flexible, sonorous contralto, with its deep\nchest notes, her smiles while she was singing, her mischievous, passionate\neyes, and her little foot which involuntarily kept time to the measure of\nthe song, her despairing wail at the end of each couplet,--this all touched\nsome resonant but tender chord. It was evident that she lived only in the\nsong that she was singing.\n\nIlyushka, in his smile, his back, his legs, his whole being, carrying out\nin pantomime the idea expressed in the song, accompanied it on his guitar,\nand, fixing his eyes upon her as though he were hearing her for the first\ntime, attentively and carefully lifted and drooped his head with the rhythm\nof the song.\n\nThen he suddenly straightened himself up as the singer sang the last note,\nand, as though he felt himself superior to every one else in the world,\nwith proud deliberation kicked the guitar, turned it over, stamped his\nfoot, tossed back his locks, and looked at the chorus with a frown.\n\nAll his body, from his neck to his toes, began to dance in every sinew.\n\nAnd twenty powerful, energetic voices, each trying to outdo the other in\nmaking strange and extraordinary noises, were lifted in union.\n\nThe old women sprang down from their chairs, waving their handkerchiefs,\nand showing their teeth, and crying in rhythmic measure, each louder than\nthe other. The bassos, leaning their heads on one side, and swelling their\nnecks, bellowed from behind their chairs.\n\nWhen Stioshka emitted her high notes, Ilyushka brought his guitar nearer to\nher as though trying to aid her; and the handsome young man, in his\nenthusiasm, cried out that now they struck B-flat.\n\nWhen they came to the national dance, the Plyasovaya, and Duniasha, with\nshoulders and bosom shaking, stepped in front of the count, and was passing\non, Turbin leaped from his place, took off his uniform, and, remaining only\nin his red shirt, boldly joined her, keeping up the same measure, and\ncutting with his feet such antics, that the gypsies laughed and exchanged\nglances of approval.\n\nThe ispravnik, who was sitting Turkish fashion, pounded his chest with his\nfist, and cried "_Vivat!_" and then, seizing the count by the leg, began to\ntell him that out of two thousand rubles, he had only five hundred left and\nthat he might do whatever he pleased, if only the count would permit him.\n\nThe old _paterfamilias_ woke up, and wanted to go home, but they would not\nlet him. The handsome young man asked a gypsy girl to waltz with him. The\ncavalryman, anxious to exalt himself by his friendship with the count, got\nup from his corner, and embraced Turbin. "Ah, my turtle-dove!" he cried.\n"Why must you leave us so soon? ha?" The count said nothing, being\nevidently absorbed in thought. "Where did you go? Ah, you rascal, I know\nwhere you went!"\n\nThis familiarity somehow displeased the Count Turbin. Without smiling, he\nlooked in silence into the cavalryman\'s face, and suddenly gave him such a\nterrible and grievous affront that the cavalryman was mortified, and for\nsome time did not know what to make of such an insult, whether it were a\njoke or not a joke. At last he made up his mind that it was a joke; he\nsmiled, and returned to his gypsy, assuring her that he would really marry\nher after Easter.\n\nAnother song was sung, a third, they danced again; the round of gayety was\nkept up, and every one continued to feel gay. There was no end to the\nchampagne.\n\nThe count drank a great deal. His eyes seemed to grow rather moist, but he\ndid not grow dizzy; he danced still better than the rest, spoke without any\nthickness, and even joined in a chorus, and supported Stioshka when she\nsang "The sweet emotion of friendship."\n\nIn the midst of the dance and song the merchant, who kept the hotel, came\nto beg the guests to go home, as it was three o\'clock in the morning.\n\nThe count took the landlord by the throat, and ordered him to dance the\n_prisiadka_. The merchant refused. The count snatched a bottle of\nchampagne, and standing the merchant on his head ordered him to stay so,\nand then amid general hilarity poured the whole bottle over him.\n\nThe dawn was already breaking. All were pale and weary except the count.\n\n"At all events, I must go to Moscow," said he, suddenly rising. "Come with\nme, all of you, to my room, children.... See me off, and let us have some\ntea."\n\nAll accompanied him with the exception of the sleeping proprietor, who\nstill remained there; they piled into three sledges that were waiting at\nthe door, and drove off to the hotel.\n\n\nVII.\n\n"Have the horses put in!" cried the count, as he entered the sitting-room\nof the hotel with all his friends including the gypsies.\n\n"Sashka,--not the gypsy Sashka, but mine,--tell the superintendent that if\nthe horses are poor I will flog him. Now give us some tea. Zavalshevsky,\nmake some tea; I am going to Ilyin\'s; I want to find how things have gone\nwith him," added Turbin; and he went out into the corridor, and directed\nhis steps to the uhlan\'s room.\n\nIlyin was just through playing, and, having lost all his money down to his\nlast kopek, had thrown himself face down on the worn-out haircloth sofa,\nand was picking the hairs out one by one, sticking them in his mouth,\nbiting them into two, and spitting them out again.\n\nTwo tallow candles, one of which was already burnt down to the paper, stood\non the card-cluttered ombre-table, and mingled their feeble rays with the\nmorning light which was beginning to shine through the window.\n\nThe uhlan\'s mind was vacant of all thought: that strange thick fog of the\ngambling-passion muffled all the capabilities of his mind so that there was\nnot even room for regret.\n\nOnce he endeavored to think what was left for him to do, how he should get\naway without a kopek, how he should pay back the fifteen thousand rubles\nof public money that he had lost in gambling, what his colonel would say,\nwhat his mother would say, what his comrades would say; and such fear came\nover him, and such disgust at himself, that, in his anxiety to rid himself\nof the thought of it, he arose and began to walk up and down through the\nroom, trying only to walk on the cracks of the floor; and then once more he\nbegan to recall all the least details of the evening.\n\nHe vividly imagined that he was winning the whole back again: he takes a\nnine, and lays down a king of spades on two thousand rubles; a queen lies\nat the right, at the left an ace, at the right a king of diamonds--and all\nwas lost! but if he had had a six at the right and a king of diamonds at\nthe left, then he would have won it all back, he would have staked all\nagain on P, and would have won back his fifteen thousand rubles, then he\nwould have bought a good pacer of the colonel, an extra pair of horses, and\na phaeton. And what else besides? Ah! indeed it would have been a splendid,\nsplendid thing!\n\nAgain he threw himself down on the sofa, and began to bite the hairs once\nmore.\n\n"Why are they singing songs in No. 7?" he wondered. "It must be, they are\nhaving a jollification in Turbin\'s room. I\'m of a good mind to go there,\nand have a little drink."\n\nJust at this moment the count came in.\n\n"Well, have you been losing, brother, hey?" he cried.\n\n"I will pretend to be asleep, otherwise I shall have to talk with him, and\nI really want to sleep now."\n\nNevertheless Turbin went up to him, and laid his hand caressingly on his\nhead.... "Well, my dear little friend, have you been losing? have you had\nbad luck? Tell me."\n\nIlyin made no reply.\n\nThe count took him by the arm.\n\n"I have been losing. What is it to you?" muttered Ilyin, in a sleepy voice\nexpressing indifference and vexation; he did not change his position.\n\n"Every thing?"\n\n"Well, yes. What harm is there in it? All! What is it to you?"\n\n"Listen: tell me the truth, as to a comrade," said the count, who, under\nthe influence of the wine that he had been drinking, was disposed to be\ntender, and continued to smooth the other\'s hair. "You know I have taken a\nfancy to you. Tell me the truth. If you have lost the public money, I will\nhelp you; if you don\'t, it will be too late.... Was it public money?"\n\nIlyin leaped up from the sofa.\n\n"If you wish me to tell you, don\'t speak to me so, because ... and I beg of\nyou don\'t speak to me.... I will blow my brains out--that\'s the only thing\nthat\'s left for me now!" he exclaimed with genuine despair, letting his\nhead sink into his hands, and bursting into tears, although but the moment\nbefore he had been calmly thinking about his horses.\n\n"_Ekh!_ you\'re a pretty young girl! Well, who might not have the same thing\nhappen to him? It isn\'t as bad as it might be; perhaps we can straighten\nthings out: wait for me here."\n\nThe count hastened from the room.\n\n"Where is the _pomyeshchik_[69] Lukhnof\'s room?" he demanded of the\nhall-boy.\n\n[Footnote 69: Landed proprietor.]\n\nThe hall-boy offered to show the count the way. The count in spite of the\nobjections of the lackey, who said that his master had only just come in\nand was preparing to retire, entered the room.\n\nLukhnof in his dressing-gown was sitting in front of a table, counting over\na number of packages of bank-notes piled up before him. On the table was a\nbottle of Rheinwein, of which he was very fond. He had procured himself\nthis pleasure from his winnings.\n\nColdly, sternly, Lukhnof looked at the count over his glasses, affecting\nnot to recognize him.\n\n"It seems that you do not know me," said the count, proceeding toward the\ntable with resolute steps.\n\nLukhnof recognized the count, and asked,--\n\n"What is your pleasure?"\n\n"I wish to play with you," said Turbin, sitting down on the sofa.\n\n"Now?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Another time I should be most happy, count; but now I am tired, and am\ngetting ready to go to bed. Won\'t you have some wine? It is excellent\nwine."\n\n"But I wish to play with you for a little while _now_."\n\n"I am not prepared to play any more. Maybe some of the other guests will.\n_I will not_, count! I beg of you to excuse me."\n\n"Then you will not?"\n\nLukhnof shrugged his shoulders as though to express his regret at not being\nable to fulfil the count\'s desires.\n\n"Will you not play under any consideration?"\n\nThe same gesture.\n\n"I am very desirous of playing with you.... Say, will you play, or not?"\n\nSilence.\n\n"Will you play?" asked the count a second time.\n\nThe same silence, and a quick glance over his glasses at the count\'s face,\nwhich was beginning to grow sinister.\n\n"Will you play?" cried the count in a loud voice, striking his hand on the\ntable so violently that the bottle of Rheinwein toppled over and the wine\nran out. "You have been cheating, have you not? Will you play? I ask you\nthe third time."\n\n"I have told you, no! This is truly strange, count, ... perfectly\nunjustifiable, to come this way, and put your knife at a man\'s throat,"\nremarked Lukhnof, not lifting his eyes.\n\nA brief silence followed, during which the count\'s face grew paler and\npaler. Suddenly Lukhnof received a terrible blow on the head, which stunned\nhim. He fell back on the divan, trying to grasp the money, and screamed in\na penetratingly despairing tone, such as was scarcely to be expected from\nhim, he was always so calm and imposing in his deportment.\n\nTurbin gathered up the remaining bank-notes that were lying on the table,\npushed away the servant who had come to his master\'s assistance, and with\nquick steps left the room.\n\n"If you wish satisfaction, I am at your service; I shall be in my room for\nhalf an hour yet,--No. 7," added the count, turning back as he reached the\ndoor.\n\n"Villain! thief!" cried a voice from within the room.... "I will have\nsatisfaction at law!"\n\nIlyin, who had not paid any heed to the count\'s promise to help him, was\nstill lying on the sofa in his room, drowned in tears of despair.\n\nThe count\'s caresses and sympathy had awakened him to a consciousness of\nthe reality, and now, amidst the fog of strange thoughts and recollections\nwhich filled his mind, it made itself more and more felt.\n\nHis youth, rich in hopes, honor, his social position, the dreams of love\nand friendship, were all destroyed forever. The fountain of his tears began\nto run dry, a too calm feeling of hopelessness took possession of him; and\nthe thought of suicide, now bringing no sense of repulsion or terror, more\nand more frequently recurred to him.\n\nAt this moment the count\'s firm steps were heard.\n\nOn Turbin\'s face were still visible the last traces of his recent wrath,\nhis hands trembled slightly; but in his eyes shone a kindly gayety and\nself-satisfaction.\n\n"There! It has been won back for you!" he cried, tossing upon the table\nseveral packages of bank-notes. "Count them; are they all there? Then come\nas soon as possible to the sitting-room; I am going off right away," he\nadded, as though he did not perceive the tremendous revulsion of joy and\ngratefulness which rushed over the uhlan\'s face. Then, humming a gypsy\nsong, he left the room.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nSashka, tightening his girdle, was waiting for the horses to be harnessed,\nbut was anxious to go first and get the count\'s cloak, which, with the\ncollar, must have been worth three hundred rubles, and return that\nmiserable blue-lined shuba to that rascally man who had exchanged with the\ncount at the marshal\'s. But Turbin said that it was not necessary, and went\nto his room to change his clothes.\n\nThe cavalryman kept hiccoughing as he sat silently by his gypsy maiden. The\nispravnik called for vodka, and invited all the gentlemen to come and\nbreakfast with him, promising them that his wife would, without fail, dance\nthe national dance with the gypsies.\n\nThe handsome young man was earnestly arguing with Ilyushka that there was\nmore soul in the piano-forte, and that it was impossible to take B-flat on\nthe guitar. The chinovnik was gloomily drinking tea in one corner, and\napparently the daylight made him feel ashamed of his dissipation.\n\nThe gypsies were conversing together in Romany, and urging that they should\nonce more enliven the gentlemen; to which Stioshka objected, declaring that\nit would only vex the _barorai_,--that is, in Romany, count or prince, or\nrather great barin.\n\nFor the most part, the last spark of the orgy was dying out.\n\n"Well, then, one more song for a farewell, and then home with you,"\nexclaimed the count, fresh, gay, and radiant above all the others, as he\ncame into the room ready dressed in his travelling suit.\n\nThe gypsies had again formed their circle, and were just getting ready to\nsing, when Ilyin came in with a package of bank-notes in his hand, and drew\nthe count to one side.\n\n"I had only fifteen thousand rubles of public money, but you gave me\nsixteen thousand three hundred," said the uhlan; "this is yours, of\ncourse."\n\n"That\'s a fine arrangement. Let me have it."\n\nIlyin handed him the money, looking timidly at the count, and opened his\nmouth to say something; but then he reddened so painfully that the tears\ncame into his eyes, and he seized the count\'s hand, and began to squeeze\nit.\n\n"Away with you, Ilyushka ... listen to me! Now, here\'s your money, but you\nmust accompany me with your songs to the city limits!" And he threw on his\nguitar the thirteen hundred rubles which Ilyin had brought him. But the\ncount had forgotten to repay the cavalryman the one hundred rubles which he\nhad borrowed of him the evening before.\n\nIt was now ten o\'clock in the morning. The little sun was rising above the\nhousetops, the streets were beginning to fill with people, the merchants\nhad long ago opened their shops, nobles and chinovniks were riding up and\ndown through the streets, and ladies were out shopping, when the band of\ngypsies, the ispravnik, the cavalryman, the handsome young fellow, Ilyin,\nand the count who was wrapped up in his blue-lined bear-skin shuba, came\nout on the door-steps of the hotel.\n\nIt was a sunny day, and it thawed. Three hired troikas, with their tails\nknotted, and splashing through the liquid mud, pranced up to the steps; and\nthe whole jolly company prepared to take their places. The count, Ilyin,\nStioshka, Ilyushka, and Sashka the count\'s man,[70] mounted the first\nsledge.\n\n[Footnote 70: _denshchik._]\n\nBluecher was beside himself with delight, and, wagging his tail, barked at\nthe shaft-horse.\n\nThe other gentlemen, together with the gypsies, men and women, climbed into\nthe other sledges. From the very hotel the sledges flew off side by side,\nand the gypsies set up a merry chorus and song.\n\nThe troikas, with the songs and jingling bells, dashed through the whole\nlength of the city to the gates, compelling all the equipages which they\nmet to rein up on the very sidewalks.\n\nMerchants and passers-by who did not know them, and especially those who\ndid, were filled with astonishment to see nobles of high rank, in the midst\nof "the white day," dashing through the streets with intoxicated gypsies,\nsinging at the tops of their voices.\n\nWhen they reached the city limits, the troikas stopped, and all the party\ntook farewell of the count.\n\nIlyin, who had drunk considerable at the leave-taking, and had all the time\nbeen driving the horses, suddenly became melancholy, and began to urge the\ncount to stay just one day more; but when he was assured that this was\nimpossible, quite unexpectedly threw himself into his arms, and began to\nkiss his new friend, and promised him that as soon as he got to camp, he\nwould petition to be transferred into the regiment of hussars in which\nCount Turbin served.\n\nThe count was extraordinarily hilarious; he tipped into a snow-drift the\ncavalryman, who, since morning, had definitely taken to saying _thou_ to\nhim; he set Bluecher on the ispravnik; he took Stioshka into his arms, and\nthreatened to carry her off with him to Moscow; but at last he tucked\nhimself into the sledge, and stationed Bluecher by his side, who was always\nready to ride. Sashka took his place on the box, after once more asking the\ncavalryman to secure the count\'s cloak from _them_, and to send it to him.\nThe count cried "Go on,"[71] took off his cap, waved it over his head, and\nwhistled in post-boy fashion to the horses. The troikas parted company.\n\n[Footnote 71: _proshol._]\n\nAs far as the eye could see, stretched a monotonous snow-covered plain,\nover which wound the yellowish muddy ribbon of the road.\n\nThe bright sunlight, dancing, glistened on the melting snow, which was\ncovered with a thin crust of transparent ice, and pleasantly warmed the\nface and back.\n\nThe steam arose from the sweaty horses. The bells jingled.\n\nA peasant[72] with a creaking sledge, heavily loaded, slowly turned out\ninto the slushy snow, twitching his hempen reins, and tramping with his\nwell-soaked sabots.[73]\n\n[Footnote 72: _muzhik._]\n\n[Footnote 73: _lapti._]\n\nA stout, handsome peasant woman, with a child wrapped in a sheep-skin on\nher lap, who was seated on another load, used the end of her reins to whip\nup a white mangy-tailed old nag.\n\nSuddenly the count remembered Anna Fedorovna.\n\n"Turn round!" he cried.\n\nThe driver did not understand.\n\n"Turn round and drive back; back to the city! Be quick about it." The\ntroika again passed the city gate, and quickly drew up in front of the\nboarded steps of the Zaitsova dwelling.\n\nThe count briskly mounted the steps, passed through the vestibule and the\nparlor, and finding the widow still asleep he took her in his arms, lifting\nher from her bed, and kissed her sleeping eyes again and again, and then\ndarted back to the sledge.\n\nAnna Fedorovna awoke from her slumber, and demanded, "What has happened?"\n\nThe count took his seat in his sledge, shouted to the driver, and now no\nlonger delaying, and thinking not of Lukhnof nor of the little widow, nor\nof Stioshka, but only of what was awaiting him in Moscow, rapidly left the\ncity of K. behind him.\n\n\nIX.\n\nA score of years have passed. Much water has run since then, many men have\ndied, many children have been born, many have grown up and become old;\nstill more thoughts have been born and perished. Much that was beautiful\nand much that was ugly in the past have disappeared; much that is beautiful\nin the new has been brought forth, and still more that is incomplete and\nabortive of the new has appeared in God\'s world.\n\nCount Feodor Turbin was long ago killed in a duel with some foreigner whom\nhe struck on the street with his long whip. His son, who was as like him as\ntwo drops of water, had already reached the age of two or three and twenty,\nand was a lovely fellow, already serving in the cavalry.\n\nMorally the young Count Turbin was entirely different from his father.\nThere was not a shadow of those fiery, passionate, and in truth be it said,\ncorrupt inclinations, peculiar to the last century.\n\nTogether with intelligence, cultivation, and inherited natural gifts, a\nlove for the proprieties and amenities of life, a practical view of men and\ncircumstances, wisdom and forethought, were his chief characteristics.\n\nThe young count made admirable progress in his profession; at twenty-three\nhe was already lieutenant.... When war broke out, he came to the conclusion\nthat it would be more for his interests to enter the regular army; and he\njoined a regiment of hussars as captain of cavalry, where he soon was given\ncommand of a battalion.\n\nIn the month of May, 1848, the S. regiment of hussars was on its way\nthrough the government of K., and the very battalion which the young Count\nTurbin commanded was obliged to be quartered for one night at Morozovka,\nAnna Fedorovna\'s village. Anna Fedorovna was still alive, but was now so\nfar from being young that she no longer called herself young, which, for a\nwoman, means much.\n\nShe had grown very stout, and this, it is said, restores youth in a woman.\nBut that was not the worst of it: over her pale, stout flesh was a net-work\nof coarse, flabby wrinkles. She no longer went to the city, she even found\nit hard to mount into her carriage; but still she was just as good-natured\nand as completely vacant-minded as ever,--the truth might safely be told,\nnow that it was no longer palliated by her beauty.\n\nUnder her roof lived her daughter Liza, a rustic Russian belle of\ntwenty-three summers, and her brother, our acquaintance the cavalryman, who\nhad spent all his patrimony in behalf of others, and now, in his old age,\nhad taken refuge with Anna Fedorovna.\n\nThe hair on his head had become perfectly gray; his upper lip was sunken,\nbut the mustache that it wore was carefully dyed. Wrinkles covered not only\nhis brow and cheeks, but also his nose and neck; and yet his weak bow-legs\ngave evidence of the old cavalryman.\n\nAnna Fedorovna\'s whole family and household were gathered in the small\nparlor of the ancient house. The balcony door and windows, looking out into\na star-shaped garden shaded by lindens, were open. Anna Fedorovna, in her\ngray hair and a lilac-colored gown,[74] was sitting on the sofa, before a\nsmall round mahogany table, shuffling cards. The old brother, dressed in\nspruce white pantaloons and a blue coat, had taken up his position near the\nwindow, knitting strips of white cotton on a fork, an occupation which his\nniece had taught him, and which gave him great enjoyment, as he had nothing\nelse to do, his eyes not being strong enough to enable him to read\nnewspapers, which was his favorite occupation. Near him Pimotchka, a\n_protegee_ of Anna Fedorovna, was studying her lessons under the guidance\nof Liza, who with wooden knitting-needles was knitting stockings of\ngoat-wool for her uncle.\n\n[Footnote 74: _katsaveika._]\n\nThe last rays of the setting sun, as always at this time, threw under the\nlinden alley their soft reflections on the last window-panes and the little\n_etagere_ which stood near it.\n\nIn the garden it was so still that one could hear the swift rush of a\nswallow\'s wings, and so quiet in the room that Anna Fedorovna\'s gentle\nsigh, or the old man\'s cough as he kept changing the position of his legs,\nwas the only sound.\n\n"How does this go, Lizanka? show me, please. I keep forgetting," said Anna\nFedorovna, pausing in the midst of her game of patience. Liza, without\nstopping her work, went over to her mother, and, glancing at the cards,\n"Ah!" says she. "You have mixed them all up, dear mamasha," said she,\narranging the cards. "That is the way they should be placed. Now they come\nas you desired," she added, secretly withdrawing one card.\n\n"Now you are always managing to deceive me! You said that it would go."\n\n"No, truly; it goes, I assure you. It has come out right."\n\n"Very well, then; very well, you rogue! But isn\'t it time for tea?"\n\n"I have just ordered the samovar heated. I will go and see about it\nimmediately. Shall we have it brought here?... Now, Pimotchka, hasten and\nfinish your lessons, and we will go and take a run."\n\nAnd Liza started for the door.\n\n"Lizotchka! Lizanka!" cried her uncle, steadfastly regarding his fork,\n"again it seems to me I have dropped a stitch. Arrange it for me, my\ndarling."[75]\n\n[Footnote 75: _golubchik._]\n\n"In a moment, in a moment. First I must have the sugar broken up."\n\nAnd in point of fact, within three minutes, she came running into the room,\nwent up to her uncle, and took him by the ear.\n\n"That\'s to pay you for dropping stitches," said she laughing. "You have not\nbeen knitting as I taught you."\n\n"Now, that\'ll do, that\'ll do, adjust it for me; there seems to be some sort\nof a knot."\n\nLiza took the fork, pulled out a pin from her kerchief, which was blown\nback a little by the breeze coming through the window, picked it out a\ncouple of times, and handed it back to her uncle.\n\n"Now you must kiss me for that," said she, putting up her rosy cheek toward\nhim, and re-adjusting her kerchief. "You shall have rum in your tea to-day.\nTo-day is Friday, you see."\n\nAnd again she went to the tea-room.\n\n"Uncle dear, come and look! some hussars are riding up toward the house!"\nher ringing voice was heard to say. Anna Fedorovna and her brother hastened\ninto the tea-room, the windows of which faced the village, and looked at\nthe hussars. Very little was to be seen; through the cloud of dust it could\nbe judged only that a body of men was advancing.\n\n"What a pity, sister," remarked the uncle to Anna Fedorovna, "what a pity\nthat we are so cramped, and the wing is not built yet, so that we might\ninvite the officers here. Officers of the hussars! they are such glorious,\ngay young fellows! I should like to have a glimpse at them."\n\n"Well, I should be heartily glad, but you know yourself that there is\nnowhere to put them: my sleeping-room, Liza\'s room, the parlor, and then\nyour room,--judge for yourself. Mikhailo Matveef has put the\n_starosta\'s_[76] house in order for them; he says it will be nice there."\n\n[Footnote 76: Village elder.]\n\n"But we must find you a husband, Lizotchka, among them,--a glorious\nhussar!" said the uncle.\n\n"No, I do not want a hussar: I want an uhlan. Let me see, you served among\nthe uhlans, didn\'t you, uncle?... I don\'t care to know these hussars. They\nsay they are desperate fellows."\n\nAnd Liza blushed a little, and then once more her ringing laugh was heard.\n"There\'s Ustiushka running: we must ask her what she saw," said she. Anna\nFedorovna sent to have Ustiushka brought in.\n\n"She has no idea of sticking to her work, she must always be running off to\nlook at the soldiers," said Anna Fedorovna.... "Now, where have they lodged\nthe officers?"\n\n"With the Yeremkins, your ladyship. There are two of them, such lovely men!\nOne of them is a count, they tell me."\n\n"What\'s his name?"\n\n"Kazarof or Turbinof. I don\'t remember, excuse me."\n\n"There now, you\'re a goose, you don\'t know how to tell any thing at all.\nYou might have remembered his name!"\n\n"Well, I\'ll run and find out."\n\n"I know that you are quite able to do that. But no, let Danilo\ngo.--Brother, go and tell him to go; have him ask if there is not something\nwhich the officers may need; every thing must be done in good form; have\nthem understand that it is the lady of the house who has sent to find out."\n\nThe old people sat down again in the tea-room, and Liza went to the\nservants\' room to put the lumps of sugar in the sugar-bowl. Ustiushka was\ntelling them there about the hussars.\n\n"O my dear young lady, what a handsome man he is! that count!" she said,\n"absolutely a little cherubim,[77] with black eyebrows. You ought to have\nsuch a husband as that; what a lovely little couple you would make!" The\nother maids smiled approvingly; the old nurse, sitting by the window with\nher stocking, sighed, and, drawing a long breath, murmured a prayer.\n\n[Footnote 77: _kherubimchik._]\n\n"It seems to me that the hussars have given you a great deal of pleasure,"\nsaid Liza. "You are a master hand at description. Bring me the _mors_,[78]\nUstiushka, please; we must give the officers something sour to drink." And\nLiza, laughing, went out with the sugar-bowl.\n\n[Footnote 78: A sour beverage made of cranberries.]\n\n"But I should like to see what sort of a man this hussar is,--whether he is\nbrunet or blondin. And I imagine he would not object to making our\nacquaintance. But he will go away, and never know that I was here and was\nthinking about him. And how many have passed by me in this way! No one ever\nsees me except uncle and Ustiushka! How many times I have arranged my hair,\nhow many pairs of cuffs I have put on, and yet no one ever sees me or falls\nin love with me," she thought with a sigh, contemplating her white, plump\nhand.\n\n"He must be tall, and have big eyes, and a nice little black mustache....\nNo! I am already over twenty-two, and no one has ever fallen in love with\nme except the pock-marked Ivan Ipatuitch. And four years ago I was still\nbetter-looking; and so my girlhood has gone, and no one is the better for\nit. Ah! I am an unhappy country maiden!"\n\nHer mother\'s voice, calling her to bring the tea, aroused the country\nmaiden from this momentary revery.\n\nShe shook her little head, and went into the tea-room.\n\nThe best things always happen unexpectedly; and the more you try to force\nthem, the worse they come out. In the country it is rare that any attempt\nis made to impart education, and therefore when a good one is found it is\ngenerally a surprise. And thus it happened, in a notable degree, in the\ncase of Liza. Anna Fedorovna, through her own lack of intelligence and\nnatural laziness, had not given Liza any education at all; had not taught\nher music, nor the French language which is so indispensable. But the girl\nhad fortunately been a healthy, bright little child: she had intrusted her\nto a wet-nurse and a day-nurse; she had fed her, and dressed her in print\ndresses and goat-skin shoes, and let her run wild and gather mushrooms and\nberries; had her taught reading and arithmetic by a resident seminarist.\nAnd thus, as fate would have it, at the age of sixteen, she found in her\ndaughter a companion, a soul who was always cheerful and good-natured, and\nthe actual mistress of the house.\n\nThrough her goodness of heart, Anna Fedorovna always had in her house some\n_protegee_, either a serf or some foundling. Liza, from the time she was\nten years old, had begun to take care of them; to teach them, clothe them,\ntake them to church, and keep them still when they were inclined to be\nmischievous.\n\nThen her old broken-down but good-natured uncle made his appearance, and he\nhad to be taken care of like a child. Then the domestic servants and the\npeasants began to come to the young mistress with their desires and their\nailments; and she treated them with elderberry, mint, and spirits of\ncamphor. Then the domestic management of the house fell into her hands\nentirely. Then came the unsatisfied craving for love, which found\nexpression only in nature and religion.\n\nThus Liza, by chance, grew into an active, good-naturedly cheerful,\nself-poised, pure, and deeply religious young woman.\n\nTo be sure, she had her little fits of jealousy and envy when she saw, all\naround her in church, her neighbors dressed in new, fashionable hats that\ncame from K.; she was sometimes vexed to tears by her old, irritable\nmother, and her caprices; she had her dreams of love in the most absurd and\neven the crudest forms, but her healthy activity, which she could not\nshirk, drove them away; and now, at twenty-two, not a single spot, not a\nsingle compunction, had touched the fresh, calm soul of this maiden, now\ndeveloped into the fulness of perfect physical and moral beauty.\n\nLiza was of medium height, rather plump than lean; her eyes were brown,\nsmall, with a soft dark shade on the lower lid; she wore her flaxen hair in\na long braid.\n\nIn walking she took long steps, and swayed like a duck, as the saying is.\n\nThe expression of her face, when she was occupied with her duties, and\nnothing especially disturbed her, seemed to say to all who looked into it,\n"Life in this world is good and pleasant to one who has a heart full of\nlove, and a pure conscience."\n\nEven in moments of vexation, of trouble, of unrest, or of melancholy, in\nspite of her tears, of the drawing-down of the left brow, of the compressed\nlips, of the petulance of her desires, even then in the dimples of her\ncheeks, in the corners of her mouth, and in her brilliant eyes, so used to\nsmile and rejoice in life,--even then there shone a heart good and upright,\nand unspoiled by knowledge.\n\n\nX.\n\nIt was still rather warm, though the sun was already set, when the\nbattalion arrived at Morozovka. In front of them, along the dusty village\nstreet, trotted a brindled cow, separated from the herd, bellowing, and\noccasionally stopping to look round, and never once perceiving that all she\nhad to do was to turn out and let the battalion pass.\n\nPeasants, old men, women, children, and domestic serfs, crowding both sides\nof the road, gazed curiously at the hussars.\n\nThrough a thick cloud of dust the hussars rode along on raven-black horses,\ncurvetting and occasionally snorting.\n\nAt the right of the battalion, gracefully mounted on beautiful black\nsteeds, rode two officers. One was the commander, Count Turbin; the other a\nvery young man, who had recently been promoted from the yunkers; his name\nwas Polozof.\n\nA hussar, in a white kittel, came from the best of the cottages, and,\ntaking off his cap, approached the officers.\n\n"What quarters have been assigned to us?" asked the count.\n\n"For your excellency?" replied the quartermaster, his whole body\nshuddering. "Here at the _starosta\'s_; he has put his cottage in order. I\ntried to get a room at the mansion,[79] but they said no; the proprietress\nis so ill-tempered."\n\n[Footnote 79: _barsky dvor._]\n\n"Well, all right," said the count, dismounting and stretching his legs as\nhe reached the _starosta\'s_ cottage. "Tell me, has my carriage come?"\n\n"It has deigned to arrive, your excellency," replied the quartermaster,\nindicating with his cap the leathern carriage-top which was to be seen\ninside the gate, and then hastening ahead into the entry of the cottage,\nwhich was crowded with the family of serfs, gathered to have a look at the\nofficer.\n\nHe even tripped over an old woman, as he hastily opened the door of the\nneatly cleaned cottage, and stood aside to let the count pass.\n\nThe cottage was large and commodious, but not perfectly clean. The German\nbody-servant,[80] dressed like a barin, was standing in the cottage, and,\nhaving just finished setting up the iron bed, was taking out clean linen\nfrom a trunk.\n\n[Footnote 80: _kammerdiener._]\n\n"_Phu!_ what a nasty lodging!" exclaimed the count in vexation. "Diadenko!\nIs it impossible to find me better quarters at the proprietor\'s or\nsomewhere?"\n\n"If your excellency command, I will go up to the mansion," replied\nDiadenko; "but the house is small and wretched, and seems not much better\nthan the cottage."\n\n"Well, that\'s all now. You can go."\n\nAnd the count threw himself down on the bed, supporting his head with his\nhands.\n\n"Johann!" he cried to his body-servant; "again you have made a hump in the\nmiddle. Why can\'t you learn to make a bed decently?"\n\nJohann was anxious to make it over again.\n\n"No, you need not trouble about it now!... Where\'s my dressing-gown?" he\nproceeded to ask in a petulant voice. The servant gave him the\ndressing-gown.\n\nThe count, before he put it on, examined the skirt. "There it is! You have\nnot taken that spot out! Could it be possible for any one to be a worse\nservant than you are?" he added, snatching the garment from the servant\'s\nhands, and putting it on. "Now tell me, do you do this way on purpose? Is\ntea ready?"\n\n"I haven\'t had time to make it," replied Johann.\n\n"Fool!"\n\nAfter this, the count took a French novel which was at hand, and read for\nsome time without speaking; but Johann went out into the entry to blow up\nthe coals in the samovar.\n\nIt was plain to see that the count was in a bad humor; it must have been\nowing to weariness, to the dust on his face, to his tightly-fitting\nclothes, and to his empty stomach. "Johann!" he cried again, "give me an\naccount of those ten rubles. What did you get in town?"\n\nThe count looked over the account which the servant handed him, and made\nsome dissatisfied remarks about the high prices paid.\n\n"Give me the rum for the tea."\n\n"I did not get any rum," said Johann.\n\n"Delightful! How many times have I told you always to have rum?"\n\n"I didn\'t have money enough."\n\n"Why didn\'t Polozof buy it? You might have got some from his man."\n\n"The cornet Polozof? I do not know. He bought tea and sugar."\n\n"Beast! Get you gone. You are the only man who has the power to exhaust my\npatience! You know that I always take rum in my tea when I am on the\nmarch."\n\n"Here are two letters one of the staff brought for you," said the\nbody-servant.\n\nThe count, as he lay on the bed, tore open the letters, and began to read\nthem. At this moment the cornet came in with gay countenance, having\nquartered the battalion.\n\n"Well, how is it, Turbin? It\'s first-rate here, seems to me. I am tired\nout, I confess it. It has been a warm day."\n\n"First-rate! I should think so! A dirty, stinking hut! and no rum, thanks\nto you. Your stupid did not buy any, nor this one either. You might have\nsaid something anyway!"\n\nAnd he went on with his reading. After he had read the letter through, he\ncrumpled it up, and threw it on the floor.\n\n"_Why_ didn\'t you buy some rum?" the cornet in a whisper demanded of his\nservant in the entry. "Didn\'t you have any money?"\n\n"Well, why should we be always the ones to spend the money? I have enough\nto spend for without that, and _his_ German does nothing but smoke his\npipe,--that\'s all."\n\nThe second letter was evidently not disagreeable, because the count smiled\nas he read it.\n\n"Who\'s that from?" asked Polozof, returning to the room, and trying to\narrange for himself a couch on the floor, near the oven.\n\n"From Mina," replied the count gayly, handing him the letter. "Would you\nlike to read it? What a lovely woman she is! Now, she\'s better than our\nyoung ladies, that\'s a fact. Just see what feeling and what wit in that\nletter! There\'s only one thing that I don\'t like,--she asks me for money!"\n\n"No, that\'s not pleasant," replied the cornet.\n\n"Well it\'s true I promised to give her some; but this expedition--And\nbesides, if I am commander of the battalion, at the end of three months I\nwill send some to her. I should not regret it; she\'s really a lovely woman.\nIsn\'t she?" he asked with a smile, following with his eyes Polozof\'s\nexpression as he read the letter.\n\n"Horribly misspelled, but sweet; it seems to me she really loves you,"\nreplied the cornet.\n\n"Hm! I should think so! Only these women truly love when they do love."\n\n"But who was that other letter from?" asked the cornet, pointing to the one\nwhich he had read.\n\n"That? Oh, that\'s from a certain man, very ugly, to whom I owe a gambling\ndebt, and this is the third time that he has reminded me of it. I can\'t pay\nit to him now. It\'s a stupid letter," replied the count, evidently nettled\nby the recollection of it.\n\nThe two officers remained silent for some little time. The cornet, who, it\nseemed, had come under Turbin\'s influence, drank his tea without speaking,\nthough he occasionally cast a glance at the clouded face of the handsome\ncount, who gazed steadily out of the window. He did not venture to renew\nthe conversation.\n\n"Well, then, I think it can be accomplished without difficulty," suddenly\nexclaimed the count, turning to Polozof, and gayly nodding his head. "If we\nwho are in the line get promoted this year, yes, and if we take part in\nsome engagement, then I can overtake my former captains of the guard."\n\nThey were drinking their second cup of tea, and the conversation was still\ndwelling on this theme, when the old Danilo came with the message from Anna\nFedorovna.\n\n"And she would also like to know whether you are not pleased to be the son\nof Feodor Ivanovitch Turbin," he added, on his own responsibility, as he\nhad found out the officer\'s name, and still remembered the late count\'s\nvisit to the city of K. "Our mistress,[81] Anna Fedorovna, used to be very\nwell acquainted with him."\n\n[Footnote 81: _baruinya._]\n\n"He was my father. Now tell the lady that I am very much obliged, but that\nI need nothing; only, if it would not be possible to give me a cleaner room\nin the mansion, say, or somewhere."\n\n"Now, why did you do that?" asked Polozof after Danilo had gone. "Isn\'t it\njust the same thing? For one night isn\'t it just as well here? And it will\nput them to inconvenience."\n\n"There it is again! It seems to me we have had enough of being sent round\namong these smoky hovels.[82] It\'s easy enough to see that you are not a\npractical man. Why shouldn\'t we seize the opportunity, when we can, of\nsleeping, even if it\'s for only one night, like decent men? And they,\ncontrary to what you think, will be mighty glad. There\'s only one thing\nobjectionable. If this lady used to know my father," continued the count,\nwith a smile that discovered his white gleaming teeth,--"somehow I always\nfeel a little ashamed of my late papasha; there\'s always some scandalous\nstory, or some debt or other. And so I can\'t endure to meet any of my\nfather\'s acquaintances. However, that was an entirely different age," he\nadded seriously.\n\n[Footnote 82: _kurnaya izba_, a peasant\'s hut without chimney.]\n\n"Oh! I did not tell you," rejoined Polozof. "I recently met Ilyin, the\nbrigade commander of uhlans. He is very anxious to see you; he is\npassionately fond of your father."\n\n"I think that he is terrible trash, that Ilyin. But the worst is that all\nthese gentlemen who imagine that they knew my father in order to make\nfriends with me, insist upon telling me, as though it were very pleasant\nfor me to hear, about escapades of his that make me blush. It is true I am\nnot impulsive, and I look upon things dispassionately; while he was too\nhot-spirited a man, and sometimes he played exceedingly reprehensible\ntricks. However, that was all due to his time. In our day and generation,\nmaybe, he would have been a very sensible man, for he had tremendous\nabilities; one must give him credit for that."\n\nIn a quarter of an hour the servant returned, and brought an invitation for\nthem to come and spend the night at the mansion.\n\n\nXI.\n\nAs soon as Anna Fedorovna learned that the officer of hussars was the son\nof Count Feodor Turbin, she was thrown into a great state of excitement.\n\n"Oh! great heavens![83] he is my darling! Danilo! run, hurry, tell them the\nlady invites them to stay at her house," she cried, in great agitation, and\nhastening to the servants\' room. "Lizanka! Ustiushka! You must have your\nroom put in order, Liza. You can go into your uncle\'s room; and you,\nbrother,--brother, you can sleep to-night in the parlor. It\'s for only one\nnight."\n\n[Footnote 83: _batiuzhki moi!_]\n\n"That\'s nothing, sister! I would sleep on the floor."\n\n"He must be a handsome fellow, I think, if he\'s like his father. Only let\nme see him, the turtle-dove! You shall see for yourself, Liza. Ah! his\nfather was handsome! Where shall we put the table? Let it go there," said\nAnna Fedorovna, running about here and there. "There now, bring in two\nbeds; get one from the overseer, and get from the _etagere_ the glass\ncandlestick which my brother gave me for my birthday, and put in a wax\ncandle."\n\nAt last all was ready. Liza, in spite of her mother\'s interference,\narranged her room in her own way for the two officers.\n\nShe brought out clean linen sheets, fragrant of mignonnette, and had the\nbeds made; she ordered a carafe of water and candles near it on the little\ntable. She burned scented paper in the girls\' room, and moved her own\nlittle bed into her uncle\'s chamber.\n\nAnna Fedorovna gradually became calm, and sat down again in her usual\nplace; she even took out her cards; but instead of shuffling them, she\nleaned on her fat elbow, and gave herself up to her thoughts.\n\n"How time has gone! how time has gone!" she exclaimed in a whisper. "It is\nlong! long! isn\'t it? I seem to see him now! _Akh!_ he was a scamp!"\n\nAnd the tears came into her eyes. "Now here is Lizanka, but she isn\'t at\nall what I was at her age. She is a nice girl; but no, not quite....\n\n"Lizanka, you had better wear your mousselin-de-laine dress this evening."\n\n"But are you going to invite them down-stairs, mamasha? You had better not\ndo it," rejoined Liza, with a feeling of invincible agitation at the\nthought of seeing the officers. "You had better not, mamasha!"\n\nIn point of fact, she did not so much desire to see them, as she felt\napprehensive of some painful pleasure awaiting her, as it seemed to her.\n\n"Perhaps they themselves would like to make our acquaintance, Lizotchka,"\nsaid Anna Fedorovna, glancing at her daughter\'s hair, and at the same time\nthinking, "No, not such hair as I had at her age. No, Lizotchka, how much I\ncould wish for you!" And she really wished something very excellent for her\ndaughter, but she could scarcely look forward to a match with the count;\nshe could not desire such a relationship as she herself had formed with his\nfather; but that something good would come of it, she wished very, very\nmuch for her daughter. She possibly had the desire to live over again in\nher daughter\'s happiness all the life which she lived with the late count.\n\nThe old cavalryman was also somewhat excited by the count\'s coming. He went\nto his room, and shut himself up in it. At the end of a quarter of an hour,\nhe re-appeared dressed in a Hungarian coat and blue pantaloons; and with a\ntroubled-happy expression of countenance, such as a girl wears when she\nputs on her first ball-dress, he started for the room assigned to the\nguests.\n\n"We shall have a glimpse of some of the hussars of to-day, sister. The late\ncount was indeed a genuine hussar. We shall see! we shall see!"\n\nThe officers had by this time come in by the back entrance, and were in the\nroom that had been put at their service.\n\n"There now," said the count, stretching himself out in his dusty boots on\nthe bed which had just been made for him, "if we aren\'t better off here\nthan we were there in that hovel with the cockroaches!"\n\n"Better? of course; but think what obligations we are putting ourselves\nunder to the people here."\n\n"What rubbish! You must always be a practical man. They are mighty glad to\nhave us, of course. Fellow!" cried the count, "ask some one to put a\ncurtain up at this window, else there\'ll be a draught in the night."\n\nAt this moment the old man came in to make the acquaintance of the\nofficers. Though he was somewhat confused, he did not fail to tell how he\nhad been a comrade of the late count\'s, who had been very congenial to him,\nand he even went so far as to say that more than once he had been under\nobligations to the late count. Whether he meant, in speaking of the\nobligations to the late count, a reference to the hundred rubles which the\ncount had borrowed and never returned, or to his throwing him into the\nsnow-drift, or to the slap in the face, the old man failed to explain.\n\nHowever, the count was very urbane with the old cavalryman, and thanked him\nfor his hospitality.\n\n"You must excuse us if it is not very luxurious, count,"--he almost said\n"your excellency," as he had got out of the habit of meeting with men of\nrank. "My sister\'s house is rather small. As for the window here, we will\nfind something to serve as a curtain right away, and it will be\nfirst-rate," added the little old man; and under the pretext of going for a\ncurtain, but really because he wanted to give his report about the officers\nas quickly as possible, he left the room. The pretty little Ustiushka came,\nbringing her mistress\'s shawl to serve as a curtain. She was also\ncommissioned to ask if the gentlemen would not like some tea.\n\nThe cheerful hospitality had had a manifestly beneficent influence upon the\ncount\'s spirits. He laughed and jested with Ustiushka gayly, and went to\nsuch lengths that she even called him a bad man; he asked her if her\nmistress was pretty, and in reply to her question whether he would like\nsome tea, replied that she might please bring him some, but above all, as\nhis supper was not ready, he would like some vodka now, and a little lunch,\nand some sherry if there was any.\n\nThe old uncle was in raptures over the young count\'s politeness, and\npraised to the skies the young generation of officers, saying that the men\nof the present day were far preferable to those of the past.\n\nAnna Fedorovna could not agree to that,--no one could be any better than\nCount Feodor Ivanovitch,--and she was beginning to grow seriously angry,\nand remarked dryly, "For you, brother, the one who flatters you last is the\nbest! Without any question, the men of our time are better educated, but\nstill Feodor Ivanovitch could dance the schottische, and was so amiable\nthat everybody in his day, you might say, was stupid compared to him! only\nhe did not care for any one else beside me. Oh, certainly there were fine\nmen in the old time!"\n\nAt this moment came the message requesting the vodka, the lunch, and the\nsherry.\n\n"There now, just like you, brother! You never do things right. We ought to\nhave had supper prepared.... Liza, attend to it, that\'s my darling."\n\nLiza hastened to the storeroom for mushrooms and fresh cream butter, and\ntold the cook to prepare beef cutlets.\n\n"How much sherry is there? Haven\'t you any left, brother?"\n\n"No, sister; I never have had any."\n\n"What! no sherry? but what is it you drink in your tea?"\n\n"That is rum, Anna Fedorovna."\n\n"Isn\'t that the same thing? Give them some of that. It is all the same,\nit\'ll make no difference. Or would it not be better to invite them down\nhere, brother? You know all about it. They would not be offended, I\nimagine, would they?"\n\nThe cavalryman assured her that he would answer for it that the count, in\nhis goodness of heart, would not decline, and that he would certainly bring\nthem.\n\nAnna Fedorovna went off to put on, for some reason or other, her gros-grain\ndress and a new cap; but Liza was so busy that she had no time to take off\nher pink gingham dress with wide sleeves. Moreover, she was terribly\nwrought up; it seemed to her that something astonishing, like a very low\nblack cloud, was sweeping down upon her soul.\n\nThis count-hussar, this handsome fellow, seemed to her an absolutely novel\nand unexpected but beautiful creature. His character, his habits, his\nwords, it seemed to her, must be something extraordinary, such as had never\ncome into the range of her experience. All that he thought and said must be\nbright and true; all that he did must be honorable; his whole appearance\nmust be beautiful. She could have no doubt of that. If he had demanded not\nmerely a lunch and sherry, but even a bath in spirits of salvia, she would\nnot have been surprised, she would not have blamed him, and she would have\nbeen convinced that this was just and reasonable.\n\nThe count immediately accepted when the cavalryman brought him his sister\'s\ninvitation; he combed his hair, put on his coat, and took his cigar-case.\n\n"Will you come?" he asked of Polozof.\n\n"Indeed we had better not go," replied the cornet; "_ils feront des frais\npour nous recevoir_."\n\n"Rubbish! it will make them happy. Besides, I have been making\ninquiries ... there\'s a pretty daughter here.... Come along," said the\ncount in French.\n\n"_Je vous en prie, messieurs_," said the cavalryman, merely for the sake of\ngiving them to understand that he also could speak French, and understood\nwhat the officers were saying.\n\n\nXII.\n\nLiza, red in the face and with downcast eyes, was ostensibly occupied with\nfilling up the teapot, and did not dare to look at the officers as they\nentered the room.\n\nAnna Fedorovna, on the contrary, briskly jumped up and bowed, and without\ntaking her eyes from the count\'s face began to talk to him, now finding an\nextraordinary resemblance to his father, now presenting her daughter, now\noffering him tea, meats, or jelly-cakes.\n\nNo one paid any attention to the cornet, thanks to his modest behavior; and\nhe was very glad of it, because it gave him a chance, within the limits of\npropriety, to observe and study the details of Liza\'s beauty, which had\nevidently come over him with the force of a surprise.\n\nThe uncle listening to his sister\'s conversation had a speech ready on his\nlips, and was waiting for a chance to relate his cavalry experiences.\n\nThe count smoked his cigar over his tea, so that Liza had great difficulty\nin refraining from coughing, but he was very talkative and amiable; at\nfirst, in the infrequent pauses of Anna Fedorovna\'s conversation, he\nintroduced his own stories, and finally he took the conversation into his\nown hands.\n\nOne thing struck his listeners as rather strange: in his talk he often used\nwords, which, though not considered reprehensible in his own set, were\nhere rather audacious, so that Anna Fedorovna was a little abashed, and\nLiza blushed to the roots of her hair. But this the count did not notice,\nand continued to be just as natural and amiable as ever.\n\nLiza filled the glasses in silence, not putting them into the hands of the\nguests, but pushing them toward them; she had not entirely recovered from\nher agitation, but listened eagerly to the count\'s anecdotes.\n\nThe count\'s pointless tales, and the pauses in the conversation, gradually\nre-assured her. The bright things that she had expected from him were not\nforthcoming, nor did she find in him that surpassing elegance for which she\nhad confusedly hoped. Even as soon as the third glass of tea, when her\ntimid eyes once encountered his, and he did not avoid them, but continued\nalmost too boldly to stare at her, with a lurking smile, she became\nconscious of a certain feeling of hostility against him; and she soon\ndiscovered that there was not only nothing out of the ordinary in him, but\nthat he was very little different from those whom she had already seen; in\nfact, that there was no reason to be afraid of him. She noticed that he had\nlong and neat finger-nails, but otherwise there was no mark of special\nbeauty about him.\n\nLiza suddenly, not without some inward sorrow, renouncing her dream,\nregained her self-possession; and only the undemonstrative cornet\'s glance,\nwhich she felt fixed upon her, disquieted her.\n\n"Perhaps it is not the count, but the other," she said to herself.\n\n\nXIII.\n\nAfter tea, the old lady invited her guests into the other room, and again\nsat down in her usual place. "But perhaps you would like to rest, count?"\nshe asked. "Well, then, what would you like to amuse yourselves with, my\ndear guests?" she proceeded to ask after she had been assured to the\ncontrary. "You play cards, do you not, count?--Here, brother, you might\ntake a hand in some game or other."...\n\n"Why, you yourself can play _preference_," replied the cavalryman. "You had\nbetter take a hand, then. The count will play, will he not? And you?"\n\nThe officers were agreeable to every thing that might satisfy their amiable\nhosts.\n\nLiza brought from her room her old cards which she used for divining\nwhether her mother would speedily recover of a cold, or whether her uncle\nwould return on such and such a day from the city if he chanced to have\ngone there, or whether her neighbor would be in during the day, and other\nlike things. These cards, though they had been in use for two months, were\nless soiled than those which Anna Fedorovna used for the same purpose.\n\n"Perhaps you are not accustomed to playing for small stakes," suggested the\nuncle. "Anna Fedorovna and I play for half-kopeks, and then she always gets\nthe better of all of us."\n\n"Ah! make your own arrangements. I shall be perfectly satisfied," said the\ncount.\n\n"Well, then, be it in paper kopeks for the sake of our dear guests; only\nlet me gain, as I am old," said Anna Fedorovna, settling herself in her\nchair, and adjusting her mantilla. "Maybe I shall win a ruble of them,"\nthought Anna Fedorovna, who in her old age felt a little passion for cards.\n\n"If you would like, I will teach you to play with tablets," said the count,\n"and with the _miseries_. It is very jolly."\n\nEverybody was delighted with this new Petersburg fashion. The uncle went so\nfar as to assert that he knew it, and that it was just the same thing as\n_boston_, but that he had forgotten somewhat about it.\n\nAnna Fedorovna did not comprehend it at all; and it took her so long to get\ninto it, that she felt under the necessity of smiling and nodding her head\nassuringly, to give the impression that she now understood, and that now it\nwas all perfectly clear to her. But there was no little amusement created\nwhen in the midst of the game Anna Fedorovna, with ace and king blank,\ncalled "_miserie_," and remained with the six. She even began to grow\nconfused, smiled timidly, and hastened to assure them that she had not as\nyet become accustomed to the new way.\n\nNevertheless they put down the points against her, and many of them too;\nthe more because the count, through his practice of playing on large\nstakes, played carefully, led very prudently, and never at all understood\nwhat the cornet meant by sundry raps with his foot under the table, or why\nhe made such stupid blunders in playing.\n\nLiza brought in more jelly-cakes, three kinds of preserves, and apples\ncooked in some manner with port-wine; and then, standing behind her\nmother\'s chair, she looked on at the game, and occasionally watched the\nofficers, and especially the count\'s white hands with their delicate long\nfinger-nails, as he with such skill, assurance, and grace, threw the cards,\nand took the tricks.\n\nOnce more Anna Fedorovna, with some show of temper going beyond the others,\nbid as high as seven, and lost three points; and when, at her brother\'s\ninstigation, she tried to make some calculation, she found herself utterly\nconfused and off the track.\n\n"It\'s nothing, mamasha; you\'ll win it back again," said Liza, with a smile,\nanxious to rescue her mother from her ridiculous position. "Some time\nyou\'ll put a fine on uncle: then he will be caught."\n\n"But you might help me, Lizotchka," cried Anna Fedorovna, looking with an\nexpression of dismay at her daughter; "I don\'t know how this"....\n\n"But I don\'t know how to play this either," rejoined Liza, carefully\ncalculating her mother\'s losses. "But if you go on at this rate, mamasha,\nyou will lose a good deal, and Pimotchka will not have her new dress," she\nadded in jest.\n\n"Yes, in this way it is quite possible to lose ten silver rubles," said the\ncornet, looking at Liza, and anxious to draw her into conversation.\n\n"Aren\'t we playing for paper money?" asked Anna Fedorovna, gazing round at\nthe rest.\n\n"I don\'t know, I am sure," replied the count. "But I don\'t know how to\nreckon in bank-notes. What are they? what do you mean by bank-notes?"[84]\n\n[Footnote 84: _Assignatsii._]\n\n"Why, no one nowadays reckons in bank-notes," explained the cavalryman, who\nwas playing like a hero and was on the winning side.\n\nThe old lady ordered some sparkling wine, drank two glasses herself, grew\nquite flushed, and seemed to abandon all hope. One braid of her gray hair\nescaped from under her cap, and she did not even put it up. It was evident\nthat she thought herself losing millions, and that she was entirely ruined.\nThe cornet kept nudging the count\'s leg more and more emphatically. The\ncount was noting down the old lady\'s losses.\n\nAt last the game came to an end. In spite of Anna Fedorovna\'s efforts to\nbring her reckoning higher than it should be, and to pretend that she had\nbeen cheated in her account, and that it could not be correct, in spite of\nher dismay at the magnitude of her losses, at last the account was made\nout, and she was found to have lost nine hundred and twenty points.\n\n"Isn\'t that equal to nine paper rubles?" she asked again and again; and she\ndid not begin to realize how great her forfeit was, until her brother, to\nher horror, explained that she was "out" thirty-two and a half paper\nrubles, and that it was absolutely necessary for her to pay it.\n\nThe count did not even sum up his gains, but, as soon as the game was over,\narose and went over to the window where Liza was arranging the lunch, and\nputting potted mushrooms on a plate. There he did with perfect calmness and\nnaturalness what the cornet had been anxious and yet unable to effect all\nthe evening,--he engaged her in conversation about the weather.\n\nThe cornet at this time was brought into a thoroughly unpleasant\npredicament. Anna Fedorovna, in the absence of the count and Liza, who had\nmanaged to keep her in a jovial frame of mind, became really angry.\n\n"Indeed, it is too bad that we have caused you to lose so heavily," said\nPolozof, in order to say something. "It is simply shameful."\n\n"I should think these tablets and _miseries_ were something of your own\ninvention. I don\'t know any thing about them. How many paper rubles does\nthe whole amount to?" she demanded.\n\n"Thirty-two rubles, thirty-two and a half," insisted the cavalryman, who,\nfrom the effect of having been on the winning side, was in a very waggish\nframe of mind. "Give him the money, sister.... Give it to him."\n\n"I will give all I owe, only you must not ask for any more. No, I shall\nnever win it back in my life."\n\nAnd Anna Fedorovna went to her room, all in excitement, hurried back, and\nbrought nine paper rubles. Only on the old man\'s strenuous insistence she\nwas induced to pay the whole sum. Polozof had some fear that the old lady\nwould pour out on him the vials of her wrath if he entered into\nconversation with her. He silently, without attracting attention, turned\naway, and rejoined the count and Liza, who were talking at the open window.\n\nOn the table, which was now spread for the supper, stood two tallow\ncandles, whose flame occasionally flickered in the gentle breeze of the\nmild May night. Through the window opening into the garden came a very\ndifferent light from that which filled the room. The moon, almost at its\nfull, already beginning to lose its golden radiance, was pouring over the\ntops of the lofty lindens, and making brighter and brighter the delicate\nfleecy clouds that occasionally overcast it.\n\nFrom the pond, the surface of which, silvered in one place by the moon,\ncould be seen through the trees, came the voices of the frogs. In the\nsweet-scented lilac-bush under the very window, which from time to time\nslowly shook its heavy-laden blossoms, birds were darting and fluttering.\n\n"What marvellous weather!" said the count, as he joined Liza, and sat down\nin the low window-seat. "I suppose you go to walk a good deal, don\'t you?"\n\n"Yes," rejoined Liza, not experiencing the slightest embarrassment in the\ncount\'s company. "Every morning, at seven o\'clock, I make the tour of the\nestate, and sometimes I take a walk with Pimotchka,--mamma\'s _protegee_."\n\n"It\'s pleasant living in the country," cried the count, putting his monocle\nto his eye, and gazing first at the garden, and then at Liza. "But don\'t\nyou like to take a walk on moonlight nights?"\n\n"No. Three years ago my uncle and I used to go out walking every moonlight\nnight. He had some sort of strange illness,--insomnia. Whenever there was a\nfull moon, he could not sleep. His room like this opens into the garden,\nand the window is low. The moon shines right into it."\n\n"Strange," remarked the count. "Then this is your room."\n\n"No, I only sleep there for this one night. You occupy my room."\n\n"Is it possible? ... oh, good heavens![85] I shall never in the world\nforgive myself for the trouble that I have caused," said the count, casting\nthe monocle from his eye as a sign of sincerity.... "If I had only known\nthat I was going to"....\n\n[Footnote 85: _Akh! Bozhe moi!_]\n\n"How much trouble was it? On the contrary, I am very glad. My uncle\'s room\nis so nice and jolly: there\'s a low window there. I shall sit down in it\nbefore I go to bed, or perhaps I shall go down, out into the garden, and\ntake a little walk."\n\n"What a glorious girl!" said the count to himself, replacing the monocle,\nand staring at her, and while pretending to change his seat in the window,\ntrying to touch her foot with his. "And how shrewdly she gave me to\nunderstand that I might meet her in the garden at the window, if I would\ncome down!"\n\nLiza even lost in the count\'s eyes a large share of her charm, so easy did\nthe conquest of her seem to him.\n\n"And how blissful it must be," said the count dreamily, gazing into the\nshadow-haunted alley, "to spend such a night in the garden with the object\nof one\'s love!"\n\nLiza was somewhat abashed by these words, and by a second evidently\ndeliberate pressure upon her foot. Before she thought, she made some reply\nfor the sake of dissimulating her embarrassment.\n\nShe said, "Yes, it is splendid to walk in the moonlight."\n\nThere was something disagreeable about the whole conversation. She put the\ncover on the jar from which she had been taking the mushrooms, and was just\nturning from the window, when the cornet came toward her, and she felt a\ncuriosity to know what kind of a man he was.\n\n"What a lovely night!" said he.\n\n"They can only talk about the weather," thought Liza.\n\n"What a wonderful view!" continued the cornet, "only I should think it\nwould be tiresome," he added through a strange propensity, peculiar to him,\nof saying things sure to offend the people who pleased him very much.\n\n"Why should you think so? Always the same cooking and always the same dress\nmight become tiresome; but a lovely garden can never be tiresome when you\nenjoy walking, and especially when there\'s a moon rising higher and higher.\nFrom my uncle\'s room you can see the whole pond. I shall see it from there\nto-night."\n\n"And you haven\'t any nightingales at all, have you?" asked the count,\ngreatly put out, because Polozof had come and prevented him from learning\nthe exact conditions of the rendezvous.\n\n"Oh, yes, we always have them; last year the hunters caught one; and last\nweek there was one that sang beautifully, but the district inspector[86]\ncame along with his bells, and scared him away.... Three years ago my uncle\nand I used to sit out in the covered alley, and listen to one for two hours\nat a time."\n\n[Footnote 86: _stanovoi._]\n\n"What is this chatterbox telling you about?" inquired the old uncle,\njoining the trio. "Aren\'t you ready for something to eat?"\n\nAt supper, the count by his reiterated praise of the viands, and his\nappetite, succeeded somewhat in pacifying Anna Fedorovna\'s unhappy state of\nmind. Afterwards the officers made their adieux, and went to their room.\nThe count shook hands with the old cavalier, and, to Anna Fedorovna\'s\nsurprise, with her, without offering to kiss her hand; and he also squeezed\nLiza\'s hand, at the same time looking straight into her eyes, and craftily\nsmiling his pleasing smile. This glance again somewhat disconcerted the\nmaiden. "He is very handsome," she said to herself, "only he is quite too\nconceited."\n\n\nXIV.\n\n"Well, now, aren\'t you ashamed?" exclaimed Polozof, when the two officers\nhad reached the privacy of their chamber. "I tried to lose, and I kept\nnudging you under the table. Now aren\'t you really ashamed? The poor old\nlady was quite beside herself."\n\nThe count burst into a terrible fit of laughter.\n\n"A most amusing dame! How abused she felt!"\n\nAnd again he began to laugh so heartily that even Johann, who was standing\nin front of him, cast down his eyes to conceal a smile. "And here is the\nson of an old family friend! Ha, ha, ha!" continued the count in a gale of\nlaughter.\n\n"No, indeed, it is not right. I felt really sorry for her," said the\ncornet.\n\n"What rubbish! How young you are! What! did you think that I was going to\nlose? Why should I lose? I only lose when I don\'t know any better. Ten\nrubles, brother, will come in handy. You must look on life in a practical\nway, or else you will always be a fool."\n\nPolozof made no answer: in the first place, he wanted to think by himself\nabout Liza, who seemed to him to be an extraordinarily pure and beautiful\ncreature.\n\nHe undressed, and lay down on the clean soft bed which had been made ready\nfor him.\n\n"How absurd all these honors and the glory of war!" he thought to himself,\ngazing at the window shaded by the shawl, through the interstices of which\ncrept the pale rays of the moon. "Here is happiness--to live in a quiet\nnook, with a gentle, bright, simple-hearted wife; that is enduring, true\nhappiness."\n\nBut somehow he did not communicate these imaginations to his friend; and he\ndid not even speak of the rustic maiden, though he felt sure that the count\nwas also thinking about her.\n\n"Why don\'t you undress?" he demanded of the count, who was walking up and\ndown the room.\n\n"Oh, I don\'t feel like sleeping! Put out the candle if you like," said he.\n"I can undress in the dark."\n\nAnd he continued to walk up and down.\n\n"He does not feel sleepy," repeated Polozof, who after the evening\'s\nexperiences felt more than ever dissatisfied with the count\'s influence\nupon him, and disposed to revolt against it. "I imagine," he reasoned,\nmentally addressing Turbin, "what thoughts are now trooping through that\nwell-combed head of yours. And I saw how she pleased you. But you are not\nthe kind to appreciate that simple-hearted, pure-minded creature. Mina is\nthe one for you, you want the epaulets of a colonel.--Indeed, I have a mind\nto ask him how he liked her."\n\nAnd Polozof was about to address him, but he deliberated: he felt that not\nonly he was not in the right frame of mind to discuss with him if the\ncount\'s glance at Liza was what he interpreted it to be, but that he should\nnot have the force of mind necessary for him to disagree with him, so\naccustomed was he to submit to an influence which for him grew each day\nmore burdensome and unrighteous.\n\n"Where are you going?" he asked, as the count took his cap and went to the\ndoor.\n\n"I am going to the stable; I wish to see if every thing is all right."\n\n"Strange!" thought the cornet; but he blew out the candle, and, trying to\ndispel the absurdly jealous and hostile thoughts that arose against his\nformer friend, he turned over on the other side.\n\nAnna Fedorovna meantime, having crossed herself, and kissed her brother,\nher daughter, and her _protegee_, as affectionately as usual, also retired\nto her room.\n\nLong had it been since the old lady had experienced in a single day so many\npowerful sensations. She could not even say her prayers in tranquillity;\nall the melancholy but vivid remembrances of the late count, and of this\nyoung dandy who had so ruthlessly taken advantage of her, kept coming up in\nher mind.\n\nNevertheless she undressed as usual, and drank a half glass of kvas which\nstood ready on the little table near the bed, and lay down. Her beloved cat\ncame softly into the room. Anna Fedorovna called her, and began to stroke\nher fur, and listen to her purring; but still she could not go to sleep.\n\n"It is the cat that disturbs me," she said to herself, and pushed her away.\nThe cat fell to the floor softly, and, slowly waving her bushy tail, got\nupon the oven;[87] and then the maid, who slept in the room on the floor,\nbrought her felt, and put out the candle, after lighting the night-lamp.\n\n[Footnote 87: The _lezhanka_, a part of the oven built out as a sort of\ncouch.]\n\nAt last the maid began to snore; but sleep still refused to come to Anna\nFedorovna, and calm her excited imagination. The face of the hussar\nconstantly arose before her mental vision, when she shut her eyes; and it\nseemed to her that it appeared in various strange guises in her room, when\nshe opened her eyes and looked at the commode, at the table, and her white\nraiment hanging up in the feeble light of the night-lamp. Then it seemed\nhot to her in the feather-bed, and the ticking of the watch on the table\nseemed unendurable; exasperating to the last degree, the snoring of the\nmaid. She wakened her, and bade her cease snoring.\n\nAgain the thoughts of the old count and of the young count, and of the game\nof _preference_, became strangely mixed in her mind. Now she seemed to see\nherself waltzing with the former count; she saw her own round white\nshoulders, she felt on them some one\'s kisses, and then she saw her\ndaughter in the young count\'s embrace.\n\nOnce more Ustiushka began to snore....\n\n"No, it\'s somehow different now, the men aren\'t the same. _He_ was ready to\nfling himself into the fire for my sake. Yes, I was worth doing it for! But\nthis one, have no fear, is sound asleep like a goose, instead of wooing.\nHow his father fell on his knees, and said, \'Whatever you desire I will do,\nI could kill myself in a moment; what do you desire?\' And he would have\nkilled himself, if I had bade him!"...\n\nSuddenly the sound of bare feet was heard in the corridor; and Liza with a\nshawl thrown over her came in pale and trembling, and almost fell on her\nmother\'s bed....\n\nAfter saying good-night to her mother, Liza had gone alone to the room that\nhad been her uncle\'s. Putting on a white jacket, throwing a handkerchief\nround her thick long braids, she put out the light, opened the window, and\ncurled up in a chair, turning her dreamy eyes to the pond which was now all\nshining with silver brilliancy.\n\nAll her ordinary occupations and interests came up before her now in an\nentirely different light. Her capricious old mother, unreasoning love for\nwhom had become a part of her very soul, her feeble but amiable old uncle,\nthe domestics, the peasants who worshipped their young mistress, the milch\ncows and the calves; all this nature which was forever the same in its\ncontinual death and resurrection, amid which she had grown up, with love\nfor others, and with the love of others for her,--all this that gave her\nthat gentle, agreeable peace of mind,--suddenly seemed to her something\ndifferent; it all seemed to her dismal, superfluous.\n\nIt was as though some one said to her, "Fool, fool! For twenty years you\nhave been occupied in trivialities, you have been serving others without\nreason, and you have not known what life, what happiness, were!"\n\nThis was what she thought now as she gazed down into the depths of the\nmotionless moonlit garden, and the thought came over her with vastly more\nforce than ever before. And what was it that induced this train of thought?\nIt was not in the least a sudden love for the count, as might easily be\nsupposed. On the contrary, he did not please her. It might rather have been\nthe cornet of whom she was thinking; but he was homely, poor, and taciturn.\n\n"No, it isn\'t that," she said to herself.\n\nHer ideal was so charming! It was an ideal which might have been loved in\nthe midst of this night, in the midst of this nature, without infringing\nits supernal beauty; an ideal not in the least circumscribed by the\nnecessity of reducing it to coarse reality.\n\nIn days gone by, her lonely situation, and the absence of people who might\nhave attracted her, caused that all the strength of the love which\nProvidence has implanted impartially in the hearts of each one of us, was\nstill intact and potential in her soul. But now she had been living too\nlong with the pathetic happiness of feeling that she possessed in her heart\nthis something, and occasionally opening the mysterious chalice of her\nheart, of rejoicing in the contemplation of its riches, ready to pour out\nwithout stint on some one all that it contained.\n\nGod grant that she may not have to take this melancholy delight with her to\nthe tomb! But who knows if there be any better and more powerful delight,\nor if it is not the only true and possible one?\n\n"O Father in heaven," she thought, "is it possible that I have lost my\nyouth and my happiness, and that they will never return?... Will they never\nreturn again? is it really true?"\n\nShe gazed in the direction of the moon at the bright far-off sky, studded\nwith white wavy clouds, which, as they swept on toward the moon, blotted\nout the little stars.\n\n"If the moon should seize that little cloud above it, then it means that it\nis true," she thought. A thin smoke-like strip of cloud passed over the\nlower half of the brilliant orb, and gradually the light grew fainter on\nthe turf, on the linden tops, on the pond: the black shadows of the trees\ngrew less distinct. And as though to harmonize with the gloomy shade which\nwas enveloping nature, a gentle breeze stirred through the leaves, and\nbrought to the window the dewy fragrance of the leaves, the moist earth,\nand the blooming lilacs.\n\n"No, it is not true!" she said, trying to console herself; "but if the\nnightingale should sing this night, then I should take it to mean that all\nmy forebodings are nonsense, and that there is no need of losing hope."\n\nAnd long she sat in silence, as though expecting some one, while once more\nall grew bright and full of life; and then again and again the clouds\npassed over the moon, and all became sombre.\n\nShe was even beginning to grow drowsy, as she sat there by the window, when\nshe was aroused by the nightingale\'s melodious trills clearly echoing\nacross the pond. The rustic maiden opened her eyes. Once more, with a new\nenjoyment, her whole soul was dedicated to that mysterious union with the\nnature which so calmly and serenely spread out before her.\n\nShe leaned on both elbows. A certain haunting sensation of gentle\nmelancholy oppressed her heart; and tears of pure, deep love, burning for\nsatisfaction, good consoling tears, sprang to her eyes.\n\nShe leaned her arms on the window-sill, and rested her head upon them. Her\nfavorite prayer seemed of its own accord to arise in her soul, and thus she\nfell asleep with moist eyes.\n\nThe pressure of some one\'s hand awakened her. She started up. But the touch\nwas gentle and pleasant. The hand squeezed hers with a stronger pressure.\n\nSuddenly she realized the true state of things, screamed, tore herself\naway; and trying to make herself believe that it was not the count who,\nbathed in the brilliant moonlight, was standing in front of her window, she\nhastened from the room.\n\n\nXV.\n\nIt was indeed the count. When he heard the maiden\'s cry, and the cough of\nthe watchman who was coming from the other side of the fence in reply to\nthe shriek, he had the sensation of being a thief caught in the act, and\nstarted to run across the dew-drenched grass, so as to hide in the depths\nof the garden.\n\n"Oh, what a fool I was!" he said instinctively. "I frightened her. I ought\nto have been more gentle, to have wakened her by gentle words. Oh! I am a\nbeast, a blundering beast."\n\nHe paused and listened. The watchman had come through the wicket-gate into\nthe garden, dragging his cane along the sanded walk.\n\nHe must hide. He went toward the pond. The frogs made him tremble as they\nhastily sprang from under his very feet into the water. There,\nnotwithstanding his wet feet, he crouched down on his heels, and, began to\nrecall all he had done,--how he had crept through the hedge, found her\nwindow, and at last caught a glimpse of a white shadow; how several times,\nwhile on the watch for the least noise, he had hastened away from the\nwindow; how at one moment it seemed to him that doubtless she was waiting\nfor him with vexation in her heart that he was so dilatory, and the next\nhow impossible it seemed that she would make an appointment with him so\neasily; and how, finally coming to the conclusion, that, through the\nembarrassment naturally felt by a country maiden, she was only pretending\nto be asleep, he had resolutely gone up to the window, and seen clearly her\nposition, and then suddenly, for some occult reason, had run away again;\nand only after a powerful effort of self-control, being ashamed of his\ncowardice, he had gone boldly up to her and touched her on the hand.\n\nThe watchman again coughed, and, shutting the squeaky gate, went out of the\ngarden. The window in the young girl\'s room was shut, and the wooden\nshutters inside were drawn.\n\nThe count was terribly disappointed to see this. He would have given a good\ndeal to have a chance to begin it all over again; he would not have acted\nso stupidly.\n\n"A marvellous girl! what freshness! simply charming! And so I lost her.\nStupid beast that I was."\n\nHowever, as he was not in the mood to go to sleep yet, he walked, as chance\nshould lead, along the path, through the linden alley, with the resolute\nsteps of a man who has been angry. And now for him also this night brought,\nas its gifts of reconciliation, a strange, calming melancholy, and a\ncraving for love.\n\nThe clay path, here and there dotted with sprouting grass or dry twigs, was\nlighted by patches of pale light where the moon sent its rays straight\nthrough the thick foliage of the lindens. Here and there a bending bough,\napparently overgrown with gray moss, gleamed on one side. The silvered\nfoliage occasionally rustled.\n\nAt the house there was no light in the windows; all sounds were hushed,\nonly the nightingale filled with his song all the immensity of silent and\nglorious space.\n\n"My God! what a night! what a marvellous night!" thought the count,\nbreathing in the fresh fragrance of the garden. "Something makes me feel\nblue, as though I were dissatisfied with myself and with others, and\ndissatisfied with my whole life. But what a splendid, dear girl! Perhaps\nshe was really offended." Here his fancies changed. He imagined himself\nthere in the garden with this district maiden in various and most\nremarkable situations; then his mistress Mina supplanted the maiden\'s\nplace.\n\n"What a fool I am! I ought simply to have put my arm around her waist, and\nkissed her."\n\nAnd with this regret the count returned to his room. The cornet was not yet\nasleep. He immediately turned over in bed, and looked at the count.\n\n"Aren\'t you asleep?" asked the count.\n\n"No."\n\n"Shall I tell you what happened?"\n\n"Well."\n\n"No, I\'d better not tell you.... Yes, I will too. Move your legs over a\nlittle."\n\nAnd the count, who had already given up vain regret for his unsuccessful\nintrigue, sat down with a gay smile on his comrade\'s bed. "Could you\nimagine that the young lady of the house gave me a rendezvous?"\n\n"What is that you say?" screamed Polozof, leaping up in bed.\n\n"Well, now listen."\n\n"But how? When? It can\'t be!"\n\n"See here: while you were making out your accounts in _preference_, she\ntold me that she would this night be sitting at the window, and that it was\npossible to get in at that window. Now, this is what it means to be a\npractical man: while you were there reckoning up with the old woman, I was\narranging this little affair. You yourself heard her say right out in your\npresence, that she was going to sit at the window to-night, and look at\nthe pond."\n\n"Yes, but she said that without any meaning in it."\n\n"I am not so sure whether she said it purposely or otherwise. Maybe she did\nnot wish to come at it all at once, only it looked like that. But a\nwretched piece of work came out of it. Like a perfect fool I spoilt the\nwhole thing," he added, scornfully smiling at himself.\n\n"Well, what is it? Where have you been?"\n\nThe count told him the whole story, with the exception of his irresolute\nand repeated advances. "I spoilt it myself; I ought to have been bolder.\nShe screamed, and ran away from the window."\n\n"Then she screamed and ran away?" repeated the cornet, replying with a\nconstrained smile to the count\'s smile, which had such a long and powerful\ninfluence upon him.\n\n"Yes, but now it\'s time to go to sleep."\n\nPolozof again turned his back to the door, and lay in silence for ten\nminutes. God knows what was going on in his soul; but when he turned over\nagain, his face was full of passion and resolution.\n\n"Count Turbin," said he in a broken voice.\n\n"Are you dreaming, or not?" replied the count calmly. "What is it, cornet\nPolozof?"\n\n"Count Turbin, you are a scoundrel," cried Polozof, and he sprang from the\nbed.\n\n\nXVI.\n\nThe next day the battalion departed. The officers did not see any of the\nhousehold, or bid them farewell. Neither did they speak together.\n\nIt was understood that they were to fight their duel when they came to the\nnext halting-place. But Captain Schultz, a good comrade, an admirable\nhorseman, who was loved by everybody in the regiment, and had been chosen\nby the count for his second, succeeded in arranging the affair in such a\nmanner that not only they did not fight, but that no one in the regiment\nknew about the matter; and Turbin and Polozof, though their old relations\nof friendship were never restored, still said "thou," and met at meals and\nat the gaming-table.\n\n\n\n\nTHREE DEATHS\n\n_A TALE._\n\n1859.\n\n\nI.\n\nIt was autumn.\n\nAlong the highway came two equipages at a brisk pace. In the first carriage\nsat two women. One was a lady, thin and pale. The other, her maid, with a\nbrilliant red complexion, and plump. Her short, dry locks escaped from\nunder a faded cap; her red hand, in a torn glove, put them back with a\njerk. Her full bosom, incased in a tapestry shawl, breathed of health; her\nrestless black eyes now gazed through the window at the fields hurrying by\nthem, now rested on her mistress, now peered solicitously into the corners\nof the coach.\n\nBefore the maid\'s face swung the lady\'s bonnet on the rack; on her knees\nlay a puppy; her feet were raised by packages lying on the floor, and could\nalmost be heard drumming upon them above the noise of the creaking of the\nsprings, and the rattling of the windows.\n\nThe lady, with her hands resting in her lap and her eyes shut, feebly\nswayed on the cushions which supported her back, and, slightly frowning,\nstruggled with a cough.\n\nShe wore a white nightcap, and a blue neckerchief twisted around her\ndelicate pale neck. A straight line, disappearing under the cap, parted her\nblonde hair, which was smoothly pomaded; and there was a dry, deathly\nappearance about the whiteness of the skin in this simple parting. The\nwithered and rather sallow skin was loosely drawn over her delicate and\npretty features, and there was a hectic flush on the cheeks and\ncheek-bones. Her lips were dry and restless, her thin eyelashes had lost\ntheir curve, and a cloth travelling capote made straight folds over her\nsunken chest. Although her eyes were closed, her face gave the impression\nof weariness, irascibility, and habitual suffering.\n\nThe lackey, leaning back, was napping on the coach-box. The hired\ndriver,[88] shouting in a clear voice, urged on his four powerful and\nsweaty horses, occasionally looking back at the other driver, who was\nshouting just behind them in an open barouche. The tires of the wheels, in\ntheir even and rapid course, left wide parallel tracks on the limy mud of\nthe highway.\n\n[Footnote 88: _yamshchik._]\n\nThe sky was gray and cold, a moist mist was falling over the fields and the\nroad. It was suffocating in the carriage, and smelt of eau-de-cologne and\ndust. The invalid leaned back her head, and slowly opened her eyes. Her\ngreat eyes were brilliant, and of a beautiful dark color. "Again!" said\nshe, nervously pushing away with her beautiful attenuated hand the end of\nher maid\'s cloak, which occasionally hit against her knee. Her mouth\ncontracted painfully.\n\nMatriosha raised her cloak in both hands, lifting herself up on her strong\nlegs, and then sat down again, farther away. Her fresh face was suffused\nwith a brilliant scarlet.\n\nThe invalid\'s handsome dark eyes eagerly followed the maid\'s motions; and\nthen with both hands she took hold of the seat, and did her best to raise\nherself a little higher, but her strength was not sufficient.\n\nAgain her mouth became contracted, and her whole face took on an expression\nof unavailing, angry irony.\n\n"If you would only help me.... Ah! It\'s not necessary. I can do it myself.\nOnly have the goodness not to put those pillows behind me.... On the whole,\nyou had better not touch them, if you don\'t understand!"\n\nThe lady closed her eyes, and then again, quickly raising the lids, gazed\nat her maid.\n\nMatriosha looked at her, and gnawed her red lower lip. A heavy sigh escaped\nfrom the sick woman\'s breast; but the sigh was not ended, but was merged in\na fit of coughing. She scowled, and turned her face away, clutching her\nchest with both hands. When the coughing fit was over, she once more shut\nher eyes, and continued to sit motionless. The coach and the barouche\nrolled into the village. Matriosha drew her fat hand from under her shawl,\nand made the sign of the cross.\n\n"What is this?" demanded the lady.\n\n"A post-station, madame."\n\n"Why did you cross yourself, I should like to know?"\n\n"The church, madame."\n\nThe lady looked out of the window, and began slowly to cross herself,\ngazing with all her eyes at the great village church, in front of which the\ninvalid\'s carriage was now passing.\n\nThe two vehicles came to a stop together at the post-house. The sick\nwoman\'s husband and the doctor dismounted from the barouche, and came to\nthe coach.\n\n"How are you feeling?" asked the doctor, taking her pulse.\n\n"Well, my dear, aren\'t you fatigued?" asked the husband, in French.\n"Wouldn\'t you like to go out?"\n\nMatriosha, gathering up the bundles, squeezed herself into the corner, so\nas not to interfere with the conversation.\n\n"No matter, it\'s all the same thing," replied the invalid. "I will not get\nout."\n\nThe husband, after standing there a little while, went into the post-house.\nMatriosha, jumping from the carriage, tiptoed across the muddy road, into\nthe enclosure.\n\n"If I am miserable, there is no reason why the rest of you should not have\nbreakfast," said the sick woman, smiling faintly to the doctor, who was\nstanding by her window.\n\n"It makes no difference to them how I am," she remarked to herself as the\ndoctor, turning from her with slow step, started to run up the steps of the\nstation-house. "They are well, and it\'s all the same to them. O my God!"\n\n"How now, Eduard Ivanovitch," said the husband, as he met the doctor, and\nrubbing his hands with a gay smile. "I have ordered my travelling-case\nbrought; what do you say to that?"\n\n"That\'s worth while," replied the doctor.\n\n"Well now, how about _her_?" asked the husband with a sigh, lowering his\nvoice and raising his brows.\n\n"I have told you that she cannot reach Moscow, much less Italy, especially\nin such weather."\n\n"What is to be done, then? Oh! my God! my God!"\n\nThe husband covered his eyes with his hand.... "Give it here," he added,\naddressing his man, who came bringing the travelling-case.\n\n"You\'ll have to stop somewhere on the route," replied the doctor, shrugging\nhis shoulders.\n\n"But tell me, how can that be done?" rejoined the husband. "I have done\nevery thing to keep her from going: I have spoken to her of our means, and\nof our children whom we should have to leave behind, and of my business.\nShe would not hear a word. She has made her plans for living abroad, as\nthough she were well. But if I should tell her what her real condition is,\nit would kill her."\n\n"Well, she is a dead woman now: you may as well know it, Vasili Dmitritch.\nA person cannot live without lungs, and there is no way of making lungs\ngrow again. It is melancholy, it is hard, but what is to be done about it?\nIt is my business and yours to make her last days as easy as possible. It\nis the confessor that is needed here."\n\n"Oh, my God! Now just perceive how I am situated, in speaking to her of her\nlast will. Let come whatever may, yet I cannot speak of that. And yet you\nknow how good she is."\n\n"Try at least to persuade her to wait until the roads are frozen," said the\ndoctor, shaking his head significantly: "something might happen during the\njourney."\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n"Aksiusha, oh, Aksiusha!" cried the superintendent\'s daughter, throwing a\ncloak over her head and tiptoeing down the muddy back steps. "Come along.\nLet us have a look at the Shirkinskaya lady: they say she\'s got\nlung-trouble, and they\'re taking her abroad. I never saw how any one looked\nin consumption."\n\nAksiusha jumped down from the door-sill; and the two girls, hand in hand,\nhurried out of the gates. Shortening their steps, they walked by the coach,\nand stared in at the lowered window. The invalid bent her head toward them;\nbut when she saw their inquisitiveness, she frowned and turned away.\n\n"Oh, de-e-ar!" said the superintendent\'s daughter, vigorously shaking her\nhead.... "How wonderfully pretty she used to be, and how she has changed!\nIt is terrible! Did you see? Did you see, Aksiusha?"\n\n"Yes, but how thin she is!" assented Aksiusha. "Let us go by and look\nagain; we\'ll make believe go to the well. Did you see, she turned away from\nus; still I got a good view of her. Isn\'t it too bad, Masha?"\n\n"Yes, but what terrible mud!" replied Masha, and both of them started to\nrun back within the gates.\n\n"It\'s evident that I have become a fright," thought the sick woman.... "But\nwe must hurry, hurry, and get abroad, and there I shall soon get well."\n\n"Well, and how are you, my dear?" inquired the husband, coming to the\ncarriage with still a morsel of something in his mouth.\n\n"Always one and the same question," thought the sick woman, "and he\'s even\neating!"\n\n"It\'s no consequence," she murmured between her teeth.\n\n"Do you know, my dear, I am afraid that this journey in such weather will\nonly make you worse. Eduard Ivanovitch says the same thing. Hadn\'t we\nbetter turn back?"\n\nShe maintained an angry silence.\n\n"The weather will improve maybe, the roads will become good, and that would\nbe better for you; then at least we could start all together."\n\n"Pardon me. If I had not listened to you so long, I should at this moment\nbe at Berlin and have entirely recovered."\n\n"What\'s to be done, my angel? it was impossible, as you know. But now if\nyou would wait a month, you would be ever so much better; I could finish up\nmy business, and we could take the children with us."\n\n"The children are well, and I am ill."\n\n"But just see here, my love, if in this weather you should grow worse on\nthe road.... At least we should be at home."\n\n"What is the use of being at home?... _Die_ at home?" replied the invalid\npeevishly.\n\nBut the word _die_ evidently startled her, and she turned upon her husband\na supplicating and inquiring look. He dropped his eyes, and said nothing.\n\nThe sick woman\'s mouth suddenly contracted in a childish fashion, and the\ntears sprang to her eyes. Her husband covered his face with his\nhandkerchief, and silently turned from the carriage.\n\n"No, I will go," cried the invalid; and lifting her eyes to the sky, she\nclasped her hands, and began to whisper incoherent words. "My God! why must\nit be?" she said, and the tears flowed more violently. She prayed long and\nfervently, but still there was just the same sense of constriction and pain\nin her chest, just the same gray melancholy in the sky and the fields and\nthe road; just the same autumnal mist, neither thicker nor more tenuous,\nbut ever the same in its monotony, falling on the muddy highway, on the\nroofs, on the carriage, and on the sheep-skin coats of the drivers, who\nwere talking in strong, gay voices, as they were oiling and adjusting the\ncarriage.\n\n\nII.\n\nThe coach was ready, but the driver loitered. He had gone into the driver\'s\ncottage,[89] where it was warm, close, dark, and suffocating; smelling of\nhuman occupation, of cooking bread, of cabbage, and of sheep-skin garments.\n\n[Footnote 89: _izba._]\n\nSeveral drivers were in the room; the cook was engaged near the oven, on\ntop of which lay a sick man wrapped up in pelts.\n\n"Uncle Khveodor! hey! Uncle Khveodor," called a young man, the driver, in a\ntulup, and with his knout in his belt, coming into the room, and addressing\nthe sick man.\n\n"What do you want, rattlepate? What are you calling to Fyedka[90] for?"\ndemanded one of the drivers. "There\'s your carriage waiting for you."\n\n[Footnote 90: Fyedka and Fyedya are diminutives of Feodor, Theodore.]\n\n"I want to borrow his boots. Mine are worn out," replied the young fellow,\ntossing back his curls and straightening his mittens in his belt. "Why? is\nhe asleep? Say, Uncle Khveodor!" he insisted, going to the oven.\n\n"What is it?" a weak voice was heard saying, and a blowsy, emaciated face\nwas lifted up from the oven.\n\nA broad, gaunt hand, bloodless and covered with hairs, pulled up his\novercoat over the dirty shirt that covered his bony shoulder. "Give me\nsomething to drink, brother; what is it you want?"\n\nThe young fellow handed him a small dish of water.\n\n"I say, Fyedya," said he, hesitating, "I reckon you won\'t want your new\nboots now; let me have them? Probably you won\'t need them any more."\n\nThe sick man dropping his weary head down to the lacquered bowl, and\ndipping his thin, hanging mustache in the brown water, drank feebly and\neagerly.\n\nHis tangled beard was unclean; his sunken, clouded eyes were with\ndifficulty raised to the young man\'s face. When he had finished drinking,\nhe tried to raise his hand to wipe his wet lips, but his strength failed\nhim, and he wiped them on the sleeve of his overcoat. Silently, and\nbreathing with difficulty through his nose, he looked straight into the\nyoung man\'s eyes, and tried to collect his strength.\n\n"Maybe you have promised them to some one else?" said the young driver. "If\nthat\'s so, all right. The worst of it is, it is wet outside, and I have to\ngo out to my work, and so I said to myself, \'I reckon I\'ll ask Fyedka for\nhis boots; I reckon he won\'t be needing them.\' But maybe you will need\nthem,--just say"....\n\nSomething began to bubble up and rumble in the sick man\'s chest; he bent\nover, and began to strangle, with a cough that rattled in his throat.\n\n"Now I should like to know where he would need them?" unexpectedly snapped\nout the cook, angrily addressing the whole hovel. "This is the second month\nthat he has not crept down from the oven. Just see how he is all broken up!\nand you can hear how it must hurt him inside. Where would he need boots?\nThey would not think of burying him in new ones! And it was time long ago,\nGod pardon me the sin of saying so. Just see how he chokes! He ought to be\ntaken from this hovel to another, or somewhere. They say there\'s hospitals\nin the city; but what\'s you going to do? he takes up the whole room, and\nthat\'s too much. There isn\'t any room at all. And yet you are expected to\nkeep neat."\n\n"Hey! Seryoha, come along, take your place, the people are waiting," cried\nthe head man of the station, coming to the door.\n\nSeryoha started to go without waiting for his reply, but the sick man\nduring his cough intimated by his eyes that he was going to speak.\n\n"You can take the boots, Seryoha," said he, conquering the cough and\ngetting his breath a little. "Only, do you hear, buy me a stone when I am\ndead," he added hoarsely.\n\n"Thank you, uncle; then I will take them, and as for the\nstone,--_ei-ei!_--I will buy you one."\n\n"There, children, you are witnesses," the sick man was able to articulate,\nand then once more he bent over and began to choke.\n\n"All right, we have heard," said one of the drivers. "But run, Seryoha, or\nelse the starosta will be after you again. You know Lady Shirkinskaya is\nsick."\n\nSeryoha quickly pulled off his ragged, unwieldy boots, and flung them under\nthe bench. Uncle Feodor\'s fitted his feet exactly, and the young driver\ncould not keep his eyes off them as he went to the carriage.\n\n"_Ek!_ what splendid boots! Here\'s some grease," called another driver with\nthe grease-pot in his hand, as Seryoha mounted to his box and gathered up\nthe reins. "Get them for nothing?"\n\n"So you\'re jealous, are you?" cried Seryoha, lifting up and tucking around\nhis legs the tails of his overcoat. "Off with you, my darlings," he cried\nto the horses, cracking his knout; and the coach and barouche with their\noccupants, trunks, and other belongings, were hidden in the thick autumnal\nmist, and rapidly whirled away over the wet road.\n\nThe sick driver remained on the oven in the stifling hovel, and, not being\nable to throw off the phlegm, by a supreme effort turned over on the\nother-side, and stopped coughing.\n\nTill evening there was a continual coming and going, and eating of meals in\nthe hovel, and the sick man was not noticed. Before night came on, the cook\nclimbed upon the oven, and pulled off the sheep-skin from his legs.\n\n"Don\'t be angry with me, Nastasya," murmured the sick man. "I shall soon\nleave you your room."\n\n"All right, all right, it\'s of no consequence. But what is the matter with\nyou, uncle? Tell me."\n\n"All my innards are gnawed out, God knows what it is!"\n\n"And I don\'t doubt your gullet hurts you when you cough so?"\n\n"It hurts me all over. My death is at hand, that\'s what it is. _Okh! Okh!\nOkh!_" groaned the sick man.\n\n"Now cover up your legs this way," said Nastasya, comfortably arranging the\novercoat so that it would cover him, and then getting down from the oven.\n\nDuring the night the hovel was faintly lighted by a single taper. Nastasya\nand a dozen drivers were sleeping, snoring loudly, on the floor and the\nbenches. Only the sick man feebly choked and coughed, and tossed on the\noven.\n\nIn the morning no sound was heard from him.\n\n"I saw something wonderful in my sleep," said the cook, as she stretched\nherself in the early twilight the next morning. "I seemed to see Uncle\nKhveodor get down from the oven, and go out to cut wood. \'Look here,\' says\nhe, \'I\'m going to help you, Nasya;\' and I says to him, \'How can you split\nwood?\' but he seizes the hatchet, and begins to cut so fast, so fast that\nnothing but chips fly. \'Why,\' says I, \'ain\'t you been sick?\'--\'No,\' says\nhe, \'I am well,\' and he kind of lifted up the axe, and I was scared; and I\nscreamed and woke up. He can\'t be dead, can he?--Uncle Khveodor! hey,\nuncle!"\n\nFeodor did not move.\n\n"Now he can\'t be dead, can he? Go and see," said one of the drivers who had\njust waked up. The emaciated hand, covered with reddish hair, that hung\ndown from the oven, was cold and pale.\n\n"Go tell the superintendent; it seems he is dead," said the driver.\n\nFeodor had no relatives. He was a stranger. On the next day they buried him\nin the new burying-ground behind the grove; and Nastasya for many days had\nto tell everybody of the dream which she had seen, and how she had been the\nfirst to discover that Uncle Feodor was dead.\n\n\nIII.\n\nSpring had come.\n\nAlong the wet streets of the city swift streamlets ran purling between bits\nof ice; bright were the colors of people\'s dresses and the tones of their\nvoices, as they hurried along. In the walled gardens, the buds on the trees\nwere bourgeoning, and the fresh breeze swayed their branches with a soft\ngentle murmur. Everywhere transparent drops were forming and falling....\n\nThe sparrows chattered incoherently, and fluttered about on their little\nwings. On the sunny side, on the walls, houses, and trees, all was full of\nlife and brilliancy. The sky, and the earth, and the heart of man\noverflowed with youth and joy.\n\nIn front of a great seignorial mansion, in one of the principal streets,\nfresh straw was laid; in the house lay that same invalid whom we saw\nhastening abroad.\n\nNear the closed doors of the house stood the sick lady\'s husband, and a\nlady well along in years. On a sofa sat the confessor, with cast-down eyes,\nholding something wrapped up under his stole.[91] In one corner, in a\nVoltaire easy-chair, reclined an old lady, the sick woman\'s mother, weeping\nviolently.\n\n[Footnote 91: Called _epitrachilion_ in the Greek Church.]\n\nNear her the maid stood holding a clean handkerchief, ready for the old\nlady\'s use when she should ask for it. Another maid was rubbing the old\nlady\'s temples, and blowing on her gray head underneath her cap.\n\n"Well, Christ be with you, my dear," said the husband to the elderly lady\nwho was standing with him near the door: "she has such confidence in you;\nyou know how to talk with her; go and speak with her a little while, my\ndarling, please go!"\n\nHe was about to open the door for her; but his cousin held him back,\nputting her handkerchief several times to her eyes, and shaking her head.\n\n"There, now she will not see that I have been weeping," said she, and,\nopening the door herself, went to the invalid.\n\nThe husband was in the greatest excitement, and seemed quite beside\nhimself. He started to go over to the old mother, but after taking a few\nsteps he turned around, walked the length of the room, and approached the\npriest.\n\nThe priest looked at him, raised his brows toward heaven, and sighed. The\nthick gray beard also was lifted and fell again.\n\n"My God! my God!" said the husband.\n\n"What can you do?" exclaimed the confessor, sighing and again lifting up\nhis brows and beard, and letting them drop.\n\n"And the old mother there!" exclaimed the husband, almost in despair. "She\nwill not be able to endure it. You see, she loved her so, she loved her so,\nthat she.... I don\'t know. You might try, holy father,[92] to calm her a\nlittle, and persuade her to go away."\n\n[Footnote 92: _batiushka._]\n\nThe confessor arose and went over to the old lady.\n\n"It is true, no one can appreciate a mother\'s heart," said he, "but God is\ncompassionate."\n\nThe old lady\'s face was suddenly convulsed, and a hysterical sob shook her\nframe.\n\n"God is compassionate," repeated the priest, when she had grown a little\ncalmer. "I will tell you, in my parish there was a sick man, and much worse\nthan Marya Dmitrievna, and he, though he was only a shopkeeper,[93] was\ncured in a very short time, by means of herbs. And this very same\nshopkeeper is now in Moscow. I have told Vasili Dmitrievitch about him; it\nmight be tried, you know. At all events, it would satisfy the invalid. With\nGod, all things are possible."\n\n[Footnote 93: _meshchanin._]\n\n"No, she won\'t get well," persisted the old lady. "Why should God have\ntaken her, and not me?"\n\nAnd again the hysterical sobbing overcame her so violently that she fainted\naway.\n\nThe invalid\'s husband hid his face in his hands, and rushed from the room.\n\nIn the corridor the first person whom he met was a six-year-old boy, who\nwas chasing his little sister with all his might and main.\n\n"Do you bid me take the children to their mamma?" inquired the nurse.\n\n"No, she is not able to see them. They distract her."\n\nThe lad stopped for a moment, and after looking eagerly into his father\'s\nface, he cut a dido with his leg, and with merry shouts ran on. "I\'m\nplaying she\'s a horse, papasha," cried the little fellow, pointing to his\nsister.\n\nMeantime, in the next room, the cousin had taken her seat near the sick\nwoman, and was skilfully bringing the conversation by degrees round so as\nto prepare her for the thought of death. The doctor stood by the window,\nmixing some draught.\n\nThe invalid in a white dressing-gown, all surrounded by cushions, was\nsitting up in bed, and gazed silently at her cousin.\n\n"Ah, my dear!" she exclaimed, unexpectedly interrupting her, "don\'t try to\nprepare me; don\'t treat me like a little child! I am a Christian woman. I\nknow all about it. I know that I have not long to live; I know that if my\nhusband had heeded me sooner, I should have been in Italy, and possibly,\nyes probably, should have been well by this time. They all told him so. But\nwhat is to be done? it\'s as God saw fit. We all of us have sinned, I know\nthat; but I hope in the mercy of God, that all will be pardoned, ought to\nbe pardoned. I am trying to sound my own heart. I also have committed many\nsins, my love. But how much I have suffered in atonement! I have tried to\nbear my sufferings patiently"....\n\n"Then shall I have the confessor come in, my love? It will be all the\neasier for you, after you have been absolved," said the cousin.\n\nThe sick woman dropped her head in token of assent. "O God! pardon me a\nsinner," she whispered.\n\nThe cousin went out, and beckoned to the confessor. "She is an angel," she\nsaid to the husband, with tears in her eyes. The husband wept. The priest\nwent into the sick-room; the old lady still remained unconscious, and in\nthe room beyond all was perfectly quiet. At the end of five minutes the\nconfessor came out, and, taking off his stole, arranged his hair.\n\n"Thanks be to the Lord, she is calmer now," said he. "She wishes to see\nyou."\n\nThe cousin and the husband went to the sick-room. The invalid, gently\nweeping, was gazing at the images.\n\n"I congratulate you, my love," said the husband.\n\n"Thank you. How well I feel now! what ineffable joy I experience!" said the\nsick woman, and a faint smile played over her thin lips. "How merciful God\nis! Is it not so? He is merciful and omnipotent!" And again with an eager\nprayer she turned her tearful eyes towards the holy images.\n\nThen suddenly something seemed to occur to her mind. She beckoned to her\nhusband.\n\n"You are never willing to do what I desire," said she in a weak and\nquerulous voice.\n\nThe husband, stretching his neck, listened to her submissively.\n\n"What is it, my love?"\n\n"How many times I have told you that these doctors don\'t know any thing!\nThere are uneducated women doctors: they make cures. That\'s what the good\nfather said.... A shopkeeper.... send for him"....\n\n"For whom, my love?"\n\n"Good heavens! you can never understand me." And the dying woman frowned,\nand closed her eyes.\n\nThe doctor came to her, and took her hand. Her pulse was evidently growing\nfeebler and feebler. He made a sign to the husband. The sick woman remarked\nthis gesture, and looked around in fright. The cousin turned away to hide\nher tears.\n\n"Don\'t weep, don\'t torment yourselves on my account," said the invalid.\n"That takes away from me my last comfort."\n\n"You are an angel!" exclaimed the cousin, kissing her hand.\n\n"No, kiss me here. They only kiss the hands of those who are dead. My God!\nmy God!"\n\nThat same evening the sick woman was a corpse, and the corpse in the\ncoffin lay in the parlor of the great mansion. In the immense room, the\ndoors of which were closed, sat the clerk,[94] and with a monotonous voice\nread the Psalms of David through his nose.\n\n[Footnote 94: _diachok._]\n\nThe bright glare from the wax candles in the lofty silver candelabra fell\non the white brow of the dead, on the heavy waxen hands, on the stiff folds\nof the cerement which brought out into awful relief the knees and the feet.\n\nThe clerk, not varying his tones, continued to read on steadily, and in the\nsilence of the chamber of death his words rang out and died away.\nOccasionally from distant rooms came the voice of children and their\nromping.\n\n"_Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their breath,\nthey die and return to their dust._\n\n"_Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the\nface of the earth._\n\n"_The glory of the Lord shall endure forever: the Lord shall rejoice in his\nworks._"\n\nThe face of the dead was stern and majestic. But there was no motion either\non the pure cold brow, or the firmly closed lips. She was all attention.\nBut did she perhaps now understand these grand words?\n\n\nIV.\n\nAt the end of a month, over the grave of the dead a stone chapel was\nerected. Over the driver\'s there was as yet no stone, and only the fresh\ngreen grass sprouted over the mound that served as the sole record of the\npast existence of a man.\n\n"It will be a sin and a shame, Seryoha," said the cook at the station-house\none day, "if you don\'t buy a gravestone for Khveodor. You kept saying,\n\'It\'s winter, winter,\' but now why don\'t you keep your word? I heard it\nall. He has already come back once to ask why you don\'t do it; if you don\'t\nbuy him one, he will come again, he will choke you."\n\n"Well, now, have I denied it?" urged Seryoha. "I am going to buy him a\nstone, as I said I would. I can get one for a ruble and a half. I have not\nforgotten about it; I\'ll have to get it. As soon as I happen to be in town,\nthen I\'ll buy him one."\n\n"You ought at least to put up a cross, that\'s what you ought to do," said\nan old driver. "It isn\'t right at all. You\'re wearing those boots now."\n\n"Yes. But where could I get him a cross? You wouldn\'t want to make one out\nof an old piece of stick, would you?"\n\n"What is that you say? Make one out of an old piece of stick? No; take your\naxe, go out to the wood a little earlier than usual, and you can hew him\nout one. Take a little ash-tree, and you can make one. You can have a\ncovered cross. If you go then, you won\'t have to give the watchman a little\ndrink of vodka. One doesn\'t want to give vodka for every trifle. Now,\nyesterday I broke my axletree, and I go and hew out a new one of green\nwood. No one said a word."\n\nEarly the next morning, almost before dawn, Seryoha took his axe, and went\nto the wood.\n\nOver all things hung a cold, dead veil of falling mist, as yet untouched by\nthe rays of the sun.\n\nThe cast gradually grew brighter, reflecting its pale light over the vault\nof heaven still covered by light clouds. Not a single grass-blade below,\nnot a single leaf on the topmost branches of the tree-top, waved. Only from\ntime to time could be heard the sounds of fluttering wings in the thicket,\nor a rustling on the ground broke in upon the silence of the forest.\n\nSuddenly a strange sound, foreign to this nature, resounded and died away\nat the edge of the forest. Again the noise sounded, and was monotonously\nrepeated again and again, at the foot of one of the ancient, immovable\ntrees. A tree-top began to shake in an extraordinary manner; the juicy\nleaves whispered something; and the warbler, sitting on one of the\nbranches, flew off a couple of times with a shrill cry, and, wagging its\ntail, finally perched on another tree.\n\nThe axe rang more and more frequently; the white chips, full of sap, were\nscattered upon the dewy grass, and a slight cracking was heard beneath the\nblows.\n\nThe tree trembled with all its body, leaned over, and quickly straightened\nitself with a fearful shudder on its base.\n\nFor an instant all was still, then once more the tree bent over; a crash\nwas heard in its trunk; and tearing the thicket, and dragging down the\nbranches, it plunged toward the damp earth.\n\nThe noise of the axe and of footsteps ceased.\n\nThe warbler uttered a cry, and flew higher. The branch which she grazed\nwith her wings shook for an instant, and then came to rest like all the\nothers with their foliage.\n\nThe trees, more joyously than ever, extended their branches over the new\nspace that had been made in their midst.\n\nThe first sunbeams, breaking through the cloud, gleamed in the sky, and\nshone along the earth and heavens.\n\nThe mist, in billows, began to float along the hollows; the dew, gleaming,\nplayed on the green foliage; translucent white clouds hurried along their\nazure path.\n\nThe birds hopped about in the thicket, and, as though beside themselves,\nvoiced their happiness; the juicy leaves joyfully and contentedly whispered\non the tree-tops; and the branches of the living trees slowly and\nmajestically waved over the dead and fallen tree.\n\n\n\n\nA PRISONER IN THE CAUCASUS.\n\n\nI.\n\nA Russian of rank was serving as an officer in the army of the Caucasus.\nHis name was Zhilin.\n\nThere came to him one day a letter from his home. His aged mother wrote\nhim: "I am now getting along in years, and before I die I should like to\nsee my beloved son. Come and bid me farewell, lay me in the ground, and\nthen with my blessing return again to your service. And I have been finding\na bride for you, and she is intelligent and handsome and has property. If\nyou like, you can marry and settle down together."\n\nZhilin cogitated, "It is very true: the old lady has been growing feeble;\nmaybe I shall not have a chance to see her again. Let us go, and if the\nbride is pretty--then I might marry."\n\nHe went to his colonel, got his leave of absence, took his farewell of his\ncomrades, gave the soldiers of his command nine gallons[95] of vodka as a\nfarewell treat, and made his arrangements to depart.\n\n[Footnote 95: Four _vedros_, equivalent exactly to 8.80 gallons.]\n\nThere was war at that time in the Caucasus. The roads were not open for\ntravel either by day or night. If any of the Russians rode or walked\noutside of the fortress, the Tatars were likely either to kill him or\ncarry him off to the mountains. And it was arranged that twice a week an\nescort of soldiers should go from fortress to fortress. In front and behind\nmarched the soldiers, and the travellers rode in the middle.\n\nIt was now summer-time. At sunrise the baggage-train was made up behind the\nfortification; the guard of soldiery marched ahead, and the procession\nmoved along the road.\n\nZhilin was on horseback, and his effects were on a cart that formed part of\nthe train.\n\nThey had twenty-five versts[96] to travel. The train marched slowly;\nsometimes the soldiers halted; sometimes a wagon-wheel came off, or a horse\nbalked, and all had to stop and wait.\n\n[Footnote 96: Sixteen and a half miles.]\n\nThe sun was already past the zenith, but the train had only gone half way,\nso great were the dust and heat. The sun was baking hot, and nowhere was\nthere shelter. A bald steppe; not a tree or a shrub on the road.\n\nZhilin rode on ahead, occasionally stopping and waiting till the train\ncaught up with him. He would listen, and hear the signal on the horn to\nhalt again. And Zhilin thought, "Would I better go on alone without the\nsoldiers? I have a good horse under me; if I fall in with the Tatars, I can\nescape. Or shall I wait?"\n\nHe kept stopping and pondering. And just then another officer, also on\nhorseback, rode up to him; his name was Kostuilin, and he had a musket.\n\nHe said, "Zhilin, let us ride on ahead together. I am so hungry that I\ncannot stand it any longer, and the heat too,--you could wring my shirt\nout!" Kostuilin was a heavy, stout, ruddy man, and the sweat was dripping\nfrom him.\n\nZhilin reflected, and said, "And your musket is loaded?"\n\n"It is."\n\n"All right, let us go. Only one condition: not to separate."\n\nAnd they started on up the road. They rode along the steppe, talking and\nlooking on each side. There was a wide sweep of view. As soon as the steppe\ncame to an end, the road went into a pass between two mountains.\n\nAnd Zhilin said, "I must ride up on that mountain, and reconnoitre,\notherwise you see they might come down from the mountain and surprise us."\n\nBut Kostuilin said, "What is there to reconnoitre? Let us go ahead."\n\nZhilin did not heed him.\n\n"No," says he, "you wait for me here below. I\'ll just glance around."\n\nAnd he spurred his horse up the mountain to the left.\n\nThe horse that Zhilin rode was a hunter; he had bought him out of a drove\nof colts, paying a hundred rubles for him, and he had himself trained him.\nHe bore him up the steep slope as on wings. He had hardly reached the\nsummit when before him less than seven hundred feet distant mounted Tatars\nwere standing,--thirty men.\n\nHe saw them, and started to turn back, but the Tatars had caught sight of\nhim; they set out in pursuit of him, unstrapping their weapons as they\ngallop. Zhilin dashes down the precipice with all the speed of his horse,\nand cries to Kostuilin, "Fire your gun!" and to his horse he says, though\nnot aloud, "Little mother, carry me safely, don\'t stumble; if you trip, I\nam lost. If we get back to the gun, we won\'t fall into their hands."\n\nBut Kostuilin, instead of waiting for him, as soon as he saw the Tatars,\ngalloped on with all his might toward the fortress. With his whip he\nbelabored his horse, first on one side, then on the other; all that could\nbe seen through the dust, was the horse switching her tail.\n\nZhilin saw that his case was desperate. The gun was gone; nothing was to be\ndone with a sabre alone. He turned his horse back toward the train; he\nthought he might escape that way.\n\nBut in front of him, he sees that six are galloping down the steep. His\nhorse is good, but theirs are better; and besides, they have got the start\nof him. He started to wheel about, and was going to dash ahead again, but\nhis horse had got momentum, and could not be held back; he flew straight\ndown toward them.\n\nHe sees a red-bearded Tatar approaching him on a gray mare. He is gaining\non him; he gnashes his teeth; he is getting his gun ready.\n\n"Well," thinks Zhilin, "I know you devils; if you should take me prisoner,\nyou would put me in a hole, and flog me with a whip. I won\'t give myself up\nalive."\n\nNow, Zhilin was not of great size, but he was an uhlan. He drew his sabre,\nspurred his horse straight at the red-bearded Tatar. He says to himself,\n"Either I will crush him with my horse, or I will hack him down with my\nsabre."\n\nZhilin, however, did not reach the place on horseback; suddenly behind him,\ngun-shots were fired at the horse. The horse fell headlong, and pinned\nZhilin\'s leg to the ground.\n\nHe tried to arise; but already ill-smelling Tatars were sitting on him, and\npinioning his hands behind his back.\n\nHe burst from them, knocking the Tatars over; but three others had\ndismounted from their horses, and began to beat him on the head with their\ngun-stocks.\n\nHis sight failed him, and he staggered.\n\nThe Tatars seized him, took from their saddles extra saddle-girths, bent\nhis arms behind his back, fastened them with a Tatar knot, and lifted him\nup.\n\nThey took his sabre from him, pulled off his boots, made a thorough search\nof him, pulled out his money and his watch, tore his clothes all to pieces.\n\nZhilin glanced at his horse. The poor beast lay as he had fallen, on his\nside, and was kicking, vainly trying to rise. In his head was a hole, and\nfrom the hole the black blood was pouring; the dust for an arshin around\nwas wet with it.\n\nA Tatar went to the horse to remove the saddle. He was still kicking, so\nthe man took out his dagger, and cut his throat. The throat gave a\nwhistling sound, a trembling ran over the body, and all was over.\n\nThe Tatars took off the saddle and the other trappings. The one with the\nred beard mounted his horse, and the others lifted Zhilin behind him to\nkeep him from falling; they fastened him with the reins to the Tatar\'s\nbelt, and thus they carried him off to the mountains.\n\nZhilin sat behind, swaying and bumping his face against the stinking\nTatar\'s back.\n\nAll that he could see before him was the healthy Tatar back, and the sinewy\nneck, and a smooth-shaven nape, showing blue beneath the cap.\n\nZhilin\'s head ached; the blood trickled into his eyes. And it was\nimpossible for him to get a more comfortable position on the horse, or wipe\naway the blood. His arms were so tightly bound that his collar-bones ached.\nThey rode long from mountain to mountain; they forded a river; then they\nentered a highway, and rode along a valley. Zhilin tried to follow the\nroute that they took him; but his eyes were glued together with blood, and\nit was impossible for him to turn round.\n\nIt began to grow dark; they crossed still another river, and began to climb\na rocky mountain. There was an odor of smoke. The barking of dogs was\nheard.\n\nThey had reached an _aul_.[97]\n\n[Footnote 97: _Aul_ = Tatar\'s village.--_Author\'s note._]\n\nThe Tatars dismounted. The Tatar children came running up, and surrounded\nZhilin, whistling and exulting. Finally they began to fling stones at him.\n\nThe Tatar drove away the children, lifted Zhilin from the horse, and called\na servant.\n\nA Nogai, with prominent cheek-bones, came at the call. He wore only a\nshirt. The shirt was torn; his whole breast was bare. The Tatar said\nsomething to him. The servant brought a foot-stock. It consisted of two\noaken blocks provided with iron rings, and in one of the rings was a clamp\nwith a lock. They unfastened Zhilin\'s arms, put on the stock, and took him\nto a barn, pushed him in, and shut the door.\n\nZhilin fell on the manure. As he lay there, he felt round in the darkness,\nand when he had found a place that was less foul, he stretched himself out.\n\n\nII.\n\nZhilin scarcely slept that night. The nights were short. He saw through a\ncrack that it was growing light. Zhilin got up, widened the crack, and\nmanaged to look out.\n\nThrough the crack he could see a road leading down from the mountain; at\nthe right, a Tatar _saklia_[98] with two trees near it. A black dog was\nlying on the road; a she-goat with her kids was walking by, all of them\nshaking their tails.\n\n[Footnote 98: A mountain-hut in the Caucasus.]\n\nHe saw coming down the mountain a young Tatar girl in a variegated shirt,\nungirdled, in pantalettes and boots; her head was covered with a kaftan,\nand on it she bore a great tin water-jug.\n\nShe walked along, swaying and bending her back, and holding by the hand a\nlittle Tatar urchin, with shaven head, who wore a single shirt.\n\nAfter the Tatar maiden had passed with her water-jug, the red-bearded Tatar\nof the evening before came out, wearing a silk beshmet, a silver dagger in\nhis belt, and sandals on his bare feet. On his head was a high cap of\nsheep-skin, dyed black, and with the point hanging down. He came out,\nstretched himself, stroked his red beard. He paused, gave some order to the\nservant, and went off somewhere.\n\nThen two children on horseback came along on their way to the\nwatering-trough. The hind-quarters of the horses were wet.\n\nOther shaven-headed youngsters, with nothing but shirts on, and nothing on\ntheir legs, formed a little band, and came to the barn; they got a dry\nstick, and stuck it through the crack.\n\nZhilin growled "_ukh_" at them. The children began to cry, and scatter in\nevery direction as fast as their legs would carry them; only their bare\nknees glistened. But Zhilin began to be thirsty; his throat was parched. He\nsaid to himself, "I wonder if they won\'t come to look after me?"\n\nSuddenly the barn-doors are thrown open.\n\nThe red Tatar came in, and with him another, of slighter stature and of\ndark complexion. His eyes were bright and black, his cheeks ruddy, his\nlittle beard well trimmed, his face jolly and always enlivened with a grin.\n\nThe dark man\'s clothing was still richer: a silk beshmet of blue silk,\nembroidered with gold lace. In his belt, a great silver dagger; handsome\nmorocco slippers embroidered with silver, and over the fine slippers he\nwore a larger pair of stout ones. His cap was tall, of white lamb\'s wool.\n\nThe red Tatar came in, muttered something, gave vent to some abusive\nlanguage, and then stood leaning against the wall, fingering his dagger,\nand scowling under his brows at Zhilin, like a wolf.\n\nBut the dark Tatar, nervous and active, and always on the go, as though he\nwere made of springs, came straight up to Zhilin, squatted down on his\nheels, showed his teeth, tapped him on the shoulder, began to gabble\nsomething in his own language, winked his eyes, and, clucking his tongue,\nkept saying, "A fine Russ, a fine Russ!"[99]\n\n[Footnote 99: _Urus_ in Tatar.]\n\nZhilin did not understand him, and said, "Drink; give me some water."\n\nThe dark one grinned.\n\n"A fine Russ!" and all the time he kept babbling.\n\nZhilin signified by his hands and lips that they should give him water.\n\nThe dark one understood, grinned, put his head out of the door, and cried,\n"Dina!"\n\nA young girl came running in,--a slender, lean creature of thirteen, with a\nface like the dark man\'s. Evidently she was his daughter.\n\nShe was dressed in a long blue shirt with wide sleeves and without a belt.\nOn the bottom, on the breast, and on the cuffs it was relieved with red\ntrimmings. She wore on her legs pantalettes and slippers, and over the\nslippers another pair with high heels. On her neck was a necklace wholly\ncomposed of half-ruble pieces. Her head was uncovered; she had her hair in\na black braid, and on the braid was a ribbon, and to the ribbon were\nattached various ornaments and a silver ruble.\n\nHer father gave her some command. She ran out, and quickly returned,\nbringing a little tin pitcher. After she had handed him the water, she also\nsquatted on her heels in such a way that her knees were higher than her\nshoulders.\n\nShe sits that way, and opens her eyes, and stares at Zhilin while he\ndrinks, as though he were some wild beast.\n\nZhilin offered to return the pitcher to her. She darted away like a wild\ngoat. Even her father laughed.\n\nHe sent her after something else. She took the pitcher, ran out, and\nbrought back some unleavened bread on a small round board, and again\nsquatted down, and stared without taking her eyes from him.\n\nThe Tatars went out, and again bolted the door.\n\nAfter a while the Nogai also comes to Zhilin, and says, "_Ai-da, khozyain,\nai-da!_"\n\nBut he does not know Russian either. Zhilin, however, perceived that he\nwished him to go somewhere.\n\nZhilin hobbled out with his clog; it was impossible to walk, so he had to\ndrag one leg. The Nogai led the way for him.\n\nHe sees before him a Tatar village, of half a score of houses, and the\nnative mosque with its minaret.\n\nIn front of one house stood three horses saddled. Lads held them by the\nbridle. From this house came the dark Tatar, and waved his hand, signifying\nthat Zhilin was to come to him. He grinned, and kept saying something in\nhis own tongue, and went into the house.\n\nZhilin followed him.\n\nThe room was decent; the walls were smoothly plastered with clay. Against\nthe front wall were placed feather-beds; on the sides hung costly rugs; on\nthe rugs were guns, pistols, and sabres, all silver-mounted.\n\nOn one side a little oven was set in, on a level with the floor.\n\nThe floor was of earth, clean as a threshing-floor, and the whole of the\nfront portion was covered with felt; rugs were distributed over the felt,\nand on the rugs were down pillows.\n\nOn the rugs were sitting some Tatars in slippers only,--the dark Tatar, the\nred-bearded one, and three guests. Behind their backs, down cushions were\nplaced; and before them on wooden plates were pancakes of millet-flour, and\nmelted butter in a cup, and the Tatar beer, called _buza_, in a pitcher.\nThey ate with their fingers, and all dipped into the butter.\n\nThe dark man leaped up, bade Zhilin sit on one side, not on a rug but on\nthe bare floor; going back again to his rug, he handed his guests cakes and\n_buza_.\n\nThe servant showed Zhilin his place; he himself took off his shoes, placed\nthem by the door in a row with the slippers of the other guests, and took\nhis seat on the felt as near as possible to his masters; and while they eat\nhe looks at them, and his mouth waters.\n\nAfter the Tatars had finished eating, a Tatar woman entered, dressed in the\nsame sort of shirt as the girl wore, and in pantalettes; her head was\ncovered with a handkerchief. She carried out the butter and the cakes, and\nbrought a handsome finger-bowl, and a pitcher with a narrow nose.\n\nThe Tatars finished washing their hands, then they folded their arms, knelt\ndown, and puffed on all sides, and said their prayers. They talked in their\nown tongue.\n\nThen one of the guests, a Tatar, approached Zhilin, and began to speak to\nhim in Russian. "Kazi Muhamet made you prisoner," said he, pointing to the\nred-bearded Tatar; "and he has given you to Abdul Murat," indicating the\ndark one. "_Abdul Murat is now your master._"[100]\n\n[Footnote 100: _khozyain._]\n\nZhilin said nothing.\n\nAbdul Murat began to talk, all the time pointing toward Zhilin, and grinned\nas he talked-: "_soldat Urus, korosho Urus_."\n\nThe interpreter went on to say, "He commands you to write a letter home,\nand have them send money to ransom you. As soon as money is sent, he will\nset you free."\n\nZhilin pondered a little, and then said, "Does he wish a large ransom?"\n\nThe Tatars took counsel together, and then the interpreter said,--\n\n"Three thousand silver rubles."\n\n"No," replied Zhilin, "I can\'t pay that."\n\nAbdul leaped up, began to gesticulate and talk to Zhilin; he seemed all the\ntime to think that Zhilin understood him.\n\nThe interpreter translated his words. "He means," says he, "how much will\nyou give?"\n\nZhilin after pondering a little said, "Five hundred rubles."\n\nThen the Tatars all began to talk at once. Abdul began to scream at the\nred-bearded Tatar. He grew so excited as he talked, that the spittle flew\nfrom his mouth.\n\nBut the red-bearded Tatar only frowned, and clucked with his tongue.\n\nWhen all became silent again, the interpreter said, "Five hundred rubles is\nnot enough to buy you of your master. He himself has paid two hundred for\nyou. Kazi Muhamet was in debt to him. He took you for the debt. Three\nthousand rubles; it is no use to send less. But if you don\'t write, they\nwill put you in a hole, and flog you with a whip."\n\n"_Ekh!_" thinks Zhilin, "the more cowardly one is, the worse it is for\nhim." He leaped to his feet, and said,--\n\n"Now you tell him, dog that he is, that if he thinks he is going to\nfrighten me, then I will not give him a single kopek nor will I write. I am\nnot afraid of you, and you will never make me afraid of you, you dog!" The\ninterpreter translated this, and again they all began to talk at once.\n\nThey gabbled a long time, then the dark one got up and came to Zhilin.\n\n"_Urus_," says he, "_jigit, jigit Urus!_"\n\nThe word _jigit_ among them signifies a brave young man. And he grinned,\nsaid something to the interpreter, and the interpreter said, "Give a\nthousand rubles." Zhilin would not give in. "I will not pay more than five\nhundred. But if you kill me, you will get nothing at all."\n\nThe Tatars consulted together, sent out the servant, and they themselves\nlooked first at the door, then at Zhilin.\n\nThe servant returned, followed by a rather stout man in bare feet and\nalmost stripped. His feet also were in stocks.\n\nZhilin made an exclamation: he recognized Kostuilin.\n\nAnd they brought him in, and placed him next his comrade; the two began to\ntalk together, and the Tatars looked on and listened in silence.\n\nZhilin told how it had gone with him; Kostuilin told how his horse had\nstood stock still, and his gun had missed fire, and that this same Abdul\nhad overtaken him and captured him.\n\nAbdul listened, pointed to Kostuilin, and muttered something. The\ninterpreter translated his words to mean that they now both belonged to the\nsame master, and that the one who paid the ransom first would be freed\nfirst. "Now," says he to Zhilin, "you lose your temper so easily, but your\ncomrade is calm; he has written a letter home; they will send five\nthousand silver rubles. And so he will be well fed, and he won\'t be hurt."\n\nAnd Zhilin said, "Let my comrade do as he pleases. Maybe he is rich. But I\nam not rich; I will do as I have already told you. Kill me if you wish, but\nit would not do you any good, and I will not pay you more than five hundred\nrubles."\n\nThey were silent.\n\nSuddenly Abdul leaped up, brought a little chest, took out a pen, a sheet\nof paper, and ink, and pushed them into Zhilin\'s hands, then tapped him on\nthe shoulder, and said by signs, "Write." He had agreed to take the five\nhundred rubles.\n\n"Wait a moment," said Zhilin to the interpreter. "Tell him that he must\nfeed us well, clothe us, and give us good decent foot-wear, and let us stay\ntogether. We want to have a good time. And lastly, that he take off these\nclogs."\n\nHe looked at his Tatar master, and smiled. The master also smiled, and when\nhe learned what was wanted, said,--\n\n"I will give you the very best clothes: a cherkeska[101] and boots, fit for\na wedding. And I will feed you like princes. And if you want to live\ntogether, why, you can live in the barn. But it won\'t do to take away the\nclogs: you would run away. Only at night will I have them taken off." Then\nhe jumped up, tapped him on the shoulder: "You good, me good."\n\n[Footnote 101: A sort of long Circassian cloak.]\n\nZhilin wrote his letter, but he put on it the wrong address so that it\nmight never reach its destination. He said to himself, "I shall run away."\n\nThey took Zhilin and Kostuilin to the barn, strewed corn-stalks, gave them\nwater in a pitcher, and bread, two old cherkeski, and some worn-out\nmilitary boots. It was evident that they had been stolen from some dead\nsoldier. When night came they took off their clogs, and locked them up in\nthe barn.\n\n\nIII.\n\nThus Zhilin and his comrade lived a whole month. Their master was always on\nthe grin.\n\n"You, Ivan, good--me, Abdul, good."\n\nBut he gave them wretched food; unleavened bread made of millet-flour,\ncooked in the form of cakes, but often not heated through.\n\nKostuilin wrote home again, and was anxiously awaiting the arrival of the\nmoney, and lost his spirits. Whole days at a time, he sat in the barn, and\ncounted the days till his money should arrive, or else he slept.\n\nBut Zhilin had no expectation that his letter would reach its destination,\nand he did not write another.\n\n"Where," he asked himself,--"where would my mother get the money for my\nransom? And besides, she lived for the most part on what I used to send\nher. If she made out to raise five hundred rubles, she would be in want\ntill the end of her days. If God wills it, I may escape."\n\nAnd all the time he kept his eyes open, and made plans to elude his\ncaptors.\n\nHe walked about the aul; he amused himself by whistling; or else he sat\ndown and fashioned things, either modelling dolls out of clay or plaiting\nbaskets of osiers, for Zhilin was a master at all sorts of handiwork.\n\nOne time he had made a doll with nose, and hands and feet, and dressed in a\nTatar shirt, and he set the doll on the roof. The Tatar women were going\nfor water. Dina, the master\'s daughter, caught sight of the doll. She\ncalled the Tatar girls. They set down their jugs, and looked and laughed.\n\nZhilin took the doll, and offered it to them. They keep laughing, but don\'t\ndare to take it.\n\nHe left the doll, went to the barn, and watched what would take place.\n\nDina ran up to the doll, looked around, seized the doll, and fled.\n\nThe next morning at dawn he sees Dina come out on the doorstep with the\ndoll. And she has already dressed it up in red rags, and was rocking it\nlike a little child, and singing a lullaby in her own language.\n\nAn old woman came out, gave her a scolding, snatched the doll away, broke\nit in pieces, and sent Dina to her work.\n\nZhilin made another doll, a still better one, and gave it to Dina.\n\nOne time Dina brought a little jug, put it down, took a seat, and looked at\nhim. Then she laughed, and pointed to the jug.\n\n"What is she so gay about?" thinks Zhilin.\n\nHe took the jug, and began to drink. He supposed that it was water, but it\nwas milk.\n\nHe drank up the milk.\n\n"Good," says he. How delighted Dina was! "Good, Ivan, good!"\n\nAnd she jumped up, clapped her hands, snatched the jug, and ran away. And\nfrom that time she began to bring him secretly fresh milk every day.\n\nNow, sometimes the Tatars would make cheesecakes out of goat\'s milk, and\ndry them on their roofs. Then she used to carry some of these cakes\nsecretly to him. And another time, when her father had killed a sheep, she\nbrought him a piece of mutton in her sleeve. She threw it down, and ran\naway.\n\nOne time there was a tremendous shower, and for a whole hour the rain\npoured as from buckets; and all the brooks grew roily. Wherever there had\nbeen a ford, the depth of the water increased to seven feet, and bowlders\nwere rolled along by it. Everywhere torrents were rushing, the mountains\nwere full of the roaring.\n\nNow, when the shower was over, streams were pouring all through the\nvillage. Zhilin asked his master for a knife, whittled out a cylinder and\nsome paddles, and made a water-wheel, and fastened manikins at the two\nends.\n\nThe little girls brought him some rags, and he dressed up the manikins, one\nlike a man, the other like a woman. He fastened them on, and put the wheel\nin a brook. The wheel revolved, and the dolls danced.\n\nThe whole village collected: the little boys and the little girls, the\nwomen, and even the Tatars, came and clucked with their tongues. "_Ai,\nUrus! ai, Ivan!_"\n\nAbdul had a Russian watch, which had been broken. He took it, and showed it\nto Zhilin, and clucked with his tongue. Zhilin said,--\n\n"Let me have it, I will fix it."\n\nHe took it, opened the penknife, took it apart. Then he put it together\nagain, and gave it back. The watch ran.\n\nThe Tatar was delighted, brought him his old beshmet which was all in rags,\nand gave it to him. Nothing else to be done,--he took it, and used it as a\ncovering at night.\n\nFrom that time, Zhilin\'s fame went abroad, that he was a "master." Even\nfrom distant villages, they came to him. One brought him a gun-lock or a\npistol to repair, another a watch.\n\nHis master furnished him with tools,--a pair of pincers and gimlets and a\nlittle file.\n\nOne time a Tatar fell ill; they came to Zhilin: "Come cure him!"\n\nZhilin knew nothing of medicine. He went, looked at the sick man, said to\nhimself, "Perhaps he will get well, anyway." He went into the barn, took\nwater and sand, and shook them up together. He whispered a few words to the\nwater in presence of the Tatars, and gave it to the sick man to drink.\n\nFortunately for him, the Tatar got well.\n\nZhilin had by this time learned something of their language. And some of\nthe Tatars became accustomed to him; when they wanted him, they called him\nby name, "Ivan, Ivan;" but others always looked at him as though he was a\nwild beast.\n\nThe red-bearded Tatar did not like Zhilin; when he saw him, he scowled and\nturned away, or else insulted him.\n\nThere was another old man among them; he did not live in the aul, but came\ndown from the mountain. Zhilin never saw him except when he came to the\nmosque to prayer. He was of small stature; on his cap, he wore a white\nhandkerchief as an ornament. His beard and mustaches were trimmed; they\nwere white as wool, and his face was wrinkled and brick-red. His nose was\nhooked like a hawk\'s, and his eyes were gray and cruel, and he had no teeth\nexcept two tusks.\n\nHe used to come in his turban, leaning on his staff, and glare like a\nwolf; whenever he saw Zhilin, he would snort, and turn his back.\n\nOne time Zhilin went to the mountain to see where the old man lived. He\ndescended a narrow path, and sees a little stone-walled garden. On the\nother side of the wall are cherry-trees, peach-trees, and a little hut with\na flat roof.\n\nHe went nearer; he sees bee-hives made of straw, and bees flying and\nhumming around them. And the old man is on his knees before the hives,\nhammering something.\n\nZhilin raised himself up, so as to get a better view, and his clog made a\nnoise.\n\nThe old man looked up,--squealed; he pulled his pistol from his belt, and\nfired at Zhilin, who had barely time to hide behind the wall.\n\nThe old man came to make his complaint to Zhilin\'s master. Abdul called him\nin, grinned, and asked him:\n\n"Why did you go to the old man\'s?"\n\n"I didn\'t do him any harm. I wanted to see how he lived."\n\nAbdul explained it to the old man; but he was angry, hissed, mumbled\nsomething, showed his tusks, and threatened Zhilin with his hands.\n\nZhilin did not understand it all; but he made out that the old man wished\nAbdul to kill the two Russians, and not have them in the aul.\n\nThe old man went off.\n\nZhilin began to ask his master, "Who is that old man?" And the master\nreplied,--\n\n"He is a great man. He used to be our first _jigit_; he has killed many\nRussians. He used to be rich. He had three wives and eight sons. All lived\nin one village. The Russians came, destroyed his village, and killed seven\nof his sons. One son was left, and surrendered to the Russians. The old man\nwent and gave himself up to the Russians also. He lived among them three\nmonths, found his son, killed him with his own hand, and escaped. Since\nthat time he has stopped fighting. He went to Mecca to pray to God, and\nthat\'s why he wears a turban. Whoever has been to Mecca is called a\n_hadji_, and wears a _chalma_. But he does not love you Russians. He has\nbade me kill you, but I don\'t intend to kill you. I have paid out money for\nyou, and besides, Ivan, I have come to like you. And so far from wishing to\nkill you, I would rather not let you go from me at all, if I had not given\nmy word."\n\nHe laughed, and began to repeat in Russian, "_Tvoya Ivan, khorosh, moya,\nAbdul, khorosh._"\n\n\nIV.\n\nThus Zhilin lived a month. In the daytime he walked about the aul or did\nsome handiwork, but when night came, and it grew quiet in the aul, he\nburrowed in his barn. It was hard work digging because of the stones, and\nhe sometimes had to use his file on them; and thus he dug a hole under the\nwall big enough to crawl through.\n\n"Only," he thought, "I must know the region a little first, so as to escape\nin the right direction. And the Tatars wouldn\'t tell me any thing."\n\nHe waited till one time when his master was absent, then he went after\ndinner behind the aul to a mountain. His idea was to reconnoitre the\ncountry.\n\nBut when Abdul returned he commanded a small boy to follow Zhilin, and not\ntake his eyes from him. The little fellow tagged after Zhilin, and kept\ncrying,--\n\n"Don\'t go there. Father won\'t allow it. I will call the men if you go!"\n\nZhilin began to reason with him. "I am not going far," says he,--"only to\nthat hill: I must get some herbs. Come with me; I can\'t run away with this\nclog. To-morrow I will make you a bow and arrows."\n\nHe persuaded the lad, they went together. To look at, the mountain is not\nfar, but it was hard work with the clog; he went a little distance at a\ntime, pulling himself up by main strength.\n\nZhilin sat down on the summit, and began to survey the ground.\n\nTo the south behind the barn lay a valley through which a herd was grazing,\nand another aul was in sight at the foot of it. Back of the village was\nanother hill still steeper, and back of that still another. Between the\nmountains lay a further stretch of forest, and then still other mountains\nconstantly rising higher and higher. And higher than all, stood snow-capped\npeaks white as sugar, and one snowy peak rose like a dome above them all.\n\nTo the east and west also were mountains. In every direction the smoke of\nauls was to be seen in the ravines.\n\n"Well," he said to himself, "this is all their country."\n\nHe began to look in the direction of the Russian possessions. At his very\nfeet was a little river, his village surrounded by gardens. By the river\nsome women, no larger in appearance than little dolls, were standing and\nwashing. Behind the aul was a lower mountain, and beyond it two other\nmountains covered with forests. And between the two mountains a plain\nstretched far, far away in the blue distance; and on the plain lay what\nseemed like smoke.\n\nZhilin tried to remember in what direction, when he lived at home in the\nfortress, the sun used to rise, and where it set. He looked. "Just about\nthere," says he, "in that valley, our fortress ought to be. There, between\nthose two mountains, I must make my escape."\n\nThe little sun began to slope toward the west. The snowy mountains changed\nfrom white to purple; the wooded mountains grew dark; a mist arose from\nthe valley; and the valley itself, where the Russian fortress must be,\nglowed in the sunset as though it were on fire. Zhilin strained his gaze.\nSomething seemed to hang waving in the air, like smoke arising from\nchimneys.\n\nAnd so it seemed to him that it must be from the fortress itself,--the\nRussian fortress.\n\nIt was already growing late. The voice of the mulla calling to prayer was\nheard. The herds began to return; the kine were lowing. The little lad kept\nrepeating, "Let us go!" but Zhilin could not tear himself away.\n\nThey returned home.\n\n"Well," thinks Zhilin, "now I know the place; I must make my escape."\n\nHe proposed to make his escape that very night. The nights were dark; it\nwas the wane of the moon.\n\nUnfortunately the Tatars returned in the evening. Usually they came in\ndriving the cattle with them, and came in hilarious. But this time they had\nno cattle; but they brought a Tatar, dead on his saddle. It was Kazi\nMuhamet\'s brother. They rode in solemnly, and collected for the burial.\n\nZhilin also went out to look.\n\nThey did not put the dead body in a coffin, but wrapped it in linen, and\nplaced it under a plane-tree in the village, where it lay on the sward.\n\nThe mulla came; the old men gathered together, their caps bound around with\nhandkerchiefs. They took off their shoes, and sat in rows on their heels\nbefore the dead.\n\nIn front was the mulla, behind him three old men in turbans, and behind\nthem the rest of the Tatars. The mulla lifted the dead man\'s head, and\nsaid, "Allah!" (That means God.) He said this one word, and let the head\nfall back. All were silent; they sat motionless.\n\nAgain the mulla lifted the head, saying, "Allah!" and all repeated it after\nhim,--\n\n"Allah!"\n\nThen silence again.\n\nThe dead man lay on the sward; he was motionless, and they sat as though\nthey were dead. Not one made a motion. The only sound was the rustling of\nthe foliage of the plane-tree, stirred by the breeze.\n\nThen the mulla offered a prayer. All got to their feet; they took the dead\nbody in their arms, and carried it away.\n\nThey brought it to a pit. The pit was not a mere hole, but was hollowed out\nunder the earth like a cellar.\n\nThey took the body under the armpits and by the legs, doubled it up, and\nlet it down gently, shoved it forcibly under the ground, and laid the arms\nalong the belly. The Nogai brought a green osier. They laid it in the pit;\nthen they quickly filled it up with earth, and over the dead man\'s head\nthey placed a gravestone. They smoothed the earth over, and again sat\naround the grave in rows. There was a long silence.\n\n"Allah! Allah! Allah!"\n\nThey sighed and got up. The red-bearded Tatar gave money to the old men,\nthen he got up, struck his forehead three times with a whip, and went home.\n\nThe next morning Zhilin sees the red-haired Tatar leading a mare through\nthe village, and three Tatars following him. They went behind the village.\nKazi Muhamet took off his beshmet, rolled up his sleeves,--his hands were\npowerful,--took out his dagger, and sharpened it on a whetstone. The Tatars\nheld back the mare\'s head. Kazi Muhamet approached, and cut the throat;\nthen he turned the animal over, and began to flay it, pulling away the hide\nwith his mighty fists.\n\nThe women and maidens came, and began to wash the intestines and the\nlights. Then they cut up the mare, and carried the meat to the hut. And the\nwhole village collected at the Kazi Muhamet\'s to celebrate the dead.\n\nFor three days they feasted on the mare and drank _buza_. Thus they\ncelebrated the dead. All the Tatars were at home.\n\nOn the fourth day about noon, Zhilin sees that they are collecting for some\nexpedition. Their horses are brought out. They put on their gear, and\nstarted off, ten men of them, under the command of the Kazi Muhamet; only\nAbdul staid at home. There was a new moon, but the nights were still dark.\n\n"Now," thinks Zhilin, "to-day we must escape." And he tells Kostuilin.\n\nBut Kostuilin was afraid. "How can we escape? We don\'t know the way."\n\n"I know the way."\n\n"But we should not get there during the night."\n\n"Well, if we don\'t get there we will spend the night in the woods. I have\nsome cakes. What are you going to do? It will be all right if they send you\nthe money, but you see, your friends may not collect so much. And the\nTatars are now angry because the Russians have killed one of their men.\nThey say they are thinking of killing us."\n\nKostuilin thought and thought. "All right, let us go!"\n\n\nV.\n\nZhilin crept down into his hole, and widened it so that Kostuilin also\ncould get through, and then they sat and waited till all should be quiet in\nthe aul.\n\nAs soon as the people were quiet in the aul, Zhilin crept under the wall,\nand came out on the other side. He whispers to Kostuilin, "Crawl under."\n\nKostuilin also crept under, but in doing so he hit a stone with his leg,\nand it made a noise.\n\nNow, the master had a brindled dog as a watch,--a most ferocious animal;\nthey called him Ulyashin.\n\nZhilin had been in the habit of feeding him. Ulyashin heard the noise, and\nbegan to bark and jump about, and the other dogs joined in.\n\nZhilin gave a little whistle, threw him a piece of cake. Ulyashin\nrecognized him, began to wag his tail, and ceased barking.\n\nAbdul had heard the disturbance, and cried from within the hut:--\n\n"_Hait! hait!_ Ulyashin."\n\nBut Zhilin scratched the dog behind the ears. The dog makes no more sound,\nrubs against his legs, and wags his tail.\n\nThey wait behind the corner.\n\nAll became silent again; the only sound was the bleating of a sheep in the\nfold, and far below them the water roaring over the pebbles.\n\nIt is dark, but the sky is studded with stars. Over the mountain the young\nmoon hung red, with its horns turned upward.\n\nIn the valleys a mist was rising, white as milk. Zhilin started up, and\nsaid to his comrade in Tatar, "Well, brother, _ai-da_!"\n\nThey set out again.\n\nBut as they get under way, they hear the call of the mulla on the\nminaret:--\n\n"_Allah! Bis\'m Allah! el Rakhman!_"\n\n"That means, the people will be going to the mosque."\n\nAgain they sat down and hid under the wall.\n\nThey sat there long, waiting until the people should pass. Again it grew\nstill.\n\n"Now for our fate!"\n\nThey crossed themselves, and started.\n\nThey went across the dvor, and down the steep bank to the stream, crossed\nthe stream, proceeded along the valley. The mist was thick, and closed in\nall around them, but above their heads the stars could still be seen.\n\nZhilin used the stars to guide him which way to go. It was cool in the\nmist, it was easy walking, only their boots were troublesome,--they were\nworn at the heels. Zhilin took his off, threw them away, and walked\nbarefoot. He sprang from stone to stone, and kept glancing at the stars.\n\nKostuilin began to grow weary. "Go slower," says he; "my boots chafe me, my\nwhole foot is raw."\n\n"Then take them off, it will be easier."\n\nKostuilin began to go barefoot, but that was still worse; he kept scraping\nhis feet on the stones and having to stop.\n\nZhilin said to him, "You may cut your feet, but you will save your life;\nbut if you are caught they will kill you, which would be worse."\n\nKostuilin said nothing, but crept along, groaning. For a long time they\nwent down the valley. Suddenly they hear dogs barking at the right. Zhilin\nhalted, looked around, climbed up the bank, and felt about with his hands.\n\n"_Ekh!_" says he, "we have made a mistake; we have gone too far to the\nright. Here is one of the enemy\'s villages. I could see it from the hill.\nWe must go back to the left, up the mountain. There must be a forest\nthere."\n\nBut Kostuilin objected. "Just wait a little while, let us get breath. My\nfeet are all blood."\n\n"Eh, brother! they will get well. You should walk more lightly. This way."\n\nAnd Zhilin turned back toward the left, and up hill toward the forest.\n\nKostuilin kept halting and groaning. Zhilin tried to hush him up, and still\nhastened on.\n\nThey climbed the mountain. And there they found the forest. They entered\nit; their clothes were all torn to pieces on the thorns. They found a\nlittle path through the woods. They walked along it.\n\n"Halt!"\n\nThere was the sound of hoofs on the path. They stopped to listen. It\nsounded like the tramping of a horse: then it also stopped. They set out\nonce more; again the tramping hoofs. When they stopped, it stopped.\n\nZhilin crept ahead, and investigated a light spot on the path.\n\nSomething is standing there. It may be a horse, or it may not, but on it\nthere is something strange, not at all like a man.\n\nIt snorted--plainly! "What a strange thing!"\n\nZhilin gave a slight whistle. There was a dash of feet from the path into\nthe forest, a crackling in the underbrush, and something rushed along like\na hurricane, with a crashing of dry boughs.\n\nKostuilin almost fell to the ground in fright. But Zhilin laughed, and\nsaid,--\n\n"That was a stag. Do you hear how it crashes through the woods with its\nhorns? We frightened him, and he frightened us."\n\nThey went on their way. Already the Great Bear was beginning to set; the\ndawn was not distant. And they were in doubt whether they should come out\nright or not. Zhilin was inclined to think that they were on the right\ntrack, and that it would be about ten versts farther before they reached\nthe Russian fortress, but there is no certain guide; you could not tell in\nthe night.\n\nThey came to a little clearing. Kostuilin sat down and said,--\n\n"Do as you please, but I will not go any farther; my legs won\'t carry me."\n\nZhilin tried to persuade him.\n\n"No," says he, "I won\'t go, I can\'t go."\n\nZhilin grew angry; he threatens him, he scolds him.\n\n"Then I will go on without you. Good-by!"\n\nKostuilin jumped up and followed. They went four versts farther. The fog\nbegan to grow thicker in the forest. Nothing could be seen before them; the\nstars were barely visible.\n\nSuddenly they hear the tramping of a horse just in front of them; they can\nhear his shoes striking on the stones.\n\nZhilin threw himself down on his belly, and tried to listen by laying his\near to the ground.\n\n"Yes, it is,--it is some one on horseback coming in our direction."\n\nThey slipped off to one side of the road, crouched down in the bushes, and\nwaited. Zhilin crept close to the path, and looked.\n\nHe sees a mounted Tatar riding along, driving a cow. The man is muttering\nto himself. When the Tatar had ridden by, Zhilin returned to Kostuilin.\n\n"Well, God has saved us. Up with you! Come along!"\n\nKostuilin tried to rise, and fell back.\n\n"I can\'t; by God, I can\'t. My strength is all gone."\n\nThe man was as though he were drunk. He was all of a sweat; and as they\nwere surrounded by the cold fog, and his feet were torn, he was quite used\nup. Zhilin tried to lift him by main force. Then Kostuilin cried, "_Ai!_ it\nhurt."\n\nZhilin was frightened to death.\n\n"What are you screaming for? Don\'t you know that Tatar is near? He will\nhear you." But he said to himself, "Now he is really played out, what can I\ndo with him? I can\'t abandon a comrade. Now," says he, "get up; climb on my\nback. I will carry you if you can\'t walk any longer." He took Kostuilin on\nhis shoulders, holding him by the thighs, and went along the path with his\nburden. "Only," says he, "don\'t put your hands on my throat, for Christ\'s\nsake! Lean on my shoulders."\n\nIt was hard for Zhilin. His feet were also bloody, and he was weary. He\nstopped, and made it a little easier for himself by setting Kostuilin down,\nand getting him better mounted. Then he went on again.\n\nEvidently the Tatar had heard them when Kostuilin screamed. Zhilin caught\nthe sound of some one following them and shouting in his language. Zhilin\nput into the bushes. The Tatar aimed his gun; he fired it off, but missed;\nbegan to whine in his native tongue, and galloped up the path.\n\n"Well," says Zhilin, "we are lost, brother. The dog,--he will be right back\nwith a band of Tatars on our track.... If we don\'t succeed in putting three\nversts between us, we are lost." And he thinks to himself, "The devil take\nit, that I had to bring this clod along with me! Alone, I should have got\nthere long ago."\n\nKostuilin said, "Go alone. Why should you be lost on my account?"\n\n"No, I will not go; it would not do to abandon a comrade." He lifted him\nagain on his shoulder, and started on. Thus he made a verst. It was forest\nall the way, and no sign of outlet. But the fog was now beginning to lift,\nand seemed to be floating away in little clouds: not a star could be seen.\nZhilin was tired out.\n\nA little spring gushed out by the road: it was walled in with stones. There\nhe stopped, and dropped Kostuilin.\n\n"Let me rest a little," says he, "and get a drink. We will eat our cakes.\nIt can\'t be very far now."\n\nHe had just stretched himself out to drink, when the sound of hoofs was\nheard behind them. Again they hid in the bushes at the right under the\ncrest, and crouched down.\n\nThey heard Tatar voices. The Tatars stopped at the very spot where they had\nturned in from the road. After discussing a while, they seemed to be\nsetting dogs on the scent.\n\nThe refugees hear the sound of a crashing through the bushes: a strange dog\ncomes directly to them. He stops and barks.\n\nThe Tatars followed on their track. They are also strangers.\n\nThey seized them, bound them, lifted them on horses, and carried them off.\n\nAfter they had ridden three versts, Abdul, with two Tatars, met them. He\nsaid something to their new captors. They were transferred to Abdul\'s\nhorses, and were brought back to the aul.\n\nAbdul was no longer grinning, and he said not a word to them.\n\nThey reached the village at daybreak; the prisoners were left in the\nstreet. The children gathered around them, tormenting them with stones and\nwhips, and howling.\n\nThe Tatars gathered around them in a circle, and the old man from the\nmountain was among them. They began to discuss. Zhilin made out that they\nwere deciding on what should be done with them. Some said that they ought\nto be sent farther into the mountains, but the old man declared that they\nmust be killed. Abdul argued against it. Says he, "I have paid out money\nfor them, I shall get a ransom for them."\n\nBut the old man said, "They won\'t pay any thing; it will only be an injury\nto us. And it is a sin to keep Russians alive. Kill them, and that is the\nend of it."\n\nThey separated. Abdul came to Zhilin, and reported the decision.\n\n"If," says he, "the ransom is not sent in two weeks, you will be flogged.\nAnd if you try to run away again, I will kill you like a dog. Write your\nletter, and write it good!"\n\nPaper was brought them; they wrote their letters. Clogs were put on their\nfeet again; they were taken behind the mosque.... There was a pit twelve\nfeet[102] deep, and they were thrust down into this pit.\n\n[Footnote 102: Five arshins, 11.65 feet.]\n\n\nVI.\n\nLife was made utterly wretched for them. Their clogs were not taken off\neven at night, and they were not let out at all.\n\nUnbaked dough was thrown down to them as though they were dogs, and water\nwas let down in a jug. In the pit it was damp and suffocating.\n\nKostuilin became ill, and swelled up, and had rheumatism all over his body,\nand he groaned or slept all the time.\n\nEven Zhilin lost his spirits; he sees that they are in desperate straits.\nAnd he does not know how to get out.\n\nHe had begun to make an excavation, but there was nowhere to hide the\nearth; Abdul discovered it, and threatened to kill him.\n\nHe was squatting down one time in the pit, and thinking about life and\nliberty, and he grew sad.\n\nSuddenly a cake[103] fell directly into his lap, then another, and some\ncherries followed. He looked up, and there was Dina. She peered down at\nhim, laughed, and then ran away. And Zhilin began to conjecture, "Couldn\'t\nDina help me?"\n\n[Footnote 103: _lepyoshka._]\n\nHe cleared out a little place in the pit, picked up some clay, and made\nsome dolls. He made men and women, horses and dogs; he said to himself,\n"When Dina comes, I will give them to her."\n\nBut Dina did not make her appearance on the next day. And Zhilin hears the\ntrampling of horses\' hoofs: men came riding up: the Tatars collected at the\nmosque, arguing, shouting, and talking about the Russians.\n\nThe voice of the old man was heard. Zhilin could not understand very well,\nbut he made out that the Russians were somewhere near, and the Tatars were\nafraid that they would attack the aul, and they did not know what to do\nwith the prisoners.\n\nThey talked a while, and went away. Suddenly Zhilin heard a rustling at the\nedge of the pit.\n\nHe sees Dina squatting on her heels, with her knees higher than her head;\nshe leaned over, her necklace hung down and swung over the pit. And her\nlittle eyes twinkled like stars. She took from her sleeve two cheesecakes,\nand threw them down to him. Zhilin accepted them, and said, "Why did you\nstay away so long? I have been making you some dolls. Here they are." He\nbegan to toss them up to her one at a time.\n\nBut she shook her head, and would not look at them. "I can\'t take them,"\nsaid she. She said nothing more for a time, but sat there: then she said,\n"Ivan, they want to kill you."\n\nShe made a significant motion across her throat.\n\n"Who wants to kill me?"\n\n"Father. The old man has ordered him to. But I am sorry for you."\n\nAnd Zhilin said, "Well, then, if you are sorry for me, bring me a long\nstick." She shook her head, meaning that it was impossible.\n\nHe clasped his hands in supplication to her. "Dina, please! Bring one to\nme, Dinushka!"\n\n"I can\'t," said she. "They would see me; they are all at home." And she ran\naway.\n\nAfterwards, Zhilin was sitting there in the evening, and wondering what he\nshould do. He kept raising his eyes. He could see the stars, but the moon\nwas not yet up. The mulla uttered his call, then all became silent.\n\nZhilin began already to doze, thinking to himself, "The little maid is\nafraid."\n\nSuddenly a piece of clay fell on his head; he glanced up; a long pole was\nsliding over the edge of the pit, it slid out, began to descend toward him,\nit reached the bottom of the pit. Zhilin was delighted. He seized it,\npulled it along,--it was a strong pole. He had noticed it before on Abdul\'s\nroof.\n\nHe gazed up; the stars were shining high in the heavens, and Dina\'s eyes,\nat the edge of the pit, gleamed in the darkness like a cat\'s.\n\nShe craned her head over, and whispered, "Ivan, Ivan." And she waved her\nhands before her face, meaning, "Softly, please."\n\n"What is it?" said Zhilin.\n\n"All have gone, there are only two at home."\n\nAnd Zhilin said, "Well, Kostuilin, let us go, let us make our last attempt.\nI will help you."\n\nKostuilin, however, would not hear to it.\n\n"No," says he, "it is not meant for me to get away from here. How could I\ngo when I haven\'t even strength to turn over?"\n\n"All right, then. Good-by.[104] Don\'t think me unkind."\n\n[Footnote 104: _proshchai._]\n\nHe kissed Kostuilin.\n\nHe clasped the pole, told Dina to hold it firmly, and tried to climb up.\nTwice he fell back,--his clog so impeded him. Kostuilin boosted him; he\nmanaged to get to the top: Dina pulled on the sleeves of his shirt with all\nher might, laughing heartily.\n\nZhilin pulled up the pole, and said, "Carry it back to its place, Dina, for\nif they found it they would flog you."\n\nShe dragged off the pole, and Zhilin began to go down the mountain. When he\nhad reached the bottom of the cliff, he took a sharp stone, and tried to\nbreak the padlock of his clog. But the lock was strong; he could not strike\nit fairly.\n\nHe hears some one hurrying down the hill, with light, skipping steps. He\nthinks, "That is probably Dina again."\n\nDina ran to him, took a stone, and says, "Let me try it."\n\nShe knelt down, and began to work with all her might. But her hands were as\ndelicate as osiers. She had no strength. She threw down the stone, and\nburst into tears.\n\nZhilin again tried to break the lock, and Dina squatted by his side, and\nleaned against his shoulder. Zhilin glanced up, and saw at the left behind\nthe mountain a red glow like a fire; it was the moon just rising.\n\n"Well," he says to himself, "I must cross the valley and get into the woods\nbefore the moon rises." He stood up, and threw away the stone. No matter\nfor the clog--he must take it with him.\n\n"Good-by," says he. "Dinushka, I shall always remember you."\n\nDina clung to him, reached with her hands for a place to stow away some\ncakes. He took the cakes.\n\n"Thank you," said he: "you are a thoughtful darling. Who will make you\ndolls after I am gone?" and he stroked her hair.\n\nDina burst into tears, hid her face in her hands, and scrambled up the\nhillside like a kid. He could hear, in the darkness, the jingling of the\ncoins on her braids.\n\nZhilin crossed himself, picked up the lock of his clog so that it might not\nmake a noise, and started on his way, dragging his leg all the time, and\nkeeping his eyes constantly on the glow where the moon was rising.\n\nHe knew the way. He had eight versts to go in a direct course, but he would\nhave to strike into the forest before the moon came entirely up. He crossed\nthe stream, and now the light was increasing behind the mountain.\n\nHe proceeded along the valley: it was growing light. He walks along,\nconstantly glancing around; but still the moon was not visible. The glow\nwas now changing to white light, and one side of the valley grew brighter\nand brighter. The shadow crept away from the mountain till it reached its\nvery foot.\n\nZhilin still hurried along, all the time keeping to the shadow.\n\nHe hurries as fast as he can, but the moon rises still faster; and now, at\nthe right, the mountain-tops are illuminated.\n\nHe struck into the forest just as the moon rose above the mountains. It\nbecame as light and white as day. On the trees all the leaves were visible.\nIt was warm and bright on the mountain-side; every thing seemed as though\nit were dead. The only sound was the roaring of a torrent far below. He\nwalked along in the forest; he had met no one. Zhilin found a little spot\nin the forest where it was still darker, and began to rest.\n\nWhile he rested he ate one of his cakes. He procured a stone and once more\ntried to break the padlock, but he only bruised his hands, and failed to\nbreak the lock.\n\nHe arose and went on his way. When he had gone a verst his strength gave\nout, his feet were sore. He had to walk ten steps at a time, and then rest.\n\n"There\'s nothing to be done for it," says he to himself. "I will push on as\nlong as my strength holds out; for if I sit down, then I shall not get up\nagain. If I do not reach the fortress before it is daylight, then I will\nlie down in the woods and spend the day, and start on to-morrow night\nagain."\n\nHe walked all night. Once he passed two Tatars on horseback, but he heard\nthem at some distance, and hid behind a tree.\n\nAlready the moon was beginning to pale, the dew had fallen, it was near\ndawn, and Zhilin had not reached the end of the forest.\n\n"Well," says he to himself, "I will go thirty steps farther, strike into\nthe forest, and sit down."\n\nHe went thirty steps, and sees the end of the forest. He went to the edge;\nit was broad daylight. Before him, as on the palm of his hand, were the\nsteppe and the fortress; and on the left, not far away on the\nmountain-side, fires were burning, or dying out; the smoke rose, and men\nwere moving around the watch-fires.\n\nHe looks, and sees the gleaming of fire-arms: Cossacks, soldiers!\n\nZhilin was overjoyed.\n\nHe gathered his remaining strength, and walked down the mountain. And he\nsays to himself, "God help me, if a mounted Tatar should get sight of me on\nthis bare field! I should not escape him, even though I am so near." Even\nwhile these thoughts are passing through his mind, he sees at the left, on\na hillock not fourteen hundred feet away, three Tatars on the watch. They\ncaught sight of him,--bore down upon him. Then his heart failed within him.\nWaving his arms, he shouted at the top of his voice, "Brothers! help,\nbrothers!"\n\nOur men heard him,--mounted Cossacks dashed out toward him. The Cossacks\nwere far off, the Tatars near. And now Zhilin collected his last remaining\nenergies, seized his clog with his hand, ran toward the Cossacks, and,\nwithout any consciousness of feeling, crossed himself and cried, "Brothers,\nbrothers, brothers!"\n\nThe Cossacks were fifteen in number.\n\nThe Tatars were dismayed. Before they reached him, they stopped short. And\nZhilin reached the Cossacks.\n\nThe Cossacks surrounded him, and questioned him: "Who are you?" "What is\nyour name?" "Where did you come from?"\n\nBut Zhilin was almost beside himself; he wept, and kept on shouting,\n"Brothers, brothers!"\n\nThe soldiers hastened up, and gathered around him; one brought him bread,\nanother kasha-gruel, another vodka, another threw a cloak around him, still\nanother broke his chains.\n\nThe officers recognized him, they brought him into the fortress. The\nsoldiers were delighted, his comrades pressed into Zhilin\'s room.\n\nZhilin told them what had happened to him, and he ended his tale with the\nwords,--\n\n"That\'s the way I went home and got married! No, I see that such is not to\nbe my fate."\n\nAnd he remained in the service in the Caucasus.\n\nAt the end of a month Kostuilin was ransomed for five thousand rubles.\n\nHe was brought home scarcely alive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nCOUNT TOLSTOI\'S WORKS.\n\n\nANNA KARENINA                     $1.75\n\nCHILDHOOD, BOYHOOD, AND YOUTH      1.50\n\nIVAN ILYITCH                       1.25\n\nMY RELIGION                        1.00\n\nMY CONFESSION                      1.00\n\nWHAT TO DO?                        1.25\n\nTHE INVADERS                       1.25\n\nA RUSSIAN PROPRIETOR               1.50\n\n\nTHOMAS Y CROWELL & CO.,\nPUBLISHERS.\n\n13 ASTOR PLACE, NEW YORK.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nCOUNT TOLSTOI\'S WORKS.\n\n\nThe demand for these Russian stories has but just fairly begun; but it is a\nliterary movement more widespread, more intense, than anything this country\nhas probably seen within the past quarter of a century.--_Boston\nTraveller._\n\n\n     ANNA KARENINA. 12mo, $1.75.\n\n     "Will take rank among the great works of fiction of the\n     age."--_Portland Transcript._\n\n     "As you read on, you say not, \'This is _like_ life\' but\n     \'This _is_ life.\'"--_W.

TOLSTOI.\n\nTranslated from the Russian by NATHAN HASKELL DOLE.\n\nRoyal 12mo, 750 pp., $1.75.\n\n\n     "As you read on you say, not, \'This is like life,\' but,\n     \'This is life.\' It has not only the complexion, the very\n     hue, of life, but its movement, its advances, its strange\n     pauses, its seeming reversions to former conditions, and its\n     perpetual change, its apparent isolations, its essential\n     solidarity. It is a world, and you live in it while you\n     read, and long afterward; but at no step have you been\n     betrayed, not because your guide has warned or exhorted you,\n     but because he has been true, and has shown you all things\n     as they are."--_W. D. Howells, in Harpers\' Monthly._\n\n     "The power of this book lies in the author\'s supreme control\n     of the influences which affect human action, in his vivid\n     apprehension of the operation of inexorable law, in his\n     intuitive knowledge of the action and reaction of spiritual\n     conditions. With a noble art he throws against the shadow,\n     that deepens ever to the end, a radiant soul development\n     that serenely grows brighter till we know it is Tolstoi\n     himself, his experience, his best. It is a great book, and\n     of such creations the most sincere admiration falls sadly\n     short of fitting expression."--_Washington Post._\n\n     "The effect of the whole is stimulating and elevating. The\n     book is certainly one of decided genius."--_New York\n     Tribune._\n\n     "It is difficult to speak of this noble book without\n     incurring the suspicion of extravagance."--_New York\n     Examiner._\n\n     "Will take rank among the great works of fiction of the\n     age."--_Portland Transcript._\n\n     "Characterized by all the breadth and complexity, the\n     insight, and the profound analysis of\n     \'Middlemarch.\'"--_Critic, New York._\n\n     "It is not undue praise to say that, since the publication\n     of Goethe\'s \'Elective Affinities,\' no such relentless\n     analysis of the human emotions, and of the action and\n     reaction of social relations, has appeared as is shown in\n     Count Tolstoi\'s novel, \'Anna Karenina.\'"--_Boston\n     Traveller._\n\n\nTHOMAS Y.
