The scene represents a small\n    dining-room.\n\n  [1] Prot\xc3\xa1sov is his family name, but the name by which he is usually\n  addressed is F\xc3\xa9dya, an abbreviation of his Christian name--Theodore.\n  The ceremonious form of address would be Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich.\n\n    Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, a stout grey-haired lady, tightly laced, is sitting\n    alone at the tea-table on which is a samov\xc3\xa1r. Enter nurse, carrying\n    a teapot.\n\nNURSE. May I have a little hot water, ma\'am?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes. How\'s Baby?\n\nNURSE. He\'s restless.... There\'s nothing worse than for a lady to nurse\nher baby herself! She has her troubles, and the child must suffer. What\ncan her milk be like, when she lies awake crying all night?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. But she seems quieter now.\n\nNURSE. Quiet, indeed! It makes one ill to see her. She\'s been writing\nsomething, and crying.\n\n    Enter S\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA [to Nurse] Lisa is looking for you.\n\nNURSE. I\'m coming, I\'m coming. [Exit].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Nurse says she keeps on crying.... Why can\'t she control\nherself?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Well really, mother, you are amazing!... A woman has left her\nhusband, her child\'s father, and you expect her to be calm!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, not calm ... But what\'s done is done! If I, her\nmother, not only allowed my daughter to leave her husband, but am even\nglad she has done it, that shows he deserved it. One ought to rejoice,\nnot to grieve, at the chance of freeing oneself from such a bad man!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Mother, why say such things? You know it\'s not true! He\'s not\nbad--but on the contrary, he\'s a wonderful man, in spite of his\nweaknesses.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes indeed, a "wonderful" man--as soon as he has money in\nhis pocket--his own or other people\'s....\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Mother! He has never taken other people\'s!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes he has--his wife\'s! Where\'s the difference?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. But he gave all his property to his wife!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Of course, when he knew that otherwise he was sure to\nsquander it all!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Squander or not, I only know that a wife must not separate from\nher husband, especially from such a one as F\xc3\xa9dya.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Then, in your opinion she ought to wait till he has\nsquandered everything, and brought his gipsy mistresses into the house?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. He has no mistresses!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. That\'s the misfortune--he seems to have bewitched you\nall! But not me--no! He won\'t come over me! I see through him, and he\nknows it. Had I been in Lisa\'s place I should have left him a year ago.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. How lightly you say it!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Not lightly at all. It\'s not a light thing for me, as a\nmother, to see my daughter divorced. Believe me it\'s not! But yet it is\nbetter than ruining a young life.... No, I\'m thankful to God that she\nhas at last made up her mind, and that it is all over.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Perhaps it\'s not all over!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Oh! If he only consents to a divorce....\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. What good will that do?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. This good; that she is young, and may again be happy.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Oh mother! It\'s dreadful to hear you speak so! Lisa can\'t love\nanother.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Why not, when she\'s free? Many a man a thousand times\nbetter than your F\xc3\xa9dya might turn up who would be only too happy to\nmarry Lisa.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Mother, it\'s not right! I know you\'re thinking of Victor\nKar\xc3\xa9nin....\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. And why shouldn\'t I? He has loved her these ten years,\nand she loves him.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Yes, but not as a husband! They have been friends from childhood.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. We know those friendships! If only the obstacles were out\nof the way!\n\n    Enter Maid.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What is it?\n\nMAID. The mistress has sent the porter with a note for Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What mistress?\n\nMAID. _Our_ mistress--Mrs. Prot\xc3\xa1sova.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well?\n\nMAID. Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin has sent back word that he will come round at once.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [surprised] We were just speaking of him! Only I can\'t\nthink why ... [to S\xc3\xa1sha] Do you know?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Perhaps I do, and perhaps I don\'t!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You always have secrets!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Lisa will tell you herself when she comes.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [shakes her head. To Maid] The samov\xc3\xa1r must be made to\nboil again. Take it, Douny\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n    Maid takes samov\xc3\xa1r, and exit.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to S\xc3\xa1sha who has risen and is going out] It turns out\njust as I told you! She sent for him at once....\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. She may have sent for him for quite a different reason.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What for, then?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Now, at this moment, Kar\xc3\xa9nin is the same to her as old Nurse\nTr\xc3\xadfonovna.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, you\'ll see.... Don\'t I know her? She has sent for\nhim to comfort her.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Oh mother, how little you know her, to be able to suppose\xc2\xa0...!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, we\'ll see!... And I am very, very glad.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. We _shall_ see! [Exit, humming a tune].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [alone, shakes her head and mutters] It\'s all right, it\'s\nall right!\n\n    Enter Maid.\n\nMAID. Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin has come.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well then, show him in, and tell your mistress.\n\n    Maid exit by inner door. Enter Kar\xc3\xa9nin, who bows to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Your daughter wrote to me to come. I meant to come and see you\nto-night, anyhow. So I was very pleased ... Is Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna[2]\nwell?\n\n  [2] Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna is the polite way of speaking of Mrs.\n  Prot\xc3\xa1sova, otherwise Lisa.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, she is well, but Baby is a bit restless. She will be\nhere directly. [In a melancholy voice] Ah yes! It is a sad time.... But\nyou know all about it, don\'t you?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I do. I was here, you know, the day before yesterday, when his\nletter came. But is it possible that everything is irrevocably settled?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Why of course! Naturally! To go through it all again\nwould be intolerable.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. This is a case where the proverb applies: "Measure ten times\nbefore you cut once." ... It is very painful to cut into the quick.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Of course it is; but then their marriage has long had a\nrift in it, so that the tearing asunder was easier than one would have\nthought. He himself sees that, after what has occurred, it is impossible\nfor him to return.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Why so?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. How can you expect it, after all his horrid\ngoings-on--after he swore it should not happen again, and that if it did\nhe would renounce all rights as a husband and set her perfectly free?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, but how can a woman be free when she is bound by marriage?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. By divorce. He promised her a divorce, and we shall\ninsist on it.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, but Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna loved him so....\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Ah, but her love has suffered such trials that there can\nhardly be anything left of it! Drunkenness, deception, and infidelity\n... Can one love such a husband?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Nothing is impossible to love.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You talk of love! But how can one love such a man--a\nbroken reed, whom one can never depend on? Don\'t you know what it came\nto\xc2\xa0...? [Looks round at the door, and continues hurriedly] All his\naffairs in a muddle, everything pawned, nothing to pay with! Then their\nuncle sends 2,000 roubles to pay the interest on their mortgaged\nestates, and he takes the money and disappears. His wife is left at\nhome, with a sick baby, waiting for him--and at last gets a note asking\nher to send him his clothes and things!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, yes; I know.\n\n    Enter Lisa and S\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, here is Victor Mih\xc3\xa1ylovich,[3] obedient to your\nsummons.\n\n  [3] The polite way of naming Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, but I am sorry I was delayed for a few minutes.\n\nLISA. Thank you. I have a great favour to ask of you, and I have no one\nto turn to but you.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Anything in my power\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. You know all about\xc2\xa0...?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I do.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well then, I shall leave you [To S\xc3\xa1sha] Come, we\'ll leave\nthem alone. [Exit with S\xc3\xa1sha].\n\nLISA. Yes, he wrote to me saying that he considers everything at an end\n... [struggling with her tears] ... and I was hurt!... and so ... In a\nword, I consented to break--I answered, accepting his renunciation.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. And now you repent?\n\nLISA. Yes. I feel that I was wrong, and that I cannot do it. Anything is\nbetter than to be separated from him. In short--I want you to give him\nthis letter.... Please, Victor, give him the letter, and tell him ...\nand bring him back!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [surprised] Yes, but how?\n\nLISA. Tell him I ask him to forget everything, and to return. I might\nsimply send the letter, but I know him: his first impulse, as always,\nwill be the right one--but then someone will influence him, and he\'ll\nchange his mind and not do what he really wants to....\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I will do what I can.\n\nLISA. You\'re surprised at my asking _you_?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. No.... Yet, to tell you the truth--yes, I am surprised.\n\nLISA. But you are not angry?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. As if I could be angry with you!\n\nLISA. I asked you because I know you care for him.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Him, and you too! You know that. I am thinking not of myself,\nbut of you. Thank you for trusting me! I will do what I can.\n\nLISA. I know.... I will tell you everything. To-day I went to Afr\xc3\xa9mov\'s\nto find out where he was. I was told he had gone to the gipsies--which\nis what I feared most of all. I know he will get carried away if he is\nnot stopped in time--and that\'s what has to be done.... So you\'ll go?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Of course, and at once.\n\nLISA. Go!... Find him, and tell him all is forgotten and I am waiting\nfor him.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. But where am I to look for him?\n\nLISA. He is with the gipsies. I went there myself.... I went as far as\nthe porch, and wished to send in the letter, but changed my mind and\ndecided to ask you. Here is the address.... Well, then, tell him to\nreturn: tell him nothing has happened ... all is forgotten. Do it for\nlove of him, and for the sake of our friendship!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I will do all in my power! [Bows, and exit].\n\nLISA. I can\'t, I can\'t! Anything rather than ... I can\'t!\n\n    Enter S\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Well, have you sent?\n\n    Lisa nods affirmatively.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. And he agreed?\n\nLISA. Of course.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. But why just _him_? I don\'t understand.\n\nLISA. But who else?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Don\'t you know he is in love with you?\n\nLISA. That\'s dead and gone. Whom would you have had me send?... Do you\nthink he _will_ come back?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. I am sure of it, because\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Enter Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna. S\xc3\xa1sha is silent.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. And where is Victor Mih\xc3\xa1ylovich?\n\nLISA. He\'s gone.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Gone! How\'s that?\n\nLISA. I asked him to do something for me.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. "Do something?" Another secret!\n\nLISA. It\'s not a secret. I simply asked him to give a letter into\nF\xc3\xa9dya\'s own hands.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. F\xc3\xa9dya? What--to Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich?\n\nLISA. Yes, to F\xc3\xa9dya.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I thought all relations between you were over!\n\nLISA. I can\'t part from him.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What? Are you going to begin all over again?\n\nLISA. I wanted to, and tried ... but I can\'t! Anything you like--only I\ncan\'t part from him!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Then do you want to have him back again?\n\nLISA. Yes.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. To let that skunk into the house again?\n\nLISA. Mother, I beg you not to speak so of my husband!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. He _was_ your husband.\n\nLISA. No, he is my husband still.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. A spendthrift, a drunkard, a rake ... and you can\'t part\nfrom him?\n\nLISA. Why do you torment me! You seem to want to do it.... It\'s hard\nenough for me without that.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I torment you! Well then, I\'ll go. I can\'t stand by and\nsee it....\n\n    Lisa is silent.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I see! That\'s just what you want--I\'m in your way.... I\ncan\'t live so. I can\'t make you out at all! It\'s all so\nnew-fangled--first you make up your mind to separate, then you suddenly\nsend for a man who is in love with you\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. Nothing of the kind.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Kar\xc3\xa9nin proposed to you ... and you send him to fetch\nyour husband! Why? To arouse jealousy?\n\nLISA. Mother, what you are saying is terrible! Leave me alone!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Very well! Turn your mother out of the house, and let in\nyour rake of a husband!... Yes, I will not remain here! Good-bye,\nthen--I leave you to your fate; you can do as you please! [Exit slamming\ndoor].\n\nLISA [drops into a chair] That\'s the last straw!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Never mind.... It will be all right; we\'ll soon pacify Mother.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [passing through] Douny\xc3\xa1sha! My trunk!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Mother, listen!... [follows her out with a significant glance to\nLisa].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    A room in the gipsies\' house. The choir is singing "Kanavela." F\xc3\xa9dya\n    in his shirt-sleeves is lying prone on the sofa. Afr\xc3\xa9mov sits\n    astride a chair in front of the leader of the choir. An officer sits\n    at a table, on which are bottles of champagne and glasses. A\n    musician is taking notes.\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. F\xc3\xa9dya, are you asleep?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [rising] Don\'t talk.... Now let\'s have "Not at Eve."\n\nGIPSY LEADER. That won\'t do, Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich! Let M\xc3\xa1sha sing a solo\nnow.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. All right! And then, "Not at Eve." [Lies down again].\n\nOFFICER. Sing "Fateful Hour."\n\nGIPSY. All agreed?\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Go on!\n\nOFFICER [to musician] Have you taken it down?\n\nMUSICIAN. Quite impossible! It\'s different every time.... And the scale\nis somehow different. Look here! [Beckons to a gipsy woman who is\nlooking on] Is this right? [Hums].\n\nGIPSY. That\'s it, that\'s splendid!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. He\'ll never get it; and if he does take it down and shoves it\ninto an opera, he\'ll only spoil it!... Now, M\xc3\xa1sha, start off! Let\'s have\n"Fateful Hour"--take your guitar. [Rises, sits down opposite her, and\ngazes into her eyes].\n\n    M\xc3\xa1sha sings.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. That\'s good too! M\xc3\xa1sha, you\'re a brick!... Now then, "Not at\nEve"!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. No, wait! First, my burial song....\n\nOFFICER. Why _burial_?\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Because, when I\'m dead ... you know, dead and laid in my\ncoffin, the gipsies will come (you know I shall leave instructions with\nmy wife) and they will begin to sing "I Walked a Mile" ... and then I\'ll\njump out of my coffin!... Do you understand? [To the musician] You just\nwrite this down. [To the gipsies] Well, rattle along!\n\n    Gipsies sing.\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. What do you think of that?... Now then, "My Brave Lads"!\n\n    Gipsies sing.\n\n    Afr\xc3\xa9mov gesticulates and dances. The gipsies smile and continue\n    singing, clapping their hands. Afr\xc3\xa9mov sits down and the song ends.\n\nGIPSIES. Bravo! Michael Andr\xc3\xa9yevich![4] He\'s a real gipsy!\n\n  [4] The polite way of addressing Mr. Afr\xc3\xa9mov.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, _now_ "Not at Eve"!\n\n    Gipsies sing.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. That\'s it! It\'s wonderful ... And where does it all happen--all\nthat this music expresses? Ah, it\'s fine!... And how is it man can reach\nsuch ecstasy, and cannot keep it?\n\nMUSICIAN [taking notes] Yes, it\'s most original.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Not original--but the real thing!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV [to gipsies] Well, have a rest now. [Takes the guitar and sits\ndown beside K\xc3\xa1tya, one of the gipsies].\n\nMUSICIAN. It\'s really simple, except the rhythm....\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [waves his hand, goes to M\xc3\xa1sha, and sits down on sofa beside her]\nOh, M\xc3\xa1sha, M\xc3\xa1sha! How you do turn me inside-out!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. And how about what I asked you for?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What? Money?... [Takes some out of his trouser-pocket] Here, take\nit!\n\n    M\xc3\xa1sha laughs, takes it, and hides it in her bosom.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [to the gipsies] Who can make it out? She opens heaven for me, and\nthen asks for money to buy scents with! [To M\xc3\xa1sha] Why, you don\'t in the\nleast understand what you\'re doing!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Not understand indeed! I understand that when I am in love, I try\nto please my man, and sing all the better.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Do you love me?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Looks like it!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Wonderful! [Kisses her].\n\n    Exeunt most of the gipsies. Some couples remain: F\xc3\xa9dya with M\xc3\xa1sha,\n    Afr\xc3\xa9mov with K\xc3\xa1tya, and the officer with G\xc3\xa1sha. The musician writes.\n    A gipsy man strums a valse tune on the guitar.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. But I\'m married, and your choir won\'t allow it....\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. The choir is one thing, one\'s heart\'s another! I love those I\nlove, and hate those I hate.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Ah! This is good! Isn\'t it?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Of course it\'s good--we\'ve jolly visitors, and are all merry.\n\n    Enter gipsy man.\n\nGIPSY [to F\xc3\xa9dya] A gentleman is asking for you.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What gentleman?\n\nGIPSY. I don\'t know.... Well dressed, wears a sable overcoat--\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. A swell? Well, ask him in. [Exit Gipsy].\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Who has come to see you here?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. The devil knows! Who can want me?\n\n    Enter Kar\xc3\xa9nin. Looks round.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Ah, Victor! I never expected _you_!... Take off your coat!...\nWhat wind has blown you here? Come, sit down and listen to "Not at Eve."\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. _Je voudrais vous parler sans t\xc3\xa9moins._[5]\n\n  [5] I wanted to speak to you alone.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What about?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. _Je viens de chez vous. Votre femme m\'a charg\xc3\xa9 de cette lettre\net puis\xc2\xa0..._[6]\n\n  [6] I have come from your home. Your wife has entrusted me with this\n  letter and besides\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [takes letter, reads, frowns, then smiles affectionately] I say,\nKar\xc3\xa9nin, of course you know what is in this letter?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I know ... and I want to say\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Wait, wait a bit! Please don\'t imagine that I am drunk and my\nwords irresponsible.... I mean, that I am irresponsible! I am drunk, but\nin this matter I see quite clearly.... Well, what were you commissioned\nto say?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I was commissioned to find you, and to tell you ... that ...\nshe ... is waiting for you. She asks you to forget everything and come\nback.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [listens in silence, gazing into Kar\xc3\xa9nin\'s eyes] Still, I don\'t\nunderstand why _you_\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna sent for me, and asked me\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. So\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. But I ask you, not so much in your wife\'s name as from\nmyself.... Come home!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You are a better man than I. (What nonsense! It is easy enough to\nbe better than I) ... I am a scoundrel, and you are a good--yes, a good\nman.... And that is the very reason why I won\'t alter my decision....\nNo! Not on that account either--but simply because I can\'t and won\'t....\nHow could I return?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Let us go to my rooms now, and I\'ll tell her that you will\nreturn to-morrow.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. And to-morrow, what?... I shall still be I, and she--she. [Goes\nto the table and drinks] It\'s best to have the tooth out at one go....\nDidn\'t I say that if I broke my word she was to throw me over? Well, I\nhave broken it, and that\'s the end of it.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. For you, but not for her!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. It is extraordinary that _you_ should take pains to prevent our\nmarriage being broken up!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [is about to speak, but M\xc3\xa1sha comes up]\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [interrupting him] Just hear her sing "The Flax"!... M\xc3\xa1sha!\n\n    The gipsies re-enter.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA [whispers] An ovation, eh?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [laughs] An ovation!... "Victor, my Lord! Son of Michael!"\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Gipsies sing a song of greeting and laudation.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [listens in confusion then asks] How much shall I give them?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, give them twenty-five roubles.[7]\n\n  [7] About \xc2\xa32, 10s.\n\n    Kar\xc3\xa9nin gives the money.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Splendid! And now, "The Flax!"\n\n    Gipsies sing.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [looks round] Kar\xc3\xa9nin\'s bunked!... Well, devil take him!\n\n    Gipsy group breaks up.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [sits down by M\xc3\xa1sha] Do you know who that was?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. I heard his name.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. He\'s an excellent fellow! He came to take me home to my wife. She\nloves a fool like me, and see what I am doing here\xc2\xa0...!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Well, and it\'s wrong! You ought to go back to her.... You ought\nto pity her.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You think I ought to? Well, I think I ought not.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Of course, if you don\'t love her you need not. Only love counts.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. And how do you know that?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Seems I do!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, kiss me then!... Now, let\'s have "The Flax" once more, and\nthen finish up.\n\n    Gipsies sing.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Ah, how good it is! If only one hadn\'t to wake up!... If one\ncould die so!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    Two weeks have passed since Act I. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna and Kar\xc3\xa9nin are\n    discovered sitting in Lisa\'s dining-room. Enter S\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Well, what news?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. The doctor says there is no danger at present, as long as he does\nnot catch cold.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, but Lisa is quite worn out.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. He says it\'s false croup, and a very mild attack. [Points to a\nbasket]. What\'s that?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Grapes. Victor brought them.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Won\'t you have some?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Yes, she likes grapes. She has become terribly nervous.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Naturally--after not sleeping for two nights, and not eating.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. And how about you.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. That\'s quite another matter.\n\n    Enter doctor and Lisa.\n\nDOCTOR [impressively] Yes, that\'s it. Change it every half-hour if he\'s\nawake, but if he\'s asleep don\'t disturb him. You need not paint the\nthroat. The room must be kept at its present temperature\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. But if he again begins to choke?\n\nDOCTOR. He probably won\'t, but if he should, use the spray. And give him\nthe powders: one in the morning and the other at night. I will give you\nthe prescription now.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Have a cup of tea, doctor?\n\nDOCTOR. No thanks.... My patients are expecting me.\n\n    Sits down to the table. S\xc3\xa1sha brings him paper and ink.\n\nLISA. So you\'re sure it is not croup?\n\nDOCTOR [smiling] Perfectly certain!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [to Lisa] And now have some tea, or, better still, go and lie\ndown!... Just see what you look like....\n\nLISA. Oh, now I am alive again. Thank you, you are a true friend!\n[Presses his hand. S\xc3\xa1sha moves away angrily] I am so grateful to you,\ndear friend! At such times one recog\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. What have I done? There\'s really no cause at all to thank me.\n\nLISA. And who stopped up all night? Who fetched the very best doctor?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I am already fully rewarded by the fact that M\xc3\xadsha is out of\ndanger; and above all by your kindness.\n\nLISA [presses his hand again and laughs, showing him some money in her\nhand] That\'s for the doctor; but I never know how to give it....\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Neither do I.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Don\'t know what?\n\nLISA. How to give money to a doctor.... He has saved more than my life,\nand I give him money! It seems so unpleasant.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Let me give it. I know how. It\'s quite simple.\n\nDOCTOR [rises and hands the prescription to Lisa] These powders are to\nbe well mixed in a tablespoonful of boiled water\xc2\xa0... [goes on talking].\n\n    Kar\xc3\xa9nin sits at the table drinking tea; S\xc3\xa1sha and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna come\n    forward.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. I can\'t bear the way they go on! It\'s just as if she were in love\nwith him.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, can it be wondered at?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. It\'s disgusting!\n\n    Doctor takes leave of everybody, and exit. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna goes with\n    him.\n\nLISA [to Kar\xc3\xa9nin] He\'s so sweet now! As soon as even he was a little\nbetter he at once began to smile and crow. I must go to him, but I don\'t\nlike leaving you.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. You had better have a cup of tea, and eat something.\n\nLISA. I don\'t want anything now. I am so happy after all that\nanxiety!... [Sobs].\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. There! You see how worn out you are!\n\nLISA. I\'m so happy!... Would you like to have a look at him?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Of course.\n\nLISA. Then come with me. [Exeunt].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [returning to S\xc3\xa1sha] What are you looking so glum\nabout?... I gave him the money quite well, and he took it.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. It\'s disgusting! She has taken him with her to the nursery. It\'s\njust as if he were her _fianc\xc3\xa9_ or her husband....\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Whatever does it matter to you? Why need you get excited\nabout it? Did you mean to marry him yourself?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. I? Marry that pikestaff? I\'d rather marry I don\'t know whom, than\nhim! Such a thing never entered my head.... I am only disgusted that,\nafter F\xc3\xa9dya, Lisa can be so attracted by a stranger.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Not a stranger, but an old playfellow!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Don\'t I see by their smiles and looks that they are in love?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, what is there to be surprised at in that? He shares\nher anxiety about her baby, shows sympathy and helps her ... and she\nfeels grateful. Besides, why should she not love and marry Victor?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. That would be disgusting--disgusting....\n\n    Enter Kar\xc3\xa9nin and Lisa. Kar\xc3\xa9nin silently takes leave. S\xc3\xa1sha goes of\n    angrily.\n\nLISA [to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna] What\'s the matter with her?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I really don\'t know.\n\n    Lisa sighs, and is silent.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    Afr\xc3\xa9mov\'s sitting-room. Glasses of wine on the table. Afr\xc3\xa9mov,\n    F\xc3\xa9dya, St\xc3\xa1khov (shaggy), Butk\xc3\xa9vich (close-shaven), and Korotk\xc3\xb3v (a\n    tuft-hunter).\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. And I tell you that he\'ll be out of the running! La Belle Bois\nis the best horse in Europe.... Will you bet?\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. Don\'t, my dear fellow.... You know very well that nobody\nbelieves you, or will bet with you.\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. I tell you your Cartouche won\'t be in it!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Stop quarrelling! Let me settle it ... ask F\xc3\xa9dya--he\'ll give\nyou the right tip.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Both horses are good. All depends on the jockey.\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. G\xc3\xbasev is a rascal, and needs a firm hand on him.\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V [shouts] No!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Wait a bit--I\'ll settle your differences.... Who won the Moscow\nDerby?\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. He did--but what of that? It was only chance. If Crakus had\nnot fallen ill.... [Enter footman].\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. What is it?\n\nFOOTMAN. A lady has come, and is asking for Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov.\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. What is she like? A real lady?\n\nFOOTMAN. I don\'t know her name, but she\'s a real lady.\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. F\xc3\xa9dya! a lady to see you!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [startled] Who is it?\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. He doesn\'t know.\n\nFOOTMAN. Shall I ask her into the dining-room?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No, wait.... I\'ll go myself and see.\n\n    Exeunt F\xc3\xa9dya and footman.\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. Who can it be? It must be M\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. Which M\xc3\xa1sha?\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. The gipsy. She\'s in love with him, like a cat.\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. What a darling she is\xc2\xa0...! And how she sings!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Charming! Tany\xc3\xbasha and she! They sang with Peter yesterday.\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. What a lucky fellow that is!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Why? Because the girls are all sweet on him? Not much luck in\nthat!\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. I can\'t bear gipsies--nothing refined about them.\n\nBUTK\xc3\x89VICH. No, you can\'t say that!\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. I\'d give the whole lot for one French woman!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Yes, we know you--and your \xc3\xa6sthetics!... I\'ll go and see who it\nis. [Exit].\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. If it\'s M\xc3\xa1sha, bring her in here! We\'ll make her sing.... No,\nthe gipsies aren\'t what they used to be. Tany\xc3\xbasha, now--by Gad!\n\nBUTK\xc3\x89VICH. And I believe they\'re just the same.\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. Just the same? When instead of their own pieces they sing empty\ndrawing-room songs?\n\nBUTK\xc3\x89VICH. Some drawing-room songs are very good.\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. Will you bet I don\'t get them to sing a drawing-room song so\nthat you won\'t know it from one of their own?\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. Korotk\xc3\xb3v always wants to bet!\n\n    Enter Afr\xc3\xa9mov.\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. I say, you fellows, it\'s not M\xc3\xa1sha--and there\'s no room he can\nask her into but this. Let us clear out to the billiard room. [Exeunt].\n\n    Enter F\xc3\xa9dya and S\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA [confused] F\xc3\xa9dya, forgive me if it\'s unpleasant--but for God\'s\nsake hear me!... [Her voice trembles].\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya walks up and down the room. S\xc3\xa1sha sits down, and follows him\n    with her eyes.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. F\xc3\xa9dya! Come home!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Just listen to me, S\xc3\xa1sha ... I quite understand you, S\xc3\xa1sha dear,\nand in your place I should do the same--I should try to find some way to\nbring back the old state of affairs. But if you were me, if--strange as\nit sounds--you, dear sensitive girl, were in my place ... you would\ncertainly have done as I did, and have gone away and ceased to spoil\nsomeone else\'s life.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Spoil? How? As if Lisa could live without you!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Oh, S\xc3\xa1sha dear! Dear heart!... She can, she can! And she will yet\nbe happy--far happier than with me.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Never!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. It seems so to you [Takes her hand] ... But that\'s not the point.\nThe chief thing is, that _I_ can\'t!... You know, one folds a piece of\nthick paper this way and that a hundred times and still it holds\ntogether; but fold it once more, and it comes in half.... So it was with\nLisa and me. It hurts me too much to look into her eyes--and she feels\nthe same, believe me!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. No, no!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You say "No," but you yourself know that it is "Yes"!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. I can only judge by myself. If I were in her place, and you\nanswered as you are doing, it would be dreadful!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, for _you_\xc2\xa0... [Pause; both are agitated].\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA [rises] Must things really remain so?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I suppose\xc2\xa0...\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. F\xc3\xa9dya come back!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Thank you, S\xc3\xa1sha dear! You will always remain a precious memory\nto me.... But good-bye, dear heart!... Let me kiss you. [Kisses her\nforehead].\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA [agitated] No, I don\'t say good-bye, and I don\'t believe, and\nwon\'t believe ... F\xc3\xa9dya!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well then, listen! But give me your word that what I tell you,\nyou won\'t repeat to anybody--do you promise?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Of course!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well then, listen, S\xc3\xa1sha.... It\'s true that I am her husband and\nthe father of her child, but I am--superfluous! Wait, wait--don\'t\nreply.... You think I\'m jealous? Not at all! In the first place, I have\nno right; secondly, I have no cause. Victor Kar\xc3\xa9nin is her old friend\nand mine too. He loves her, and she him.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. No!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. She does--as an honest, moral woman can, who does not allow\nherself to love anyone but her husband. But she loves, and will love him\nwhen this obstacle [points to himself] is removed; and I will remove it,\nand they shall be happy! [His voice trembles].\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. F\xc3\xa9dya, don\'t talk like that!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Why, you know very well that it\'s true! And I shall be glad of\ntheir happiness, and it\'s the best I can do. I shall not return, but\nshall give them their freedom.... Tell them so.... Don\'t answer--and\ngood-bye!\n\n    Kisses her on the forehead, and opens the door for her.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. F\xc3\xa9dya--you are wonderful!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Good-bye, good-bye!... [Exit S\xc3\xa1sha].\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, yes.... That\'s the thing ... that\'s the thing!... [Rings].\n\n    Enter footman.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Call your master.... [Exit footman].... And it\'s true--it\'s true.\n\n    Enter Afr\xc3\xa9mov.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Come along!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Have you settled matters?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Splendidly! [Sings]\n\n        "And she swore by ev\'ry power\xc2\xa0..."\n\nSplendidly!... Where are they all?\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. They\'re playing billiards.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. That\'s right--we will too [Sings]\n\n        "Rest here, just an hour\xc2\xa0..."\n\nCome along!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov, a sixty-year-old bachelor with moustaches, a\n    retired army man, elegant, very dignified and melancholy-looking.\n    Anna Dm\xc3\xadtrievna Kar\xc3\xa9nina (Victor\'s mother), a fifty-year-old "grande\n    dame" who tries to appear younger, and intersperses her remarks with\n    French expressions.\n\n    Anna Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\'s sitting-room, furnished with expensive simplicity,\n    and filled with souvenirs.\n\n    Anna Dm\xc3\xadtrievna is writing. Footman enters.\n\nFOOTMAN. Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Yes, certainly\xc2\xa0... [Turns round and touches herself up\nbefore the looking-glass].\n\n    Enter Abr\xc3\xa9zkov.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. _J\'esp\xc3\xa8re que je ne force pas la consigne...._[8]\n[Kisses her hand].\n\n  [8] I hope I am not forcing myself on you.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. You know that _vous \xc3\xaates toujours le bienvenu_[9]--and\nto-day especially! You got my note?\n\n  [9] You are always welcome.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I did, and this is my answer.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Ah, my friend! I begin quite to despair. _Il est\npositivement ensorcel\xc3\xa9!_[10] I never before knew him so insistent, so\nobstinate, so pitiless, and so indifferent to me. He has quite changed\nsince that woman dismissed her husband!\n\n  [10] He is positively bewitched!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. What are the facts? How do matters actually stand?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. He wants to marry her come what may.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. And how about the husband?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. He agrees to a divorce.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Dear me!\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. And he, Victor, lends himself to it, with all the\nabominations--lawyers, proofs of guilt--_tout \xc3\xa7a est d\xc3\xa9goutant_![11] And\nit doesn\'t seem to repel him. I don\'t understand him--he was always so\nsensitive, so reserved\xc2\xa0...\n\n  [11] It is all disgusting!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. He is in love! Ah, when a man really loves\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Yes, but how is it that in our day love could be\npure--could be a loving friendship, lasting through life? That kind of\nlove I understand and value.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Nowadays the young generation no longer contents itself\nwith those ideal relations. _La possession de l\'\xc3\xa2me ne leur suffit\nplus._[12] It can\'t be helped!... What can one do with him?\n\n  [12] For them, to possess the soul is no longer enough.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. You must not say that of _him_--but it\'s as if he were\nunder a spell. It\'s just as if he were someone else.... You know, I\ncalled on her. He begged me so. I went there, did not find her in, and\nleft my card. _Elle m\'a fait demander si je ne pourrais la\nrecevoir_;[13] and to-day [looks at the clock] at two o\'clock, that is\nin a few minutes\' time, she will be here. I promised Victor I would\nreceive her, but you understand how I am placed! I am not myself at all;\nand so, from old habit, I sent for you. I need your help!\n\n  [13] She inquired whether I would receive her.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Thank you.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. This visit of hers, you understand, will decide the\nwhole matter--Victor\'s fate! I must either refuse my consent--but how\ncan I?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Don\'t you know her at all?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I have never seen her. But I\'m afraid of her. A good\nwoman could not consent to leave her husband, and he a good man, too! As\na fellow-student of Victor\'s he used to visit us, you know, and was very\nnice. But whatever he may be, _quels que soient les torts qu\'il a eus\nvis-\xc3\xa0-vis d\'elle_,[14] one must not leave one\'s husband. She ought to\nbear her cross. What I don\'t understand is how Victor, with the\nconvictions he holds, can think of marrying a divorced woman! How\noften--quite lately--he has argued warmly with Sp\xc3\xadtsin in my presence,\nthat divorce was incompatible with true Christianity; and now he himself\nis going in for it! _Si elle a pu le charmer \xc3\xa0 un tel point_[15] ... I\nam afraid of her! But I sent for you to know what _you_ have to say to\nit all, and instead of that I have been doing all the talking myself!\nWhat do you think of it? Tell me your opinion. What ought I to do? You\nhave spoken with Victor?\n\n  [14] However he may have wronged her.\n\n  [15] If she has been able to charm him to such a degree\xc2\xa0...\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I have: and I think he loves her. He has grown used to\nloving her; and love has got a great hold on him. He is a man who takes\nthings slowly but firmly. What has once entered his heart will never\nleave it again; and he will never love anyone but her; and he can never\nbe happy without her, or with anyone else.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. And how willingly V\xc3\xa1rya Kaz\xc3\xa1ntseva would have married\nhim! What a girl she is, and how she loves him!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV [smiling]. _C\'est compter sans son h\xc3\xb4te!_[16] That is\nquite out of the question now. I think it\'s best to submit, and help him\nto get married.\n\n  [16] That\'s reckoning without your host!\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. To a divorced woman--and have him meet his wife\'s\nhusband?... I can\'t think how you can speak of it so calmly. Is she a\nwoman a mother could wish to see as the wife of her only son--and such a\nson?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. But what is to be done, my dear friend? Of course it\nwould be better if he married a girl whom you knew and liked; but since\nthat\'s impossible ... Besides it\'s not as if he were going to marry a\ngipsy, or goodness knows who\xc2\xa0...! Lisa Prot\xc3\xa1sova is a very nice good\nwoman. I know her, through my niece Nelly, and know her to be a modest,\nkind-hearted, affectionate and moral woman.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. A moral woman--who makes up her mind to leave her\nhusband!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. This is not like you! You\'re unkind and harsh! Her\nhusband is the kind of man of whom one says that they are their own\nworst enemies; but he is an even greater enemy to his wife. He is a\nweak, fallen, drunken fellow. He has squandered all his property and\nhers too. She has a child.... How can you condemn her for leaving such a\nman? Nor has she left him: he left her.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Oh, what mud! What mud! And I have to soil my hands\nwith it!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. And how about your religion?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Of course, of course! To forgive, "As we forgive them\nthat trespass against us." _Mais, c\'est plus fort que moi!_[17]\n\n  [17] But it\'s beyond me!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. How could she live with such a man? If she had not\nloved anyone else she would have had to leave him. She would have had\nto, for her child\'s sake. The husband himself--an intelligent\nkind-hearted man when he is in his senses--advises her to do it....\n\n    Enter Victor, who kisses his mother\'s hand and greets Prince\n    Abr\xc3\xa9zkov.\n\nVICTOR. Mother, I have come to say this: Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna will be\nhere in a minute, and I beg, I implore you--if you still refuse your\nconsent to my marriage\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA [interrupting him] Of course I still refuse my\nconsent\xc2\xa0...\n\nVICTOR [continues his speech and frowns] In that case I beg, I implore\nyou, not to speak to her of your refusal! Don\'t settle matters\nnegatively\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I don\'t expect we shall mention the subject. For my\npart, I certainly won\'t begin.\n\nVICTOR. And she is even less likely to. I only want you to make her\nacquaintance.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. The one thing I can\'t understand is how you reconcile\nyour desire to marry Mrs. Prot\xc3\xa1sova, who has a husband living, with your\nreligious conviction that divorce is contrary to Christianity.\n\nVICTOR. Mother, this is cruel of you! Are we really so immaculate that\nwe must always be perfectly consistent when life is so complex? Mother,\nwhy are you so cruel to me?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I love you. I desire your happiness.\n\nVICTOR [to Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov] Prince!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Of course you desire his happiness. But it is not easy\nfor you and me, with our grey hairs, to understand the young; and it is\nparticularly difficult for a mother grown accustomed to her own idea of\nhow her son is to be happy. Women are all like that.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Yes, yes indeed! You are all against me! You may do it,\nof course. _Vous \xc3\xaates majeur._[18] ... But you will kill me!\n\n  [18] You are of age.\n\nVICTOR. You are not yourself. This is worse than cruelty!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV [to Victor] Be quiet, Victor. Your mother\'s words are\nalways worse than her deeds.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I shall tell her how I think and feel, but I will do it\nwithout offending her.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Of that I am sure.\n\n    Enter footman.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Here she is.\n\nVICTOR. I\'ll go.\n\nFOOTMAN. Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna Prot\xc3\xa1sova.\n\nVICTOR. I am going. _Please_, Mother! [Exit.]\n\n    Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov also rises.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Ask her in. [To Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov] No, you must please\nstay here!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I thought you\'d find a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ easier.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. No, I\'m afraid ... [Is restless] If I want to be left\n_t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with her, I will nod to you. _Cela d\xc3\xa9pendra._[19] ... To\nbe left alone with her may make it difficult for me. But I\'ll do like\nthat if\xc2\xa0... [Makes a sign].\n\n  [19] It will depend.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I shall understand. I feel sure you will like her. Only\nbe just.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. How you are all against me!\n\n    Enter Lisa, in visiting dress and hat.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA [rising] I was sorry not to find you in, and it is kind\nof you to call.\n\nLISA. I never dreamed that you\'d be so good as to call.... I am so\ngrateful to you for wishing to see me.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA [pointing to Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov] You are acquainted?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Yes, certainly. I have had the pleasure of being\nintroduced. [They shake hands and sit down] My niece Nelly has often\nmentioned you to me.\n\nLISA. Yes, she and I were great friends [glancing timidly at Anna\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna], and we are still friendly. [To Anna Dm\xc3\xadtrievna] I never\nexpected that you would wish to see me.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I knew your husband well. He was friendly with Victor,\nand used to come to our house before he left for Tamb\xc3\xb3v. I think it was\nthere you married?\n\nLISA. Yes, it was there we married.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. But after his return to Moscow he never visited us.\n\nLISA. Yes, he hardly went out anywhere.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. And he never introduced you to me.\n\n    Awkward silence.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. The last time I met you was at the theatricals at the\nDen\xc3\xadsovs\'. They went off very well; and you were acting.\n\nLISA. No ... Yes ... Of course ... I did act. [Silence again]. Anna\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna, forgive me if what I am going to say displeases you, but I\ncan\'t and don\'t know how to dissemble! I have come because Victor\nMih\xc3\xa1ylovich said ... because he--I mean, because you wished to see\nme.... But it is best to speak out [with a catch in her voice] ... It is\nvery hard for me.... But you are kind.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I\'d better go.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Yes, do.\n\n    Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov takes leave of both women, and exit.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Listen, Lisa ... I am very sorry for you, and I like\nyou. But I love Victor. He is the one being I love in the world. I know\nhis soul as I know my own. It is a proud soul. He was proud as a boy of\nseven.... Not proud of his name or wealth, but proud of his character\nand innocence, which he has guarded. He is as pure as a maiden.\n\nLISA. I know.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. He has never loved any woman. You are the first. I do\nnot say I am not jealous. I am jealous. But we mothers--your son is\nstill a baby, and it is too soon for you--we are prepared for that. I\nwas prepared to give him up to his wife and not to be jealous--but to a\nwife as pure as himself\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. I ... have I\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Forgive me! I know it was not your fault, but you are\nunfortunate. And I know him. Now he is ready to bear--and will\nbear--anything, and he would never mention it, but he would suffer. His\nwounded pride would suffer, and he would not be happy.\n\nLISA. I have thought of that.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Lisa, my dear, you are a wise and good woman. If you\nlove him you must desire his happiness more than your own. And if that\nis so, you will not wish to bind him and give him cause to\nrepent--though he would never _say_ a word.\n\nLISA. I know he wouldn\'t! I have thought about it, and have asked myself\nthat question. I have thought of it, and have spoken of it to him. But\nwhat can I do, when he says he does not wish to live without me? I said\nto him: "Let us be friends, but do not spoil your life; do not bind your\npure life to my unfortunate one!" But he does not wish for that.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. No, not at present....\n\nLISA. Persuade him to leave me, and I will agree. I love him for his own\nhappiness and not for mine. Only help me! Do not hate me! Let us\nlovingly work together for his happiness!\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Yes, yes! I have grown fond of you. [Kisses her. Lisa\ncries] And yet, and yet it is dreadful! If only he had loved you before\nyou married\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. He says he did love me then, but did not wish to prevent a\nfriend\'s happiness.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Ah, how hard it all is! Still, we will love one\nanother, and God will help us to find what we want.\n\nVICTOR [entering] Mother, dear! I have heard everything! I expected\nthis: you are fond of her, and all will be well!\n\nLISA. I am sorry you heard. I should not have said it if\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Still, nothing is settled. All I can say is, that if it\nwere not for all these unfortunate circumstances, I should have been\nglad. [Kisses her].\n\nVICTOR. Only, please don\'t change!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    A plainly furnished room; bed, table, sofa. F\xc3\xa9dya alone.\n\n_A knock at the door. A woman\'s voice outside._ Why have you locked\nyourself in, Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich? F\xc3\xa9dya! Open\xc2\xa0...!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [gets up and unlocks door] That\'s right! Thank you for coming.\nIt\'s dull, terribly dull!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Why didn\'t you come to us? Been drinking again? Eh, eh! And after\nyou\'d promised!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. D\'you know, I\'ve no money!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. And why have I taken it into my head to care for you!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. M\xc3\xa1sha!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Well, what about "M\xc3\xa1sha, M\xc3\xa1sha"? If you were really in love,\nyou\'d have got a divorce long ago. They themselves asked you to. You say\nyou don\'t love her, but all the same you keep to her! I see you don\'t\nwish\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. But you know why I don\'t wish!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. That\'s all rubbish. People say quite truly that you\'re an empty\nfellow.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What can I say to you? That your words hurt me, you know without\nbeing told!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Nothing hurts you!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You know that the one joy I have in life is your love.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. _My_ love--yes; but yours doesn\'t exist.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. All right. I\'m not going to assure you. Besides, what\'s the good?\nYou know!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. F\xc3\xa9dya; why torment me?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Which of us torments?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA [cries] You are unkind!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [goes up and embraces her] M\xc3\xa1sha! What\'s it all about? Stop that.\nOne must live, and not whine. It doesn\'t suit you at all, my lovely one!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. You do love me?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Whom else could I love?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Only me? Well then, read what you have been writing.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. It will bore you.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. It\'s you who wrote it, so it\'s sure to be good.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well then listen. [Reads] "One day, late in autumn, my friend and\nI agreed to meet on the Mur\xc3\xbdgin fields, where there was a close thicket\nwith many young birds in it. The day was dull, warm, and quiet. The\nmist\xc2\xa0..."\n\n    Enter two old gipsies, M\xc3\xa1sha\'s parents, Iv\xc3\xa1n Mak\xc3\xa1rovich and Nast\xc3\xa1sia\n    Iv\xc3\xa1novna.\n\nNAST\xc3\x81SIA [stepping up to her daughter] Here you are then, you damned\nrunaway sheep! [To F\xc3\xa9dya] My respects to you, sir! [To M\xc3\xa1sha] Is that\nhow you treat us, eh?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N [to F\xc3\xa9dya] It\'s wrong, sir, what you\'re doing! You\'re ruining the\nwench! Oh, but it\'s wrong ... You\'re doing a dirty deed.\n\nNAST\xc3\x81SIA. Put on your shawl! March at once!... Running away like this!\nWhat can I say to the choir? Gallivanting with a beggar--what can you\nget out of him?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. I don\'t gallivant! I love this gentleman, that\'s all. I\'ve not\nleft the choir. I\'ll go on singing, and what\xc2\xa0...\n\nIV\xc3\x81N. Say another word, and I\'ll pull the hair off your head!...\nSlut!... Who behaves like that? Not your father, nor your mother, nor\nyour aunt!... It\'s bad, sir! We were fond of you--often and often we\nsang to you without pay. We pitied you, and what have you done?\n\nNAST\xc3\x81SIA. You\'ve ruined our daughter for nothing ... our own, our only\ndaughter, the light of our eyes, our priceless jewel--you\'ve trodden her\ninto the mire, that\'s what you\'ve done! You\'ve no conscience.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Nast\xc3\xa1sia Iv\xc3\xa1novna, you suspect me falsely. Your daughter is like\na sister to me. I care for her honour. You must think no evil ... but I\nlove her! What is one to do?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N. But you didn\'t love her when you had money! If you\'d then\nsubscribed ten thousand roubles or so to the choir, you might have had\nher honourably. But now you\'ve squandered everything, and carry her off\nby stealth! It\'s a shame, sir, a shame!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. He has not carried me off! I came to him myself, and if you take\nme away now, I shall come back again. I love him, and there\'s an end of\nit! My love is stronger than all your locks ... I won\'t!\n\nNAST\xc3\x81SIA. Come, M\xc3\xa1sha dearest! Come, my own! Don\'t sulk. You\'ve done\nwrong, and now come along.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N. Now then, you\'ve talked enough! March! [Seizes her hand] Excuse\nus, sir! [Exit the three gipsies].\n\n    Enter Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Excuse me. I have been an unwilling witness of an\nunpleasant scene....\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Whom have I the honour?... [Recognises the Prince] Ah, Prince\nAbr\xc3\xa9zkov! [They shake hands].\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. An unwilling witness of an unpleasant scene. I should\nhave been glad not to hear, but having overheard it, I consider it my\nduty to tell you so. I was directed here, and had to wait at the door\nfor those people to come out--more particularly as their very loud\nvoices rendered my knocking inaudible.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, yes--please take a seat. Thank you for telling me: it gives\nme the right to explain that scene to you. I don\'t mind what you may\nthink of me, but I should like to tell you that the reproaches you heard\naddressed to that girl, that gipsy singer, were unjust. That girl is as\nmorally pure as a dove; and my relations with her are those of a friend.\nThere may be a tinge of romance in them, but it does not destroy the\npurity--the honour--of the girl. That is what I wished to tell you; but\nwhat is it you want of me? In what way can I be of service?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. In the first place, I\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Forgive me, Prince. My present social standing is such, that my\nformer slight acquaintance with you does not entitle me to a visit from\nyou, unless you have some business with me. What is it?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I won\'t deny it. You have guessed right. I have\nbusiness with you; but I beg you to believe that the alteration in your\nposition in no wise affects my attitude towards you.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I am sure of it.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. My business is this. The son of my old friend, Anna\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna Kar\xc3\xa9nina, and she herself, have asked me to ascertain\ndirectly from you what are your relations ... May I speak out?... your\nrelations with your wife, Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna Prot\xc3\xa1sova.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. My relations with my wife, or rather with her who _was_ my wife,\nare entirely at an end.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. So I understood, and that is why I accepted this\ndifficult mission.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. At an end, and, I hasten to add, not by her fault, but by\nmine--by my innumerable faults. She is, as she always was, quite\nirreproachable.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Well then, Victor Kar\xc3\xa9nin, or rather his mother, asked\nme to find out what your intentions are.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [growing excited] What intentions? I have none. I set her quite\nfree! Moreover, I will never disturb her peace. I know she loves Victor\nKar\xc3\xa9nin. Well, let her! I consider him a very dull, but very good and\nhonourable man, and I think that she will, as the phrase goes, be happy\nwith him; and--_que le bon Dieu les b\xc3\xa9nisse_![20] That\'s all\xc2\xa0...\n\n  [20] May God bless them!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Yes, but we\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [interrupting] And don\'t suppose that I feel the least bit\njealous. If I said that Victor is dull, I withdraw the remark. He is an\nexcellent, honourable, moral man: almost the direct opposite of myself.\nAnd he has loved her from childhood. Perhaps she too may have loved him\nwhen she married me--that happens sometimes! The very best love is\nunconscious love. I believe she always did love him; but as an honest\nwoman she did not confess it even to herself. But ... a shadow of some\nkind always lay across our family life--but why am I confessing to you?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Please do! Believe me, my chief reason for coming to\nyou was my desire to understand the situation fully.... I understand\nyou. I understand that the shadow, as you so well express it, may have\nbeen\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, it was; and that perhaps is why I could not find\nsatisfaction in the family life she provided for me, but was always\nseeking something, and being carried away. However, that sounds like\nexcusing myself. I don\'t want to, and can\'t, excuse myself. I was (I say\nwith assurance, _was_) a bad husband. I say _was_, because in my\nconsciousness I am not, and have long not been, her husband. I consider\nher perfectly free. So there you have my answer to your question.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Yes, but you know Victor\'s family, and himself too. His\nrelation to Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna is, and has been all through, most\nrespectful and distant. He assisted her when she was in trouble\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, I by my dissipation helped to draw them together. What\'s to\nbe done? It had to be so!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. You know the strictly Orthodox convictions of that\nfamily. Having myself a broader outlook on things, I do not share them;\nbut I respect and understand them. I understand that for him, and\nespecially for his mother, union with a woman without a Church marriage\nis unthinkable.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, I know his stu\xc2\xa0... his strictness, his conservatism in these\nmatters. But what do they want? A divorce? I told them long ago that I\nam quite willing; but the business of taking the blame on myself, and\nall the lies connected with it, are very trying....[21]\n\n  [21] Under the Russian law divorce was only obtainable if ocular\n  evidence of adultery was forthcoming, and a great deal of perjury was\n  usually involved in such cases.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I quite understand you, and sympathise. But how can it\nbe avoided? I think it might be arranged that way--but you are right. It\nis dreadful, and I quite understand you.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [pressing the Prince\'s hand] Thank you, dear Prince! I always knew\nyou were a kind and honourable man. Tell me what to do. How am I to act?\nPut yourself in my place. I am not trying to improve. I am a\ngood-for-nothing; but there are things I cannot do quietly. I cannot\nquietly tell lies.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I don\'t understand you! You, a capable, intelligent\nman, so sensitive to what is good--how can you let yourself be so\ncarried away--so forget what you expect of yourself? How have you ruined\nyour life and come to this?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [forcing back tears of emotion] I have led this disorderly life\nfor ten years, and this is the first time a man like you has pitied me!\nI have been pitied by my boon-companions, by rakes and by women; but a\nreasonable, good man like you ... Thank you! How did I come to my ruin?\nFirst, through drink. It is not that drink tastes nice; but do what I\nwill, I always feel I am not doing the right thing, and I feel ashamed.\nI talk to you now, and feel ashamed. As for being a _Mar\xc3\xa9chal de la\nnoblesse_, or a Bank Director--I should feel ashamed, so ashamed! It is\nonly when I drink that I do not feel this shame. And music: not operas\nor Beethoven, but gipsies!... That is life! Energy flows into one\'s\nveins! And then those dear black eyes, and those smiles! And the more\ndelicious it is, the more ashamed one feels afterwards.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. How about work?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I have tried it, but it\'s no good. I am always dissatisfied with\nit--but what\'s the use of talking about myself! I thank you.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Then what am I to say?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Tell them I will do what they wish. They want to get married, and\nthat there should be no obstacle to their marriage?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Of course.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I\'ll do it! Tell them I will certainly do it.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. But when?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Wait a bit. Well, say in a fortnight. Will that do?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Then I may tell them so?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You may. Good-bye, Prince! Thank you once again!\n\n[Exit Prince].\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [sits for a long time and smiles silently] That\'s the way, that\'s\nthe way! It must be so, must be, must be! Splendid!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    A private room in a restaurant. A waiter shows in F\xc3\xa9dya and Iv\xc3\xa1n\n    Petr\xc3\xb3vich Alex\xc3\xa1ndrov.\n\nWAITER. Here, please. No one will disturb you here. I\'ll bring some\npaper directly.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Prot\xc3\xa1sov, I\'ll come in too.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [seriously] If you like, but I\'m busy and ... All right, come in.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. You wish to reply to their demands? I\'ll tell you what\nto say. I should not do it that way--always speak straight out, and act\nwith decision.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [to waiter] A bottle of champagne!\n\n    Exit waiter.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [taking out a revolver and putting it on the table] Wait a bit!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. What\'s that? Do you want to shoot yourself? You can if\nyou like. I understand you! They wish to humiliate you, and you will\nshow them the sort of man you are! You will kill yourself with a\nrevolver, and them with magnanimity. I understand you. I understand\neverything, because I am a genius.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Of course--of course. Only\xc2\xa0... [Enter waiter with paper and ink].\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [covers the revolver with a napkin] Uncork it--let\'s have a drink.\n[They drink. F\xc3\xa9dya writes] Wait a bit!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Here\'s to your ... great journey! You know I\'m above all\nthis. I\'m not going to restrain you! Life and death are alike to\nGenius. I die in life, and live in death. You will kill yourself that\ntwo people should pity you; and I--I shall kill myself that the whole\nworld may understand what it has lost. I won\'t hesitate, or think about\nit! I seize it [snatches revolver]--now! And all is over. But it is too\nsoon yet. [Lays down revolver] Nor shall I write anything; they must\nunderstand it themselves.... Oh, you\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [writing] Wait a bit.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Pitiful people! They fuss, they bustle, and don\'t\nunderstand--don\'t understand anything at all.... I\'m not talking to you,\nI am only expressing my thoughts. And, after all, what does humanity\nneed? Very little--only to value its geniuses. But they always are\nexecuted, persecuted, tortured.... No! I\'m not going to be your toy! I\nwill drag you out into the open! No-o-o! Hypocrites!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [having finished writing, drinks and reads over his letter] Go\naway, please!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Go away? Well, good-bye then! I am not going to restrain\nyou. I shall do the same. But not yet. I only want to tell you\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. All right! You\'ll tell me afterwards. And now, dear chap, just\none thing: give this to the manager [gives him money] and ask if a\nparcel and a letter have come for me.... Please do!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. All right--then you\'ll wait for me? I have still\nsomething important to tell you--something that you will not hear in\nthis world nor in the next, at any rate not till I come there.... Am I\nto let him have _all_ of this?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. As much as is necessary. [Exit Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich.]\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya sighs with relief; locks the door behind Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich; takes\n    up the revolver, cocks it, puts it to his temple; shudders, and\n    carefully lowers it again. Groans.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No; I can\'t! I can\'t! I can\'t! [Knock at the door] Who\'s there?\n\n[M\xc3\xa1sha\'s voice from outside] It\'s me!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Who\'s "me"? Oh, M\xc3\xa1sha\xc2\xa0... [opens door].\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. I\'ve been to your place, to Pop\xc3\xb3v\'s, to Afr\xc3\xa9mov\'s, and guessed\nthat you must be here. [Sees revolver] That\'s a nice thing! There\'s a\nfool! A regular fool! Is it possible you really meant to?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No, I couldn\'t.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Do I count for nothing at all? You heathen! You had no pity for\nme? Oh, Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich, it\'s a sin, a sin! In return for my\nlove\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I wished to release them. I promised to, and I can\'t lie.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. And what about me?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What about you? It would have set you free too. Is it better for\nyou to be tormented by me?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Seems it\'s better. I can\'t live without you.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What sort of life could you have with me? You\'d have cried a bit,\nand then gone on living your own life.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. I shouldn\'t have cried at all! Go to the devil, if you don\'t pity\nme! [Cries].\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. M\xc3\xa1sha, dearest! I meant to do it for the best.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Best for yourself!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [smiles] How\'s that, when I meant to kill myself?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Of course, best for yourself! But what is it you want? Tell me.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What I want? I want a great deal.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Well, what? What?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. First of all, to keep my promise. That is the first thing, and\nquite sufficient. To lie, and do all the dirty work necessary to get a\ndivorce ... I can\'t!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Granted that it\'s horrid--I myself\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Next, they must really be free--my wife and he. After all, they\nare good people; and why should they suffer? That\'s the second thing.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Well, there isn\'t much good in her, if she\'s thrown you over.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. She didn\'t--I threw her over.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. All right, all right! It\'s always you. She is an angel! What\nelse!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. This--that you are a good, dear girlie--and that I love you, and\nif I live I shall ruin you.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. That\'s not your business. I know quite well what will ruin me.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [sighs] But above all, above all ... What use is my life? Don\'t I\nknow that I am a lost good-for-nothing? I am a burden to myself and to\neverybody--as your father said. I\'m worthless....\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. What rubbish! I shall stick to you. I\'ve stuck to you already,\nand there\'s an end of it! As to your leading a bad life, drinking and\ngoing on the spree--well, you\'re a living soul! Give it up, and have\ndone with it!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. That\'s easily said.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Well, then, do it.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, when I look at you I feel as if I could really do anything.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. And so you shall! Yes, you\'ll do it! [Sees the letter] What\'s\nthat? You\'ve written to them? What have you written?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What have I written?... [Takes the letter and is about to tear it\nup] It\'s no longer wanted now.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA [snatches the letter] You\'ve said you would kill yourself? Yes?\nYou did not mention the revolver--only said that you\'d kill yourself?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, that I should be no more.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Give it me--give it, give it!... Have you read _What to Do_?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I think I have.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. It\'s a tiresome novel, but there\'s one very, very good thing in\nit. That what\'s his name?--Rakhm\xc3\xa1nov--goes and pretends he has drowned\nhimself. And you--can you swim?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. That\'s all right. Let me have your clothes--everything, and your\npocket-book too.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. How can I?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Wait a bit, wait, wait! Let\'s go home; then you\'ll change your\nclothes.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. But it will be a fraud.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. All right! You go to bathe, your clothes remain on the bank, in\nthe pocket is your pocket-book and this letter.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, and then?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. And then? Why, then we\'ll go off together and live gloriously.\n\n    Enter Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. There now! And the revolver? I\'ll take it.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Take it; take it! We\'re off.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    The Prot\xc3\xa1sovs\' drawing-room.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. He promised so definitely, that I am sure he will keep his\nword.\n\nLISA. I am ashamed to say it, but I must confess that what I heard about\nthat gipsy girl makes me feel quite free. Don\'t think it is jealousy; it\nisn\'t, but you know--it sets me free. I hardly know how to tell you....\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. You don\'t know how to tell me ... Why?\n\nLISA [smiling] Never mind! Only let me explain what I feel. The chief\nthing that tormented me was, that I felt I loved two men; and that meant\nthat I was an immoral woman.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. _You_ immoral?\n\nLISA. But since I knew that he had got someone else, and that he\ntherefore did not need me, I felt free, and felt that I might truthfully\nsay that I love you. Now things are clear within me, and only my\nposition torments me. This divorce! It is such torture--and then this\nwaiting!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. It will soon, very soon, be settled. Besides his promise, I\nsent my secretary to him with the petition ready for signature, and told\nhim not to leave till it is signed. If I did not know him so well, I\nshould think he was purposely behaving as he does.\n\nLISA. He? No, it is the result both of his weakness and his honesty. He\ndoesn\'t want to say what is not true. Only you were wrong to send him\nmoney.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I had to. The want of it might be the cause of the delay.\n\nLISA. No, there is something bad about money.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Well, anyhow, _he_ need not have been so punctilious\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. How selfish we are becoming!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, I confess it. It\'s your own fault. After all that waiting,\nthat hopelessness, I am now so happy! And happiness makes one selfish.\nIt\'s your fault!\n\nLISA. Do you think it\'s you only? I too--I feel full of happiness,\nbathed in bliss! I have everything--M\xc3\xadsha has recovered, your mother\nlikes me, and you--and above all, I, I love!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes? And no repenting? No turning back?\n\nLISA. Since that day everything has changed in me.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. And will not change again?\n\nLISA. Never! I only wish you to have done with it all as completely as I\nhave.\n\n    Enter nurse, with baby. Lisa takes the baby on her lap.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. What wretched people we are!\n\nLISA [kissing baby] Why?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. When you married, and I heard of it on my return from abroad,\nand was wretched because I felt that I had lost you, it was a relief to\nme to find that you still remembered me. I was content even with that.\nThen when our friendship was established and I felt your kindness to me,\nand even a little gleam of something in our friendship that was more\nthan friendship, I was almost happy. I was only tormented by a fear that\nI was not being honest towards F\xc3\xa9dya. But no! I was always so firmly\nconscious that any other relation than one of purest friendship with my\nfriend\'s wife was impossible--besides which, I knew you--that I was not\nreally troubled about that. Afterwards, when F\xc3\xa9dya began to cause you\nanxiety, and I felt that I was of some use to you, and that my\nfriendship was beginning to alarm you--I was quite happy, and a sort of\nvague hope awoke in me. Still later, when he became altogether\nimpossible and you decided to leave him, and I spoke to you plainly for\nthe first time, and you did not say "No," but went away in tears--then I\nwas perfectly happy; and had I then been asked what more I wanted, I\nshould have answered "Nothing"! But later on, when there came the\npossibility of uniting our lives: when my mother grew fond of you and\nthe possibility began to be realised; when you told me that you loved\nand had loved me, and then (as you did just now) that he no longer\nexisted for you and that you love only me--what more, one would think,\ncould I wish for? But no! Now the past torments me! I wish that past had\nnot existed, and that there were nothing to remind me of it.\n\nLISA [reproachfully] Victor!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Lisa, forgive me! If I tell you this, it is only because I\ndon\'t want a single thought of mine about you to be hidden from you. I\nhave purposely told you, to show how bad I am, and how well I know that\nI must struggle with and conquer myself.... And now I\'ve done it! I love\nhim.\n\nLISA. That\'s as it should be. I did all I could, but it was not I that\ndid what you desired: it happened in my heart, from which everything but\nyou has vanished.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Everything?\n\nLISA. Everything, everything--or I would not say so.\n\n    Enter footman.\n\nFOOTMAN. Mr. Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. He\'s come with F\xc3\xa9dya\'s answer.\n\nLISA [to Kar\xc3\xa9nin] Ask him in here.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [rising and going to the door] Well, here is the answer!\n\nLISA [gives baby to nurse; exit nurse] Is it possible, Victor, that\neverything will now be decided? [Kisses Kar\xc3\xa9nin].\n\n    Enter Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Well?\n\nVOZNES\xc3\x89NSKY. He has gone.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Gone! And without signing the petition?\n\nVOZNES\xc3\x89NSKY. The petition is not signed, but a letter was left for you\nand Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna [Takes letter out of his pocket and gives it to\nKar\xc3\xa9nin] I went to his lodgings, and was told he was at the restaurant.\nI went there, and Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov told me to return in an hour and I should\nthen have his answer. I went back, and then\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Is it possible that this means another delay? More excuses! No,\nthat would be downright wicked. How he has fallen!\n\nLISA. But do read the letter! [Kar\xc3\xa9nin opens letter].\n\nVOZNES\xc3\x89NSKY. You do not require me any longer?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Well, no. Good-bye! Thank you\xc2\xa0... [Pauses in astonishment as he\nreads].\n\n    Exit Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky.\n\nLISA. What--what is it?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. This is awful!\n\nLISA [takes hold of letter] Read!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [reads] "Lisa and Victor, I address myself to you both. I won\'t\nlie and call you \'dear\' or anything else. I cannot master the feeling of\nbitterness and reproach (I reproach myself, but all the same it is\npainful) when I think of you and of your love and happiness. I know\neverything. I know that though I was the husband, I have--by a series of\naccidents--been in your way. _C\'est moi qui suis l\'intrus._[22] But all\nthe same, I cannot restrain a feeling of bitterness and coldness towards\nyou. I love you both in theory, especially Lisa, Lisette! But actually I\nam more than cold towards you. I know I am wrong, but cannot change."\n\n  [22] It is I who am the intruder.\n\nLISA. How can he\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [continues reading] "But to business! This very feeling of\ndiscord within me forces me to fulfil your desire not in the way you\nwish. Lying, acting so disgusting a comedy, bribing the Consistorium,\nand all those horrors, are intolerably repulsive to me. Vile as I may\nbe, I am vile in a different way, and cannot take part in those\nabominations--simply cannot! The solution at which I have arrived is the\nsimplest: to be happy, you must marry. I am in the way; consequently I\nmust destroy myself...."\n\nLISA [seizes Victor\'s hand] Victor!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [reads] "...\xc2\xa0must destroy myself. And I will do it. When you get\nthis letter, I shall be no more.\n\n"_P.S._ What a pity you sent me money to pay for the divorce proceedings!\nIt is unpleasant, and unlike you! But it can\'t be helped. I have so\noften made mistakes, why shouldn\'t you make one? I return the money. My\nway of escape is shorter, cheaper, and surer. All I ask is, don\'t be\nangry with me, and think kindly of me. And, one thing more--there is a\nclockmaker, Evg\xc3\xa9nyev, here. Can\'t you help him, and set him on his feet?\nHe\'s a good man, though weak.--Good-bye,\n\n                                                        "F\xc3\x89DYA."\n\nLISA. He has taken his life! Yes\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [rings, and runs out to the hall] Call Mr. Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky back!\n\nLISA. I knew it! I knew it! F\xc3\xa9dya, dear F\xc3\xa9dya!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Lisa!\n\nLISA. It\'s not true, not true that I didn\'t love him and don\'t love him!\nI love only him! I love him! And I\'ve killed him. Leave me!\n\n    Enter Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Where is Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov? What did they tell you?\n\nVOZNES\xc3\x89NSKY. They told me he went out this morning, left this letter,\nand had not returned.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. We shall have to find out about it, Lisa. I must leave you.\n\nLISA. Forgive me, but I too can\'t lie! Go now--go, and find out\xc2\xa0...\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT V\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    A dirty room in a low-class restaurant. A table, at which people sit\n    drinking tea and v\xc3\xb3dka. In the foreground a small table, at which\n    sits F\xc3\xa9dya, tattered, and much come down in the world. With him is\n    Petushk\xc3\xb3v, a gentle, mild man with long hair, of clerical\n    appearance. Both are slightly drunk.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. I understand, I understand. That is true love! Yes? Go on.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, you know, if a woman of our class showed such feeling and\nsacrificed everything for the man she loved.... But she was a gipsy,\nbrought up to money-hunting, and yet she had this self-sacrificing love!\nGave everything, and wanted nothing herself! The contrast was so\nwonderful!\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Yes, in art we call it "value." You can only get quite bright\nred by putting green round it. But that\'s not to the point. I\nunderstand, quite understand.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, and I believe the one good action of my life is that I never\ntook advantage of her love. And do you know why?\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Pity.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Oh no! I never felt pity for her. What I felt for her was always\nrapturous admiration--and when she sang! Ah, how she sang--and perhaps\nstill sings! I always regarded her as far above me. I did not ruin her,\nsimply because I loved her; loved her truly. And now she\'s a good, happy\nmemory! [Drinks].\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Yes, I understand, I understand. It\'s ideal.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I\'ll tell you something. I have had my passions, and once I was\nin love with a lady--very handsome--and I loved her nastily, like a dog.\nShe gave me a _rendezvous_. And I did not go, because I thought it was\ntreating the husband shabbily. And it is strange that, even now, when I\nremember it I want to feel pleased and to approve of myself for having\nacted honourably, but I always repent as if I had committed a sin! But\nin the case of M\xc3\xa1sha, on the contrary, I am always pleased--pleased that\nI did not pollute that feeling of mine.... I may fall lower still, sell\nall I have on me, be covered with lice and sores--but this jewel ... no,\nnot jewel, but ray of sunshine, is still with me and in me.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. I understand, I understand! And where is she now?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I don\'t know! And I\'d rather not know. All _that_ belonged to a\ndifferent life; and I don\'t want to mix it up with this....\n\n    A woman is heard screaming at a table behind. The manager and a\n    policeman come in and take her out. F\xc3\xa9dya and Petushk\xc3\xb3v listen, and\n    look on in silence. When all is quiet again,\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Yes, your life is astonishing.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No, it\'s most simple! You know, in the society in which I was\nborn there are only three careers open to a man--only three. The first\nis to enter the civil or military service, to earn money and increase\nthe abominations amid which we live. That was repulsive to me. Perhaps I\nhad not the capacity for it; but above all it repelled me. Then the\nsecond is to destroy those abominations. To do that you must be a hero;\nand I am not a hero. And the third is to forget it all by going on the\nspree, drinking and singing. That is what I did. And this is what my\nsinging has brought me to! [Drinks].\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. And what about family life? I should be happy if I had a\nwife. My wife ruined me.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Family life? Yes, my wife was an ideal woman. She is still\nliving. But how shall I tell you? There was no yeast in it--you know,\nthe yeast that makes the beer froth! Well, there was nothing of that in\nour life: it was flat, and I wanted something to help me to forget--and\none can\'t forget when there\'s no sparkle in life. Then I began to do all\nsorts of nasty things. And you know, we love people for the good we do\nthem, and dislike them for the harm we do them; and I did her much harm.\nShe seemed to love me\xc2\xa0...\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Why do you say "seemed"?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I say it because there was never anything about her that made her\ncreep into my soul as M\xc3\xa1sha did. But that\'s not what I meant to say.\nWhen she was pregnant, or nursing her baby, I used to vanish, and come\nhome drunk; and of course, just because of that, I loved her less and\nless. Yes, yes! [in ecstasy] I have it! The reason I love M\xc3\xa1sha is that\nI did her good and not harm. That\'s why I love her. The other one I\ntormented, and therefore I don\'t like her.... No, after all, I simply\ndon\'t like her! Was I jealous? Yes, but that too is past....\n\n    Enter Art\xc3\xa9myev, with a cockade on his cap, dyed moustaches, and old\n    renovated clothes.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. Wish you a good appetite! [Bows to F\xc3\xa9dya] I see you\'ve made\nacquaintance with our painter, our artist.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [coldly] Yes, we are acquainted.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV [to Petushk\xc3\xb3v] And have you finished the portrait?\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. No, I lost the order.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV [Sits down] I\'m not in your way?\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya and Petushk\xc3\xb3v do not answer.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich was telling me about his life.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. Secrets? Then I won\'t disturb you--go on? I\'m sure I don\'t\nwant you. Swine! [Goes to next table and calls for beer. He listens all\nthe time to F\xc3\xa9dya\'s conversation with Petushk\xc3\xb3v, and leans towards them\nwithout their noticing it.]\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I don\'t like that gentleman.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. He was offended.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, let him be! I can\'t stand him. He is such a fellow, my\nwords won\'t come when he is there. Now with you I feel at ease, and\ncomfortable. Well, what was I saying?\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. You were speaking about your jealousy. And how was it you\nparted from your wife?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Ah! [Pauses and considers] It\'s a curious story. My wife is\nmarried\xc2\xa0...\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. How\'s that? Are you divorced?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [smiles] No, I left her a widow.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. What do you mean?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I mean that she\'s a widow! I don\'t exist.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Don\'t exist?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No, I\'m a corpse! Yes\xc2\xa0... [Art\xc3\xa9myev leans over, listening] Well,\nyou see--I _can_ tell _you_ about it; and besides, it happened long ago;\nand you don\'t know my real name. It was this way. When I had tired out\nmy wife and had squandered everything I could lay my hands on, and had\nbecome unbearable, a protector turned up for her. Don\'t imagine that\nthere was anything dirty or bad about it--no, he was my friend and a\nvery good fellow--only in everything my exact opposite! And as there is\nfar more evil than good in me, it follows that he was a good--a very\ngood man: honourable, firm, self-restrained and, in a word, virtuous. He\nhad known my wife from her childhood, and loved her. When she married me\nhe resigned himself to his fate. But later, when I became horrid and\ntormented her, he began to come oftener to our house. I myself wished\nit. They fell in love with one another, and meanwhile I went altogether\nto the bad, and abandoned my wife of my own accord. And besides, there\nwas M\xc3\xa1sha. I myself advised them to marry. They did not want to, but I\nbecame more and more impossible, and it ended in\xc2\xa0...\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. The usual thing?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No. I am sure; I know for certain that they remained pure. He is\na religious man, and considers marriage without the Church\'s blessing a\nsin. So they began asking me to agree to a divorce. I should have had to\ntake the blame on myself. It would have been necessary to tell all sorts\nof lies ... and I couldn\'t! Believe me, it would have been easier for me\nto take my life than to tell such lies--and I wished to do so. But then\na kind friend came and said, "Why do it?" and arranged it all for me. I\nwrote a farewell letter, and next day my clothes, pocket-book and\nletters were found on the river bank. I can\'t swim.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Yes, but how about the body? They did not find that!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. They did! Fancy! A week later somebody\'s body was found. My wife\nwas called to identify the decomposing body. She just glanced at it. "Is\nit he?" "It is." And so it was left. I was buried, and they married and\nare living in this town, happily. And I--here I am, living and drinking!\nYesterday I passed their house. The windows were lit up, and someone\'s\nshadow crossed the blind. Sometimes it\'s horrid, and sometimes not. It\'s\nhorrid when I\'ve no money\xc2\xa0... [Drinks].\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV [approaches] Excuse me, but I heard your story. It\'s a very\ngood story, and more than that--a very useful one! You say it\'s horrid\nwhen one has no money? There\'s nothing more horrid. But you, in your\nposition, should always have money. Aren\'t you a corpse? Well then\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Excuse me! I did not speak to you and don\'t want your advice.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. But I want to give it! You are a corpse; but suppose you come\nto life again? Then they, your wife and that gentleman, who are so\nhappy--they would be bigamists, and at best would be sent to the less\ndistant parts of Siberia. So why should you lack money?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I beg you to leave me alone.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. Simply write a letter. I\'ll write it for you if you like; only\ngive me their address, and you\'ll be grateful to me.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Be off, I tell you! I have told you nothing!\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. Yes, you have! Here\'s my witness. The waiter heard you say you\nwere a corpse.\n\nWAITER. I know nothing about it.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You scoundrel!\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. Am I a scoundrel? Eh, police! I\'ll give him in charge!\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya rises to go, but Art\xc3\xa9myev holds him. Enter policeman.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    The ivy-covered verandah of a bungalow in the country. Anna\n    Dm\xc3\xadtrievna Kar\xc3\xa9nina. Lisa (pregnant), nurse, and boy.\n\nLISA. Now he\'s on his way from the station.\n\nBOY. Who is?\n\nLISA. Papa.\n\nBOY. Papa\'s coming from the station?\n\nLISA. _C\'est \xc3\xa9tonnant comme il l\'aime, tout-\xc3\xa0-fait comme son p\xc3\xa8re._[23]\n\n  [23] It is surprising how he loves him--just as if he were his father.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. _Tant mieux! Se souvient-il de son p\xc3\xa8re v\xc3\xa9ritable?_[24]\n\n  [24] So much the better! Does he remember his real father?\n\nLISA [sighs] I never speak to him about it. I say to myself, "Why\nconfuse him?" Sometimes I think I ought to tell him. What is your\nopinion, _Maman_?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I think it is a matter of feeling, Lisa, and if you\nobey your feelings your heart will tell you what to say and when to say\nit. What a wonderful conciliator death is! I confess there was a time\nwhen F\xc3\xa9dya--whom I had known from a child--was repulsive to me; but now\nI only remember him as that nice lad, Victor\'s friend, and as the\npassionate man who sacrificed himself--illegally and irreligiously, but\nstill sacrificed himself--for those he loved. _On aura beau dire,\nl\'action est belle._[25]... I hope Victor will not forget to bring the\nwool: I\'ve hardly any left. [Knits].\n\n  [25] Say what one likes--it is a fine action.\n\nLISA. I hear him coming.\n\n    The sound of wheels and bells is heard. Lisa rises, and goes to the\n    edge of the veranda.\n\nLISA. There\'s someone with him, a lady in a bonnet--It\'s Mother! I have\nnot seen her for an age. [Goes to the door].\n\n    Enter Kar\xc3\xa9nin and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [kisses Lisa and Anna Dm\xc3\xadtrievna] Victor met me, and has\nbrought me here.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. He has done well.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, certainly. I thought to myself, "When shall I see\nher again?" and kept putting it off. But now I\'ve come, and if you don\'t\nturn me out I will stay till the last train.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [kisses his wife, mother, and the boy] D\'you know what a piece\nof luck! Congratulate me--I have two days\' holiday. They\'ll be able to\nget on without me to-morrow.\n\nLISA. Splendid! Two days! It\'s long since we had that! We\'ll drive to\nthe Hermitage, shall we?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What a likeness! Isn\'t he a strapping fellow? If only he\nhas not inherited everything--his father\'s heart\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. But not his weakness.\n\nLISA. No, everything! Victor agrees with me that if only he had been\nrightly guided in childhood\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, I don\'t know about that; but I simply can\'t think\nof him without tears.\n\nLISA. No more can we. How much higher he stands now in our recollection!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, I am sure of it.\n\nLISA. How it all seemed insoluble at one time--and then everything\nsuddenly came right.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Well, Victor, did you get the wool?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, I did. [Brings a bag, and takes out parcels]. Here is the\nwool, and this is the eau-de-Cologne; and here are letters--one "On\nGovernment Service" for you, Lisa [hands her a letter]. Well Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna, if you want to wash your hands I will show you your room. I\nmust make myself tidy too; it is almost dinner time. Lisa, Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\'s room is the corner one downstairs, isn\'t it?\n\n    Lisa is pale; holds the letter in trembling hands, and reads it.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. What\'s the matter? Lisa, what is it?\n\nLISA. He is alive!... Oh God! When will he release me! Victor, what does\nthis mean? [Sobs].\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [Takes letter and reads] This is dreadful!\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. What is it? Why don\'t you tell me?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. It is dreadful! He\'s alive, she\'s a bigamist, and I a\ncriminal! It\'s a notice from the Examining Magistrate--a summons for\nLisa to appear before him.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. What a dreadful man! Why has he done this?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. All lies, lies!\n\nLISA. Oh, how I hate him! I don\'t know what I am saying\xc2\xa0... [Exit in\ntears. Kar\xc3\xa9nin follows her].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. How is it he\'s alive?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. All I know is, that as soon as Victor came in contact\nwith this world of mud--they were sure to draw him in too! And so they\nhave. It\'s all fraud--all lies!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT VI\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    The room of an Examining Magistrate, who sits at a table talking to\n    M\xc3\xa9lnikov. At a side table a clerk is sorting papers.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. But I never said anything of the kind to her. She\ninvented it, and now reproaches me.\n\nM\xc3\x89LNIKOV. She does not reproach you, but is grieved.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. All right, I\'ll come to dinner. But now I have a\nvery interesting case on. [To Clerk] Ask her in.\n\nCLERK. Shall I ask them both?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE [finishes his cigarette and hides it] No, only Mrs.\nKar\xc3\xa9nina, or rather--by her first husband--Prot\xc3\xa1sova.\n\nM\xc3\x89LNIKOV [going out] Ah, Kar\xc3\xa9nina!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Yes, it\'s a nasty affair. It\'s true I am only\nbeginning to look into it, but it\'s a bad business. Well, good-bye!\n[Exit M\xc3\xa9lnikov].\n\n    Enter Lisa, in black and veiled.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Take a seat, please. [Points to a chair] Believe\nme, I much regret to have to question you, but we are under the\nnecessity ... Please be calm, and remember that you need not answer my\nquestions. Only, in my opinion, for your own sake--and in fact for\neverybody\'s sake--the truth is best. It is always best, even\npractically.\n\nLISA. I have nothing to conceal.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Well then [looks at paper]--your name, position,\nreligion--all that I have put down. Is it correct?\n\nLISA. Yes.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. You are accused of contracting a marriage with\nanother man, knowing your husband to be alive.\n\nLISA. I did not know it.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. And also of having persuaded your husband, and\nbribed him with money, to commit a fraud--a pretended suicide--in order\nto free yourself of him.\n\nLISA. That is all untrue.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Well then, allow me to put a few questions. Did\nyou send him 1,200 roubles in July of last year?\n\nLISA. It was his own money, the proceeds of the sale of some things of\nhis. At the time I parted from him, and when I was expecting a divorce,\nI sent him the money.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Just so! Very well. That money was sent to him on\nthe 17th of July, two days before his disappearance?\n\nLISA. I think it was on the 17th, but I don\'t remember.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. And why was the application to the Consistorium\nfor a divorce withdrawn, just at that time--and the lawyer told not to\nproceed with the case?\n\nLISA. I don\'t know.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Well, and when the police asked you to identify\nthe body, how was it you recognised it as your husband\'s?\n\nLISA. I was so excited that I did not look at the body, and I felt so\nsure it was he, that when they asked me I answered, "I think it is he."\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Yes, you did not see well, in consequence of a\nvery natural excitement. And now may I ask why you have sent a monthly\nremittance to Sar\xc3\xa1tov, the very town where your first husband was\nliving?\n\nLISA. My husband sent that money, and I cannot say what it was for, as\nthat is not my secret. But it was not sent to Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich, for\nwe were firmly convinced of his death. That I can say for certain.[26]\n\n  [26] Had Tolstoy lived to give a final revision to this play, he would\n  probably have made it clearer that Kar\xc3\xa9nin sent a monthly payment to\n  the clockmaker Evg\xc3\xa9nyev, in response to the request contained in the\n  last letter F\xc3\xa9dya addressed to Lisa and himself; and that this money\n  found its way to F\xc3\xa9dya.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Very well. Only allow me to remark, madam, that\nthe fact of our being servants of the law does not prevent our being\nmen; and believe me I quite understand your position and sympathise with\nyou! You were tied to a man who squandered your property, was\nunfaithful--in short, brought misfortune....\n\nLISA. I loved him.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Yes; but still the desire to free yourself was\nnatural, and you chose this simpler way, without realising that it would\nlead you into what is considered a crime--bigamy! I quite understand it.\nThe judges will understand too; and therefore I advise you to confess\neverything.\n\nLISA. I have nothing to confess. I have never lied. [Cries] Do you want\nme any longer?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I must ask you to remain here. I will not trouble\nyou with any more questions. Only kindly read this over and sign it. It\nis your deposition. See whether your answers have been correctly taken\ndown. Please take that seat. [Points to an armchair by the window. To\nClerk] Ask Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin to come in.\n\n    Enter Kar\xc3\xa9nin, stern and solemn.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Please take a seat.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Thank you! [Remains standing] What do you want of me?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I have to take your deposition.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. In what capacity?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE [smiling] I, in the capacity of Examining\nMagistrate, am obliged to question you in the capacity of an accused\nperson.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Indeed! Accused of what?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Of marrying a woman whose husband was alive.\nHowever, allow me to question you properly. Kindly sit down.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Thank you.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Your name?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Victor Kar\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Your calling?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Chamberlain and Member of Council.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Age?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Thirty-eight.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Religion?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Orthodox; and I have never before been tried or questioned!\nWell?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Did you know that Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich Prot\xc3\xa1sov\nwas alive when you married his wife?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I did not know it. We were both convinced that he was drowned.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. After Prot\xc3\xa1sov\'s alleged death, to whom in Sar\xc3\xa1tov\ndid you send a monthly remittance?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I do not wish to reply to that question.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Very well. Why did you send money--1,200\nroubles--to Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov just before his pretended death on 17th July?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. That money was given to me by my wife\xc2\xa0...\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. By Mrs. Prot\xc3\xa1sova?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. ...\xc2\xa0by my wife, to send to her husband. She considered that\nmoney to be his, and having severed all connection with him, considered\nit unfair to keep it.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. One more question--why did you withdraw the\napplication for divorce?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Because Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich undertook to apply for a divorce,\nand wrote me about it.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Have you got his letter?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. It has been lost.[27]\n\n  [27] Kar\xc3\xa9nin does not produce F\xc3\xa9dya\'s letter because it would have\n  proved connivance in the divorce proceedings.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. It is strange that everything which might convince\nthe Court of the truth of your evidence should either be lost or\nnon-existent.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Do you want anything more?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I want nothing, except to do my duty; but you\'ll\nhave to exonerate yourselves, and I have just advised Mrs. Prot\xc3\xa1sova,\nand I advise you also, not to try to hide what everyone can see, but to\nsay what really happened. Especially as Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov is in such a\ncondition that he has already told everything just as it happened, and\nwill probably do the same in Court, I should advise\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I request you to keep within the limits of your duty, and not\nto give me your advice! May we go? [Approaches Lisa, who rises and takes\nhis arm].\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I am very sorry to be obliged to detain you\xc2\xa0...\n[Kar\xc3\xa9nin looks round in astonishment] Oh, I don\'t mean that I arrest\nyou. Though that would make it easier to get at the truth, I shall not\nresort to such a measure. I only want to take Prot\xc3\xa1sov\'s deposition in\nyour presence, and to confront him with you--which will make it easier\nfor you to detect any falsehood in what he says. Please take a seat.\nCall in Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov!\n\n    Enter F\xc3\xa9dya, dirty and shabby.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [addresses Lisa and Kar\xc3\xa9nin] Lisa! Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna! Victor! I\nam not guilty! I wished to act for the best. But if I am guilty ...\nforgive me, forgive me! [Bows low to them].\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Please to answer my questions.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Ask, then.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Your name?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Why, you know it!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Please answer.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well then, Theodore Prot\xc3\xa1sov.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Your calling, age and religion?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [after a pause] Aren\'t you ashamed to ask such nonsense? Ask what\nyou want to know, and not such rubbish!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I beg you to be more careful in your expressions,\nand to answer my questions!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, if you\'re not ashamed of it, here you are: Calling,\ngraduate; age, forty; religion, Orthodox. What next!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Did Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin and your wife know that you were\nalive when you left your clothes on the river bank and disappeared?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Certainly not! I wished really to commit suicide, but\nafterwards--but there\'s no need to go into that. The thing is, that they\nknew nothing about it.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. How is it that you gave a different account to the\npolice officer?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What police officer? Oh, when he came to see me at the dosshouse?\nI was drunk, and was romancing. I don\'t remember what I said. All that\nwas rubbish. Now I am not drunk, and am telling the whole truth! They\nknew nothing. They believed that I was no longer alive, and I was glad\nof it. And everything would have gone on as it was, but for that rascal,\nArt\xc3\xa9myev! If anyone is guilty, it is I alone.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I understand your wish to be magnanimous, but the\nlaw demands the truth. Why was money sent to you?\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya is silent.\n\nYou received through Semy\xc3\xb3nov the money sent to you in Sar\xc3\xa1tov?\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya is silent.\n\nWhy don\'t you answer? It will be put down in the depositions that the\naccused did not answer these questions, and this may harm you and them\nvery much. Well then, how was it?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [after a pause] Oh, Mr. Magistrate, how is it you are not ashamed!\nWhy do you pry into other people\'s lives? You are glad to have power,\nand to show it, you torment not physically but morally--torment people a\nthousand times better than yourself!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I beg\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You\'ve nothing to beg! I shall say what I think, and you [to\nClerk] write it down! At least for once there will be sensible human\nwords in a police report! [Raises his voice] There are three people: I,\nhe, and she. Our relations to one another are complex--a spiritual\nstruggle such as you know nothing of, a struggle between good and evil\ngoes on. That struggle ends in a manner which sets them free. They were\nall at peace. They were happy, and remembered me with affection. I,\nfallen as I was, was glad that I had acted as I ought, and that I, a\ngood-for-nothing, had gone out of their lives, so as not to stand in the\nway of people who were good and who had life before them. And so we were\nall living, when suddenly a blackmailing scoundrel appears who wants me\nto take part in his rascality, and I send him about his business. Then\nhe comes to you, to the champion of Justice! The guardian of Morality!\nAnd you, who receive each month a few pounds for doing your dirty work,\nput on your uniform, and calmly bully these people--bully people whose\nlittle finger is worth more than your whole body and soul! People who\nwould not admit you to their anteroom! But you have got so far, and are\npleased\xc2\xa0...\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I shall have you turned out!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I\'m not afraid of anyone, because I\'m a corpse and you can\'t do\nme any harm. No position could be worse than mine! So turn me out!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. May we go?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Immediately, but first sign your deposition.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You\'d be quite comic, if you weren\'t so vile!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Take him away! I arrest you.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [to Lisa and Kar\xc3\xa9nin] Forgive me!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [approaches and holds out his hand] It had to happen!\n\n    Lisa passes by. F\xc3\xa9dya bows low to her.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    A corridor of the Law Courts. In the background a door with glass\n    panels, beside which stands an usher. Further to the right another\n    door through which the accused are led.\n\n    Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich Alex\xc3\xa1ndrov comes to the first door and wishes to\n    enter.\n\nUSHER. Where are you going? You mustn\'t! Shoving in like that!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Why mustn\'t I? The law says the proceedings are public.\n[Applause is heard from inside the Court].\n\nUSHER. Anyhow, you mustn\'t, and that\'s all about it.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Ignorant fellow! You don\'t know whom you are speaking\nto!\n\n    A Young Lawyer in a dress-suit enters from the Court.\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. Are you concerned in this case?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. No, I am the public, and this ignoramus--this\nCerberus--won\'t let me in!\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. But this door is not for the public.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. I know, but I am a man who should be admitted.\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. Wait a bit--they\'ll adjourn in a minute. [Is just going,\nwhen he meets Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov].\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. May I ask how the case stands?\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. The Counsel are speaking--Petr\xc3\xbashin is addressing the\nCourt.\n\n    Applause from within.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. And how do the defendants bear their position?\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. With great dignity, especially Kar\xc3\xa9nin and Elisabeth\nAndr\xc3\xa9yevna. It is as if not they were being indicted, but they were\nindicting society! That\'s what is felt, and on that Petr\xc3\xbashin is\nworking.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Well, and Prot\xc3\xa1sov?\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. He is terribly excited. He trembles all over; but that is\nnatural, considering the life he leads. He is particularly irritable,\nand interrupted the Public Prosecutor and Counsel several times\xc2\xa0...\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. What do you think the result will be?\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. It is hard to say. In any case they won\'t be found guilty\nof premeditation; but still\xc2\xa0... [A gentleman comes out, and Prince\nAbr\xc3\xa9zkov moves towards the door] You wish to go in?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I should like to.\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. You are Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I am.\n\nYOUNG LAWYER [to Usher] Let this gentleman pass. There is an empty chair\njust to the left.\n\n    Usher lets Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov pass. As the door opens, Counsel is seen\n    speaking.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Aristocrats! I am an aristocrat of the soul, and that is\nhigher!\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. Well, excuse me\xc2\xa0... [Exit].\n\n    Petushk\xc3\xb3v enters hurriedly, and approaches Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Ah, how are you, Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich? How are things going?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Counsel are still speaking, but this fellow won\'t let me\nin.\n\nUSHER. Don\'t make a noise here! This is not a public-house!\n\n    Applause. The doors open. Lawyers, and the public--men and\n    women--come out.\n\nA LADY. Splendid! He really moved me to tears.\n\nOFFICER. It\'s better than any novel. Only I don\'t understand how she\ncould love him so. Dreadful object!\n\n    The other door opens. The accused come out: first Lisa, then\n    Kar\xc3\xa9nin. They pass along the corridor. F\xc3\xa9dya follows alone.\n\nLADY. Hush--here he is!

[Hands F\xc3\xa9dya something].\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [Hides it in his pocket, and wishes to pass out, but sees\nPetushk\xc3\xb3v] Stupid! Vile! Dreary, dreary! Senseless. [Wishes to pass].\n\n    Enter Counsel Petr\xc3\xbashin; stout, red, and animated. He approaches\n    F\xc3\xa9dya.\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. Well, friend! Our affairs are going well--only don\'t you go\nand spoil things for me in your last speech!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I won\'t speak. What is the use? I shan\'t do it.\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. Yes, you must speak. But don\'t be excited. The whole matter\nis now in a nutshell! Only tell them what you told me--that if you are\nbeing tried, it is only for _not_ having committed suicide: that is, for\nnot doing what is considered a crime both by civil and ecclesiastical\nlaw.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I shan\'t say anything!\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. Why not?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I don\'t want to, and shan\'t. Tell me only, at the worst, what\nwill it be?\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. I have already told you--at worst, exile to Siberia.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Who will be exiled?\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. You and your wife.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. And at best?\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. Church penance, and of course annulment of the second\nmarriage.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Then they will again tie me to her--or rather, her to me?\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. Yes, that must be so. But don\'t excite yourself, and please\nsay what I told you, and above all, don\'t say anything superfluous.\nHowever [noticing that a circle of listeners has formed round them] I am\ntired, and will go and sit down; and you\'d better take a rest. The chief\nthing is, not to lose courage!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No other sentence is possible?\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN [going] No other.\n\n    Enter Attendant.\n\nATTENDANT. Pass on! Pass on! No loitering in the corridor!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Directly! [Takes out revolver and shoots himself in the heart.\nFalls. All rush on him] All right, I think it is done.... Lisa!...\n\n    The audience, judges, accused, and witnesses rush out from all the\n    doors.\n\n    In front of all is Lisa. Behind her M\xc3\xa1sha, Kar\xc3\xa9nin, Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich\n    and Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov.\n\nLISA. F\xc3\xa9dya, what have you done! Why?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Forgive me that I could not ... free you any other way.... It\'s\nnot for you ... it\'s best for me. I have long ... been ready\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. You will live!\n\n    A Doctor bends over F\xc3\xa9dya and listens.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I need no doctor to tell me ... Good-bye, Victor ... Ah,\nM\xc3\xa1sha!... it\'s too late this time ...

The scene represents a small\n    dining-room.\n\n  [1] Prot\xc3\xa1sov is his family name, but the name by which he is usually\n  addressed is F\xc3\xa9dya, an abbreviation of his Christian name--Theodore.\n  The ceremonious form of address would be Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich.\n\n    Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, a stout grey-haired lady, tightly laced, is sitting\n    alone at the tea-table on which is a samov\xc3\xa1r. Enter nurse, carrying\n    a teapot.\n\nNURSE. May I have a little hot water, ma\'am?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes. How\'s Baby?\n\nNURSE. He\'s restless.... There\'s nothing worse than for a lady to nurse\nher baby herself! She has her troubles, and the child must suffer. What\ncan her milk be like, when she lies awake crying all night?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. But she seems quieter now.\n\nNURSE. Quiet, indeed! It makes one ill to see her. She\'s been writing\nsomething, and crying.\n\n    Enter S\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA [to Nurse] Lisa is looking for you.\n\nNURSE. I\'m coming, I\'m coming. [Exit].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Nurse says she keeps on crying.... Why can\'t she control\nherself?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Well really, mother, you are amazing!... A woman has left her\nhusband, her child\'s father, and you expect her to be calm!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, not calm ... But what\'s done is done! If I, her\nmother, not only allowed my daughter to leave her husband, but am even\nglad she has done it, that shows he deserved it. One ought to rejoice,\nnot to grieve, at the chance of freeing oneself from such a bad man!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Mother, why say such things? You know it\'s not true! He\'s not\nbad--but on the contrary, he\'s a wonderful man, in spite of his\nweaknesses.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes indeed, a "wonderful" man--as soon as he has money in\nhis pocket--his own or other people\'s....\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Mother! He has never taken other people\'s!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes he has--his wife\'s! Where\'s the difference?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. But he gave all his property to his wife!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Of course, when he knew that otherwise he was sure to\nsquander it all!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Squander or not, I only know that a wife must not separate from\nher husband, especially from such a one as F\xc3\xa9dya.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Then, in your opinion she ought to wait till he has\nsquandered everything, and brought his gipsy mistresses into the house?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. He has no mistresses!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. That\'s the misfortune--he seems to have bewitched you\nall! But not me--no! He won\'t come over me! I see through him, and he\nknows it. Had I been in Lisa\'s place I should have left him a year ago.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. How lightly you say it!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Not lightly at all. It\'s not a light thing for me, as a\nmother, to see my daughter divorced. Believe me it\'s not! But yet it is\nbetter than ruining a young life.... No, I\'m thankful to God that she\nhas at last made up her mind, and that it is all over.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Perhaps it\'s not all over!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Oh! If he only consents to a divorce....\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. What good will that do?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. This good; that she is young, and may again be happy.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Oh mother! It\'s dreadful to hear you speak so! Lisa can\'t love\nanother.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Why not, when she\'s free? Many a man a thousand times\nbetter than your F\xc3\xa9dya might turn up who would be only too happy to\nmarry Lisa.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Mother, it\'s not right! I know you\'re thinking of Victor\nKar\xc3\xa9nin....\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. And why shouldn\'t I? He has loved her these ten years,\nand she loves him.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Yes, but not as a husband! They have been friends from childhood.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. We know those friendships! If only the obstacles were out\nof the way!\n\n    Enter Maid.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What is it?\n\nMAID. The mistress has sent the porter with a note for Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What mistress?\n\nMAID. _Our_ mistress--Mrs. Prot\xc3\xa1sova.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well?\n\nMAID. Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin has sent back word that he will come round at once.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [surprised] We were just speaking of him! Only I can\'t\nthink why ... [to S\xc3\xa1sha] Do you know?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Perhaps I do, and perhaps I don\'t!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You always have secrets!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Lisa will tell you herself when she comes.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [shakes her head. To Maid] The samov\xc3\xa1r must be made to\nboil again. Take it, Douny\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n    Maid takes samov\xc3\xa1r, and exit.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to S\xc3\xa1sha who has risen and is going out] It turns out\njust as I told you! She sent for him at once....\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. She may have sent for him for quite a different reason.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What for, then?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Now, at this moment, Kar\xc3\xa9nin is the same to her as old Nurse\nTr\xc3\xadfonovna.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, you\'ll see.... Don\'t I know her? She has sent for\nhim to comfort her.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Oh mother, how little you know her, to be able to suppose\xc2\xa0...!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, we\'ll see!... And I am very, very glad.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. We _shall_ see! [Exit, humming a tune].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [alone, shakes her head and mutters] It\'s all right, it\'s\nall right!\n\n    Enter Maid.\n\nMAID. Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin has come.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well then, show him in, and tell your mistress.\n\n    Maid exit by inner door. Enter Kar\xc3\xa9nin, who bows to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Your daughter wrote to me to come. I meant to come and see you\nto-night, anyhow. So I was very pleased ... Is Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna[2]\nwell?\n\n  [2] Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna is the polite way of speaking of Mrs.\n  Prot\xc3\xa1sova, otherwise Lisa.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, she is well, but Baby is a bit restless. She will be\nhere directly. [In a melancholy voice] Ah yes! It is a sad time.... But\nyou know all about it, don\'t you?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I do. I was here, you know, the day before yesterday, when his\nletter came. But is it possible that everything is irrevocably settled?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Why of course! Naturally! To go through it all again\nwould be intolerable.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. This is a case where the proverb applies: "Measure ten times\nbefore you cut once." ... It is very painful to cut into the quick.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Of course it is; but then their marriage has long had a\nrift in it, so that the tearing asunder was easier than one would have\nthought. He himself sees that, after what has occurred, it is impossible\nfor him to return.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Why so?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. How can you expect it, after all his horrid\ngoings-on--after he swore it should not happen again, and that if it did\nhe would renounce all rights as a husband and set her perfectly free?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, but how can a woman be free when she is bound by marriage?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. By divorce. He promised her a divorce, and we shall\ninsist on it.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, but Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna loved him so....\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Ah, but her love has suffered such trials that there can\nhardly be anything left of it! Drunkenness, deception, and infidelity\n... Can one love such a husband?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Nothing is impossible to love.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You talk of love! But how can one love such a man--a\nbroken reed, whom one can never depend on? Don\'t you know what it came\nto\xc2\xa0...? [Looks round at the door, and continues hurriedly] All his\naffairs in a muddle, everything pawned, nothing to pay with! Then their\nuncle sends 2,000 roubles to pay the interest on their mortgaged\nestates, and he takes the money and disappears. His wife is left at\nhome, with a sick baby, waiting for him--and at last gets a note asking\nher to send him his clothes and things!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, yes; I know.\n\n    Enter Lisa and S\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, here is Victor Mih\xc3\xa1ylovich,[3] obedient to your\nsummons.\n\n  [3] The polite way of naming Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, but I am sorry I was delayed for a few minutes.\n\nLISA. Thank you. I have a great favour to ask of you, and I have no one\nto turn to but you.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Anything in my power\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. You know all about\xc2\xa0...?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I do.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well then, I shall leave you [To S\xc3\xa1sha] Come, we\'ll leave\nthem alone. [Exit with S\xc3\xa1sha].\n\nLISA. Yes, he wrote to me saying that he considers everything at an end\n... [struggling with her tears] ... and I was hurt!... and so ... In a\nword, I consented to break--I answered, accepting his renunciation.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. And now you repent?\n\nLISA. Yes. I feel that I was wrong, and that I cannot do it. Anything is\nbetter than to be separated from him. In short--I want you to give him\nthis letter.... Please, Victor, give him the letter, and tell him ...\nand bring him back!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [surprised] Yes, but how?\n\nLISA. Tell him I ask him to forget everything, and to return. I might\nsimply send the letter, but I know him: his first impulse, as always,\nwill be the right one--but then someone will influence him, and he\'ll\nchange his mind and not do what he really wants to....\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I will do what I can.\n\nLISA. You\'re surprised at my asking _you_?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. No.... Yet, to tell you the truth--yes, I am surprised.\n\nLISA. But you are not angry?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. As if I could be angry with you!\n\nLISA. I asked you because I know you care for him.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Him, and you too! You know that. I am thinking not of myself,\nbut of you. Thank you for trusting me! I will do what I can.\n\nLISA. I know.... I will tell you everything. To-day I went to Afr\xc3\xa9mov\'s\nto find out where he was. I was told he had gone to the gipsies--which\nis what I feared most of all. I know he will get carried away if he is\nnot stopped in time--and that\'s what has to be done.... So you\'ll go?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Of course, and at once.\n\nLISA. Go!... Find him, and tell him all is forgotten and I am waiting\nfor him.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. But where am I to look for him?\n\nLISA. He is with the gipsies. I went there myself.... I went as far as\nthe porch, and wished to send in the letter, but changed my mind and\ndecided to ask you. Here is the address.... Well, then, tell him to\nreturn: tell him nothing has happened ... all is forgotten. Do it for\nlove of him, and for the sake of our friendship!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I will do all in my power! [Bows, and exit].\n\nLISA. I can\'t, I can\'t! Anything rather than ... I can\'t!\n\n    Enter S\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Well, have you sent?\n\n    Lisa nods affirmatively.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. And he agreed?\n\nLISA. Of course.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. But why just _him_? I don\'t understand.\n\nLISA. But who else?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Don\'t you know he is in love with you?\n\nLISA. That\'s dead and gone. Whom would you have had me send?... Do you\nthink he _will_ come back?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. I am sure of it, because\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Enter Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna. S\xc3\xa1sha is silent.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. And where is Victor Mih\xc3\xa1ylovich?\n\nLISA. He\'s gone.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Gone! How\'s that?\n\nLISA. I asked him to do something for me.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. "Do something?" Another secret!\n\nLISA. It\'s not a secret. I simply asked him to give a letter into\nF\xc3\xa9dya\'s own hands.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. F\xc3\xa9dya? What--to Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich?\n\nLISA. Yes, to F\xc3\xa9dya.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I thought all relations between you were over!\n\nLISA. I can\'t part from him.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What? Are you going to begin all over again?\n\nLISA. I wanted to, and tried ... but I can\'t! Anything you like--only I\ncan\'t part from him!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Then do you want to have him back again?\n\nLISA. Yes.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. To let that skunk into the house again?\n\nLISA. Mother, I beg you not to speak so of my husband!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. He _was_ your husband.\n\nLISA. No, he is my husband still.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. A spendthrift, a drunkard, a rake ... and you can\'t part\nfrom him?\n\nLISA. Why do you torment me! You seem to want to do it.... It\'s hard\nenough for me without that.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I torment you! Well then, I\'ll go. I can\'t stand by and\nsee it....\n\n    Lisa is silent.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I see! That\'s just what you want--I\'m in your way.... I\ncan\'t live so. I can\'t make you out at all! It\'s all so\nnew-fangled--first you make up your mind to separate, then you suddenly\nsend for a man who is in love with you\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. Nothing of the kind.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Kar\xc3\xa9nin proposed to you ... and you send him to fetch\nyour husband! Why? To arouse jealousy?\n\nLISA. Mother, what you are saying is terrible! Leave me alone!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Very well! Turn your mother out of the house, and let in\nyour rake of a husband!... Yes, I will not remain here! Good-bye,\nthen--I leave you to your fate; you can do as you please! [Exit slamming\ndoor].\n\nLISA [drops into a chair] That\'s the last straw!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Never mind.... It will be all right; we\'ll soon pacify Mother.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [passing through] Douny\xc3\xa1sha! My trunk!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Mother, listen!... [follows her out with a significant glance to\nLisa].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    A room in the gipsies\' house. The choir is singing "Kanavela." F\xc3\xa9dya\n    in his shirt-sleeves is lying prone on the sofa. Afr\xc3\xa9mov sits\n    astride a chair in front of the leader of the choir. An officer sits\n    at a table, on which are bottles of champagne and glasses. A\n    musician is taking notes.\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. F\xc3\xa9dya, are you asleep?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [rising] Don\'t talk.... Now let\'s have "Not at Eve."\n\nGIPSY LEADER. That won\'t do, Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich! Let M\xc3\xa1sha sing a solo\nnow.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. All right! And then, "Not at Eve." [Lies down again].\n\nOFFICER. Sing "Fateful Hour."\n\nGIPSY. All agreed?\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Go on!\n\nOFFICER [to musician] Have you taken it down?\n\nMUSICIAN. Quite impossible! It\'s different every time.... And the scale\nis somehow different. Look here! [Beckons to a gipsy woman who is\nlooking on] Is this right? [Hums].\n\nGIPSY. That\'s it, that\'s splendid!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. He\'ll never get it; and if he does take it down and shoves it\ninto an opera, he\'ll only spoil it!... Now, M\xc3\xa1sha, start off! Let\'s have\n"Fateful Hour"--take your guitar. [Rises, sits down opposite her, and\ngazes into her eyes].\n\n    M\xc3\xa1sha sings.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. That\'s good too! M\xc3\xa1sha, you\'re a brick!... Now then, "Not at\nEve"!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. No, wait! First, my burial song....\n\nOFFICER. Why _burial_?\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Because, when I\'m dead ... you know, dead and laid in my\ncoffin, the gipsies will come (you know I shall leave instructions with\nmy wife) and they will begin to sing "I Walked a Mile" ... and then I\'ll\njump out of my coffin!... Do you understand? [To the musician] You just\nwrite this down. [To the gipsies] Well, rattle along!\n\n    Gipsies sing.\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. What do you think of that?... Now then, "My Brave Lads"!\n\n    Gipsies sing.\n\n    Afr\xc3\xa9mov gesticulates and dances. The gipsies smile and continue\n    singing, clapping their hands. Afr\xc3\xa9mov sits down and the song ends.\n\nGIPSIES. Bravo! Michael Andr\xc3\xa9yevich![4] He\'s a real gipsy!\n\n  [4] The polite way of addressing Mr. Afr\xc3\xa9mov.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, _now_ "Not at Eve"!\n\n    Gipsies sing.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. That\'s it! It\'s wonderful ... And where does it all happen--all\nthat this music expresses? Ah, it\'s fine!... And how is it man can reach\nsuch ecstasy, and cannot keep it?\n\nMUSICIAN [taking notes] Yes, it\'s most original.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Not original--but the real thing!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV [to gipsies] Well, have a rest now. [Takes the guitar and sits\ndown beside K\xc3\xa1tya, one of the gipsies].\n\nMUSICIAN. It\'s really simple, except the rhythm....\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [waves his hand, goes to M\xc3\xa1sha, and sits down on sofa beside her]\nOh, M\xc3\xa1sha, M\xc3\xa1sha! How you do turn me inside-out!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. And how about what I asked you for?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What? Money?... [Takes some out of his trouser-pocket] Here, take\nit!\n\n    M\xc3\xa1sha laughs, takes it, and hides it in her bosom.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [to the gipsies] Who can make it out? She opens heaven for me, and\nthen asks for money to buy scents with! [To M\xc3\xa1sha] Why, you don\'t in the\nleast understand what you\'re doing!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Not understand indeed! I understand that when I am in love, I try\nto please my man, and sing all the better.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Do you love me?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Looks like it!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Wonderful! [Kisses her].\n\n    Exeunt most of the gipsies. Some couples remain: F\xc3\xa9dya with M\xc3\xa1sha,\n    Afr\xc3\xa9mov with K\xc3\xa1tya, and the officer with G\xc3\xa1sha. The musician writes.\n    A gipsy man strums a valse tune on the guitar.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. But I\'m married, and your choir won\'t allow it....\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. The choir is one thing, one\'s heart\'s another! I love those I\nlove, and hate those I hate.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Ah! This is good! Isn\'t it?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Of course it\'s good--we\'ve jolly visitors, and are all merry.\n\n    Enter gipsy man.\n\nGIPSY [to F\xc3\xa9dya] A gentleman is asking for you.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What gentleman?\n\nGIPSY. I don\'t know.... Well dressed, wears a sable overcoat--\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. A swell? Well, ask him in. [Exit Gipsy].\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Who has come to see you here?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. The devil knows! Who can want me?\n\n    Enter Kar\xc3\xa9nin. Looks round.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Ah, Victor! I never expected _you_!... Take off your coat!...\nWhat wind has blown you here? Come, sit down and listen to "Not at Eve."\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. _Je voudrais vous parler sans t\xc3\xa9moins._[5]\n\n  [5] I wanted to speak to you alone.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What about?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. _Je viens de chez vous. Votre femme m\'a charg\xc3\xa9 de cette lettre\net puis\xc2\xa0..._[6]\n\n  [6] I have come from your home. Your wife has entrusted me with this\n  letter and besides\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [takes letter, reads, frowns, then smiles affectionately] I say,\nKar\xc3\xa9nin, of course you know what is in this letter?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I know ... and I want to say\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Wait, wait a bit! Please don\'t imagine that I am drunk and my\nwords irresponsible.... I mean, that I am irresponsible! I am drunk, but\nin this matter I see quite clearly.... Well, what were you commissioned\nto say?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I was commissioned to find you, and to tell you ... that ...\nshe ... is waiting for you. She asks you to forget everything and come\nback.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [listens in silence, gazing into Kar\xc3\xa9nin\'s eyes] Still, I don\'t\nunderstand why _you_\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna sent for me, and asked me\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. So\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. But I ask you, not so much in your wife\'s name as from\nmyself.... Come home!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You are a better man than I. (What nonsense! It is easy enough to\nbe better than I) ... I am a scoundrel, and you are a good--yes, a good\nman.... And that is the very reason why I won\'t alter my decision....\nNo! Not on that account either--but simply because I can\'t and won\'t....\nHow could I return?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Let us go to my rooms now, and I\'ll tell her that you will\nreturn to-morrow.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. And to-morrow, what?... I shall still be I, and she--she. [Goes\nto the table and drinks] It\'s best to have the tooth out at one go....\nDidn\'t I say that if I broke my word she was to throw me over? Well, I\nhave broken it, and that\'s the end of it.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. For you, but not for her!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. It is extraordinary that _you_ should take pains to prevent our\nmarriage being broken up!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [is about to speak, but M\xc3\xa1sha comes up]\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [interrupting him] Just hear her sing "The Flax"!... M\xc3\xa1sha!\n\n    The gipsies re-enter.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA [whispers] An ovation, eh?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [laughs] An ovation!... "Victor, my Lord! Son of Michael!"\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Gipsies sing a song of greeting and laudation.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [listens in confusion then asks] How much shall I give them?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, give them twenty-five roubles.[7]\n\n  [7] About \xc2\xa32, 10s.\n\n    Kar\xc3\xa9nin gives the money.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Splendid! And now, "The Flax!"\n\n    Gipsies sing.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [looks round] Kar\xc3\xa9nin\'s bunked!... Well, devil take him!\n\n    Gipsy group breaks up.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [sits down by M\xc3\xa1sha] Do you know who that was?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. I heard his name.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. He\'s an excellent fellow! He came to take me home to my wife. She\nloves a fool like me, and see what I am doing here\xc2\xa0...!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Well, and it\'s wrong! You ought to go back to her.... You ought\nto pity her.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You think I ought to? Well, I think I ought not.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Of course, if you don\'t love her you need not. Only love counts.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. And how do you know that?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Seems I do!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, kiss me then!... Now, let\'s have "The Flax" once more, and\nthen finish up.\n\n    Gipsies sing.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Ah, how good it is! If only one hadn\'t to wake up!... If one\ncould die so!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    Two weeks have passed since Act I. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna and Kar\xc3\xa9nin are\n    discovered sitting in Lisa\'s dining-room. Enter S\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Well, what news?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. The doctor says there is no danger at present, as long as he does\nnot catch cold.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, but Lisa is quite worn out.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. He says it\'s false croup, and a very mild attack. [Points to a\nbasket]. What\'s that?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Grapes. Victor brought them.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Won\'t you have some?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Yes, she likes grapes. She has become terribly nervous.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Naturally--after not sleeping for two nights, and not eating.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. And how about you.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. That\'s quite another matter.\n\n    Enter doctor and Lisa.\n\nDOCTOR [impressively] Yes, that\'s it. Change it every half-hour if he\'s\nawake, but if he\'s asleep don\'t disturb him. You need not paint the\nthroat. The room must be kept at its present temperature\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. But if he again begins to choke?\n\nDOCTOR. He probably won\'t, but if he should, use the spray. And give him\nthe powders: one in the morning and the other at night. I will give you\nthe prescription now.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Have a cup of tea, doctor?\n\nDOCTOR. No thanks.... My patients are expecting me.\n\n    Sits down to the table. S\xc3\xa1sha brings him paper and ink.\n\nLISA. So you\'re sure it is not croup?\n\nDOCTOR [smiling] Perfectly certain!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [to Lisa] And now have some tea, or, better still, go and lie\ndown!... Just see what you look like....\n\nLISA. Oh, now I am alive again. Thank you, you are a true friend!\n[Presses his hand. S\xc3\xa1sha moves away angrily] I am so grateful to you,\ndear friend! At such times one recog\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. What have I done? There\'s really no cause at all to thank me.\n\nLISA. And who stopped up all night? Who fetched the very best doctor?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I am already fully rewarded by the fact that M\xc3\xadsha is out of\ndanger; and above all by your kindness.\n\nLISA [presses his hand again and laughs, showing him some money in her\nhand] That\'s for the doctor; but I never know how to give it....\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Neither do I.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Don\'t know what?\n\nLISA. How to give money to a doctor.... He has saved more than my life,\nand I give him money! It seems so unpleasant.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Let me give it. I know how. It\'s quite simple.\n\nDOCTOR [rises and hands the prescription to Lisa] These powders are to\nbe well mixed in a tablespoonful of boiled water\xc2\xa0... [goes on talking].\n\n    Kar\xc3\xa9nin sits at the table drinking tea; S\xc3\xa1sha and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna come\n    forward.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. I can\'t bear the way they go on! It\'s just as if she were in love\nwith him.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, can it be wondered at?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. It\'s disgusting!\n\n    Doctor takes leave of everybody, and exit. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna goes with\n    him.\n\nLISA [to Kar\xc3\xa9nin] He\'s so sweet now! As soon as even he was a little\nbetter he at once began to smile and crow. I must go to him, but I don\'t\nlike leaving you.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. You had better have a cup of tea, and eat something.\n\nLISA. I don\'t want anything now. I am so happy after all that\nanxiety!... [Sobs].\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. There! You see how worn out you are!\n\nLISA. I\'m so happy!... Would you like to have a look at him?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Of course.\n\nLISA. Then come with me. [Exeunt].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [returning to S\xc3\xa1sha] What are you looking so glum\nabout?... I gave him the money quite well, and he took it.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. It\'s disgusting! She has taken him with her to the nursery. It\'s\njust as if he were her _fianc\xc3\xa9_ or her husband....\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Whatever does it matter to you? Why need you get excited\nabout it? Did you mean to marry him yourself?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. I? Marry that pikestaff? I\'d rather marry I don\'t know whom, than\nhim! Such a thing never entered my head.... I am only disgusted that,\nafter F\xc3\xa9dya, Lisa can be so attracted by a stranger.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Not a stranger, but an old playfellow!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Don\'t I see by their smiles and looks that they are in love?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, what is there to be surprised at in that? He shares\nher anxiety about her baby, shows sympathy and helps her ... and she\nfeels grateful. Besides, why should she not love and marry Victor?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. That would be disgusting--disgusting....\n\n    Enter Kar\xc3\xa9nin and Lisa. Kar\xc3\xa9nin silently takes leave. S\xc3\xa1sha goes of\n    angrily.\n\nLISA [to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna] What\'s the matter with her?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I really don\'t know.\n\n    Lisa sighs, and is silent.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    Afr\xc3\xa9mov\'s sitting-room. Glasses of wine on the table. Afr\xc3\xa9mov,\n    F\xc3\xa9dya, St\xc3\xa1khov (shaggy), Butk\xc3\xa9vich (close-shaven), and Korotk\xc3\xb3v (a\n    tuft-hunter).\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. And I tell you that he\'ll be out of the running! La Belle Bois\nis the best horse in Europe.... Will you bet?\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. Don\'t, my dear fellow.... You know very well that nobody\nbelieves you, or will bet with you.\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. I tell you your Cartouche won\'t be in it!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Stop quarrelling! Let me settle it ... ask F\xc3\xa9dya--he\'ll give\nyou the right tip.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Both horses are good. All depends on the jockey.\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. G\xc3\xbasev is a rascal, and needs a firm hand on him.\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V [shouts] No!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Wait a bit--I\'ll settle your differences.... Who won the Moscow\nDerby?\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. He did--but what of that? It was only chance. If Crakus had\nnot fallen ill.... [Enter footman].\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. What is it?\n\nFOOTMAN. A lady has come, and is asking for Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov.\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. What is she like? A real lady?\n\nFOOTMAN. I don\'t know her name, but she\'s a real lady.\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. F\xc3\xa9dya! a lady to see you!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [startled] Who is it?\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. He doesn\'t know.\n\nFOOTMAN. Shall I ask her into the dining-room?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No, wait.... I\'ll go myself and see.\n\n    Exeunt F\xc3\xa9dya and footman.\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. Who can it be? It must be M\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. Which M\xc3\xa1sha?\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. The gipsy. She\'s in love with him, like a cat.\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. What a darling she is\xc2\xa0...! And how she sings!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Charming! Tany\xc3\xbasha and she! They sang with Peter yesterday.\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. What a lucky fellow that is!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Why? Because the girls are all sweet on him? Not much luck in\nthat!\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. I can\'t bear gipsies--nothing refined about them.\n\nBUTK\xc3\x89VICH. No, you can\'t say that!\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. I\'d give the whole lot for one French woman!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Yes, we know you--and your \xc3\xa6sthetics!... I\'ll go and see who it\nis. [Exit].\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. If it\'s M\xc3\xa1sha, bring her in here! We\'ll make her sing.... No,\nthe gipsies aren\'t what they used to be. Tany\xc3\xbasha, now--by Gad!\n\nBUTK\xc3\x89VICH. And I believe they\'re just the same.\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. Just the same? When instead of their own pieces they sing empty\ndrawing-room songs?\n\nBUTK\xc3\x89VICH. Some drawing-room songs are very good.\n\nKOROTK\xc3\x93V. Will you bet I don\'t get them to sing a drawing-room song so\nthat you won\'t know it from one of their own?\n\nST\xc3\x81KHOV. Korotk\xc3\xb3v always wants to bet!\n\n    Enter Afr\xc3\xa9mov.\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. I say, you fellows, it\'s not M\xc3\xa1sha--and there\'s no room he can\nask her into but this. Let us clear out to the billiard room. [Exeunt].\n\n    Enter F\xc3\xa9dya and S\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA [confused] F\xc3\xa9dya, forgive me if it\'s unpleasant--but for God\'s\nsake hear me!... [Her voice trembles].\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya walks up and down the room. S\xc3\xa1sha sits down, and follows him\n    with her eyes.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. F\xc3\xa9dya! Come home!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Just listen to me, S\xc3\xa1sha ... I quite understand you, S\xc3\xa1sha dear,\nand in your place I should do the same--I should try to find some way to\nbring back the old state of affairs. But if you were me, if--strange as\nit sounds--you, dear sensitive girl, were in my place ... you would\ncertainly have done as I did, and have gone away and ceased to spoil\nsomeone else\'s life.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Spoil? How? As if Lisa could live without you!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Oh, S\xc3\xa1sha dear! Dear heart!... She can, she can! And she will yet\nbe happy--far happier than with me.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Never!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. It seems so to you [Takes her hand] ... But that\'s not the point.\nThe chief thing is, that _I_ can\'t!... You know, one folds a piece of\nthick paper this way and that a hundred times and still it holds\ntogether; but fold it once more, and it comes in half.... So it was with\nLisa and me. It hurts me too much to look into her eyes--and she feels\nthe same, believe me!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. No, no!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You say "No," but you yourself know that it is "Yes"!\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. I can only judge by myself. If I were in her place, and you\nanswered as you are doing, it would be dreadful!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, for _you_\xc2\xa0... [Pause; both are agitated].\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA [rises] Must things really remain so?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I suppose\xc2\xa0...\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. F\xc3\xa9dya come back!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Thank you, S\xc3\xa1sha dear! You will always remain a precious memory\nto me.... But good-bye, dear heart!... Let me kiss you. [Kisses her\nforehead].\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA [agitated] No, I don\'t say good-bye, and I don\'t believe, and\nwon\'t believe ... F\xc3\xa9dya!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well then, listen! But give me your word that what I tell you,\nyou won\'t repeat to anybody--do you promise?\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. Of course!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well then, listen, S\xc3\xa1sha.... It\'s true that I am her husband and\nthe father of her child, but I am--superfluous! Wait, wait--don\'t\nreply.... You think I\'m jealous? Not at all! In the first place, I have\nno right; secondly, I have no cause. Victor Kar\xc3\xa9nin is her old friend\nand mine too. He loves her, and she him.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. No!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. She does--as an honest, moral woman can, who does not allow\nherself to love anyone but her husband. But she loves, and will love him\nwhen this obstacle [points to himself] is removed; and I will remove it,\nand they shall be happy! [His voice trembles].\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. F\xc3\xa9dya, don\'t talk like that!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Why, you know very well that it\'s true! And I shall be glad of\ntheir happiness, and it\'s the best I can do. I shall not return, but\nshall give them their freedom.... Tell them so.... Don\'t answer--and\ngood-bye!\n\n    Kisses her on the forehead, and opens the door for her.\n\nS\xc3\x81SHA. F\xc3\xa9dya--you are wonderful!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Good-bye, good-bye!... [Exit S\xc3\xa1sha].\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, yes.... That\'s the thing ... that\'s the thing!... [Rings].\n\n    Enter footman.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Call your master.... [Exit footman].... And it\'s true--it\'s true.\n\n    Enter Afr\xc3\xa9mov.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Come along!\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. Have you settled matters?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Splendidly! [Sings]\n\n        "And she swore by ev\'ry power\xc2\xa0..."\n\nSplendidly!... Where are they all?\n\nAFR\xc3\x89MOV. They\'re playing billiards.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. That\'s right--we will too [Sings]\n\n        "Rest here, just an hour\xc2\xa0..."\n\nCome along!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov, a sixty-year-old bachelor with moustaches, a\n    retired army man, elegant, very dignified and melancholy-looking.\n    Anna Dm\xc3\xadtrievna Kar\xc3\xa9nina (Victor\'s mother), a fifty-year-old "grande\n    dame" who tries to appear younger, and intersperses her remarks with\n    French expressions.\n\n    Anna Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\'s sitting-room, furnished with expensive simplicity,\n    and filled with souvenirs.\n\n    Anna Dm\xc3\xadtrievna is writing. Footman enters.\n\nFOOTMAN. Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Yes, certainly\xc2\xa0... [Turns round and touches herself up\nbefore the looking-glass].\n\n    Enter Abr\xc3\xa9zkov.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. _J\'esp\xc3\xa8re que je ne force pas la consigne...._[8]\n[Kisses her hand].\n\n  [8] I hope I am not forcing myself on you.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. You know that _vous \xc3\xaates toujours le bienvenu_[9]--and\nto-day especially! You got my note?\n\n  [9] You are always welcome.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I did, and this is my answer.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Ah, my friend! I begin quite to despair. _Il est\npositivement ensorcel\xc3\xa9!_[10] I never before knew him so insistent, so\nobstinate, so pitiless, and so indifferent to me. He has quite changed\nsince that woman dismissed her husband!\n\n  [10] He is positively bewitched!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. What are the facts? How do matters actually stand?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. He wants to marry her come what may.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. And how about the husband?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. He agrees to a divorce.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Dear me!\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. And he, Victor, lends himself to it, with all the\nabominations--lawyers, proofs of guilt--_tout \xc3\xa7a est d\xc3\xa9goutant_![11] And\nit doesn\'t seem to repel him. I don\'t understand him--he was always so\nsensitive, so reserved\xc2\xa0...\n\n  [11] It is all disgusting!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. He is in love! Ah, when a man really loves\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Yes, but how is it that in our day love could be\npure--could be a loving friendship, lasting through life? That kind of\nlove I understand and value.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Nowadays the young generation no longer contents itself\nwith those ideal relations. _La possession de l\'\xc3\xa2me ne leur suffit\nplus._[12] It can\'t be helped!... What can one do with him?\n\n  [12] For them, to possess the soul is no longer enough.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. You must not say that of _him_--but it\'s as if he were\nunder a spell. It\'s just as if he were someone else.... You know, I\ncalled on her. He begged me so. I went there, did not find her in, and\nleft my card. _Elle m\'a fait demander si je ne pourrais la\nrecevoir_;[13] and to-day [looks at the clock] at two o\'clock, that is\nin a few minutes\' time, she will be here. I promised Victor I would\nreceive her, but you understand how I am placed! I am not myself at all;\nand so, from old habit, I sent for you. I need your help!\n\n  [13] She inquired whether I would receive her.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Thank you.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. This visit of hers, you understand, will decide the\nwhole matter--Victor\'s fate! I must either refuse my consent--but how\ncan I?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Don\'t you know her at all?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I have never seen her. But I\'m afraid of her. A good\nwoman could not consent to leave her husband, and he a good man, too! As\na fellow-student of Victor\'s he used to visit us, you know, and was very\nnice. But whatever he may be, _quels que soient les torts qu\'il a eus\nvis-\xc3\xa0-vis d\'elle_,[14] one must not leave one\'s husband. She ought to\nbear her cross. What I don\'t understand is how Victor, with the\nconvictions he holds, can think of marrying a divorced woman! How\noften--quite lately--he has argued warmly with Sp\xc3\xadtsin in my presence,\nthat divorce was incompatible with true Christianity; and now he himself\nis going in for it! _Si elle a pu le charmer \xc3\xa0 un tel point_[15] ... I\nam afraid of her! But I sent for you to know what _you_ have to say to\nit all, and instead of that I have been doing all the talking myself!\nWhat do you think of it? Tell me your opinion. What ought I to do? You\nhave spoken with Victor?\n\n  [14] However he may have wronged her.\n\n  [15] If she has been able to charm him to such a degree\xc2\xa0...\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I have: and I think he loves her. He has grown used to\nloving her; and love has got a great hold on him. He is a man who takes\nthings slowly but firmly. What has once entered his heart will never\nleave it again; and he will never love anyone but her; and he can never\nbe happy without her, or with anyone else.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. And how willingly V\xc3\xa1rya Kaz\xc3\xa1ntseva would have married\nhim! What a girl she is, and how she loves him!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV [smiling]. _C\'est compter sans son h\xc3\xb4te!_[16] That is\nquite out of the question now. I think it\'s best to submit, and help him\nto get married.\n\n  [16] That\'s reckoning without your host!\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. To a divorced woman--and have him meet his wife\'s\nhusband?... I can\'t think how you can speak of it so calmly. Is she a\nwoman a mother could wish to see as the wife of her only son--and such a\nson?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. But what is to be done, my dear friend? Of course it\nwould be better if he married a girl whom you knew and liked; but since\nthat\'s impossible ... Besides it\'s not as if he were going to marry a\ngipsy, or goodness knows who\xc2\xa0...! Lisa Prot\xc3\xa1sova is a very nice good\nwoman. I know her, through my niece Nelly, and know her to be a modest,\nkind-hearted, affectionate and moral woman.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. A moral woman--who makes up her mind to leave her\nhusband!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. This is not like you! You\'re unkind and harsh! Her\nhusband is the kind of man of whom one says that they are their own\nworst enemies; but he is an even greater enemy to his wife. He is a\nweak, fallen, drunken fellow. He has squandered all his property and\nhers too. She has a child.... How can you condemn her for leaving such a\nman? Nor has she left him: he left her.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Oh, what mud! What mud! And I have to soil my hands\nwith it!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. And how about your religion?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Of course, of course! To forgive, "As we forgive them\nthat trespass against us." _Mais, c\'est plus fort que moi!_[17]\n\n  [17] But it\'s beyond me!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. How could she live with such a man? If she had not\nloved anyone else she would have had to leave him. She would have had\nto, for her child\'s sake. The husband himself--an intelligent\nkind-hearted man when he is in his senses--advises her to do it....\n\n    Enter Victor, who kisses his mother\'s hand and greets Prince\n    Abr\xc3\xa9zkov.\n\nVICTOR. Mother, I have come to say this: Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna will be\nhere in a minute, and I beg, I implore you--if you still refuse your\nconsent to my marriage\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA [interrupting him] Of course I still refuse my\nconsent\xc2\xa0...\n\nVICTOR [continues his speech and frowns] In that case I beg, I implore\nyou, not to speak to her of your refusal! Don\'t settle matters\nnegatively\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I don\'t expect we shall mention the subject. For my\npart, I certainly won\'t begin.\n\nVICTOR. And she is even less likely to. I only want you to make her\nacquaintance.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. The one thing I can\'t understand is how you reconcile\nyour desire to marry Mrs. Prot\xc3\xa1sova, who has a husband living, with your\nreligious conviction that divorce is contrary to Christianity.\n\nVICTOR. Mother, this is cruel of you! Are we really so immaculate that\nwe must always be perfectly consistent when life is so complex? Mother,\nwhy are you so cruel to me?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I love you. I desire your happiness.\n\nVICTOR [to Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov] Prince!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Of course you desire his happiness. But it is not easy\nfor you and me, with our grey hairs, to understand the young; and it is\nparticularly difficult for a mother grown accustomed to her own idea of\nhow her son is to be happy. Women are all like that.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Yes, yes indeed! You are all against me! You may do it,\nof course. _Vous \xc3\xaates majeur._[18] ... But you will kill me!\n\n  [18] You are of age.\n\nVICTOR. You are not yourself. This is worse than cruelty!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV [to Victor] Be quiet, Victor. Your mother\'s words are\nalways worse than her deeds.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I shall tell her how I think and feel, but I will do it\nwithout offending her.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Of that I am sure.\n\n    Enter footman.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Here she is.\n\nVICTOR. I\'ll go.\n\nFOOTMAN. Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna Prot\xc3\xa1sova.\n\nVICTOR. I am going. _Please_, Mother! [Exit.]\n\n    Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov also rises.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Ask her in. [To Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov] No, you must please\nstay here!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I thought you\'d find a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ easier.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. No, I\'m afraid ... [Is restless] If I want to be left\n_t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with her, I will nod to you. _Cela d\xc3\xa9pendra._[19] ... To\nbe left alone with her may make it difficult for me. But I\'ll do like\nthat if\xc2\xa0... [Makes a sign].\n\n  [19] It will depend.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I shall understand. I feel sure you will like her. Only\nbe just.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. How you are all against me!\n\n    Enter Lisa, in visiting dress and hat.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA [rising] I was sorry not to find you in, and it is kind\nof you to call.\n\nLISA. I never dreamed that you\'d be so good as to call.... I am so\ngrateful to you for wishing to see me.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA [pointing to Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov] You are acquainted?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Yes, certainly. I have had the pleasure of being\nintroduced. [They shake hands and sit down] My niece Nelly has often\nmentioned you to me.\n\nLISA. Yes, she and I were great friends [glancing timidly at Anna\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna], and we are still friendly. [To Anna Dm\xc3\xadtrievna] I never\nexpected that you would wish to see me.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I knew your husband well. He was friendly with Victor,\nand used to come to our house before he left for Tamb\xc3\xb3v. I think it was\nthere you married?\n\nLISA. Yes, it was there we married.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. But after his return to Moscow he never visited us.\n\nLISA. Yes, he hardly went out anywhere.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. And he never introduced you to me.\n\n    Awkward silence.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. The last time I met you was at the theatricals at the\nDen\xc3\xadsovs\'. They went off very well; and you were acting.\n\nLISA. No ... Yes ... Of course ... I did act. [Silence again]. Anna\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna, forgive me if what I am going to say displeases you, but I\ncan\'t and don\'t know how to dissemble! I have come because Victor\nMih\xc3\xa1ylovich said ... because he--I mean, because you wished to see\nme.... But it is best to speak out [with a catch in her voice] ... It is\nvery hard for me.... But you are kind.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I\'d better go.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Yes, do.\n\n    Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov takes leave of both women, and exit.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Listen, Lisa ... I am very sorry for you, and I like\nyou. But I love Victor. He is the one being I love in the world. I know\nhis soul as I know my own. It is a proud soul. He was proud as a boy of\nseven.... Not proud of his name or wealth, but proud of his character\nand innocence, which he has guarded. He is as pure as a maiden.\n\nLISA. I know.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. He has never loved any woman. You are the first. I do\nnot say I am not jealous. I am jealous. But we mothers--your son is\nstill a baby, and it is too soon for you--we are prepared for that. I\nwas prepared to give him up to his wife and not to be jealous--but to a\nwife as pure as himself\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. I ... have I\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Forgive me! I know it was not your fault, but you are\nunfortunate. And I know him. Now he is ready to bear--and will\nbear--anything, and he would never mention it, but he would suffer. His\nwounded pride would suffer, and he would not be happy.\n\nLISA. I have thought of that.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Lisa, my dear, you are a wise and good woman. If you\nlove him you must desire his happiness more than your own. And if that\nis so, you will not wish to bind him and give him cause to\nrepent--though he would never _say_ a word.\n\nLISA. I know he wouldn\'t! I have thought about it, and have asked myself\nthat question. I have thought of it, and have spoken of it to him. But\nwhat can I do, when he says he does not wish to live without me? I said\nto him: "Let us be friends, but do not spoil your life; do not bind your\npure life to my unfortunate one!" But he does not wish for that.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. No, not at present....\n\nLISA. Persuade him to leave me, and I will agree. I love him for his own\nhappiness and not for mine. Only help me! Do not hate me! Let us\nlovingly work together for his happiness!\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Yes, yes! I have grown fond of you. [Kisses her. Lisa\ncries] And yet, and yet it is dreadful! If only he had loved you before\nyou married\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. He says he did love me then, but did not wish to prevent a\nfriend\'s happiness.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Ah, how hard it all is! Still, we will love one\nanother, and God will help us to find what we want.\n\nVICTOR [entering] Mother, dear! I have heard everything! I expected\nthis: you are fond of her, and all will be well!\n\nLISA. I am sorry you heard. I should not have said it if\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Still, nothing is settled. All I can say is, that if it\nwere not for all these unfortunate circumstances, I should have been\nglad. [Kisses her].\n\nVICTOR. Only, please don\'t change!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    A plainly furnished room; bed, table, sofa. F\xc3\xa9dya alone.\n\n_A knock at the door. A woman\'s voice outside._ Why have you locked\nyourself in, Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich? F\xc3\xa9dya! Open\xc2\xa0...!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [gets up and unlocks door] That\'s right! Thank you for coming.\nIt\'s dull, terribly dull!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Why didn\'t you come to us? Been drinking again? Eh, eh! And after\nyou\'d promised!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. D\'you know, I\'ve no money!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. And why have I taken it into my head to care for you!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. M\xc3\xa1sha!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Well, what about "M\xc3\xa1sha, M\xc3\xa1sha"? If you were really in love,\nyou\'d have got a divorce long ago. They themselves asked you to. You say\nyou don\'t love her, but all the same you keep to her! I see you don\'t\nwish\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. But you know why I don\'t wish!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. That\'s all rubbish. People say quite truly that you\'re an empty\nfellow.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What can I say to you? That your words hurt me, you know without\nbeing told!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Nothing hurts you!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You know that the one joy I have in life is your love.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. _My_ love--yes; but yours doesn\'t exist.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. All right. I\'m not going to assure you. Besides, what\'s the good?\nYou know!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. F\xc3\xa9dya; why torment me?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Which of us torments?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA [cries] You are unkind!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [goes up and embraces her] M\xc3\xa1sha! What\'s it all about? Stop that.\nOne must live, and not whine. It doesn\'t suit you at all, my lovely one!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. You do love me?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Whom else could I love?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Only me? Well then, read what you have been writing.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. It will bore you.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. It\'s you who wrote it, so it\'s sure to be good.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well then listen. [Reads] "One day, late in autumn, my friend and\nI agreed to meet on the Mur\xc3\xbdgin fields, where there was a close thicket\nwith many young birds in it. The day was dull, warm, and quiet. The\nmist\xc2\xa0..."\n\n    Enter two old gipsies, M\xc3\xa1sha\'s parents, Iv\xc3\xa1n Mak\xc3\xa1rovich and Nast\xc3\xa1sia\n    Iv\xc3\xa1novna.\n\nNAST\xc3\x81SIA [stepping up to her daughter] Here you are then, you damned\nrunaway sheep! [To F\xc3\xa9dya] My respects to you, sir! [To M\xc3\xa1sha] Is that\nhow you treat us, eh?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N [to F\xc3\xa9dya] It\'s wrong, sir, what you\'re doing! You\'re ruining the\nwench! Oh, but it\'s wrong ... You\'re doing a dirty deed.\n\nNAST\xc3\x81SIA. Put on your shawl! March at once!... Running away like this!\nWhat can I say to the choir? Gallivanting with a beggar--what can you\nget out of him?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. I don\'t gallivant! I love this gentleman, that\'s all. I\'ve not\nleft the choir. I\'ll go on singing, and what\xc2\xa0...\n\nIV\xc3\x81N. Say another word, and I\'ll pull the hair off your head!...\nSlut!... Who behaves like that? Not your father, nor your mother, nor\nyour aunt!... It\'s bad, sir! We were fond of you--often and often we\nsang to you without pay. We pitied you, and what have you done?\n\nNAST\xc3\x81SIA. You\'ve ruined our daughter for nothing ... our own, our only\ndaughter, the light of our eyes, our priceless jewel--you\'ve trodden her\ninto the mire, that\'s what you\'ve done! You\'ve no conscience.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Nast\xc3\xa1sia Iv\xc3\xa1novna, you suspect me falsely. Your daughter is like\na sister to me. I care for her honour. You must think no evil ... but I\nlove her! What is one to do?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N. But you didn\'t love her when you had money! If you\'d then\nsubscribed ten thousand roubles or so to the choir, you might have had\nher honourably. But now you\'ve squandered everything, and carry her off\nby stealth! It\'s a shame, sir, a shame!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. He has not carried me off! I came to him myself, and if you take\nme away now, I shall come back again. I love him, and there\'s an end of\nit! My love is stronger than all your locks ... I won\'t!\n\nNAST\xc3\x81SIA. Come, M\xc3\xa1sha dearest! Come, my own! Don\'t sulk. You\'ve done\nwrong, and now come along.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N. Now then, you\'ve talked enough! March! [Seizes her hand] Excuse\nus, sir! [Exit the three gipsies].\n\n    Enter Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Excuse me. I have been an unwilling witness of an\nunpleasant scene....\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Whom have I the honour?... [Recognises the Prince] Ah, Prince\nAbr\xc3\xa9zkov! [They shake hands].\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. An unwilling witness of an unpleasant scene. I should\nhave been glad not to hear, but having overheard it, I consider it my\nduty to tell you so. I was directed here, and had to wait at the door\nfor those people to come out--more particularly as their very loud\nvoices rendered my knocking inaudible.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, yes--please take a seat. Thank you for telling me: it gives\nme the right to explain that scene to you. I don\'t mind what you may\nthink of me, but I should like to tell you that the reproaches you heard\naddressed to that girl, that gipsy singer, were unjust. That girl is as\nmorally pure as a dove; and my relations with her are those of a friend.\nThere may be a tinge of romance in them, but it does not destroy the\npurity--the honour--of the girl. That is what I wished to tell you; but\nwhat is it you want of me? In what way can I be of service?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. In the first place, I\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Forgive me, Prince. My present social standing is such, that my\nformer slight acquaintance with you does not entitle me to a visit from\nyou, unless you have some business with me. What is it?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I won\'t deny it. You have guessed right. I have\nbusiness with you; but I beg you to believe that the alteration in your\nposition in no wise affects my attitude towards you.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I am sure of it.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. My business is this. The son of my old friend, Anna\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna Kar\xc3\xa9nina, and she herself, have asked me to ascertain\ndirectly from you what are your relations ... May I speak out?... your\nrelations with your wife, Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna Prot\xc3\xa1sova.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. My relations with my wife, or rather with her who _was_ my wife,\nare entirely at an end.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. So I understood, and that is why I accepted this\ndifficult mission.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. At an end, and, I hasten to add, not by her fault, but by\nmine--by my innumerable faults. She is, as she always was, quite\nirreproachable.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Well then, Victor Kar\xc3\xa9nin, or rather his mother, asked\nme to find out what your intentions are.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [growing excited] What intentions? I have none. I set her quite\nfree! Moreover, I will never disturb her peace. I know she loves Victor\nKar\xc3\xa9nin. Well, let her! I consider him a very dull, but very good and\nhonourable man, and I think that she will, as the phrase goes, be happy\nwith him; and--_que le bon Dieu les b\xc3\xa9nisse_![20] That\'s all\xc2\xa0...\n\n  [20] May God bless them!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Yes, but we\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [interrupting] And don\'t suppose that I feel the least bit\njealous. If I said that Victor is dull, I withdraw the remark. He is an\nexcellent, honourable, moral man: almost the direct opposite of myself.\nAnd he has loved her from childhood. Perhaps she too may have loved him\nwhen she married me--that happens sometimes! The very best love is\nunconscious love. I believe she always did love him; but as an honest\nwoman she did not confess it even to herself. But ... a shadow of some\nkind always lay across our family life--but why am I confessing to you?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Please do! Believe me, my chief reason for coming to\nyou was my desire to understand the situation fully.... I understand\nyou. I understand that the shadow, as you so well express it, may have\nbeen\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, it was; and that perhaps is why I could not find\nsatisfaction in the family life she provided for me, but was always\nseeking something, and being carried away. However, that sounds like\nexcusing myself. I don\'t want to, and can\'t, excuse myself. I was (I say\nwith assurance, _was_) a bad husband. I say _was_, because in my\nconsciousness I am not, and have long not been, her husband. I consider\nher perfectly free. So there you have my answer to your question.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Yes, but you know Victor\'s family, and himself too. His\nrelation to Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna is, and has been all through, most\nrespectful and distant. He assisted her when she was in trouble\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, I by my dissipation helped to draw them together. What\'s to\nbe done? It had to be so!\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. You know the strictly Orthodox convictions of that\nfamily. Having myself a broader outlook on things, I do not share them;\nbut I respect and understand them. I understand that for him, and\nespecially for his mother, union with a woman without a Church marriage\nis unthinkable.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, I know his stu\xc2\xa0... his strictness, his conservatism in these\nmatters. But what do they want? A divorce? I told them long ago that I\nam quite willing; but the business of taking the blame on myself, and\nall the lies connected with it, are very trying....[21]\n\n  [21] Under the Russian law divorce was only obtainable if ocular\n  evidence of adultery was forthcoming, and a great deal of perjury was\n  usually involved in such cases.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I quite understand you, and sympathise. But how can it\nbe avoided? I think it might be arranged that way--but you are right. It\nis dreadful, and I quite understand you.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [pressing the Prince\'s hand] Thank you, dear Prince! I always knew\nyou were a kind and honourable man. Tell me what to do. How am I to act?\nPut yourself in my place. I am not trying to improve. I am a\ngood-for-nothing; but there are things I cannot do quietly. I cannot\nquietly tell lies.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I don\'t understand you! You, a capable, intelligent\nman, so sensitive to what is good--how can you let yourself be so\ncarried away--so forget what you expect of yourself? How have you ruined\nyour life and come to this?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [forcing back tears of emotion] I have led this disorderly life\nfor ten years, and this is the first time a man like you has pitied me!\nI have been pitied by my boon-companions, by rakes and by women; but a\nreasonable, good man like you ... Thank you! How did I come to my ruin?\nFirst, through drink. It is not that drink tastes nice; but do what I\nwill, I always feel I am not doing the right thing, and I feel ashamed.\nI talk to you now, and feel ashamed. As for being a _Mar\xc3\xa9chal de la\nnoblesse_, or a Bank Director--I should feel ashamed, so ashamed! It is\nonly when I drink that I do not feel this shame. And music: not operas\nor Beethoven, but gipsies!... That is life! Energy flows into one\'s\nveins! And then those dear black eyes, and those smiles! And the more\ndelicious it is, the more ashamed one feels afterwards.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. How about work?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I have tried it, but it\'s no good. I am always dissatisfied with\nit--but what\'s the use of talking about myself! I thank you.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Then what am I to say?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Tell them I will do what they wish. They want to get married, and\nthat there should be no obstacle to their marriage?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Of course.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I\'ll do it! Tell them I will certainly do it.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. But when?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Wait a bit. Well, say in a fortnight. Will that do?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Then I may tell them so?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You may. Good-bye, Prince! Thank you once again!\n\n[Exit Prince].\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [sits for a long time and smiles silently] That\'s the way, that\'s\nthe way! It must be so, must be, must be! Splendid!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    A private room in a restaurant. A waiter shows in F\xc3\xa9dya and Iv\xc3\xa1n\n    Petr\xc3\xb3vich Alex\xc3\xa1ndrov.\n\nWAITER. Here, please. No one will disturb you here. I\'ll bring some\npaper directly.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Prot\xc3\xa1sov, I\'ll come in too.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [seriously] If you like, but I\'m busy and ... All right, come in.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. You wish to reply to their demands? I\'ll tell you what\nto say. I should not do it that way--always speak straight out, and act\nwith decision.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [to waiter] A bottle of champagne!\n\n    Exit waiter.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [taking out a revolver and putting it on the table] Wait a bit!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. What\'s that? Do you want to shoot yourself? You can if\nyou like. I understand you! They wish to humiliate you, and you will\nshow them the sort of man you are! You will kill yourself with a\nrevolver, and them with magnanimity. I understand you. I understand\neverything, because I am a genius.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Of course--of course. Only\xc2\xa0... [Enter waiter with paper and ink].\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [covers the revolver with a napkin] Uncork it--let\'s have a drink.\n[They drink. F\xc3\xa9dya writes] Wait a bit!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Here\'s to your ... great journey! You know I\'m above all\nthis. I\'m not going to restrain you! Life and death are alike to\nGenius. I die in life, and live in death. You will kill yourself that\ntwo people should pity you; and I--I shall kill myself that the whole\nworld may understand what it has lost. I won\'t hesitate, or think about\nit! I seize it [snatches revolver]--now! And all is over. But it is too\nsoon yet. [Lays down revolver] Nor shall I write anything; they must\nunderstand it themselves.... Oh, you\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [writing] Wait a bit.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Pitiful people! They fuss, they bustle, and don\'t\nunderstand--don\'t understand anything at all.... I\'m not talking to you,\nI am only expressing my thoughts. And, after all, what does humanity\nneed? Very little--only to value its geniuses. But they always are\nexecuted, persecuted, tortured.... No! I\'m not going to be your toy! I\nwill drag you out into the open! No-o-o! Hypocrites!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [having finished writing, drinks and reads over his letter] Go\naway, please!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Go away? Well, good-bye then! I am not going to restrain\nyou. I shall do the same. But not yet. I only want to tell you\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. All right! You\'ll tell me afterwards. And now, dear chap, just\none thing: give this to the manager [gives him money] and ask if a\nparcel and a letter have come for me.... Please do!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. All right--then you\'ll wait for me? I have still\nsomething important to tell you--something that you will not hear in\nthis world nor in the next, at any rate not till I come there.... Am I\nto let him have _all_ of this?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. As much as is necessary. [Exit Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich.]\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya sighs with relief; locks the door behind Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich; takes\n    up the revolver, cocks it, puts it to his temple; shudders, and\n    carefully lowers it again. Groans.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No; I can\'t! I can\'t! I can\'t! [Knock at the door] Who\'s there?\n\n[M\xc3\xa1sha\'s voice from outside] It\'s me!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Who\'s "me"? Oh, M\xc3\xa1sha\xc2\xa0... [opens door].\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. I\'ve been to your place, to Pop\xc3\xb3v\'s, to Afr\xc3\xa9mov\'s, and guessed\nthat you must be here. [Sees revolver] That\'s a nice thing! There\'s a\nfool! A regular fool! Is it possible you really meant to?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No, I couldn\'t.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Do I count for nothing at all? You heathen! You had no pity for\nme? Oh, Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich, it\'s a sin, a sin! In return for my\nlove\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I wished to release them. I promised to, and I can\'t lie.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. And what about me?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What about you? It would have set you free too. Is it better for\nyou to be tormented by me?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Seems it\'s better. I can\'t live without you.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What sort of life could you have with me? You\'d have cried a bit,\nand then gone on living your own life.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. I shouldn\'t have cried at all! Go to the devil, if you don\'t pity\nme! [Cries].\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. M\xc3\xa1sha, dearest! I meant to do it for the best.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Best for yourself!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [smiles] How\'s that, when I meant to kill myself?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Of course, best for yourself! But what is it you want? Tell me.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What I want? I want a great deal.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Well, what? What?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. First of all, to keep my promise. That is the first thing, and\nquite sufficient. To lie, and do all the dirty work necessary to get a\ndivorce ... I can\'t!\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Granted that it\'s horrid--I myself\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Next, they must really be free--my wife and he. After all, they\nare good people; and why should they suffer? That\'s the second thing.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Well, there isn\'t much good in her, if she\'s thrown you over.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. She didn\'t--I threw her over.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. All right, all right! It\'s always you. She is an angel! What\nelse!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. This--that you are a good, dear girlie--and that I love you, and\nif I live I shall ruin you.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. That\'s not your business. I know quite well what will ruin me.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [sighs] But above all, above all ... What use is my life? Don\'t I\nknow that I am a lost good-for-nothing? I am a burden to myself and to\neverybody--as your father said. I\'m worthless....\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. What rubbish! I shall stick to you. I\'ve stuck to you already,\nand there\'s an end of it! As to your leading a bad life, drinking and\ngoing on the spree--well, you\'re a living soul! Give it up, and have\ndone with it!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. That\'s easily said.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Well, then, do it.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, when I look at you I feel as if I could really do anything.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. And so you shall! Yes, you\'ll do it! [Sees the letter] What\'s\nthat? You\'ve written to them? What have you written?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What have I written?... [Takes the letter and is about to tear it\nup] It\'s no longer wanted now.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA [snatches the letter] You\'ve said you would kill yourself? Yes?\nYou did not mention the revolver--only said that you\'d kill yourself?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, that I should be no more.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Give it me--give it, give it!... Have you read _What to Do_?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I think I have.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. It\'s a tiresome novel, but there\'s one very, very good thing in\nit. That what\'s his name?--Rakhm\xc3\xa1nov--goes and pretends he has drowned\nhimself. And you--can you swim?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. That\'s all right. Let me have your clothes--everything, and your\npocket-book too.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. How can I?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Wait a bit, wait, wait! Let\'s go home; then you\'ll change your\nclothes.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. But it will be a fraud.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. All right! You go to bathe, your clothes remain on the bank, in\nthe pocket is your pocket-book and this letter.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, and then?\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. And then? Why, then we\'ll go off together and live gloriously.\n\n    Enter Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. There now! And the revolver? I\'ll take it.\n\nM\xc3\x81SHA. Take it; take it! We\'re off.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    The Prot\xc3\xa1sovs\' drawing-room.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. He promised so definitely, that I am sure he will keep his\nword.\n\nLISA. I am ashamed to say it, but I must confess that what I heard about\nthat gipsy girl makes me feel quite free. Don\'t think it is jealousy; it\nisn\'t, but you know--it sets me free. I hardly know how to tell you....\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. You don\'t know how to tell me ... Why?\n\nLISA [smiling] Never mind! Only let me explain what I feel. The chief\nthing that tormented me was, that I felt I loved two men; and that meant\nthat I was an immoral woman.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. _You_ immoral?\n\nLISA. But since I knew that he had got someone else, and that he\ntherefore did not need me, I felt free, and felt that I might truthfully\nsay that I love you. Now things are clear within me, and only my\nposition torments me. This divorce! It is such torture--and then this\nwaiting!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. It will soon, very soon, be settled. Besides his promise, I\nsent my secretary to him with the petition ready for signature, and told\nhim not to leave till it is signed. If I did not know him so well, I\nshould think he was purposely behaving as he does.\n\nLISA. He? No, it is the result both of his weakness and his honesty. He\ndoesn\'t want to say what is not true. Only you were wrong to send him\nmoney.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I had to. The want of it might be the cause of the delay.\n\nLISA. No, there is something bad about money.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Well, anyhow, _he_ need not have been so punctilious\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. How selfish we are becoming!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, I confess it. It\'s your own fault. After all that waiting,\nthat hopelessness, I am now so happy! And happiness makes one selfish.\nIt\'s your fault!\n\nLISA. Do you think it\'s you only? I too--I feel full of happiness,\nbathed in bliss! I have everything--M\xc3\xadsha has recovered, your mother\nlikes me, and you--and above all, I, I love!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes? And no repenting? No turning back?\n\nLISA. Since that day everything has changed in me.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. And will not change again?\n\nLISA. Never! I only wish you to have done with it all as completely as I\nhave.\n\n    Enter nurse, with baby. Lisa takes the baby on her lap.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. What wretched people we are!\n\nLISA [kissing baby] Why?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. When you married, and I heard of it on my return from abroad,\nand was wretched because I felt that I had lost you, it was a relief to\nme to find that you still remembered me. I was content even with that.\nThen when our friendship was established and I felt your kindness to me,\nand even a little gleam of something in our friendship that was more\nthan friendship, I was almost happy. I was only tormented by a fear that\nI was not being honest towards F\xc3\xa9dya. But no! I was always so firmly\nconscious that any other relation than one of purest friendship with my\nfriend\'s wife was impossible--besides which, I knew you--that I was not\nreally troubled about that. Afterwards, when F\xc3\xa9dya began to cause you\nanxiety, and I felt that I was of some use to you, and that my\nfriendship was beginning to alarm you--I was quite happy, and a sort of\nvague hope awoke in me. Still later, when he became altogether\nimpossible and you decided to leave him, and I spoke to you plainly for\nthe first time, and you did not say "No," but went away in tears--then I\nwas perfectly happy; and had I then been asked what more I wanted, I\nshould have answered "Nothing"! But later on, when there came the\npossibility of uniting our lives: when my mother grew fond of you and\nthe possibility began to be realised; when you told me that you loved\nand had loved me, and then (as you did just now) that he no longer\nexisted for you and that you love only me--what more, one would think,\ncould I wish for? But no! Now the past torments me! I wish that past had\nnot existed, and that there were nothing to remind me of it.\n\nLISA [reproachfully] Victor!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Lisa, forgive me! If I tell you this, it is only because I\ndon\'t want a single thought of mine about you to be hidden from you. I\nhave purposely told you, to show how bad I am, and how well I know that\nI must struggle with and conquer myself.... And now I\'ve done it! I love\nhim.\n\nLISA. That\'s as it should be. I did all I could, but it was not I that\ndid what you desired: it happened in my heart, from which everything but\nyou has vanished.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Everything?\n\nLISA. Everything, everything--or I would not say so.\n\n    Enter footman.\n\nFOOTMAN. Mr. Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. He\'s come with F\xc3\xa9dya\'s answer.\n\nLISA [to Kar\xc3\xa9nin] Ask him in here.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [rising and going to the door] Well, here is the answer!\n\nLISA [gives baby to nurse; exit nurse] Is it possible, Victor, that\neverything will now be decided? [Kisses Kar\xc3\xa9nin].\n\n    Enter Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Well?\n\nVOZNES\xc3\x89NSKY. He has gone.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Gone! And without signing the petition?\n\nVOZNES\xc3\x89NSKY. The petition is not signed, but a letter was left for you\nand Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna [Takes letter out of his pocket and gives it to\nKar\xc3\xa9nin] I went to his lodgings, and was told he was at the restaurant.\nI went there, and Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov told me to return in an hour and I should\nthen have his answer. I went back, and then\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Is it possible that this means another delay? More excuses! No,\nthat would be downright wicked. How he has fallen!\n\nLISA. But do read the letter! [Kar\xc3\xa9nin opens letter].\n\nVOZNES\xc3\x89NSKY. You do not require me any longer?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Well, no. Good-bye! Thank you\xc2\xa0... [Pauses in astonishment as he\nreads].\n\n    Exit Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky.\n\nLISA. What--what is it?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. This is awful!\n\nLISA [takes hold of letter] Read!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [reads] "Lisa and Victor, I address myself to you both. I won\'t\nlie and call you \'dear\' or anything else. I cannot master the feeling of\nbitterness and reproach (I reproach myself, but all the same it is\npainful) when I think of you and of your love and happiness. I know\neverything. I know that though I was the husband, I have--by a series of\naccidents--been in your way. _C\'est moi qui suis l\'intrus._[22] But all\nthe same, I cannot restrain a feeling of bitterness and coldness towards\nyou. I love you both in theory, especially Lisa, Lisette! But actually I\nam more than cold towards you. I know I am wrong, but cannot change."\n\n  [22] It is I who am the intruder.\n\nLISA. How can he\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [continues reading] "But to business! This very feeling of\ndiscord within me forces me to fulfil your desire not in the way you\nwish. Lying, acting so disgusting a comedy, bribing the Consistorium,\nand all those horrors, are intolerably repulsive to me. Vile as I may\nbe, I am vile in a different way, and cannot take part in those\nabominations--simply cannot! The solution at which I have arrived is the\nsimplest: to be happy, you must marry. I am in the way; consequently I\nmust destroy myself...."\n\nLISA [seizes Victor\'s hand] Victor!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [reads] "...\xc2\xa0must destroy myself. And I will do it. When you get\nthis letter, I shall be no more.\n\n"_P.S._ What a pity you sent me money to pay for the divorce proceedings!\nIt is unpleasant, and unlike you! But it can\'t be helped. I have so\noften made mistakes, why shouldn\'t you make one? I return the money. My\nway of escape is shorter, cheaper, and surer. All I ask is, don\'t be\nangry with me, and think kindly of me. And, one thing more--there is a\nclockmaker, Evg\xc3\xa9nyev, here. Can\'t you help him, and set him on his feet?\nHe\'s a good man, though weak.--Good-bye,\n\n                                                        "F\xc3\x89DYA."\n\nLISA. He has taken his life! Yes\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [rings, and runs out to the hall] Call Mr. Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky back!\n\nLISA. I knew it! I knew it! F\xc3\xa9dya, dear F\xc3\xa9dya!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Lisa!\n\nLISA. It\'s not true, not true that I didn\'t love him and don\'t love him!\nI love only him! I love him! And I\'ve killed him. Leave me!\n\n    Enter Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Where is Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov? What did they tell you?\n\nVOZNES\xc3\x89NSKY. They told me he went out this morning, left this letter,\nand had not returned.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. We shall have to find out about it, Lisa. I must leave you.\n\nLISA. Forgive me, but I too can\'t lie! Go now--go, and find out\xc2\xa0...\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT V\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    A dirty room in a low-class restaurant. A table, at which people sit\n    drinking tea and v\xc3\xb3dka. In the foreground a small table, at which\n    sits F\xc3\xa9dya, tattered, and much come down in the world. With him is\n    Petushk\xc3\xb3v, a gentle, mild man with long hair, of clerical\n    appearance. Both are slightly drunk.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. I understand, I understand. That is true love! Yes? Go on.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, you know, if a woman of our class showed such feeling and\nsacrificed everything for the man she loved.... But she was a gipsy,\nbrought up to money-hunting, and yet she had this self-sacrificing love!\nGave everything, and wanted nothing herself! The contrast was so\nwonderful!\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Yes, in art we call it "value." You can only get quite bright\nred by putting green round it. But that\'s not to the point. I\nunderstand, quite understand.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Yes, and I believe the one good action of my life is that I never\ntook advantage of her love. And do you know why?\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Pity.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Oh no! I never felt pity for her. What I felt for her was always\nrapturous admiration--and when she sang! Ah, how she sang--and perhaps\nstill sings! I always regarded her as far above me. I did not ruin her,\nsimply because I loved her; loved her truly. And now she\'s a good, happy\nmemory! [Drinks].\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Yes, I understand, I understand. It\'s ideal.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I\'ll tell you something. I have had my passions, and once I was\nin love with a lady--very handsome--and I loved her nastily, like a dog.\nShe gave me a _rendezvous_. And I did not go, because I thought it was\ntreating the husband shabbily. And it is strange that, even now, when I\nremember it I want to feel pleased and to approve of myself for having\nacted honourably, but I always repent as if I had committed a sin! But\nin the case of M\xc3\xa1sha, on the contrary, I am always pleased--pleased that\nI did not pollute that feeling of mine.... I may fall lower still, sell\nall I have on me, be covered with lice and sores--but this jewel ... no,\nnot jewel, but ray of sunshine, is still with me and in me.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. I understand, I understand! And where is she now?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I don\'t know! And I\'d rather not know. All _that_ belonged to a\ndifferent life; and I don\'t want to mix it up with this....\n\n    A woman is heard screaming at a table behind. The manager and a\n    policeman come in and take her out. F\xc3\xa9dya and Petushk\xc3\xb3v listen, and\n    look on in silence. When all is quiet again,\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Yes, your life is astonishing.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No, it\'s most simple! You know, in the society in which I was\nborn there are only three careers open to a man--only three. The first\nis to enter the civil or military service, to earn money and increase\nthe abominations amid which we live. That was repulsive to me. Perhaps I\nhad not the capacity for it; but above all it repelled me. Then the\nsecond is to destroy those abominations. To do that you must be a hero;\nand I am not a hero. And the third is to forget it all by going on the\nspree, drinking and singing. That is what I did. And this is what my\nsinging has brought me to! [Drinks].\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. And what about family life? I should be happy if I had a\nwife. My wife ruined me.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Family life? Yes, my wife was an ideal woman. She is still\nliving. But how shall I tell you? There was no yeast in it--you know,\nthe yeast that makes the beer froth! Well, there was nothing of that in\nour life: it was flat, and I wanted something to help me to forget--and\none can\'t forget when there\'s no sparkle in life. Then I began to do all\nsorts of nasty things. And you know, we love people for the good we do\nthem, and dislike them for the harm we do them; and I did her much harm.\nShe seemed to love me\xc2\xa0...\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Why do you say "seemed"?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I say it because there was never anything about her that made her\ncreep into my soul as M\xc3\xa1sha did. But that\'s not what I meant to say.\nWhen she was pregnant, or nursing her baby, I used to vanish, and come\nhome drunk; and of course, just because of that, I loved her less and\nless. Yes, yes! [in ecstasy] I have it! The reason I love M\xc3\xa1sha is that\nI did her good and not harm. That\'s why I love her. The other one I\ntormented, and therefore I don\'t like her.... No, after all, I simply\ndon\'t like her! Was I jealous? Yes, but that too is past....\n\n    Enter Art\xc3\xa9myev, with a cockade on his cap, dyed moustaches, and old\n    renovated clothes.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. Wish you a good appetite! [Bows to F\xc3\xa9dya] I see you\'ve made\nacquaintance with our painter, our artist.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [coldly] Yes, we are acquainted.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV [to Petushk\xc3\xb3v] And have you finished the portrait?\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. No, I lost the order.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV [Sits down] I\'m not in your way?\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya and Petushk\xc3\xb3v do not answer.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich was telling me about his life.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. Secrets? Then I won\'t disturb you--go on? I\'m sure I don\'t\nwant you. Swine! [Goes to next table and calls for beer. He listens all\nthe time to F\xc3\xa9dya\'s conversation with Petushk\xc3\xb3v, and leans towards them\nwithout their noticing it.]\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I don\'t like that gentleman.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. He was offended.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, let him be! I can\'t stand him. He is such a fellow, my\nwords won\'t come when he is there. Now with you I feel at ease, and\ncomfortable. Well, what was I saying?\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. You were speaking about your jealousy. And how was it you\nparted from your wife?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Ah! [Pauses and considers] It\'s a curious story. My wife is\nmarried\xc2\xa0...\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. How\'s that? Are you divorced?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [smiles] No, I left her a widow.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. What do you mean?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I mean that she\'s a widow! I don\'t exist.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Don\'t exist?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No, I\'m a corpse! Yes\xc2\xa0... [Art\xc3\xa9myev leans over, listening] Well,\nyou see--I _can_ tell _you_ about it; and besides, it happened long ago;\nand you don\'t know my real name. It was this way. When I had tired out\nmy wife and had squandered everything I could lay my hands on, and had\nbecome unbearable, a protector turned up for her. Don\'t imagine that\nthere was anything dirty or bad about it--no, he was my friend and a\nvery good fellow--only in everything my exact opposite! And as there is\nfar more evil than good in me, it follows that he was a good--a very\ngood man: honourable, firm, self-restrained and, in a word, virtuous. He\nhad known my wife from her childhood, and loved her. When she married me\nhe resigned himself to his fate. But later, when I became horrid and\ntormented her, he began to come oftener to our house. I myself wished\nit. They fell in love with one another, and meanwhile I went altogether\nto the bad, and abandoned my wife of my own accord. And besides, there\nwas M\xc3\xa1sha. I myself advised them to marry. They did not want to, but I\nbecame more and more impossible, and it ended in\xc2\xa0...\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. The usual thing?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No. I am sure; I know for certain that they remained pure. He is\na religious man, and considers marriage without the Church\'s blessing a\nsin. So they began asking me to agree to a divorce. I should have had to\ntake the blame on myself. It would have been necessary to tell all sorts\nof lies ... and I couldn\'t! Believe me, it would have been easier for me\nto take my life than to tell such lies--and I wished to do so. But then\na kind friend came and said, "Why do it?" and arranged it all for me. I\nwrote a farewell letter, and next day my clothes, pocket-book and\nletters were found on the river bank. I can\'t swim.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Yes, but how about the body? They did not find that!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. They did! Fancy! A week later somebody\'s body was found. My wife\nwas called to identify the decomposing body. She just glanced at it. "Is\nit he?" "It is." And so it was left. I was buried, and they married and\nare living in this town, happily. And I--here I am, living and drinking!\nYesterday I passed their house. The windows were lit up, and someone\'s\nshadow crossed the blind. Sometimes it\'s horrid, and sometimes not. It\'s\nhorrid when I\'ve no money\xc2\xa0... [Drinks].\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV [approaches] Excuse me, but I heard your story. It\'s a very\ngood story, and more than that--a very useful one! You say it\'s horrid\nwhen one has no money? There\'s nothing more horrid. But you, in your\nposition, should always have money. Aren\'t you a corpse? Well then\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Excuse me! I did not speak to you and don\'t want your advice.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. But I want to give it! You are a corpse; but suppose you come\nto life again? Then they, your wife and that gentleman, who are so\nhappy--they would be bigamists, and at best would be sent to the less\ndistant parts of Siberia. So why should you lack money?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I beg you to leave me alone.\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. Simply write a letter. I\'ll write it for you if you like; only\ngive me their address, and you\'ll be grateful to me.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Be off, I tell you! I have told you nothing!\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. Yes, you have! Here\'s my witness. The waiter heard you say you\nwere a corpse.\n\nWAITER. I know nothing about it.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You scoundrel!\n\nART\xc3\x89MYEV. Am I a scoundrel? Eh, police! I\'ll give him in charge!\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya rises to go, but Art\xc3\xa9myev holds him. Enter policeman.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    The ivy-covered verandah of a bungalow in the country. Anna\n    Dm\xc3\xadtrievna Kar\xc3\xa9nina. Lisa (pregnant), nurse, and boy.\n\nLISA. Now he\'s on his way from the station.\n\nBOY. Who is?\n\nLISA. Papa.\n\nBOY. Papa\'s coming from the station?\n\nLISA. _C\'est \xc3\xa9tonnant comme il l\'aime, tout-\xc3\xa0-fait comme son p\xc3\xa8re._[23]\n\n  [23] It is surprising how he loves him--just as if he were his father.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. _Tant mieux! Se souvient-il de son p\xc3\xa8re v\xc3\xa9ritable?_[24]\n\n  [24] So much the better! Does he remember his real father?\n\nLISA [sighs] I never speak to him about it. I say to myself, "Why\nconfuse him?" Sometimes I think I ought to tell him. What is your\nopinion, _Maman_?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. I think it is a matter of feeling, Lisa, and if you\nobey your feelings your heart will tell you what to say and when to say\nit. What a wonderful conciliator death is! I confess there was a time\nwhen F\xc3\xa9dya--whom I had known from a child--was repulsive to me; but now\nI only remember him as that nice lad, Victor\'s friend, and as the\npassionate man who sacrificed himself--illegally and irreligiously, but\nstill sacrificed himself--for those he loved. _On aura beau dire,\nl\'action est belle._[25]... I hope Victor will not forget to bring the\nwool: I\'ve hardly any left. [Knits].\n\n  [25] Say what one likes--it is a fine action.\n\nLISA. I hear him coming.\n\n    The sound of wheels and bells is heard. Lisa rises, and goes to the\n    edge of the veranda.\n\nLISA. There\'s someone with him, a lady in a bonnet--It\'s Mother! I have\nnot seen her for an age. [Goes to the door].\n\n    Enter Kar\xc3\xa9nin and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [kisses Lisa and Anna Dm\xc3\xadtrievna] Victor met me, and has\nbrought me here.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. He has done well.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, certainly. I thought to myself, "When shall I see\nher again?" and kept putting it off. But now I\'ve come, and if you don\'t\nturn me out I will stay till the last train.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [kisses his wife, mother, and the boy] D\'you know what a piece\nof luck! Congratulate me--I have two days\' holiday. They\'ll be able to\nget on without me to-morrow.\n\nLISA. Splendid! Two days! It\'s long since we had that! We\'ll drive to\nthe Hermitage, shall we?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What a likeness! Isn\'t he a strapping fellow? If only he\nhas not inherited everything--his father\'s heart\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. But not his weakness.\n\nLISA. No, everything! Victor agrees with me that if only he had been\nrightly guided in childhood\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, I don\'t know about that; but I simply can\'t think\nof him without tears.\n\nLISA. No more can we. How much higher he stands now in our recollection!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, I am sure of it.\n\nLISA. How it all seemed insoluble at one time--and then everything\nsuddenly came right.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. Well, Victor, did you get the wool?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Yes, I did. [Brings a bag, and takes out parcels]. Here is the\nwool, and this is the eau-de-Cologne; and here are letters--one "On\nGovernment Service" for you, Lisa [hands her a letter]. Well Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna, if you want to wash your hands I will show you your room. I\nmust make myself tidy too; it is almost dinner time. Lisa, Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\'s room is the corner one downstairs, isn\'t it?\n\n    Lisa is pale; holds the letter in trembling hands, and reads it.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. What\'s the matter? Lisa, what is it?\n\nLISA. He is alive!... Oh God! When will he release me! Victor, what does\nthis mean? [Sobs].\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [Takes letter and reads] This is dreadful!\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. What is it? Why don\'t you tell me?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. It is dreadful! He\'s alive, she\'s a bigamist, and I a\ncriminal! It\'s a notice from the Examining Magistrate--a summons for\nLisa to appear before him.\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. What a dreadful man! Why has he done this?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. All lies, lies!\n\nLISA. Oh, how I hate him! I don\'t know what I am saying\xc2\xa0... [Exit in\ntears. Kar\xc3\xa9nin follows her].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. How is it he\'s alive?\n\nANNA DM\xc3\x8dTRIEVNA. All I know is, that as soon as Victor came in contact\nwith this world of mud--they were sure to draw him in too! And so they\nhave. It\'s all fraud--all lies!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT VI\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    The room of an Examining Magistrate, who sits at a table talking to\n    M\xc3\xa9lnikov. At a side table a clerk is sorting papers.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. But I never said anything of the kind to her. She\ninvented it, and now reproaches me.\n\nM\xc3\x89LNIKOV. She does not reproach you, but is grieved.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. All right, I\'ll come to dinner. But now I have a\nvery interesting case on. [To Clerk] Ask her in.\n\nCLERK. Shall I ask them both?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE [finishes his cigarette and hides it] No, only Mrs.\nKar\xc3\xa9nina, or rather--by her first husband--Prot\xc3\xa1sova.\n\nM\xc3\x89LNIKOV [going out] Ah, Kar\xc3\xa9nina!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Yes, it\'s a nasty affair. It\'s true I am only\nbeginning to look into it, but it\'s a bad business. Well, good-bye!\n[Exit M\xc3\xa9lnikov].\n\n    Enter Lisa, in black and veiled.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Take a seat, please. [Points to a chair] Believe\nme, I much regret to have to question you, but we are under the\nnecessity ... Please be calm, and remember that you need not answer my\nquestions. Only, in my opinion, for your own sake--and in fact for\neverybody\'s sake--the truth is best. It is always best, even\npractically.\n\nLISA. I have nothing to conceal.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Well then [looks at paper]--your name, position,\nreligion--all that I have put down. Is it correct?\n\nLISA. Yes.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. You are accused of contracting a marriage with\nanother man, knowing your husband to be alive.\n\nLISA. I did not know it.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. And also of having persuaded your husband, and\nbribed him with money, to commit a fraud--a pretended suicide--in order\nto free yourself of him.\n\nLISA. That is all untrue.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Well then, allow me to put a few questions. Did\nyou send him 1,200 roubles in July of last year?\n\nLISA. It was his own money, the proceeds of the sale of some things of\nhis. At the time I parted from him, and when I was expecting a divorce,\nI sent him the money.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Just so! Very well. That money was sent to him on\nthe 17th of July, two days before his disappearance?\n\nLISA. I think it was on the 17th, but I don\'t remember.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. And why was the application to the Consistorium\nfor a divorce withdrawn, just at that time--and the lawyer told not to\nproceed with the case?\n\nLISA. I don\'t know.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Well, and when the police asked you to identify\nthe body, how was it you recognised it as your husband\'s?\n\nLISA. I was so excited that I did not look at the body, and I felt so\nsure it was he, that when they asked me I answered, "I think it is he."\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Yes, you did not see well, in consequence of a\nvery natural excitement. And now may I ask why you have sent a monthly\nremittance to Sar\xc3\xa1tov, the very town where your first husband was\nliving?\n\nLISA. My husband sent that money, and I cannot say what it was for, as\nthat is not my secret. But it was not sent to Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich, for\nwe were firmly convinced of his death. That I can say for certain.[26]\n\n  [26] Had Tolstoy lived to give a final revision to this play, he would\n  probably have made it clearer that Kar\xc3\xa9nin sent a monthly payment to\n  the clockmaker Evg\xc3\xa9nyev, in response to the request contained in the\n  last letter F\xc3\xa9dya addressed to Lisa and himself; and that this money\n  found its way to F\xc3\xa9dya.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Very well. Only allow me to remark, madam, that\nthe fact of our being servants of the law does not prevent our being\nmen; and believe me I quite understand your position and sympathise with\nyou! You were tied to a man who squandered your property, was\nunfaithful--in short, brought misfortune....\n\nLISA. I loved him.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Yes; but still the desire to free yourself was\nnatural, and you chose this simpler way, without realising that it would\nlead you into what is considered a crime--bigamy! I quite understand it.\nThe judges will understand too; and therefore I advise you to confess\neverything.\n\nLISA. I have nothing to confess. I have never lied. [Cries] Do you want\nme any longer?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I must ask you to remain here. I will not trouble\nyou with any more questions. Only kindly read this over and sign it. It\nis your deposition. See whether your answers have been correctly taken\ndown. Please take that seat. [Points to an armchair by the window. To\nClerk] Ask Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin to come in.\n\n    Enter Kar\xc3\xa9nin, stern and solemn.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Please take a seat.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Thank you! [Remains standing] What do you want of me?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I have to take your deposition.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. In what capacity?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE [smiling] I, in the capacity of Examining\nMagistrate, am obliged to question you in the capacity of an accused\nperson.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Indeed! Accused of what?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Of marrying a woman whose husband was alive.\nHowever, allow me to question you properly. Kindly sit down.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Thank you.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Your name?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Victor Kar\xc3\xa9nin.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Your calling?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Chamberlain and Member of Council.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Age?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Thirty-eight.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Religion?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Orthodox; and I have never before been tried or questioned!\nWell?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Did you know that Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich Prot\xc3\xa1sov\nwas alive when you married his wife?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I did not know it. We were both convinced that he was drowned.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. After Prot\xc3\xa1sov\'s alleged death, to whom in Sar\xc3\xa1tov\ndid you send a monthly remittance?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I do not wish to reply to that question.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Very well. Why did you send money--1,200\nroubles--to Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov just before his pretended death on 17th July?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. That money was given to me by my wife\xc2\xa0...\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. By Mrs. Prot\xc3\xa1sova?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. ...\xc2\xa0by my wife, to send to her husband. She considered that\nmoney to be his, and having severed all connection with him, considered\nit unfair to keep it.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. One more question--why did you withdraw the\napplication for divorce?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Because Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich undertook to apply for a divorce,\nand wrote me about it.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Have you got his letter?\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. It has been lost.[27]\n\n  [27] Kar\xc3\xa9nin does not produce F\xc3\xa9dya\'s letter because it would have\n  proved connivance in the divorce proceedings.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. It is strange that everything which might convince\nthe Court of the truth of your evidence should either be lost or\nnon-existent.\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. Do you want anything more?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I want nothing, except to do my duty; but you\'ll\nhave to exonerate yourselves, and I have just advised Mrs. Prot\xc3\xa1sova,\nand I advise you also, not to try to hide what everyone can see, but to\nsay what really happened. Especially as Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov is in such a\ncondition that he has already told everything just as it happened, and\nwill probably do the same in Court, I should advise\xc2\xa0...\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. I request you to keep within the limits of your duty, and not\nto give me your advice! May we go? [Approaches Lisa, who rises and takes\nhis arm].\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I am very sorry to be obliged to detain you\xc2\xa0...\n[Kar\xc3\xa9nin looks round in astonishment] Oh, I don\'t mean that I arrest\nyou. Though that would make it easier to get at the truth, I shall not\nresort to such a measure. I only want to take Prot\xc3\xa1sov\'s deposition in\nyour presence, and to confront him with you--which will make it easier\nfor you to detect any falsehood in what he says. Please take a seat.\nCall in Mr. Prot\xc3\xa1sov!\n\n    Enter F\xc3\xa9dya, dirty and shabby.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [addresses Lisa and Kar\xc3\xa9nin] Lisa! Elisabeth Andr\xc3\xa9yevna! Victor! I\nam not guilty! I wished to act for the best. But if I am guilty ...\nforgive me, forgive me! [Bows low to them].\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Please to answer my questions.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Ask, then.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Your name?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Why, you know it!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Please answer.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well then, Theodore Prot\xc3\xa1sov.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Your calling, age and religion?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [after a pause] Aren\'t you ashamed to ask such nonsense? Ask what\nyou want to know, and not such rubbish!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I beg you to be more careful in your expressions,\nand to answer my questions!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Well, if you\'re not ashamed of it, here you are: Calling,\ngraduate; age, forty; religion, Orthodox. What next!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Did Mr. Kar\xc3\xa9nin and your wife know that you were\nalive when you left your clothes on the river bank and disappeared?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Certainly not! I wished really to commit suicide, but\nafterwards--but there\'s no need to go into that. The thing is, that they\nknew nothing about it.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. How is it that you gave a different account to the\npolice officer?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. What police officer? Oh, when he came to see me at the dosshouse?\nI was drunk, and was romancing. I don\'t remember what I said. All that\nwas rubbish. Now I am not drunk, and am telling the whole truth! They\nknew nothing. They believed that I was no longer alive, and I was glad\nof it. And everything would have gone on as it was, but for that rascal,\nArt\xc3\xa9myev! If anyone is guilty, it is I alone.\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I understand your wish to be magnanimous, but the\nlaw demands the truth. Why was money sent to you?\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya is silent.\n\nYou received through Semy\xc3\xb3nov the money sent to you in Sar\xc3\xa1tov?\n\n    F\xc3\xa9dya is silent.\n\nWhy don\'t you answer? It will be put down in the depositions that the\naccused did not answer these questions, and this may harm you and them\nvery much. Well then, how was it?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [after a pause] Oh, Mr. Magistrate, how is it you are not ashamed!\nWhy do you pry into other people\'s lives? You are glad to have power,\nand to show it, you torment not physically but morally--torment people a\nthousand times better than yourself!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I beg\xc2\xa0...\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You\'ve nothing to beg! I shall say what I think, and you [to\nClerk] write it down! At least for once there will be sensible human\nwords in a police report! [Raises his voice] There are three people: I,\nhe, and she. Our relations to one another are complex--a spiritual\nstruggle such as you know nothing of, a struggle between good and evil\ngoes on. That struggle ends in a manner which sets them free. They were\nall at peace. They were happy, and remembered me with affection. I,\nfallen as I was, was glad that I had acted as I ought, and that I, a\ngood-for-nothing, had gone out of their lives, so as not to stand in the\nway of people who were good and who had life before them. And so we were\nall living, when suddenly a blackmailing scoundrel appears who wants me\nto take part in his rascality, and I send him about his business. Then\nhe comes to you, to the champion of Justice! The guardian of Morality!\nAnd you, who receive each month a few pounds for doing your dirty work,\nput on your uniform, and calmly bully these people--bully people whose\nlittle finger is worth more than your whole body and soul! People who\nwould not admit you to their anteroom! But you have got so far, and are\npleased\xc2\xa0...\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. I shall have you turned out!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I\'m not afraid of anyone, because I\'m a corpse and you can\'t do\nme any harm. No position could be worse than mine! So turn me out!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN. May we go?\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Immediately, but first sign your deposition.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. You\'d be quite comic, if you weren\'t so vile!\n\nEXAMINING MAGISTRATE. Take him away! I arrest you.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [to Lisa and Kar\xc3\xa9nin] Forgive me!\n\nKAR\xc3\x89NIN [approaches and holds out his hand] It had to happen!\n\n    Lisa passes by. F\xc3\xa9dya bows low to her.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    A corridor of the Law Courts. In the background a door with glass\n    panels, beside which stands an usher. Further to the right another\n    door through which the accused are led.\n\n    Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich Alex\xc3\xa1ndrov comes to the first door and wishes to\n    enter.\n\nUSHER. Where are you going? You mustn\'t! Shoving in like that!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Why mustn\'t I? The law says the proceedings are public.\n[Applause is heard from inside the Court].\n\nUSHER. Anyhow, you mustn\'t, and that\'s all about it.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Ignorant fellow! You don\'t know whom you are speaking\nto!\n\n    A Young Lawyer in a dress-suit enters from the Court.\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. Are you concerned in this case?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. No, I am the public, and this ignoramus--this\nCerberus--won\'t let me in!\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. But this door is not for the public.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. I know, but I am a man who should be admitted.\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. Wait a bit--they\'ll adjourn in a minute. [Is just going,\nwhen he meets Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov].\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. May I ask how the case stands?\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. The Counsel are speaking--Petr\xc3\xbashin is addressing the\nCourt.\n\n    Applause from within.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. And how do the defendants bear their position?\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. With great dignity, especially Kar\xc3\xa9nin and Elisabeth\nAndr\xc3\xa9yevna. It is as if not they were being indicted, but they were\nindicting society! That\'s what is felt, and on that Petr\xc3\xbashin is\nworking.\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. Well, and Prot\xc3\xa1sov?\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. He is terribly excited. He trembles all over; but that is\nnatural, considering the life he leads. He is particularly irritable,\nand interrupted the Public Prosecutor and Counsel several times\xc2\xa0...\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. What do you think the result will be?\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. It is hard to say. In any case they won\'t be found guilty\nof premeditation; but still\xc2\xa0... [A gentleman comes out, and Prince\nAbr\xc3\xa9zkov moves towards the door] You wish to go in?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I should like to.\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. You are Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov?\n\nPRINCE ABR\xc3\x89ZKOV. I am.\n\nYOUNG LAWYER [to Usher] Let this gentleman pass. There is an empty chair\njust to the left.\n\n    Usher lets Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov pass. As the door opens, Counsel is seen\n    speaking.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Aristocrats! I am an aristocrat of the soul, and that is\nhigher!\n\nYOUNG LAWYER. Well, excuse me\xc2\xa0... [Exit].\n\n    Petushk\xc3\xb3v enters hurriedly, and approaches Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich.\n\nPETUSHK\xc3\x93V. Ah, how are you, Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich? How are things going?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Counsel are still speaking, but this fellow won\'t let me\nin.\n\nUSHER. Don\'t make a noise here! This is not a public-house!\n\n    Applause. The doors open. Lawyers, and the public--men and\n    women--come out.\n\nA LADY. Splendid! He really moved me to tears.\n\nOFFICER. It\'s better than any novel. Only I don\'t understand how she\ncould love him so. Dreadful object!\n\n    The other door opens. The accused come out: first Lisa, then\n    Kar\xc3\xa9nin. They pass along the corridor. F\xc3\xa9dya follows alone.\n\nLADY. Hush--here he is! Look how excited he seems!\n\n    Lady and Officer pass on.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [approaches Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich] Have you brought it?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Here it is. [Hands F\xc3\xa9dya something].\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA [Hides it in his pocket, and wishes to pass out, but sees\nPetushk\xc3\xb3v] Stupid! Vile! Dreary, dreary! Senseless. [Wishes to pass].\n\n    Enter Counsel Petr\xc3\xbashin; stout, red, and animated. He approaches\n    F\xc3\xa9dya.\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. Well, friend! Our affairs are going well--only don\'t you go\nand spoil things for me in your last speech!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I won\'t speak. What is the use? I shan\'t do it.\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. Yes, you must speak. But don\'t be excited. The whole matter\nis now in a nutshell! Only tell them what you told me--that if you are\nbeing tried, it is only for _not_ having committed suicide: that is, for\nnot doing what is considered a crime both by civil and ecclesiastical\nlaw.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I shan\'t say anything!\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. Why not?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I don\'t want to, and shan\'t. Tell me only, at the worst, what\nwill it be?\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. I have already told you--at worst, exile to Siberia.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Who will be exiled?\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. You and your wife.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. And at best?\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. Church penance, and of course annulment of the second\nmarriage.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Then they will again tie me to her--or rather, her to me?\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN. Yes, that must be so. But don\'t excite yourself, and please\nsay what I told you, and above all, don\'t say anything superfluous.\nHowever [noticing that a circle of listeners has formed round them] I am\ntired, and will go and sit down; and you\'d better take a rest. The chief\nthing is, not to lose courage!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. No other sentence is possible?\n\nPETR\xc3\x9aSHIN [going] No other.\n\n    Enter Attendant.\n\nATTENDANT. Pass on! Pass on! No loitering in the corridor!\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Directly! [Takes out revolver and shoots himself in the heart.\nFalls. All rush on him] All right, I think it is done.... Lisa!...\n\n    The audience, judges, accused, and witnesses rush out from all the\n    doors.\n\n    In front of all is Lisa. Behind her M\xc3\xa1sha, Kar\xc3\xa9nin, Iv\xc3\xa1n Petr\xc3\xb3vich\n    and Prince Abr\xc3\xa9zkov.\n\nLISA. F\xc3\xa9dya, what have you done! Why?\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. Forgive me that I could not ... free you any other way.... It\'s\nnot for you ... it\'s best for me. I have long ... been ready\xc2\xa0...\n\nLISA. You will live!\n\n    A Doctor bends over F\xc3\xa9dya and listens.\n\nF\xc3\x89DYA. I need no doctor to tell me ... Good-bye, Victor ... Ah,\nM\xc3\xa1sha!... it\'s too late this time ... [Weeps] How good ... how good!\n[Dies].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n                       END OF "THE LIVE CORPSE."\n\n\n\n\n[ Transcriber\'s Note:\n\n  The following is a list of corrections made to the original.
