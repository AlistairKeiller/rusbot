The tutor, seeing\nTolstoy so moved, asked what he could possibly do for him. In an unready\nvoice Tolstoy replied: "Save me, I am falling!" The tutor, in alarm,\ninquired what was the matter, to which Tolstoy replied: "I am overcome\nby sexual desire and feel a complete lack of power to retrain myself. I\nam in danger of yielding to the temptation. Help me!"\n\n"I am a weak man myself," replied the tutor. "How can I help you?"\n\n"You can, if only you won\'t refuse!"\n\n"But what must I do to help you?"\n\n"This! Come with me on my daily walks. We will go out together and talk,\nand the temptation will not occur to me."\n\nThey set out together, and Tolstoy told the tutor how during his daily\nwalks he had encountered Domna, a young woman of twenty-two who had\nrecently been engaged as the servants\' cook. This Domna was a tall,\nhealthy, attractive young woman with a fine figure and beautiful\ncomplexion, though not otherwise particularly handsome. At first for\nsome days he had found it pleasant to watch her. Then he had followed\nher and whittled to her. After that he had walked and talked with her,\nand at last had arranged a rendezvous with her. The spot was in a\ndistant alley on the estate; to reach it from the house one had to pass\nthe windows of the children\'s schoolroom. When setting out past those\nwindows next day to keep the appointment, he had gone through a terrible\nstruggle between the temptation and his conscience. Just then his second\nson had called to him through the window, reminding him of a Greek\nlesson that had been fixed for that day, and this had detained Tolstoy.\nHe woke as it were, and was glad to have been saved from keeping the\nappointment. But the temptation still tormented him. He tried the effect\nof prayer, but it did not free him. He suffered but felt powerless and\nas if he might yield at any moment. So as a last resource he resolved to\ntry the effect of making a full confession to someone--giving all\nparticulars of the strength of the temptation that oppressed him and of\nhis own weakness. He wished to feel as thoroughly ashamed of himself as\npossible, and he had decided to ask the tutor to accompany him on his\ndaily walk, which usually he took alone. He also arranged that Domna\nshould be removed to another place.\n\nAfter the danger was over Tolstoy seldom referred to the incident unless\nto those who spoke to him of their own sexual difficulties, but on one\noccasion he wrote a full account of it to a friend.\n\nThe incident resulted in his writing this story, _The Devil_--the hero\nof which yields to a temptation such as that Tolstoy had encountered. It\nwas composed some ten years later, but was not published during\nTolstoy\'s lifetime; nor did it appear in the English edition of his\nposthumous works issued by Nelson & Sons. It is now translated into\nEnglish for the first time. Tolstoy had vividly imagined the\nconsequences that might have resulted from yielding to the temptation,\nand used that mental experience for his story, employing fictitious\ncharacters placed in surroundings with which he was familiar and such as\nthose amid which the incident had occurred.\n\nThe relations of the sexes in Russian society of his day resembled that\nin English society to-day more than in English society of that\nperiod--when, both in literature and in life, repression and suppression\nof passion was more common. When in _Kreutzer Sonata_ and in _The Devil_\nhe expressed the views he held, Tolstoy was consciously opposing the\ncurrent of life around him, and these works also run counter to the\nmovement of our own society to-day. That however does not detract from\nthe value of the work. The belief that ill-results follow from the\nindulgence of the sexual instincts is not an obsolete eccentricity but a\nbelief held by many men in many ages, and it receives sufficient\nconfirmation from experience to make it certain that it is a view which\nhas to be reckoned with.\n\nThe ancient conception of a bitter strife between the flesh and the\nspirit and of woman as the devil\'s chief agent in achieving man\'s\nspiritual destruction, is alien to the modern outlook, and to-day it is\noften not understood how and why men ever held such beliefs; but both in\n_The Kreutzer Sonata_ and in this story Tolstoy makes us realize how\neasily and naturally men of a certain temperament may come to those\nconvictions. Without adopting that view one is enabled to realize what\nothers have felt, and to perceive how probable is a reaction from the\nunrestraint of to-day; as happened after the libertinage of the\nRestoration period.\n\nI do not think there is any other important story of Tolstoy\'s that has\nnot yet been translated. He left several trunks full of manuscripts,\nchiefly early drafts of works that had been published during his\nlifetime or commencements of stories he abandoned; but before his death\nhe expressed the opinion that, except some passages in his Diaries,\nthere was little or nothing worth publishing among those remains. He was\nindeed a great artist, and his mastery showed itself in knowing what to\nstrike out, omit, and withhold. His published writings are voluminous,\nbut among them there is little (except perhaps some of the later\nrepetitions of his non-resistance doctrine) that we could willingly\nspare. But if the mass of documents which while he lived he had the good\nsense to suppress are now to be published, together with a large amount\nof didactic correspondence, it is likely to injure rather than to\nenhance his literary reputation. There is a disquieting rumour that this\nis to take place, in the form of an edition of his works extending to\none hundred volumes. Not even that calamity will depose him from the\nplace he securely holds as the greatest and most influential of Russian\nwriters, but it will be an obstacle rather than a help to those who want\nto become acquainted with the works on which he wished his reputation to\nrest. The present story is an exception. It is so characteristic of him,\nand so closely connected with an event that influenced him, that it\nwould be a pity for it not to be known, especially as it is one of the\nfew posthumous works he left in a completed state; even in this case we\ndo not know which of the two endings he wrote he would have adopted had\nhe published it himself.\n\nThe foot-notes are by the translator.\n\n                         AYLMER MAUDE\n\nGREAT BADDOW, CHELMSFORD\n\n_September_ 12, 1925.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEVIL\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nA brilliant career lay before Eugene Irtenev. He had all that was\nnecessary for this: an admirable education at home, high honours when he\ngraduated in law at Petersburg University, connections in the highest\nsociety through his recently deceased father, and he had himself already\nbegun service in one of the Ministries under the protection of the\nMinister. He also had a fortune; even a large one, though insecure. His\nfather had lived abroad and in Petersburg, allowing his sons, Eugene,\nand Andrew, the elder who was in the Horse Guards, 6,000 rubles a year\neach, while he himself and his wife spent a great deal. He only used to\nvisit his estate for a couple of months in summer and did not concern\nhimself with its direction, entrusting it all to an unscrupulous manager\nwho also failed to attend to it, but in whom he had complete confidence.\n\nAfter the father\'s death, when the brothers began to divide the\nproperty, there were found to be so many debts that their lawyer even\nadvised them to refuse the inheritance and retain only an estate left\nthem by their grand-mother, which was valued at 100,000 rubles. But a\nneighbouring landed-proprietor who had done business with old Irtenev,\nthat is to say, who had promissory notes from him and had come to\nPetersburg on that account, said that in spite of the debts they could\nstraighten out affairs so as to retain a large fortune--it would only be\nnecessary to sell the forest and some outlying land, retaining the rich\nSem\xc3\xabnov estate with 4,000 desyatinas of black-earth, the sugar-factory,\nand 200 desyatinas of water-meadows--if one devoted oneself to the\nmanagement and, settling on the estate, farmed it wisely and\neconomically.\n\nAnd so, having visited the estate in spring (his father had died in\nLent), Eugene looked into everything, resolved to retire from the Civil\nService, settle in the country with his mother, and undertake the\nmanagement, with the object of preserving the main estate. He arranged\nwith his brother, with whom he was very friendly, that he would pay him\n4,000 rubles a year, or alternatively would pay him 80,000 in a lump\nsum, while Andrew, on his part, handed over to him his share of the\ninheritance.\n\nSo he arranged matters and, having settled down with his mother in the\nbig house, ardently and yet cautiously began managing the estate.\n\nIt is generally supposed that Conservatives are usually old people, and\nthose in favour of change are the young. That is not quite correct. The\nmost usual Conservatives are young people: those who want to live but\nwho do not think, and have not time to think, about how to live and who\ntherefore take as a model for themselves a way of life that they have\nseen.\n\nThus it was with Eugene. Having settled in the village, his aim and\nideal was to restore the form of life that had existed, not in his\nfather\'s time--his father had been a bad manager--but in his\ngrandfather\'s. And now in the house, the garden, in the\nestate-management--of course with changes suited to the times--he tried\nto resurrect the general spirit of his grandfather\'s life--everything on\na large scale--good order, method, and everybody satisfied; but so to\narrange things entailed much work. It was necessary to meet the demands\nof the creditors and the banks, and for that purpose to sell some land\nand arrange renewals of credit. It was also necessary to get money to\ncarry on (partly by farming out land, and partly by hiring labour) the\nimmense operations on the Sem\xc3\xabnov estate, with its 400 desyatinas of\nploughland and its sugar-factory, and to deal with the garden so that it\nshould not seem to be neglected or in decay.\n\nThere was much work to do, but Eugene had plenty of strength--physical\nand mental. He was twenty-six, of medium height, strongly built, with\nmuscles developed by gymnastics. He was full-blooded and very red over\nhis whole neck, with bright teeth and lips and hair soft and curly,\nthough not thick. His only physical defect was shortsightedness, which\nhe had himself developed by using spectacles, so that he could not now\ndo without a pince-nez, which had already formed a line at the top of\nhis nose-ridge.\n\nSuch he was physically. For his spiritual portrait it might be said that\nthe better anyone knew him the better they liked him. His mother had\nalways loved him more than she loved anyone else; and now, after her\nhusband\'s death, she concentrated on him not only her whole affection\nbut her whole life. Nor was it only his mother who so loved him. All his\ncomrades at the high-school and the university not merely liked him very\nmuch, but respected him. He had this effect on all who met him. It was\nimpossible not to believe what he said, impossible to suspect any\ndeception or falseness in one who had such an open, honest face and, in\nparticular, such eyes.\n\nIn general his personality helped him much in his affairs. A creditor\nwho would have refused another, trusted him. The clerk, the village\nElder, or a peasant, who would have played a dirty trick and cheated\nsomeone else, forgot to deceive under the pleasant impression of\nintercourse with this kindly, agreeable, and above all candid man.\n\nIt was the end of May. Eugene had somehow managed, in town, to get the\nvacant land freed from the mortgage, so as to sell it to a merchant, and\nhad borrowed money from that same merchant to replenish his stock, that\nis to say, to procure horses, bulls, carts and, chiefly, to begin to\nbuild a necessary farm-house. The matter had been arranged. The timber\nwas being carted, the carpenters were already at work, and manure for\nthe estate was being brought on eighty carts. But everything still hung\nby a thread.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nAmid these cares something came about which, though unimportant,\ntormented Eugene at the time. As a young man he had lived as all healthy\nyoung men live, that is, he had had relations with women of various\nkinds. He was not a libertine but, as he himself said, neither was he a\nmonk. He only turned to this, however, in so far as was necessary for\nphysical health and to have his mind free, as he used to say. This had\nbegun when he was sixteen and had gone on satisfactorily. Satisfactorily\nin the sense that he did not give himself up to debauchery, was not once\ninfatuated, and had never contracted a disease. At first he had a\nseamstress in Petersburg, then she got spoilt and he made other\narrangements, and that side of his affairs was so well secured that it\ndid not trouble him.\n\nBut now he was living in the country for the second month and did not at\nall know what he was to do. Compulsory self-restraint was beginning to\nhave a bad effect on him.\n\nMust he really go to town for that purpose? And where to? How? That was\nthe only thing that disturbed Eugene Ivanich, but as he was convinced\nthat the thing was necessary and that he needed it, it really became\nnecessary, and he felt that he was not free and that involuntarily his\neyes followed every young woman.\n\nHe did not approve of having relations with a married woman or a maid in\nhis own village. He knew by report that both his father and grandfather\nhad been quite different in this matter from other land-owners of that\ntime. At home they had never had any entanglements with peasant-women,\nand he had decided that he would not do so either; but afterwards,\nfeeling himself ever more and more under compulsion, and imagining with\nhorror what might happen to him in the neighbouring country town, and\nreflecting on the fact that the days of serfdom were now over, he\ndecided that it might be done on the spot. Only it must be done so that\nno one should know of it, and not for the sake of debauchery but merely\nfor health\'s sake--as he said to himself. And when he had decided this\nhe became still more restless. When talking to the village Elder, the\npeasants, or the carpenters, he involuntarily brought the conversation\nround to women, and when it turned to women, he kept it on that theme.\nHe noticed the women more and more.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nTo settle the matter in his own mind was one thing, but to carry it out\nwas another. To approach a woman himself was impossible. Which one?\nWhere? It must be done through someone else, but to whom should he speak\nabout it?\n\nHe happened to go into a watchman\'s hut in the forest to get a drink of\nwater. The watchman had been his father\'s huntsman. Eugene Ivanich\nchatted with him, and the watchman began telling some strange tales of\nhunting sprees. It occurred to Eugene Ivanich that it would be\nconvenient to arrange matters in this hut, or in the wood. Only he did\nnot know how to manage it, and whether old Daniel would undertake the\narrangement. "Perhaps he will be horrified at such a proposal; and I\nshall have disgraced myself, but perhaps he would agree to it quite\nsimply." So he thought while listening to Daniel\'s stories. Daniel was\ntelling how once when they had been stopping at the hut of the sexton\'s\nwife in an outlying field, he had brought a woman for F\xc3\xabdor Zakharich\nPryanishnikov.\n\n"It will be all right," thought Eugene.\n\n"Your father, may the kingdom of heaven be his, did not go in for\nnonsense of that kind."\n\n"It won\'t do," thought Eugene. But to test the matter he said: "How was\nit you engaged on such bad things?"\n\n"But what is there bad in it? She was glad of it, and F\xc3\xabdor Zakharich\nwas satisfied, very satisfied. I got a ruble. Why, what was he to do? He\ntoo is a lively limb, apparently, and drinks wine."\n\n"Yes, I may speak," thought Eugene, and at once proceeded to do so.\n\n"And, do you know, Daniel, I don\'t know how to endure it,"--he felt\nhimself going scarlet.\n\nDaniel smiled.\n\n"I am not a monk,--I have been accustomed to it."\n\nHe felt that what he was saying was stupid, but was glad to see that\nDaniel approved.\n\n"Why of course, you should have told me long ago. It can all be\narranged," said he: "Only tell me which one you want."\n\n"Oh, it is really all the same to me. Of course not an ugly one, and she\nmust be healthy."\n\n"I understand!" said Daniel briefly. He reflected.\n\n"Ah! There is a tasty morsel," he began. Again Eugene went red. "A tasty\nmorsel. See here, she was married last autumn." Daniel whispered,--"and\nhe hasn\'t been able to do anything. Think what that is worth to one who\nwants it!"\n\nEugene even frowned with shame.\n\n"No, no," he said. "I don\'t want that at all. I want, on the contrary\n(what could the contrary be?), on the contrary I only want that she\nshould be healthy and that there should be as little fuss as possible--a\nwoman whose husband is away in the army, or something of that kind."\n\n"I know. It\'s Stepanida I must bring you. Her husband is away in town,\njust the same as a soldier. And she is a fine woman, and clean. You will\nbe satisfied. As it is I was saying to her the other day--you should go,\nbut she . . ."\n\n"Well then, when is it to be?"\n\n"To-morrow if you like. I shall be going to get some tobacco and I will\ncall in, and at the dinner-hour come here, or to the bath-house behind\nthe kitchen garden. There will be nobody about. Besides after dinner\neverybody takes a nap."\n\n"All right, then."\n\nA terrible excitement seized Eugene as he rode home. "What will happen?\nWhat is a peasant woman like? Suppose it turns out that she is hideous,\nhorrible. No, she is handsome," he told himself, remembering some he had\nbeen noticing. "But what shall I say? What shall I do?"\n\nHe was not himself all that day. Next day at noon he went to the\nforester\'s hut. Daniel stood at the door and silently and significantly\nnodded towards the wood. The blood rushed to Eugene\'s heart, he was\nconscious of it and went to the kitchen-garden. No one was there. He\nwent to the bath-house--there was no one about, he looked in, came out,\nand suddenly heard the crackling of a breaking twig. He looked\nround--and she was standing in the thicket beyond the little ravine. He\nrushed there across the ravine. There were nettles in it which he had\nnot noticed. They stung him and, losing the pince-nez from his nose, he\nran up the slope on the farther side. In a white embroidered apron, in a\nred-brown skirt and a bright red kerchief, barefoot, fresh, firm, and\nhandsome, she stood shyly smiling.\n\n"There is a path leading round,--you should have gone round," she said.\n"I came long ago, ever so long."\n\nHe went up to her and, looking her over, touched her.\n\nA quarter of an hour later they separated; he found his pince-nez,\ncalled in to see Daniel, and in reply to his question: "Are you\nsatisfied, master?" gave him a ruble and went home.\n\nHe was satisfied. Only at first had he felt ashamed, then it had passed\noff. And it had all gone well. The best thing was that he now felt at\nease, tranquil and vigorous. As for her, he had not even seen her\nthoroughly. He remembered that she was clean, fresh, not bad-looking,\nand simple, without any pretence. "Whose wife is she?" said he to\nhimself. "Pechnikov\'s, Daniel said. What Pechnikov is that? There are\ntwo households of that name. Probably she is old Michael\'s\ndaughter-in-law. Yes, that must be it. His son does live in Moscow. I\'ll\nask Daniel about it some time."\n\nFrom then onward that previously important drawback to country\nlife--enforced self-restraint--was eliminated. Eugene\'s freedom of mind\nwas no longer disturbed and he was able to attend freely to his affairs.\n\nAnd the matter Eugene had undertaken was far from easy: it sometimes\nseemed to him that he would not be able to go through with it, and that\nit would end in his having to sell the estate after all, so that all his\nefforts would be wasted and it would turn out that he had failed, and\nbeen unable to accomplish what he had undertaken. That prospect\ndisturbed him most of all. Before he had time to stop up one hole a new\none would unexpectedly show itself.\n\nAll this time more and more debts of his father\'s, which he had not\nexpected, came to light. It was evident that his father had latterly\nborrowed right and left. At the time of the settlement in May, Eugene\nhad thought he at last knew everything, but suddenly, in the middle of\nthe summer, he received a letter from which it appeared that there was\nstill a debt of 12,000 rubles to the widow Esipova. There was no\npromissory note, but only an ordinary receipt, which his lawyer told him\ncould be disputed. But it did not enter Eugene\'s head to refuse to pay a\ndebt of his father\'s merely because the document could be challenged. He\nonly wanted to know for certain whether there had been such a debt.\n\n"Mamma! Who is Kaleriya Vladimirovna Esipova?" he asked his mother, when\nthey met as usual for dinner.\n\n"Esipova? She was brought up by your grandfather. Why?"\n\nEugene told his mother about the letter.\n\n"I wonder she is not ashamed to ask for it. Your father gave her so\nmuch!"\n\n"But do we owe her this?"\n\n"Well now, how shall I say? It is not a debt. Papa, out of his unbounded\nkindness . . ."\n\n"Yes, but did Papa consider it a debt?"\n\n"I cannot say. I don\'t know. I only know it is hard enough for you\nwithout that."\n\nEugene saw that Mary Pavlovna did not know what to say, and was as it\nwere sounding him.\n\n"I see from what you say, that it must be paid," said the son. "I will\ngo to see her to-morrow and have a chat, and see if it cannot be\ndeferred."\n\n"Ah, how sorry I am for you, but, you know, that will be best. Tell her\nshe must wait," said Mary Pavlovna, evidently tranquillized and proud of\nher son\'s decision.\n\nEugene\'s position was particularly hard because his mother, who was\nliving with him, did not at all realize his position. She had been so\naccustomed all her life long to live extravagantly that she could not\neven imagine to herself the position her son was in, that is to say,\nthat to-day or to-morrow matters might shape themselves so that they\nwould have nothing left, and he would have to sell everything, and live\nand support his mother on what salary he could earn, which at the very\nmost would be 2,000 rubles. She did not understand that they could only\nsave themselves from that position by cutting down expense in\neverything, and so she could not understand why Eugene was so careful\nabout trifles, in expenditure on gardeners, coachmen, servants--even on\nfood. Also, like most widows, she nourished feelings of devotion to the\nmemory of her departed spouse quite different from those she had felt\nfor him while he lived, and she did not admit the thought that what the\ndeparted had done, or had arranged, could be wrong or could be altered.\n\nEugene by great efforts managed to keep up the garden and the\nconservatory with two gardeners, and the stables with two coachmen. And\nMary Pavlovna na\xc3\xafvely thought that she was sacrificing herself for her\nson and doing all a mother could do, by not complaining of the food\nwhich the old man-cook prepared, of the fact that the paths in the park\nwere not all swept clean, and that instead of footmen they had only a\nboy.\n\nSo, too, concerning this new debt, in which Eugene saw an almost\ncrushing blow to all his undertakings, Mary Pavlovna only saw an\nincident displaying Eugene\'s noble nature.\n\nMary Pavlovna moreover did not feel much anxiety about Eugene\'s\nposition, because she was confident that he would make a brilliant\nmarriage which would put everything right. And he could make a very\nbrilliant marriage: she knew a dozen families who would be glad to give\ntheir daughters to him. And she wished to arrange the matter as soon as\npossible.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nEugene himself dreamt of marriage, but not in the same way as his\nmother. The idea of using marriage as a means of putting his affairs in\norder was repulsive to him. He wished to marry honourably, for love. He\nobserved the girls whom he met and those he knew, and compared himself\nwith them, but no decision had yet been taken. Meanwhile contrary to his\nexpectations his relations with Stepanida continued, and even acquired\nthe character of a settled affair. Eugene was so far from debauchery, it\nwas so hard for him secretly to do this thing which he felt to be bad,\nthat he could not arrange these meetings himself, and even after the\nfirst one hoped not to see Stepanida again; but it turned out that after\nsome time the same restlessness (due, he believed, to that cause) again\novercame him. And his restlessness this time was no longer impersonal,\nbut suggested just those same bright, black eyes, and that deep voice,\nsaying, "ever so long," that same scent of something fresh and strong,\nand that same full bread lifting the bib of her apron, and all this in\nthat hazel and maple thicket, bathed in bright sunlight.\n\nThough he felt ashamed, he again approached Daniel. And again a\nrendezvous was fixed for midday, in the wood. This time Eugene looked\nher over more carefully, and everything about her seemed attractive. He\ntried talking to her, and asked about her husband. He really was\nMichael\'s son, and lived as a coachman in Moscow.\n\n"Well, then, how is it you . . ." Eugene wanted to ask how it was she\nwas untrue to him.\n\n"What about \'how is it\'?" asked she. Evidently she was clever and\nquick-witted.\n\n"Well, how is it you come to me?"\n\n"There now," said she merrily. "I bet he goes on the spree there. Why\nshouldn\'t I?"\n\nEvidently she was putting on an air of sauciness and assurance. And this\nseemed charming to Eugene. But all the same he did not himself fix a\nrendezvous with her. Even when she proposed that they should meet\nwithout the aid of Daniel, to whom she seemed not very well-disposed,\nEugene did not consent. He hoped that this meeting would be the last. He\nliked her. He thought such intercourse was necessary for him and that\nthere was nothing bad about it, but in the depth of his soul there was a\nstricter judge, who did not approve of it and hoped that this would be\nthe last time, or if he did not hope that, at any rate did not wish to\nparticipate in arrangements to repeat it another time.\n\nSo the whole summer passed, during which they met a dozen times and\nalways by Daniel\'s help. It happened once that she could not be there\nbecause her husband had come home, and Daniel proposed another woman,\nbut Eugene refused with disgust. Then the husband went away, and the\nmeetings continued as before, at first through Daniel, but afterwards he\nsimply fixed the time and she came with another woman, Prokhorova--as it\nwould not do for a peasant-woman to go about alone.\n\nOnce at the very time fixed for the rendezvous a family came to call on\nMary Pavlovna, with the very girl she wished Eugene to marry, and it was\nimpossible for Eugene to get away. As soon as he could do so, he went\nout as though to the thrashing-floor, and round by the path to their\nmeeting-place in the wood. She was not there, but at the accustomed spot\neverything within reach of one\'s hand had been broken--the black alder,\nthe hazel-twigs, and even a young maple the thickness of a stake. She\nhad waited, had become excited and angry, and had skittishly left him a\nremembrance. He waited, waited, and went to Daniel to ask him to call\nher for to-morrow. She came, and was just as usual.\n\nSo the summer passed. The meetings were always arranged in the wood, and\nonly once, when it grew towards autumn, in the shed that stood in her\nback-yard.\n\nIt did not enter Eugene\'s head that these relations of his had any\nimportance for him. About her he did not even think. He gave her money\nand nothing more. At first he did not know and did not think that the\naffair was known and she was envied throughout the village, or that her\nrelations took money from her and encouraged her, and that her\nconception of any sin in the matter had been quite obliterated by the\ninfluence of the money and her family\'s approval. It seemed to her that\nif people envied her, then what she was doing was good.\n\n"It is simply necessary for one\'s health," thought Eugene. "I grant it\nis not right, and though no one says anything, everybody, or many\npeople, know of it. The woman who comes with her knows. And once she\nknows, she is sure to have told others. But what\'s to be done? I am\nacting badly," thought Eugene, "but what\'s one to do? Anyhow it is not\nfor long."\n\nWhat chiefly disturbed Eugene was the thought of the husband. At first,\nfor some reason, it seemed to him that the husband must be a poor sort,\nand this, as it were, partly justified his conduct. But he saw the\nhusband and was struck: he was a fine fellow and smartly dressed, in no\nway a worse man, but surely better, than himself. At their next meeting\nhe told her he had seen her husband and had been surprised to see that\nhe was such a fine fellow.\n\n"There\'s not such another in the village," said she proudly.\n\nThis surprised Eugene. The thought of the husband tormented him still\nmore after that. He happened to be at Daniel\'s one day and Daniel,\nhaving begun chatting, plainly said to him:\n\n"And Michael, the other day, asked me: \'Is it true that the master is\nliving with my wife?\' I said I did not know. Anyway, I said, better with\nthe master than with a peasant."\n\n"Well, and what did he say?"\n\n"He said,--\'Wait a bit. I\'ll get to know, and I\'ll give it her all the\nsame.\'"\n\n"Yes, if the husband returned to live here, I would give her up,"\nthought Eugene.\n\nBut the husband lived in town and for the present their intercourse\ncontinued.\n\n"When necessary, I will break it off, and there will be nothing left of\nit," thought he.\n\nAnd this seemed to him certain, especially as during the whole summer\nmany different things occupied him very fully: the erection of the new\nfarm-house, and the harvest, and building, and above all meeting the\ndebts and selling the waste land. All these were affairs that completely\nabsorbed him and on which he spent his thoughts when he lay down and\nwhen he rose. All that was, real life. His intercourse--he did not even\ncall it connection--with Stepanida was something quite unnoticed. It is\ntrue that when the wish to see her arose, it came with such strength\nthat he could think of nothing else. But this did not last long. A\nmeeting was arranged, and he again forgot her for a week or even for a\nmonth.\n\nIn autumn Eugene often rode to town, and there became friendly with the\nAnnenskis. They had a daughter who had just finished the Institute.[1]\nAnd then, to Mary Pavlovna\'s great grief, it happened that Eugene, as\nshe expressed it, "cheapened himself,"--by falling in love with Liza\nAnnenskaya and proposing to her.\n\nFrom that time the relations with Stepanida ceased.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: The Institute was a boarding-school for the daughters of\nthe nobility and gentry, in which great attention was paid to the\nmanners and accomplishments of the pupils.]\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nIt is impossible to explain why Eugene chose Liza Annenskaya, as it is\nnever possible to explain why a man chooses this and not that woman.\nThere were many reasons--positive and negative. One reason was that she\nwas not a very rich heiress such as his mother sought for him, another\nthat she was na\xc3\xafve and to be pitied in her relations with her mother,\nthen there was the fact that she was not a beauty who attracted general\nattention to herself, but yet was not bad looking. The chief reason was\nthat his acquaintance with her began at the time when Eugene was ripe\nfor marriage. He fell in love because he knew that he would marry.\n\nLiza Annenskaya was at first merely pleasing to Eugene, but when he\ndecided to make her his wife, his feelings for her became much stronger.\nHe felt that he was in love.\n\nLiza was tall, slender, and long. Everything about her was long; her\nface, and her nose--not prominently but downwards--and her fingers, and\nher feet. The colour of her face was very delicate, yellowish white and\ndelicately pink; her hair was long, light brown, soft, curly, and she\nhad beautiful, clear, mild, confiding eyes. Those eyes especially struck\nEugene. And when he thought of Liza he always saw those clear, mild,\nconfiding eyes.\n\nSuch was she physically; spiritually he knew nothing of her, but only\nsaw those eyes. And those eyes seemed to tell him all he needed to know.\nThe meaning of those eyes was this:\n\nWhile still in the Institute, when she was fifteen, Liza used\ncontinually to fall in love with all attractive men and was animated and\nhappy only when she was in love. After leaving the Institute she\ncontinued to fall in love, in just the same way, with all the young men\nshe met, and of course fell in love with Eugene as soon as she made his\nacquaintance. It was this being in love which gave her eyes that\nparticular expression which so captivated Eugene. Already that winter\nshe had been, at one and the same time, in love with two young men, and\nblushed and became excited not only when they entered the room but\nwhenever their names were mentioned. But afterwards, when her mother\nhinted to her that Irtenev seemed to have serious intentions, her love\nfor him increased so that she became almost indifferent to the two\nprevious attractions, and when Irtenev began to come to their balls and\nparties, and danced with her more than with others and evidently only\nwished to know whether she loved him, her love for him became painful.\nShe dreamed of him in her sleep and seemed to see him when she was awake\nin a dark room, and everyone else vanished from her mind. But when he\nproposed and they were formally engaged, and when they had kissed one\nanother and were a betrothed couple, then she had no thoughts but of\nhim, no desire but to be with him, to love him, and to be loved by him.\nShe was also proud of him and felt emotional about him and herself and\nher love, and quite melted and felt faint from love of him.\n\nThe more he got to know her the more he loved her. He had not at all\nexpected to find such love, and it strengthened his own feeling still\nmore.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nTowards spring he went to his estate at Sem\xc3\xabnovskoe to have a look at\nit and to give directions about the management, and especially about the\nhouse which was being done up for his wedding.\n\nMary Pavlovna was dissatisfied with her son\'s choice, not only because\nthe match was not as brilliant as it might have been, but also because\nshe did not like Varvara Alexeevna, his future mother-in-law. Whether\nshe was good-natured or not she did not know and could not decide, but\nthat she was not well-bred, not _comme il faut_, "not a lady" as Mary\nPavlovna said to herself,--she saw from their first acquaintance, and\nthis distressed her; distressed her because she was accustomed to value\nbreeding and knew that Eugene was sensitive to it, and she foresaw that\nhe would suffer much annoyance on this account. But she liked the girl.\nLiked her chiefly because Eugene did. One could not help loving her. And\nMary Pavlovna was quite sincerely ready to do so.\n\nEugene found his mother contented and in good spirits. She was getting\neverything straight in the house and preparing to go away herself as\nsoon as he brought his young wife. Eugene persuaded her to stay for the\ntime being, and the future remained undecided.\n\nIn the evening after tea Mary Pavlovna played patience as usual. Eugene\nsat by, helping her. This was the hour of their most intimate talks.\nHaving finished one game of patience and while preparing to begin\nanother, Mary Pavlovna looked up at Eugene and, with a little\nhesitation, began thus:\n\n"I wanted to tell you, Jenya,--of course I do not know, but in general I\nwanted to suggest to you that before your wedding it is absolutely\nnecessary to have finished with all your bachelor affairs, so that\nnothing may disturb either you or your wife. God forbid that it should.\nYou understand me?"\n\nAnd indeed Eugene at once understood that Mary Pavlovna was hinting at\nhis relations with Stepanida which had ended in the previous autumn; and\nthat she attributed much more importance to those relations than they\ndeserved, as single women always do. Eugene blushed, and not from shame\nso much as from vexation that good-natured Mary Pavlovna was\nbothering--out of affection no doubt--but still was bothering about\nmatters that were not her business and that she did not and could not\nunderstand. He answered that he had nothing that needed concealment, and\nthat he had always conducted himself so that there should be nothing to\nhinder his marrying.\n\n"Well, dear, that is excellent. Only, Jenya, don\'t be vexed with me,"\nsaid Mary Pavlovna, in confusion.\n\nBut Eugene saw that she had not finished and had not said what she\nwanted to. So it appeared when a little later she began to tell him of\nhow, in his absence, she had been asked to stand godmother at . . . the\nPechnikovs.\n\nEugene flushed now, not with vexation or shame, but with some strange\nconsciousness of the importance of what was about to be told him--an\ninvoluntary consciousness quite at variance with his conclusions. And\nwhat he expected happened. Mary Pavlovna, as if merely by way of\nconversation, mentioned that this year only boys were being\nborn,--evidently a sign of a coming war. Both at the Vasins and the\nPechnikovs the young wife had a first child--at each house a boy. Mary\nPavlovna wanted to say this casually, but she herself felt ashamed when\nshe saw the colour mount to her son\'s face and saw him nervously\nremoving, tapping, and replacing his pince-nez and hurriedly lighting a\ncigarette. She became silent. He too was silent and could not think how\nto break that silence. So they both understood that they had understood\none another.\n\n"Yes, the chief thing is that there should be justice and no favouritism\nin the village,--as under your grandfather."\n\n"Mamma,"--said Eugene suddenly,--"I know why you are saying this. You\nhave no need to be disturbed. My future family-life is so sacred to me\nthat I should not infringe it in any case. And as to what occurred in my\nbachelor days, that is quite ended. I never formed any union and no one\nhas any claims on me."\n\n"Well, I am glad," said his mother. "I know how noble your feelings\nare."\n\nEugene accepted his mother\'s words as a tribute due to him, and did not\nreply.\n\nNext day he drove to town thinking of his fianc\xc3\xa9e and of anything in\nthe world except of Stepanida. But, as if purposely to remind him, on\napproaching the church he met people walking and driving back from it.\nHe met old Matvey with Simon, some lads and girls, and then two women,\none elderly, the other smartly dressed with a bright red kerchief, who\nseemed familiar. The woman was walking lightly, boldly, carrying a child\nin her arms. He came up to them, the elder woman bowed, stopping in the\nold-fashioned way, but the young woman with the child only bent her\nhead, and from under the kerchief gleamed familiar, merry, smiling eyes.\n\nYes, this was she, but all was over and it was no use looking at her:\n"and the child may be mine," flashed through his mind. No, what\nnonsense! There was her husband, she used to see him. He did not even\nconsider the matter further, so settled in his mind was it that it had\nbeen necessary for his health,--he had paid her money and there was no\nmore to be said; there was, there had been, and there could be, no\nquestion of any union between them. It was not that he stifled the voice\nof conscience, no--his conscience simply said nothing to him. And he\nthought no more about her after the conversation with his mother and\nafter this meeting. Nor did he meet her again.\n\nEugene was married in town the week after Easter, and left at once with\nhis young wife for his country estate. The house had been arranged as\nusual for a young couple. Mary Pavlovna wished to leave, but Eugene and\nstill more strongly Liza begged her to remain, and she only moved into a\ndetached wing of the house.\n\nAnd so a new life began for Eugene.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe first year of his marriage was a hard one for Eugene. It was hard\nbecause affairs he had managed to put off during the time of his\ncourtship now, after his marriage, all came upon him at once.\n\nTo escape from debts was impossible. An outlying part of the estate was\nsold and the most pressing obligations met, but others remained, and he\nhad no money. The estate yielded a good revenue, but he had had to send\npayments to his brother, and to spend on his own marriage, so that there\nwas no ready money and the factory could not carry on and would have to\nbe closed down. The only way of escape was to use his wife\'s money.\nLiza, having realized her husband\'s position, insisted on this herself.\nEugene agreed, but only on condition that he should give her a mortgage\non half his estate; and this he did. Of course it was not for the sake\nof his wife, who felt offended at it, but to appease his mother-in-law.\n\nThese affairs, with various fluctuations of success and failure, helped\nto poison Eugene\'s life that first year. Another thing was his wife\'s\nill-health. That same first year, seven months after their marriage, in\nautumn, a misfortune befell Liza. She drove out to meet her husband who\nwas returning from town; the quiet horse became rather playful, and she\nwas frightened and jumped out. Her jump was comparatively fortunate--she\nmight have been caught by the wheel--but she was pregnant, and that same\nnight the pains began and she had a miscarriage from which she was long\nin recovering. The loss of the expected child and his wife\'s illness,\ntogether with the disorder in his affairs, and above all the presence of\nhis mother-in-law, who arrived as soon as Liza fell ill--all this\ntogether made the year still harder for Eugene.\n\nBut notwithstanding these difficult circumstances, towards the end of\nthe first year Eugene felt very well. First of all his cherished hope of\nrestoring his fallen fortune and renewing his grandfather\'s way of life\nin a new form, was approaching accomplishment, though slowly and with\ndifficulty. There was no longer any question of having to sell the whole\nestate to meet the debts. The chief estate, though transferred to his\nwife\'s name, was saved, and if only the beet crop succeeded and the\nprice kept up, by next year his position of want and stress might be\nreplaced by one of complete prosperity. That was one thing.\n\nAnother was that however much he had expected from his wife, he had\nnever expected to find in her what he actually found. It was not what he\nhad expected, but it was much better. Emotion, raptures of love--though\nhe tried to produce them--did not take place or were very slight, but\nsomething quite different appeared, namely, that he was not merely more\ncheerful and happier but that it became easier to live. He did not know\nwhy this should be so, but it was.\n\nIt happened because immediately after the marriage she decided that\nEugene Irtenev was superior to, wiser, purer, and nobler than, anyone\nelse in the world, and therefore it was right for everyone to serve him\nand do what would please him; but as it was impossible to make everyone\ndo this, she to the limit of her strength must do it herself. So she\ndid; and therefore all her strength of mind was directed towards\nlearning and guessing what he liked, and then doing just that, whatever\nit was and however difficult it might be.\n\nShe had the gift which furnishes the chief delight of intercourse with a\nloving woman; thanks to her love of her husband she penetrated into his\nsoul. She knew--better it seemed to him than he himself--his every\nstate, and every shade of his feeling, and she behaved correspondingly,\nand therefore never hurt his feelings, but always lessened his\ndistresses and strengthened his joys. And she understood not only his\nfeelings but also his joys. Things quite foreign to her--concerning the\nfarming, the factory, or the appraisement of others, she immediately\nunderstood so that she could not merely converse with him, but could\noften, as he himself said, be a useful and irreplaceable counsellor. She\nregarded affairs and people, and everything in the world, only through\nhis eyes. She loved her mother, but having seen that Eugene disliked his\nmother-in-law\'s interference in their life she immediately took her\nhusband\'s side, and did so with such decision that he had to restrain\nher.\n\nBesides all this she had very much taste, tact, and above all,\npeacefulness. All that she did, she did unnoticed; only the results of\nwhat she did were observable, namely, that always and in everything\nthere was cleanliness, order, and elegance. Liza had at once understood\nin what her husband\'s ideal of life consisted, and she tried to attain,\nand in the arrangement and order of the house did attain, what he\nwanted. Children, it is true, were lacking, but there was hope of this\nalso. In winter she went to Petersburg to see a specialist, and he\nassured them that she was quite well and could have children.\n\nAnd this desire was accomplished. By the end of the year she was again\npregnant.\n\nThe one thing that threatened, not to say poisoned, their happiness was\nher jealousy; a jealousy she restrained and did not exhibit, but from\nwhich she often suffered. Not only might Eugene not love anyone--because\nthere was not a woman on earth worthy of him (as to whether she herself\nwas worthy or not, she never asked herself),--but not a single woman\nmight, therefore, dare to love him.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThey lived thus: he rose, as he always had done, early, and went to see\nto the farm or the factory, where work was going on, or sometimes to the\nfields. Towards ten o\'clock he would come back to his coffee: they had\nit on the verandah, Mary Pavlovna, an uncle who lived with them, and\nLiza. After a conversation which was often very animated while they\ndrank their coffee, they dispersed till dinner-time. At two o\'clock they\ndined and then went for a walk, or a drive. In the evening when he\nreturned from his office they drank their evening tea, and sometimes he\nread aloud while she worked, or when there were guests they had music or\ntalked. When he went away on business he wrote to his wife, and received\nletters from her, every day. Sometimes she accompanied him, and then\nthey were particularly merry. On his name-day and on hers guests\nassembled, and it was pleasant to him to see how well she managed to\narrange things so that it was pleasant for everybody. He saw, and heard\nalso, that they all admired her, the young, agreeable hostess, and he\nloved her still more for this.\n\nAll went excellently. She bore her pregnancy easily, and though they\nwere afraid, they both began making plans as to how they would bring the\nchild up. The system of education and the arrangements were all decided\nby Eugene, and her only wish was obediently to carry out his desires.\nEugene on his part read up medical works, and intended to bring the\nchild up according to all the precepts of science. She, of course,\nagreed to everything and made preparations, making warm and also cool\n"envelopes,"[2] and preparing a cradle. Thus the second year of their\nmarriage arrived, and the second spring.\n\n\n[Footnote 2: An "envelope" was a small mattress with attached\ncoverlet, on which babies were carried about.]\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nIt was just before Trinity Sunday. Liza was in her fifth month, and,\nthough careful, she was brisk and active. Both the mothers, his and\nhers, were living in the house, but under pretext of watching and\nsafeguarding her only upset her by their tiffs. Eugene was specially\nengrossed with a new experiment for the cultivation of sugar-beet on a\nlarge scale.\n\nJust before Trinity Liza decided that it was necessary to have a\nthorough house-cleaning, as it had not been done since Easter, and she\nhired two women by the day, to help the servants wash the floors and\nwindows, beat the furniture and the carpets, and put covers on them. The\nwomen came early in the morning, heated the coppers, and set to work.\nOne of the two was Stepanida, who had just weaned her baby boy. Through\nthe office-clerk--whom she now carried on with--she had begged for the\njob of washing the floors. She wanted to have a good look at the new\nmistress. Stepanida was living by herself, as formerly, her husband\nbeing away, and she was up to tricks, as she had formerly been first\nwith old Daniel (who had once caught her taking some logs of firewood),\nafterwards with the master, and now with the young clerk. She was not\nconcerning herself any longer about her master. "He has a wife now," she\nthought. But it would be good to have a look at the lady and at her\nestablishment: folk said it was well arranged.\n\nEugene had not seen her since he had met her with the child. Having a\nbaby to attend to she had not been going out to work, and he seldom\nwalked through the village. That morning, on the eve of Trinity Sunday,\nEugene rose at five o\'clock and rode to the fallow land which was to be\nsprinkled with phosphates, and he left the house before the women were\nabout it, and while they were still engaged lighting the copper fires.\n\nMerry, contented, and hungry, Eugene returned to breakfast. He\ndismounted from his mare at the gate and handed her over to the\ngardener. Flicking the high grass with his whip and repeating, as one\noften does, a phrase he had just uttered, he walked towards the house.\nThe phrase he repeated was: "phosphates justify"--what or to whom he\nneither knew nor reflected.\n\nThey were beating a carpet on the grass. The furniture had been brought\nout.\n\n"There now! What a house-cleaning Liza has undertaken! . . . Phosphates\njustify. . . . What a manageress she is! A manageress! Yes, a\nmanageress," said he to himself, vividly imagining her in her white\nwrapper and with her smiling joyful face, as it nearly always was when\nhe looked at her. "Yes, I must change my boots, or else \'phosphates\njustify,\' that is, smell of manure, and the manageress is in such a\ncondition. Why \'in such a condition\'? Because a new little Irtenev is\ngrowing there inside her," he thought. "Yes, phosphates justify," and\nsmiling at his thoughts he put his hand to the door of his room.\n\nBut he had not time to push the door before it opened of itself and he\nmet, face to face, a woman coming towards him carrying a pail, barefoot,\nand with sleeves turned up high. He stepped aside to let her pass, she\ntoo stepped aside, adjusting her kerchief with a wet hand.\n\n"Go on, go on, I won\'t go there, if you . . ." began Eugene and,\nsuddenly, recognizing her, stopped.\n\nShe glanced merrily at him with smiling eyes, and pulling down her skirt\nwent out by the door.\n\n"What nonsense! . . . It is impossible," said Eugene to himself,\nfrowning and waving his hand as though to get rid of a fly, displeased\nat having noticed her. He was vexed that he had noticed her and yet he\ncould not take his eyes from her strong body, swayed by the agile\nstrides of her bare feet, or from her arms, shoulders, and the pleasing\nfolds of her shirt and handsome skirt, tucked up high above her white\ncalves.\n\n"But why am I looking?" said he to himself, lowering his eyes so as not\nto see her. "But anyhow I must go in to get some other boots." And he\nturned back to go into his own room, but had not gone five steps before,\nwithout knowing why or wherefore, he again glanced round to have another\nlook at her. She was just going round the corner and also glanced at\nhim.\n\n"Ah, what am I doing!" said he to himself. "She may think . . . It is\neven certain that she already does think . . ."\n\nHe entered his damp room. Another woman, an old and skinny one, was\nthere, and was still washing it. Eugene passed on tiptoe across the\nfloor wet with dirty water to the wall where his boots stood, and he was\nabout to leave the room, when the woman herself went out.\n\n"This one has gone and the other, Stepanida, will come here alone,"\nsomeone within him began to reflect.\n\n"My God, what am I thinking of and what am I doing!" He seized his boots\nand ran out with them into the hall, put them on there, brushed himself,\nand went out on to the verandah where both the mammas were already\ndrinking coffee. Liza had evidently been expecting him and came on to\nthe verandah through another door at the same time.\n\n"My God! If she, who considers me so honourable, pure, and innocent,--if\nshe only knew!"--thought he.\n\nLiza, as usual, met him with shining face. But to-day somehow she seemed\nto him particularly pale, yellow, long, and weak.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nDuring coffee, as often happened, a peculiarly feminine kind of\nconversation went on which had no logical sequence, but which evidently\nwas connected in some way for it went on uninterruptedly.\n\nThe two old ladies were pin-pricking one another, and Liza was skilfully\nman\xc5\x93uvring between them.\n\n"I am so vexed that we had not finished washing your room before you got\nback," she said to her husband. "But I do so want to get everything\narranged."\n\n"Well, did you sleep well after I got up?"\n\n"Yes, I slept well, and I feel well."\n\n"How can a woman be well in her condition during this intolerable heat,\nwhen her windows face the sun," said Varvara Alexeevna, her mother. "And\nthey have no venetian-blinds or awnings. I always had awnings."\n\n"But you know we are in the shade after ten o\'clock," said Mary\nPavlovna.\n\n"That\'s what causes fever; it comes of dampness," said Varvara\nAlexeevna, not noticing that what she was saying did not agree with what\nshe had just said. "My doctor always says that it is impossible to\ndiagnose an illness unless one knows the patient. And he certainly\nknows, for he is the leading physician and we pay him a hundred rubles a\nvisit. My late husband did not believe in doctors, but he did not grudge\nme anything."\n\n"How can a man grudge anything to a woman when perhaps her life and the\nchild\'s depend . . ."\n\n"Yes, when she has means, a wife need not depend on her husband. A good\nwife submits to her husband," said Varvara Alexeevna,--"only Liza is too\nweak after her illness."\n\n"Oh no, mamma, I feel quite well. But why have they not brought you any\nboiled cream?"\n\n"I don\'t want any. I can do with raw cream."\n\n"I offered some to Varvara Alexeevna, but she declined," said Mary\nPavlovna, as if justifying herself.\n\n"No, I don\'t want any to-day." And as if to terminate an unpleasant\nconversation and yield magnanimously, Varvara Alexeevna turned to Eugene\nand said: "Well, and have you sprinkled the phosphates?"\n\nLiza ran to fetch the cream.\n\n"But I don\'t want it. I don\'t want it."\n\n"Liza, Liza, go gently,"--said Mary Pavlovna. "Such rapid movements do\nher harm."\n\n"Nothing does harm, if one\'s mind is at peace," said Varvara Alexeevna\nas if referring to something, though she knew that there was nothing\nthat her words could refer to.\n\nLiza returned with the cream, Eugene drank his coffee and listened\nmorosely. He was accustomed to these conversations, but to-day he was\nparticularly annoyed by its lack of sense. He wanted to think over what\nhad happened to him, but this chatter disturbed him. Having finished her\ncoffee Varvara Alexeevna went away in a bad humour. Liza, Eugene, and\nMary Pavlovna stayed behind, and their conversation was simple and\npleasant. But Liza, being sensitive, at once noticed that something was\ntormenting Eugene, and she asked him whether anything unpleasant had\nhappened. He was not prepared for this question, and hesitated a little\nbefore replying that there had been nothing unpleasant. And this reply\nmade Liza think all the more; that something was tormenting, and greatly\ntormenting, him was as evident to her as the fact that a fly had fallen\ninto the milk, yet he did not speak of it. What could it be?\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nAfter breakfast they all dispersed. Eugene as usual went to his study.\nHe did not begin reading or writing his letters, but sat smoking one\ncigarette after another and thinking. He was terribly surprised and\ndisturbed by the expected recrudescence within him of the bad feeling\nfrom which he had thought himself free since his marriage. Since then he\nhad not once experienced that feeling, either for her--the woman he had\nknown--or for any other woman except his wife. He had often felt glad of\nthis emancipation, and now suddenly a chance meeting, seemingly so\nunimportant, revealed to him the fact that he was not free. What now\ntormented him was not that he was yielding to that feeling and desired\nher--he did not dream of so doing--but that the feeling was awake within\nhim and he had to be on his guard against it. He had no doubt but that\nhe would suppress it.\n\nHe had a letter to answer and a paper to write. He sat down at his\nwriting-table and began to work. Having finished it and quite forgotten\nwhat had disturbed him, he went out to go to the stables. And again as\nill-luck would have it, either by unfortunate chance or intentionally,\nas soon as he stepped from the porch, a red skirt and red kerchief\nappeared from round the corner, and she went past him swinging her arms\nand swaying her body. She not only went past him, but on passing him\nran, as if playfully, to overtake her fellow-servant.\n\nAgain the bright midday, the nettles, the back of Daniel\'s hut, and in\nthe shade of the plane-trees her smiling face biting some leaves, rose\nin his imagination.\n\n"No, it is impossible to let matters continue so," he said to himself,\nand waiting till the women had passed out of sight he went to the\noffice.\n\nIt was just the dinner-hour and he hoped to find the steward still\nthere. So it happened. The steward was just waking up from his\nafter-dinner nap. Standing in the office, stretching himself and\nyawning, he was looking at the herdsman who was telling him something.\n\n"Vasili Nikolaich!" said Eugene to the steward.\n\n"What is your pleasure?"\n\n"I want to speak to you."\n\n"What is your pleasure?"\n\n"Just finish what you are saying."\n\n"Aren\'t you going to bring it in?" said Vasili Nikolaich to the\nherdsman.\n\n"It\'s heavy, Vasili Nikolaich."\n\n"What is it?" asked Eugene.\n\n"Why, a cow has calved in the meadow. Well, all right, I\'ll order them\nto harness a horse at once. Tell Nicholas Lysukh to get out the dray\ncart."\n\nThe herdsman went out.\n\n"Do you know," began Eugene, flushing and conscious that he was doing\nso, "do you know, Vasili Nikolaich, while I was a bachelor I went off\nthe track a bit. . . . You may have heard . . ."\n\nVasili Nikolaich with smiling eyes and evidently sorry for his master,\nsaid: "Is it about Stepanida?"\n\n"Why, yes. Look here. Please, please do not engage her to help in the\nhouse. You understand, it is very awkward for me . . ."\n\n"Yes, it must have been Vanya, the clerk, who arranged it."\n\n"Yes, please. . . . Well, and hadn\'t the rest of the phosphates better\nbe strewn?" said Eugene, to hide his confusion.\n\n"Yes, I am just going to see to it."\n\nSo it ended. And Eugene calmed down, hoping that as he had lived for a\nyear without seeing her, so things would go on now. "Besides, Vasili\nNikolaich will speak to Ivan the clerk; Ivan will speak to her, and she\nwill understand that I don\'t want it," said Eugene to himself, and he\nwas glad that he had forced himself to speak to Vasili Nikolaich, hard\nas it had been to do so.\n\n"Yes, it is better, better, than that feeling of doubt, that feeling of\nshame." He shuddered at the mere remembrance of his sin in thought.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nThe moral effort he had made to overcome his shame and speak to Vasili\nNikolaich, tranquillized Eugene. It seemed to him that the matter was\nall over now. Liza at once noticed that he was quite calm, and even\nhappier than usual. "No doubt he was upset by our mothers pin-pricking\none another. It really is disagreeable, especially for him who is so\nsensitive and noble, always to hear such unfriendly and ill-mannered\ninsinuations," thought she.\n\nThe next day was Trinity Sunday. The weather was beautiful, and the\npeasant-women, according to custom, on their way into the woods to plait\nwreaths, came to the landowner\'s home and began to sing and dance. Mary\nPavlovna and Varvara Alexeevna came out on to the porch in smart\nclothes, carrying sunshades, and went up to the ring of singers. With\nthem, in a jacket of Chinese silk, came out the uncle, a flabby\nlibertine and drunkard, who was living that summer with Eugene.\n\nAs usual there was a bright, many-coloured ring of young women and\ngirls, the centre of everything, and around these from different sides\nlike attendant planets that had detached themselves and were circling\nround, went girls hand in hand, rustling in their new print gowns; young\nlads giggling and running backwards and forwards after one another;\nfull-grown lads in dark blue or black coats and caps and with red\nshirts, who unceasingly spat out sunflower-seed shells; and the domestic\nservants or other outsiders watching the dance-circle from aside. Both\nthe old ladies went close up to the ring, and Liza accompanied them in a\nlight blue dress, with light blue ribbons on her head, and with wide\nsleeves under which her long white arms and angular elbows were visible.\n\nEugene did not wish to come out, but it was ridiculous to hide, and he\ntoo came out on to the porch smoking a cigarette, bowed to the men and\nlads, and talked with one of them. The women meanwhile shouted a\ndance-song with all their might, snapping their fingers, clapping their\nhands, and dancing.\n\n"They are calling for the master," said a youngster, coming up to\nEugene\'s wife who had not noticed the call. Liza called Eugene to look\nat the dance and at one of the women dancers who particularly pleased\nher. This was Stepanida. She wore a yellow skirt, a velveteen sleeveless\njacket and a silk kerchief, and was broad, energetic, ruddy, and merry.\nNo doubt she danced well. He saw nothing.\n\n"Yes, yes," said he, removing and replacing his pince-nez. "Yes, yes,"\nrepeated he. "So it seems I cannot be rid of her," he thought.\n\nHe did not look at her as he was afraid of her attraction, and just on\nthat account what his passing glance caught of her seemed to him\nespecially attractive. Besides this he saw by her sparkling look that\nshe saw him and saw that he admired her. He stood there as long as\npropriety demanded, and seeing that Varvara Alexeevna had called her,\nsenselessly and insincerely, "my dear," and was talking to her, he\nturned aside and went away.\n\nHe went into the house. He retired in order not to see her, but on\nreaching the upper story, without knowing how or why, he approached the\nwindow, and as long as the women remained at the porch he stood there\nand looked and looked at her, feasting his eyes on her.\n\nHe ran, while there was no one to see him, and then went with quiet\nsteps on to the verandah, and from there, smoking a cigarette and as if\ngoing for a stroll, he passed through the garden and followed the\ndirection she had taken. He had not gone two steps along the alley\nbefore he noticed behind the trees a velveteen sleeveless jacket, with a\npink and yellow skirt and a red kerchief. She was going somewhere with\nanother woman. "Where are they going?"\n\nAnd suddenly a terrible desire scorched him, as though a hand were\nseizing his heart. As if by someone else\'s wish he looked round and went\ntowards her.\n\n"Eugene Ivanich, Eugene Ivanich! I have come to see your honour," said a\nvoice behind him, and Eugene, seeing old Samokhin, who was digging a\nwell for him, roused himself and, turning quickly round, went to meet\nSamokhin. While speaking with him he turned sideways and saw that she\nand the woman who was with her went down the slope, evidently to the\nwell, or making an excuse of the well, and having stopped there a little\nwhile, ran back to the dance-circle.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nAfter talking to Samokhin, Eugene returned to the house as depressed as\nif he had committed a crime. In the first place she had understood him,\nbelieved that he wanted to see her, and desired it herself. Secondly,\nthat other woman, Anna Prokhorova, evidently knew of it.\n\nAbove all, he felt that he was conquered, that he was not master of his\nown will but that there was another power moving him, that he had been\nsaved only by good fortune, and that, if not to-day, to-morrow or a day\nlater, he would perish all the same.\n\n"Yes, perish," he did not understand it otherwise: to be unfaithful to\nhis young and loving wife with a peasant woman in the village, in the\nsight of everyone,--what was it but to perish, perish utterly, so that\nit would be impossible to live? No, something must be done.\n\n"My God, my God! What am I to do? Can it be that I shall perish like\nthis?" said he to himself. "Is it not possible to do anything? Yet\nsomething must be done. Do not think about her"--he ordered himself. "Do\nnot think!" and immediately he began thinking and seeing her before him,\nand seeing also the shade of the plane tree.\n\nHe remembered having read of a hermit who, to avoid the temptation he\nfelt for a woman on whom he had to lay his hand to heal her, thrust his\nother hand into a brazier and burnt his fingers. He called that to mind.\n"Yes, I am ready to burn my fingers rather than to perish." He looked\nround to make sure that there was no one in the room, lit a candle, and\nput a finger into the flame. "There now think about her," he said to\nhimself ironically. It hurt him and he withdrew his smoke-stained\nfinger, threw away the match, and laughed at himself. What nonsense!\nThat was not what had to be done. But it was necessary to do something,\nto avoid seeing her--either to go away himself or to send her away.\nYes,--send her away. Offer her husband money to remove to town, or to\nanother village. People would hear of it and would talk about it. Well,\nwhat of that? At any rate it was better than this danger. "Yes, that\nmust be done," he said to himself; and at the very time he was looking\nat her without moving his eyes. "Where is she going?" he suddenly asked\nhimself. She, as it seemed to him, had seen him at the window and now,\nhaving glanced at him and taken another woman by the hand, was going\ntowards the garden swinging her arm briskly. Without knowing why or\nwherefore, merely in accord with what he had been thinking, he went to\nthe office.\n\nVasili Nikolaich in holiday costume and with oiled hair was sitting at\ntea with his wife and a guest who was wearing an oriental kerchief.\n\n"I want a word with you, Vasili Nikolaich!"\n\n"Please say what you want to. We have finished tea."\n\n"No. I\'d rather you came out with me."\n\n"Directly; only let me get my cap. Tanya, put out the samovar,"--said\nVasili Nikolaich, stepping outside cheerfully.\n\nIt seemed to Eugene that Vasili had been drinking, but what was to be\ndone? It might be all the better--he would sympathize with him in his\ndifficulties the more readily.\n\n"I have come again to speak about that same matter, Vasili Nikolaich,"\nsaid Eugene,--"about that woman."\n\n"Well, what of her? I told them not to take her again on any account."\n\n"No, I have been thinking in general, and this is what I wanted to take\nyour advice about. Isn\'t it possible to get them away, to send the whole\nfamily away?"\n\n"Where can they be sent?" said Vasili, disapprovingly and ironically as\nit seemed to Eugene.\n\n"Well, I thought of giving them money, or even some land in\nKoltovski,--so that she should not be here."\n\n"But how can they be sent away? Where is he to go--torn up from his\nroots? And why should you do it? What harm can she do you?"\n\n"Ah, Vasili Nikolaich, you must understand that it would be dreadful for\nmy wife to hear of it."\n\n"But who will tell her?"\n\n"How can I live with this dread? The whole thing is very painful for\nme."\n\n"But really, why should you distress yourself? Whoever stirs up the\npast--out with his eye! Who is not a sinner before God and to blame\nbefore the Tsar, as the saying is?"\n\n"All the same it would be better to get rid of them. Can\'t you speak to\nthe husband?"\n\n"But it is no use speaking! Eh, Eugene Ivanich, what is the matter with\nyou? It is all past and forgotten. All sorts of things happen. Who is\nthere that would now say anything bad of you? Everybody sees you."\n\n"But all the same go and have a talk with him."\n\n"All right, I will speak to him."\n\nThough he knew that nothing would come of it, this talk somewhat calmed\nEugene. Above all, it made him feel that through excitement he had been\nexaggerating the danger.\n\nHad he gone to meet her by appointment? It was impossible. He had simply\ngone to stroll in the garden and she had happened to run out at the same\ntime.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nAfter dinner that very Trinity Sunday Liza while walking from the garden\nto the meadow, where her husband wanted to show her the clover, took a\nfalse step and fell when crossing a little ditch. She fell gently, on\nher side; but she gave an exclamation, and her husband saw an expression\nin her face not only of fear but of pain. He wished to help her up, but\nshe motioned him away with her hand.\n\n"No, wait a bit, Eugene," she said, with a weak smile, and as it seemed\nto him, she looked up guiltily. "My foot only gave way under me."\n\n"There, I always say," remarked Varvara Alexeevna, "can anyone in her\ncondition possibly jump over ditches?"\n\n"But no, mamma, it is all right. I shall get up directly." With her\nhusband\'s help she did get up, but immediately turned pale, and her face\nshowed fear.\n\n"Yes, I am not well," and she whispered something to her mother.\n\n"Oh, my God, what have you done! I said you ought not to go\nthere,"--cried Varvara Alexeevna. "Wait,--I will call the servants. She\nmust not walk. She must be carried!"\n\n"Don\'t be afraid, Liza, I will carry you," said Eugene, putting his left\narm round her. "Hold me by the neck. Like that." And stooping down he\nput his right arm under her knees and lifted her. He could never\nafterwards forget the suffering and yet beatific expression of her face.\n\n"I am too heavy for you, dear,"--she said with a smile. "Mamma is\nrunning, tell her!" And she bent towards him and kissed him. She\nevidently wanted her mother to see how he was carrying her.\n\nEugene shouted to Varvara Alexeevna not to hurry, and that he would\ncarry Liza home. Varvara Alexeevna stopped and began to shout still\nlouder.\n\n"You will drop her, you\'ll be sure to drop her. You want to destroy her.\nYou have no conscience!"\n\n"But I am carrying her excellently."\n\n"I do not want to watch you killing my daughter, and I can\'t." And she\nran round the bend in the alley.\n\n"Never mind, it will pass," said Liza, smiling.\n\n"Yes. If only it does not have consequences like last time."\n\n"No. I am not speaking of that. That is all right. I mean mamma. You are\ntired. Rest a bit."\n\nBut though he found it heavy, Eugene carried his burden proudly and\ngladly to the house and did not hand her over to the housemaid and the\nman-cook whom Varvara Alexeevna had found and sent to meet them. He\ncarried her to the bedroom and placed her on the bed.\n\n"Now go away," she said and drawing his hand to her she kissed it.\n"Annushka and I will manage all right."\n\nMary Pavlovna also ran in from her rooms in the wing. They undressed\nLiza and laid her on the bed. Eugene sat in the drawing-room with a book\nin his hand, waiting. Varvara Alexeevna went past him with such a\nreproachfully gloomy air that he felt alarmed.\n\n"Well, how is it?" he asked.\n\n"How? What\'s the good of asking? It is probably what you wanted when you\nmade your wife jump over the ditch."\n\n"Varvara Alexeevna!" he cried. "This is impossible. If you want to\ntorment people and to poison their life,"--he wanted to say, "then go\nelsewhere to do it," but he restrained himself. "How is it that it does\nnot hurt you?"\n\n"It is too late now." And shaking her cap in a triumphant manner she\npassed out by the door.\n\nThe fall had really been a bad one, Liza\'s foot had twisted awkwardly\nand there was danger of her having another miscarriage. Everyone knew\nthat there was nothing to be done, but that she must just lie quietly,\nyet all the same they decided to send for a doctor.\n\n"Dear Nikolay Sem\xc3\xabnich," wrote Eugene to the doctor, "you have always\nbeen so kind to us, that I hope you will not refuse to come to my wife\'s\nassistance. She . . ." and so on. Having written the letter he went to\nthe stables to arrange about the horses and the carriage. Horses had to\nbe got ready to bring the doctor, and others to take him back. When an\nestate is not run on a large scale, such things cannot be quickly\ndecided but have to be considered. Having arranged it all and dispatched\nthe coachman, it was past nine before he got back to the house. His wife\nwas lying down, and said that she felt perfectly well and had no pain.\nBut Varvara Alexeevna was sitting with a lamp screened from Liza by some\nsheets of music and knitting a large red coverlet, with a mien that said\nthat after what had happened peace was impossible; but that no matter\nwhat anyone else did, she at any rate would do her duty.\n\nEugene noticed this but, to appear as if he had not seen it, he tried to\nassume a cheerful and tranquil air and told how he had chosen the horses\nand how the mare, Kabushka, had galloped capitally as left trace-horse\nin the troika.\n\n"Yes, of course, it is just the time to exercise the horses when help is\nneeded. Probably the doctor will also be thrown into the ditch,"\nremarked Varvara Alexeevna, examining her knitting from under her\npince-nez and moving it close up to the lamp.\n\n"But you know we had to send one way or other, and I made the best\narrangement I could."\n\n"Yes, I remember very well how your horses galloped with me under the\ngateway arch." This was her long-standing fancy, and Eugene now was\ninjudicious enough to remark that was not quite what had happened.\n\n"It is not for nothing that I have always said, and have often remarked\nto the prince, that it is hardest of all to live with people who are\nuntruthful and insincere; I can endure anything except that."\n\n"Well, if anyone has to suffer more than another, it is certainly I,"\nsaid Eugene. "But you . . ."\n\n"Yes, it is evident."\n\n"What?"\n\n"Nothing, I am only counting my stitches."\n\nEugene was standing at the time by the bed and Liza was looking at him,\nand one of her moist hands outside the coverlet caught his hand and\npressed it. "Bear with her for my sake. You know she cannot prevent our\nloving one another," was what her look said.\n\n"I won\'t do so again. It\'s nothing," whispered he, and he kissed her\ndamp, long hand and then her affectionate eyes, which closed while he\nkissed them.\n\n"Can it be the same thing over again?" he asked. "How are you feeling?"\n\n"I am afraid to say, for fear of being mistaken, but I feel that he is\nalive and will live," said she, glancing at her stomach.\n\n"Ah, it is dreadful, dreadful to think of."\n\nNotwithstanding Liza\'s insistence that he should go away, Eugene spent\nthe night with her, hardly closing an eye and ready to attend on her.\n\nBut she passed the night well, and had they not sent for the doctor she\nwould perhaps have got up.\n\nBy dinner-time the doctor arrived and of course said that, though if the\nsymptoms recurred there might be cause for apprehension, yet actually\nthere were no positive symptoms, but as there were also no contrary\nindications one might suppose on the one hand that--and on the other\nhand that. . . . And therefore she must lie still, and that "though I do\nnot like prescribing, yet all the same she should take this mixture and\nshould lie quiet." Besides this, the doctor gave Varvara Alexeevna a\nlecture on woman\'s anatomy, during which Varvara Alexeevna nodded her\nhead significantly. Having received his fee, as usual into the backmost\npart of his palm, the doctor drove away and the patient was left to lie\nin bed for a week.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nMost of his time Eugene spent by his wife\'s bedside, talking to her,\nreading to her, and what was hardest of all, enduring without murmur\nVarvara Alexeevna\'s attacks, and even contriving to turn these into\njokes.\n\nBut he could not stay at home. In the first place his wife sent him\naway, saying that he would fall ill if he always remained with her; and,\nsecondly, the farming was progressing in a way that demanded his\npresence at every step. He could not stay at home; but was in the\nfields, in the wood, in the garden, at the thrashing-floor; and\neverywhere, not merely the thought but the vivid image of Stepanida\npursued him, and he only occasionally forgot her. But that would not\nhave mattered, he could perhaps have mastered his feeling; but what was\nworst of all was that, whereas he had previously lived for months\nwithout seeing her, he now continually came across her. She evidently\nunderstood that he wished to renew relations with her, and tried to come\nin his way. Nothing was said either by him or by her, and therefore\nneither he nor she went directly to a rendezvous, but only sought\nopportunities of meeting.\n\nThe place where it was possible for them to meet each other was in the\nforest, where peasant-women went with sacks to collect grass for their\ncows. Eugene knew this and therefore went every day by that wood. Every\nday he told himself that he would not go there, and every day it ended\nby his making his way to the forest and, on hearing the sound of voices,\nstanding behind the bushes with sinking heart looking to see if she was\nthere.\n\nWhy he wanted to know whether it was she who was there, he did not know.\nIf it had been she and she had been alone, he would not have gone to\nher--so he believed--he would have run away; but he wanted to see her.\n\nOnce he met her. As he was entering the forest she came out of it with\ntwo other women, carrying a heavy sack, full of grass, on her back. A\nlittle earlier he would perhaps have met her in the forest. But now,\nwith the other women there, she could not go back to him in the forest.\nBut though he realized this impossibility, he stood for a long time, at\nthe risk of attracting the other women\'s attention, behind a hazel-bush.\nOf course she did not return, but he stayed there a long time. And,\ngreat heavens, how delightful his imagination made her appear to him!\nAnd this not once, but five or six times. And each time more intensely.\nNever had she seemed so attractive, and never had he been so completely\nin her power.\n\nHe felt that he had lost control of himself and had become almost\ninsane. His strictness with himself was not weakened a jot; on the\ncontrary he saw all the abomination of his desire and even of his\naction, for his going to the wood was an action. He knew that he only\nneed come near her anywhere in the dark, and if possible touch her, and\nhe would yield to his feelings. He knew that it was only shame before\npeople, before her, and no doubt before himself also, that restrained\nhim. And he knew too that he had sought conditions in which that shame\nwould not be apparent--darkness or proximity--in which it would be\nstifled by animal passion. And therefore he knew that he was a wretched\ncriminal, and despised and hated himself with all his soul. He hated\nhimself because he still had not surrendered: every day he prayed God to\nstrengthen him, to save him from perishing; every day he determined that\nfrom to-day onward he would not take a step to see her, and would forget\nher. Every day he devised means of delivering himself from this\nenticement, and he made use of those means.\n\nBut it was all in vain.\n\nOne of the means was continual occupation; another was intense physical\nwork and fasting; a third was imagining clearly to himself the shame\nthat would fall upon him when everybody knew of it--his wife, his\nmother-in-law, and the folk around. He did all this, and it seemed to\nhim that he was conquering, but the hour came, midday: the hour of their\nformer meetings and the hour when he had met her carrying the grass, and\nhe went to the forest. Thus five days of torment passed. He only saw her\nfrom a distance, but did not once encounter her.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nLiza was gradually recovering, she could move about and was only uneasy\nat the change that had taken place in her husband, which she did not\nunderstand.\n\nVarvara Alexeevna had gone away for a while and the only visitor was\nEugene\'s uncle. Mary Pavlovna was as usual at home.\n\nEugene was in his semi-insane condition when there came two days of\npouring rain, as often happens after thunder in June. The rain stopped\nall work. They even ceased carting manure, on account of the dampness\nand dirt. The peasants remained at home. The herdsmen wore themselves\nout with the cattle, and eventually drove them home. The cows and sheep\nwandered about in the pastureland and ran loose in the grounds. The\npeasant-women, barefoot and wrapped in shawls, splashing through the mud\nrushed about to seek the runaway cows. Streams flowed everywhere along\nthe paths, all the leaves and all the grass were saturated with water,\nand streams flowed unceasingly from the spouts into the bubbling\npuddles.\n\nEugene sat at home with his wife who was particularly wearisome that\nday. She questioned Eugene several times as to the cause of his\ndiscontent; and he replied with vexation that nothing was the matter.\nShe ceased questioning him, but was still distressed.\n\nThey were sitting after breakfast in the drawing-room. His uncle for the\nhundredth time was recounting fabrications about his society\nacquaintances. Liza was knitting a jacket and sighed, complaining of the\nweather and of a pain in the small of her back. The uncle advised her to\nlie down, and asked for vodka for himself. It was terribly dull for\nEugene in the house. Everything was weak and dull. He read a book and a\nmagazine, but understood nothing of them.\n\n"Yes, I must go out and look at the rasping-machine they brought\nyesterday," said he. He got up and went out.\n\n"Take an umbrella with you."\n\n"Oh, no, I have a leather coat. And I am only going as far as the\nboiling-room."\n\nHe put on his boots and his leather coat and went to the factory; but he\nhad not gone twenty steps before, coming towards him, he met her with\nher skirts tucked up high above her white calves. She was walking,\nholding down the shawl in which her head and shoulders were wrapped.\n\n"Where are you going?" said he, not recognizing her the first instant.\nWhen he recognized her it was already too late. She stopped, smiling,\nand looked long at him.\n\n"I am looking for a calf. Where are you off to in such weather?" said\nshe, as if she were seeing him every day.\n\n"Come to the shed," said he suddenly, without knowing how he said it. It\nwas as if someone else had uttered the words.\n\nShe bit her shawl, winked, and ran in the direction which led from the\ngarden to the shed, but he continued his path, intending to turn off\nbeyond the lilac-bush and go there too.\n\n"Master," he heard a voice behind him. "The mistress is calling you, and\nwants you to come back for a minute."\n\nThis was Misha, his man-servant.\n\n"My God! This is the second time you have saved me," thought Eugene, and\nimmediately turned back. His wife reminded him that he had promised to\ntake some medicine at the dinner-hour to a sick woman, and he had better\ntake it with him.\n\nWhile they were getting the medicine some five minutes elapsed, and\nthen, going away with the medicine, he hesitated to go direct to the\nshed, lest he should be seen from the house, but as soon as he was out\nof sight he promptly turned and made his way to it. He already saw her\nin imagination, inside the shed, smiling gaily. But she was not there,\nand there was nothing in the shed to show that she had been there.\n\nHe was already thinking that she had not come, had not heard or\nunderstood his words--he had muttered them through his nose as if afraid\nof her hearing them--or perhaps she had not wanted to come. "And why did\nI imagine that she would rush to me? She has her own husband; it is only\nI who am such a wretch as to have a wife, and a good one, and to run\nafter another." Thus he thought sitting in the shed, the thatch of which\nhad a leak and dripped from its straw. "But how delightful it would be\nif she did come,--alone here in this rain. If only I could embrace her\nonce again; then let happen what may. But yes," he recollected, "one\ncould tell if she has been here by her footprints." He looked at the\ntrodden ground near the shed and at the path overgrown by grass; and the\nfresh print of bare feet, and even of one that had slipped, was visible.\n"Yes, she has been here. Well now it is settled. Wherever I may see her\nI shall go straight to her. I will go to her at night." He sat for a\nlong time in the shed, and left it exhausted and crushed. He delivered\nthe medicine, returned home, and lay down in his room to wait for\ndinner.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nBefore dinner Liza came to him and, still wondering what could be the\ncause of his discontent, began to say that she was afraid that he did\nnot like the idea of her going to Moscow for her confinement, and that\nshe had decided that she would remain at home and would on no account go\nto Moscow. He knew how she feared both her confinement itself and the\nrisk of not having a healthy child, and therefore he could not help\nbeing touched at seeing how ready she was to sacrifice everything for\nhis sake. All was so nice, so pleasant, so clean, in the house; and in\nhis soul it was so dirty, despicable, and horrid. The whole evening\nEugene was tormented by knowing that notwithstanding his sincere\nrepulsion at his own weakness, notwithstanding his firm intention to\nbreak off,--the same thing would happen again to-morrow.\n\n"No, this is impossible," he said to himself, walking up and down in his\nroom. "There must be some remedy for it. My God! What am I to do?"\n\nSomeone knocked at the door as foreigners do. He knew this must be his\nuncle. "Come in," he said.\n\nThe uncle had come as a self-appointed ambassador from Liza.\n\n"Do you know, I really do notice that there is a change in you," he\nsaid,--"and Liza--I understand how it troubles her. I understand that\nit must be hard for you to leave all the business you have so\nexcellently started, but _que veux-tu_?[3] I should advise you to go\naway. It will be more satisfactory both for you and for her. And do you\nknow, I should advise you to go to the Crimea. The climate is beautiful\nand there is an excellent _accoucheur_ there, and you would be just in\ntime for the best of the grape season."\n\n"Uncle," Eugene suddenly exclaimed. "Can you keep a secret? A secret\nthat is terrible to me, a shameful secret."\n\n"Oh, come--do you really feel any doubt of me?"\n\n"Uncle, you can help me. Not only help, but save me!" said Eugene. And\nthe thought that he would disclose his secret to his uncle whom he did\nnot respect, the thought that he would show himself in the worst light\nand humiliate himself before him, was pleasant. He felt himself to be\ndespicable and guilty, and wished to punish himself.\n\n"Speak, my dear fellow, you know how fond I am of you," said the uncle,\nevidently well content that there was a secret and that it was a\nshameful one, and that it would be communicated to him, and that he\ncould be of use.\n\n"First of all I must tell you that I am a wretch, a good-for-nothing, a\nscoundrel--a real scoundrel."\n\n"Now what are you saying . . ." began his uncle, as if he were offended.\n\n"What! Not a wretch when I,--Liza\'s husband, Liza\'s! One has only to\nknow her purity, her love--and that I, her husband, want to be untrue to\nher with a peasant-woman!"\n\n"How\'s that? Why do you want to--you have not been unfaithful to her?"\n\n"Yes, at least just the same as being untrue, for it did not depend on\nme. I was ready to do so. I was hindered, or else I should . . . now. I\ndo not know what I should have done . . ."\n\n"But please, explain to me . . ."\n\n"Well, it is like this. When I was a bachelor I was stupid enough to\nhave relations with a woman here in our village. That is to say, I used\nto have meetings with her in the forest, in the field . . ."\n\n"Was she pretty?" asked his uncle.\n\nEugene frowned at this question, but he was in such need of external\nhelp that he made as if he did not hear it, and continued:\n\n"Well, I thought this was just casual and that I should break it off and\nhave done with it. And I did break it off before my marriage. For nearly\na year I did not see her or think about her." It seemed strange to\nEugene himself to hear the description of his own condition,--"Then\nsuddenly, I don\'t myself know why,--really one sometimes believes in\nwitchcraft--I saw her, and a worm crept into my heart--and it gnaws. I\nreproach myself, I understood the full horror of my action, that is to\nsay, of the act I may commit any moment, and yet I myself turned to it,\nand if I have not committed it is only because God preserved me.\nYesterday I was on my way to see her when Liza sent for me."\n\n"What, in the rain?"\n\n"Yes; I am worn out, Uncle, and have decided to confess to you and to\nask your help."\n\n"Yes, of course, it\'s a bad thing on your own estate. People will get to\nknow. I understand that Liza is weak and that it is necessary to spare\nher, but why on your own estate?"\n\nAgain Eugene tried not to hear what his uncle was saying, and hurried on\nto the core of the matter.\n\n"Yes, save me from myself. That is what I ask of you. To-day I was\nhindered by chance. But to-morrow or next time no one will hinder me.\nAnd she knows now. Don\'t leave me alone."\n\n"Yes, all right," said his uncle,--"but are you really so in love?"\n\n"Ah, it is not that at all. It is not that, it is some kind of power\nthat has seized me and holds me. I do not know what to do. Perhaps I\nshall gain strength, and then . . ."\n\n"Well, it turns out as I suggested," said his uncle. "Let us be off to\nthe Crimea."\n\n"Yes, yes, let us go; and meanwhile you will be with me, and will talk\nto me."\n\n\n[Footnote 3: What will you have?]\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nThe fact that Eugene had confided his secret to his uncle, but chiefly\nthe sufferings of his conscience and the feeling of shame he experienced\nafter that rainy day, sobered him. It was settled that they would start\nfor Yalta in a week\'s time. During that week Eugene drove to town to get\nmoney for the journey, gave instructions from the house and from the\noffice concerning the management of the estate, again became gay and\nfriendly with his wife, and began to awaken morally.\n\nSo without having once seen Stepanida after that rainy day he left with\nhis wife for the Crimea. There he spent an excellent two months. He\nreceived so many new impressions that it seemed to him that the past was\nobliterated from his memory. In the Crimea they met former acquaintances\nand became particularly friendly with them, and they also made new\nacquaintances. Life in the Crimea was a continual holiday for Eugene,\nbesides being instructive and beneficial. They became friendly there\nwith the former Marshal of the Nobility of their province; a clever and\nLiberal-minded man, who became fond of Eugene and coached him, and\nattracted him to his Party.\n\nAt the end of August Liza gave birth to a beautiful, healthy daughter,\nand her confinement was unexpectedly easy.\n\nIn September they returned home, the four of them, including the baby\nand its wet-nurse, as Liza was unable to nurse it herself. Eugene\nreturned home entirely free from the former horrors and quite a new and\nhappy man. Having gone through all that a husband goes through when his\nwife bears a child, he loved his wife more than ever. His feeling for\nthe child when he took it in his arms, was a funny, new, very pleasant\nand, as it were, a tickling feeling. Another new thing in his life now\nwas that, besides his occupation with the estate, thanks to his\nacquaintance with Dumchin (the ex-Marshal) a new interest occupied his\nmind, that of the Zemstvo--partly an ambitious interest, partly a\nfeeling of duty. In October there was to be a special Assembly, at which\nhe was to be elected. After arriving home he drove once to town and\nanother time to Dumchin.\n\nOf the torments of his temptation and struggle he had forgotten even to\nthink, and could with difficulty recall them to mind. It seemed to him\nsomething like an attack of insanity he had undergone.\n\nTo such an extent did he now feel free from it that he was not even\nafraid to make inquiries on the first occasion when he remained alone\nwith the steward. As he had previously spoken to him about the matter he\nwas not ashamed to ask.\n\n"Well, and is Sidor Pechnikov still away from home?" he inquired.\n\n"Yes, he is still in town."\n\n"And his wife?"\n\n"Oh, she is a worthless woman. She is now carrying on with Zenovi. She\nhas quite gone on the loose."\n\n"Well, that is all right," thought Eugene. "How wonderfully indifferent\nto it I am! How I have changed."\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nAll that Eugene had wished had been realized. He had obtained the\nproperty, the factory was working successfully, the beet-crops were\nexcellent, and his expected income would be a large one; his wife had\nborne a child satisfactorily, his mother-in-law had left, and he had\nbeen unanimously elected to the Zemstvo.\n\nEugene was returning home from town after the election. He had been\ncongratulated and had had to return thanks. He had had dinner and had\ndrunk some five glasses of champagne. Quite new plans of life now\npresented themselves to him. He was driving home and thinking about\nthese. It was the Indian summer: an excellent road and a hot sun. As he\napproached his home Eugene was thinking of how, as a result of this\nelection, he would occupy among the people the position of which he had\nalways dreamed; that is to say, one in which he would be able to serve\nthem not only by production, which gave employment, but also by direct\ninfluence. He imagined how in another three years his own and the other\npeasants would think of him. "For instance this one," he thought,\ndriving just then through the village and glancing at a peasant who with\na peasant-woman was crossing the street in front of him carrying a full\nwater-tub. They stopped to let his carriage pass. The peasant was old\nPechnikov, and the woman was Stepanida. Eugene looked at her, recognized\nher, and was glad to feel that he remained quite tranquil. She was still\nas good-looking as ever, but this did not touch him at all. He drove\nhome.\n\n"Well, may we congratulate you?" said his uncle.\n\n"Yes, I was elected."\n\n"Capital! We must drink to it!"\n\nNext day Eugene drove about to see to the farming which he had been\nneglecting. At the outlying farmstead a new thrashing machine was at\nwork. While watching it Eugene stepped among the women, trying not to\ntake notice of them; but try as he would he once or twice noticed the\nblack eyes and red kerchief of Stepanida, who was carrying away the\nstraw. Once or twice he glanced sideways at her and felt that something\nwas happening, but could not account for it to himself. Only next day,\nwhen he again drove to the thrashing-floor and spent two hours there\nquite unnecessarily, without ceasing to caress with his eyes the\nfamiliar, handsome figure of the young woman, did he feel that he was\nlost, irremediably lost. Again those torments! Again all that horror and\nfear, and there was no saving himself.\n\n\nWhat he expected happened to him. The evening of the next day, without\nknowing how, he found himself at her back-yard, by her hay-shed, where\nin autumn they had once had a meeting. As though having a stroll, he\nstopped there lighting a cigarette. A neighbouring peasant-woman saw\nhim, and as he turned back he heard her say to someone: "Go, he is\nwaiting for you,--on my dying word he is standing there. Go, you fool!"\n\nHe saw how a woman--she--ran to the hay-shed; but as a peasant had met\nhim, it was no longer possible for him to turn back, and so he went\nhome.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nWhen he entered the drawing-room everything seemed strange and unnatural\nto him. He had risen that morning vigorous, determined to fling it all\naside, to forget it and not to allow himself to think about it. But\nwithout noticing how it occurred he had all the morning not merely not\ninterested himself in the work, but tried to avoid it. What had formerly\nbeen important and had cheered him, was now insignificant. Unconsciously\nhe tried to free himself from business. It seemed to him that he had to\ndo so in order to think and to plan. And he freed himself and remained\nalone. But as soon as he was alone he began to wander about in the\ngarden and the forest. And all those spots were besmirched in his\nrecollection by memories that gripped him. He felt that he was walking\nin the garden and pretending to himself that he was thinking out\nsomething, but that really he was not thinking out anything, but\ninsanely and unreasonably expecting her; expecting that by some miracle\nshe would be aware that he was expecting her, and would come here at\nonce and go somewhere where no one would see them, or would come at\nnight when there would be no moon and no one, not even she herself,\nwould see,--on such a night she would come and he would touch her\nbody. . . .\n\n"There now, talking of breaking off when I wish to," said he to himself.\n"Yes, and that is having a clean healthy woman for one\'s health\'s sake!\nNo, it seems one can\'t play with her like that. I thought I had taken\nher, but it was she who took me; took me and does not let me go. Why, I\nthought I was free, but I was not free and was deceiving myself when I\nmarried. It was all nonsense,--fraud. From the time I had her I\nexperienced a new feeling, the real feeling of a husband. Yes, I ought\nto have lived with her.\n\n"One of two lives is possible for me: that which I began with Liza:\nservice, estate management, the child, and people\'s respect. If that is\nlife, it is necessary that she, Stepanida, should not be there. She must\nbe sent away, as I said, or destroyed so that she shall not exist. And\nthe other life--is this. For me to take her away from her husband, pay\nhim money, disregard the shame and disgrace, and live with her. But in\nthat case it is necessary that Liza should not exist, nor Mimi (the\nbaby). No, that is not so, the baby does not matter, but it is necessary\nthat there should be no Liza,--that she should go away--that she should\nknow, curse me, and go away. That she should know that I have exchanged\nher for a peasant-woman, that I am a deceiver and a scoundrel!--No, that\nis too terrible! It is impossible. But it might happen," he went on\nthinking,--"it might happen that Liza might fall ill and die. Die, and\nthen everything would be capital.\n\n"Capital! Oh, scoundrel! No, if someone must die it should be she. If\nshe, Stepanida, were to die, how good it would be.\n\n"Yes, that is how men come to poison or kill their wives or lovers. Take\na revolver and go and call her, and instead of embracing her, shoot her\nin the breast and have done with it.\n\n"Really she is--a devil. Simply a devil. She has possessed herself of me\nagainst my own will.\n\n"Kill? Yes. There are only two ways out: to kill my wife, or her. For it\nis impossible to live like this.[4] It is impossible. I must consider\nthe matter and look ahead. If things remain as they are what will\nhappen? I shall again be saying to myself that I do not wish it and that\nI will throw her off, but I shall only say it, and in the evening I\nshall be at her back-yard,--and she will know it and will come out. And\nif people know of it and tell my wife, or if I tell her myself,--for I\ncan\'t lie--I shall not be able to live so. I cannot! People will know.\nThey will all know--Parasha and the blacksmith. Well, is it possible to\nlive so?"\n\n[Footnote 4: At this place the alternative ending, printed at the end of\nthe story, begins.]\n\n"Impossible. There are only two ways out: to kill my wife, or to kill\nher. Yes, or else . . . Ah, yes, there is a third way: to kill myself,"\nsaid he softly, and suddenly a shudder ran over his skin. "Yes, kill\nmyself, then I shall not need to kill them." He became frightened, for\nhe felt that only that way was possible. He had a revolver. "Shall I\nreally kill myself? It is something I never thought of,--how strange it\nwill be . . ."\n\nHe returned to his study and at once opened the cupboard where the\nrevolver lay, but before he had taken it out of its case, his wife\nentered the room.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nHe threw a newspaper over the revolver.\n\n"Again the same!" said she aghast when she had looked at him.\n\n"What is the same?"\n\n"The same terrible expression that you had before and would not explain\nto me. Jenya, dear one, tell me about it. I see that you are suffering.\nTell me and you will feel easier. Whatever it may be, it will be better\nthan for you to suffer so. Don\'t I know that it is nothing bad."\n\n"You know? While . . ."\n\n"Tell me, tell me, tell me. I won\'t let you go."\n\nHe smiled a piteous smile.\n\n"Shall I?--No, it is impossible. And there is nothing to tell."\n\nPerhaps he might have told her, but at that moment the wet-nurse entered\nto ask if she should go for a walk. Liza went out to dress the baby.\n\n"Then you will tell me? I will be back directly."\n\n"Yes, perhaps . . ."\n\nShe never could forget the piteous smile with which he said this. She\nwent out.\n\nHurriedly, stealthily like a robber, he seized the revolver and took it\nout of its case. It was loaded, yes, but long ago, and one cartridge was\nmissing.\n\n"Well, how will it be?" He put it to his temple and hesitated a little,\nbut as soon as he remembered Stepanida,--his decision not to see her,\nhis struggle, temptation, fall, and renewed struggle,--he shuddered with\nhorror. "No, this is better," and he pulled the trigger . . .\n\nWhen Liza ran into the room--she had only had time to step down from the\nbalcony--he was lying face downwards on the floor: black, warm blood was\ngushing from the wound, and his corpse was twitching.\n\nThere was an inquest. No one could understand or explain the suicide. It\nnever even entered his uncle\'s head that its cause could be anything in\ncommon with the confession Eugene had made to him two months previously.\n\nVarvara Alexeevna assured them that she had always foreseen it. It had\nbeen evident from his way of disputing. Neither Liza nor Mary Pavlovna\ncould at all understand why it had happened, but still they did not\nbelieve what the doctors said, namely, that he was mentally deranged--a\npsychopath. They were quite unable to accept this, for they knew he was\nsaner than hundreds of their acquaintances.\n\nAnd indeed if Eugene Irtenev was mentally deranged everyone is similarly\ninsane; the most mentally deranged people are certainly those who see in\nothers indications of insanity they do not notice in themselves.\n\n\n\n\nVARIATION OF THE CONCLUSION OF\n_THE DEVIL_\n\n\n"To kill, yes. There were only two ways out: to kill his wife, or to\nkill her. For it is impossible to live like this," said he to himself,\nand going up to the table he took from it a revolver which, having\nexamined--one cartridge was wanting--he put in his trouser pocket.\n\n"My God! What am I doing?" he suddenly exclaimed, and folding his hands\nhe began to pray.\n\n"Oh, God, help me and deliver me. Thou knowest that I do not desire\nevil, but by myself am powerless. Help me," said he, making the sign of\nthe cross on his breast before the icon.\n\n"Yes, I can control myself. I will go out, walk about and think things\nover."\n\nHe went to the entrance-hall, put on his overcoat and went out on to the\nporch. Unconsciously his steps took him past the garden along the field\npath to the outlying farmstead. There the thrashing machine was still\ndroning and the cries of the driver-lads were heard. He entered the\nbarn. She was there. He saw her at once. She was raking up the corn, and\non seeing him she, with laughing eyes, ran briskly and merrily over the\nscattered corn, raking it up with agility. Eugene could not help\nwatching her though he did not wish it. He only recollected himself when\nshe was no longer in sight. The clerk informed him that they were now\nfinishing thrashing the corn that had been beaten down--that was why it\nwas going slower and the output was less. Eugene went up to the drum,\nwhich occasionally gave a knock as sheaves not evenly fed in passed\nunder it, and he asked the clerk if there were many such sheaves of\nbeaten-down corn.\n\n"There will be five cartloads of it."\n\n"Then look here . . ." began Eugene, but he did not finish the sentence.\nShe had gone close up to the drum and was raking the corn from under it,\nand she scorched him with her laughing eyes. That look spoke of a merry\ncareless love between them, of the fact that she knew he wanted her and\nhad come to her shed, and that she, as always, was ready to live and be\nmerry with him regardless of all conditions or consequences. Eugene felt\nhimself to be in her power, but did not wish to yield.\n\nHe remembered his prayer and tried to repeat it. He began saying it to\nhimself, but at once felt that it was useless. A single thought now\nengrossed him entirely: how to arrange a meeting with her so that the\nothers should not notice it.\n\n"If we finish this lot to-day, are we to start on a fresh stack or leave\nit till to-morrow?" asked the clerk.\n\n"Yes, yes," replied Eugene, involuntarily following her to the heap to\nwhich with the other women she was raking the corn.\n\n"But can I really not master myself?" said he to himself. "Have I really\nperished? Oh, God! But there is no God. There is only a devil. And it is\nshe. She has possessed me. But I won\'t, I won\'t! A devil, yes, a devil."\n\nAgain he went up to her, drew the revolver from his pocket and shot her,\nonce, twice, thrice, in the back. She ran a few steps and fell on the\nheap of corn.\n\n"Good Lord, oh dear! What is that?" cried the women.\n\n"No, it was not an accident. I killed her on purpose," cried Eugene.\n"Send for the police-officer."\n\nHe went home and, without speaking to his wife, went to his study and\nlocked himself in.\n\n"Do not come to me," he cried to his wife through the door. "You will\nknow all about it."\n\nAn hour later he rang, and bade the man-servant who answered the bell:\n"Go and find out whether Stepanida is alive."\n\nThe servant already knew all about it, and told him she had died an hour\nago.\n\n"Well, all right. Now leave me alone,--when the police-officer or the\nmagistrate comes, let me know."\n\nThe police-officer and magistrate arrived next morning, and Eugene,\nhaving bidden his wife and the baby farewell, was taken to prison.\n\nHe was tried. It was during the early days of trial by jury;[5] and the\nverdict was one of temporary insanity, and he was sentenced only to\nperform church penance.\n\nHe had been kept in prison for nine months and was then confined in a\nmonastery for one month.\n\n\n[Footnote 5: Trial by jury was introduced in 1864, and at first the\njuries were inclined to be extremely lenient to the prisoners.]\n'b'\n\n\n\nTHE DEVIL\n\n\nBY\n\n\nLEO TOLSTOY\n\n\n\n\n_Translated by_\n\nAYLMER MAUDE\n\n\n\n\nLONDON: GEORGE ALLEN & UNWIN LTD.\nRUSKIN HOUSE, 40 MUSEUM STREET, W.C.1\n\n\n\n\nFirst published in 1926.\n\n\n\n\nBut I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after\nher hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.\n\nAnd if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it\nfrom thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should\nperish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.\n\nAnd if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it\nfrom thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should\nperish, and not thy whole body go into hell.\n\n\n                               MATTHEW V. 28, 29, 30.\n\n\n\n\nLIST OF RUSSIAN NAMES\n\n_With stress-accents marked to show which syllable should be\nemphasized._\n\nD\xc3\xb3mna, a cook in Tolstoy\'s house.\nLeo Tolst\xc3\xb3y, the author.\nY\xc3\xa1snaya Poly\xc3\xa1na, his estate.\n\nAnna Pr\xc3\xb3khorova, a peasant woman.\n\xc3\x81nnushka, a servant.\nDesyat\xc3\xadna, a land measure, about 2\xc2\xb77 acres.\nD\xc3\xbamchin, an ex-Marshal of the Nobility.\nEugene Iv\xc3\xa1nich Irt\xc3\xa9nev (J\xc3\xa9nya), a landed-proprietor.\nF\xc3\xabdor Zakh\xc3\xa1rich Pry\xc3\xa1nishnikov, a gentleman.\nIv\xc3\xa1n (V\xc3\xa1nya), a clerk.\nKab\xc3\xbashka, a mare.\nKal\xc3\xa9riya Vlad\xc3\xadmirovna Es\xc3\xadpova, a lady.\nKolt\xc3\xb3vski, an estate.\nLiza \xc3\x81nnenskaya, Eugene\'s wife.\nMary P\xc3\xa1vlovna Irt\xc3\xa9nyeva, Eugene\'s mother.\nMatv\xc3\xa9y, a peasant.\nMisha, a man-servant.\nNicholas Lys\xc3\xbakh, a servant.\nNikol\xc3\xa1y Sem\xc3\xabnich, a doctor.\nPar\xc3\xa1sha, a servant.\nSam\xc3\xb3khin, a labourer.\nSem\xc3\xabnovskoe, a village.\nS\xc3\xaddor P\xc3\xa9chnikov, a peasant.\nStepan\xc3\xadda P\xc3\xa9chnikova, S\xc3\xaddor\'s wife.\nT\xc3\xa1nya, a girl.\nVar\xc3\xa1ra Alex\xc3\xa9evna \xc3\x81nnenskaya, Liza\'s mother.\nVas\xc3\xadli Nikol\xc3\xa1ich, a steward.\nV\xc3\xa1sin, a peasant.\nY\xc3\xa1lta, a town in the Crimea.\nZ\xc3\xa9mstvo, a Local Government institution.\nZen\xc3\xb3vi, a peasant.\n\n                \xc3\xab is pronounced as _yo_.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\nPREFACE\nCHAPTER I\nCHAPTER II\nCHAPTER III\nCHAPTER IV\nCHAPTER V\nCHAPTER VI\nCHAPTER VII\nCHAPTER VIII\nCHAPTER IX\nCHAPTER X\nCHAPTER XI\nCHAPTER XII\nCHAPTER XIII\nCHAPTER XIV\nCHAPTER XV\nCHAPTER XVI\nCHAPTER XVII\nCHAPTER XVIII\nCHAPTER XIX\nCHAPTER XX\nCHAPTER XXI\nVARIATION OF THE CONCLUSION OF _THE DEVIL_\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nTowards the end of 1880, when he was fifty-two, Tolstoy one day\napproached the young tutor who lived in his house at Yasnaya Polyana,\nand in great agitation asked him to do him a service. The tutor, seeing\nTolstoy so moved, asked what he could possibly do for him. In an unready\nvoice Tolstoy replied: "Save me, I am falling!" The tutor, in alarm,\ninquired what was the matter, to which Tolstoy replied: "I am overcome\nby sexual desire and feel a complete lack of power to retrain myself. I\nam in danger of yielding to the temptation. Help me!"\n\n"I am a weak man myself," replied the tutor. "How can I help you?"\n\n"You can, if only you won\'t refuse!"\n\n"But what must I do to help you?"\n\n"This! Come with me on my daily walks. We will go out together and talk,\nand the temptation will not occur to me."\n\nThey set out together, and Tolstoy told the tutor how during his daily\nwalks he had encountered Domna, a young woman of twenty-two who had\nrecently been engaged as the servants\' cook. This Domna was a tall,\nhealthy, attractive young woman with a fine figure and beautiful\ncomplexion, though not otherwise particularly handsome. At first for\nsome days he had found it pleasant to watch her. Then he had followed\nher and whittled to her. After that he had walked and talked with her,\nand at last had arranged a rendezvous with her. The spot was in a\ndistant alley on the estate; to reach it from the house one had to pass\nthe windows of the children\'s schoolroom. When setting out past those\nwindows next day to keep the appointment, he had gone through a terrible\nstruggle between the temptation and his conscience. Just then his second\nson had called to him through the window, reminding him of a Greek\nlesson that had been fixed for that day, and this had detained Tolstoy.\nHe woke as it were, and was glad to have been saved from keeping the\nappointment. But the temptation still tormented him. He tried the effect\nof prayer, but it did not free him. He suffered but felt powerless and\nas if he might yield at any moment. So as a last resource he resolved to\ntry the effect of making a full confession to someone--giving all\nparticulars of the strength of the temptation that oppressed him and of\nhis own weakness. He wished to feel as thoroughly ashamed of himself as\npossible, and he had decided to ask the tutor to accompany him on his\ndaily walk, which usually he took alone. He also arranged that Domna\nshould be removed to another place.\n\nAfter the danger was over Tolstoy seldom referred to the incident unless\nto those who spoke to him of their own sexual difficulties, but on one\noccasion he wrote a full account of it to a friend.\n\nThe incident resulted in his writing this story, _The Devil_--the hero\nof which yields to a temptation such as that Tolstoy had encountered. It\nwas composed some ten years later, but was not published during\nTolstoy\'s lifetime; nor did it appear in the English edition of his\nposthumous works issued by Nelson & Sons. It is now translated into\nEnglish for the first time. Tolstoy had vividly imagined the\nconsequences that might have resulted from yielding to the temptation,\nand used that mental experience for his story, employing fictitious\ncharacters placed in surroundings with which he was familiar and such as\nthose amid which the incident had occurred.\n\nThe relations of the sexes in Russian society of his day resembled that\nin English society to-day more than in English society of that\nperiod--when, both in literature and in life, repression and suppression\nof passion was more common. When in _Kreutzer Sonata_ and in _The Devil_\nhe expressed the views he held, Tolstoy was consciously opposing the\ncurrent of life around him, and these works also run counter to the\nmovement of our own society to-day. That however does not detract from\nthe value of the work. The belief that ill-results follow from the\nindulgence of the sexual instincts is not an obsolete eccentricity but a\nbelief held by many men in many ages, and it receives sufficient\nconfirmation from experience to make it certain that it is a view which\nhas to be reckoned with.\n\nThe ancient conception of a bitter strife between the flesh and the\nspirit and of woman as the devil\'s chief agent in achieving man\'s\nspiritual destruction, is alien to the modern outlook, and to-day it is\noften not understood how and why men ever held such beliefs; but both in\n_The Kreutzer Sonata_ and in this story Tolstoy makes us realize how\neasily and naturally men of a certain temperament may come to those\nconvictions. Without adopting that view one is enabled to realize what\nothers have felt, and to perceive how probable is a reaction from the\nunrestraint of to-day; as happened after the libertinage of the\nRestoration period.\n\nI do not think there is any other important story of Tolstoy\'s that has\nnot yet been translated. He left several trunks full of manuscripts,\nchiefly early drafts of works that had been published during his\nlifetime or commencements of stories he abandoned; but before his death\nhe expressed the opinion that, except some passages in his Diaries,\nthere was little or nothing worth publishing among those remains. He was\nindeed a great artist, and his mastery showed itself in knowing what to\nstrike out, omit, and withhold. His published writings are voluminous,\nbut among them there is little (except perhaps some of the later\nrepetitions of his non-resistance doctrine) that we could willingly\nspare. But if the mass of documents which while he lived he had the good\nsense to suppress are now to be published, together with a large amount\nof didactic correspondence, it is likely to injure rather than to\nenhance his literary reputation. There is a disquieting rumour that this\nis to take place, in the form of an edition of his works extending to\none hundred volumes. Not even that calamity will depose him from the\nplace he securely holds as the greatest and most influential of Russian\nwriters, but it will be an obstacle rather than a help to those who want\nto become acquainted with the works on which he wished his reputation to\nrest. The present story is an exception. It is so characteristic of him,\nand so closely connected with an event that influenced him, that it\nwould be a pity for it not to be known, especially as it is one of the\nfew posthumous works he left in a completed state; even in this case we\ndo not know which of the two endings he wrote he would have adopted had\nhe published it himself.\n\nThe foot-notes are by the translator.\n\n                         AYLMER MAUDE\n\nGREAT BADDOW, CHELMSFORD\n\n_September_ 12, 1925.\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEVIL\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nA brilliant career lay before Eugene Irtenev. He had all that was\nnecessary for this: an admirable education at home, high honours when he\ngraduated in law at Petersburg University, connections in the highest\nsociety through his recently deceased father, and he had himself already\nbegun service in one of the Ministries under the protection of the\nMinister. He also had a fortune; even a large one, though insecure. His\nfather had lived abroad and in Petersburg, allowing his sons, Eugene,\nand Andrew, the elder who was in the Horse Guards, 6,000 rubles a year\neach, while he himself and his wife spent a great deal. He only used to\nvisit his estate for a couple of months in summer and did not concern\nhimself with its direction, entrusting it all to an unscrupulous manager\nwho also failed to attend to it, but in whom he had complete confidence.\n\nAfter the father\'s death, when the brothers began to divide the\nproperty, there were found to be so many debts that their lawyer even\nadvised them to refuse the inheritance and retain only an estate left\nthem by their grand-mother, which was valued at 100,000 rubles. But a\nneighbouring landed-proprietor who had done business with old Irtenev,\nthat is to say, who had promissory notes from him and had come to\nPetersburg on that account, said that in spite of the debts they could\nstraighten out affairs so as to retain a large fortune--it would only be\nnecessary to sell the forest and some outlying land, retaining the rich\nSem\xc3\xabnov estate with 4,000 desyatinas of black-earth, the sugar-factory,\nand 200 desyatinas of water-meadows--if one devoted oneself to the\nmanagement and, settling on the estate, farmed it wisely and\neconomically.\n\nAnd so, having visited the estate in spring (his father had died in\nLent), Eugene looked into everything, resolved to retire from the Civil\nService, settle in the country with his mother, and undertake the\nmanagement, with the object of preserving the main estate. He arranged\nwith his brother, with whom he was very friendly, that he would pay him\n4,000 rubles a year, or alternatively would pay him 80,000 in a lump\nsum, while Andrew, on his part, handed over to him his share of the\ninheritance.\n\nSo he arranged matters and, having settled down with his mother in the\nbig house, ardently and yet cautiously began managing the estate.\n\nIt is generally supposed that Conservatives are usually old people, and\nthose in favour of change are the young. That is not quite correct. The\nmost usual Conservatives are young people: those who want to live but\nwho do not think, and have not time to think, about how to live and who\ntherefore take as a model for themselves a way of life that they have\nseen.\n\nThus it was with Eugene. Having settled in the village, his aim and\nideal was to restore the form of life that had existed, not in his\nfather\'s time--his father had been a bad manager--but in his\ngrandfather\'s. And now in the house, the garden, in the\nestate-management--of course with changes suited to the times--he tried\nto resurrect the general spirit of his grandfather\'s life--everything on\na large scale--good order, method, and everybody satisfied; but so to\narrange things entailed much work. It was necessary to meet the demands\nof the creditors and the banks, and for that purpose to sell some land\nand arrange renewals of credit. It was also necessary to get money to\ncarry on (partly by farming out land, and partly by hiring labour) the\nimmense operations on the Sem\xc3\xabnov estate, with its 400 desyatinas of\nploughland and its sugar-factory, and to deal with the garden so that it\nshould not seem to be neglected or in decay.\n\nThere was much work to do, but Eugene had plenty of strength--physical\nand mental. He was twenty-six, of medium height, strongly built, with\nmuscles developed by gymnastics. He was full-blooded and very red over\nhis whole neck, with bright teeth and lips and hair soft and curly,\nthough not thick. His only physical defect was shortsightedness, which\nhe had himself developed by using spectacles, so that he could not now\ndo without a pince-nez, which had already formed a line at the top of\nhis nose-ridge.\n\nSuch he was physically. For his spiritual portrait it might be said that\nthe better anyone knew him the better they liked him. His mother had\nalways loved him more than she loved anyone else; and now, after her\nhusband\'s death, she concentrated on him not only her whole affection\nbut her whole life. Nor was it only his mother who so loved him. All his\ncomrades at the high-school and the university not merely liked him very\nmuch, but respected him. He had this effect on all who met him. It was\nimpossible not to believe what he said, impossible to suspect any\ndeception or falseness in one who had such an open, honest face and, in\nparticular, such eyes.\n\nIn general his personality helped him much in his affairs. A creditor\nwho would have refused another, trusted him. The clerk, the village\nElder, or a peasant, who would have played a dirty trick and cheated\nsomeone else, forgot to deceive under the pleasant impression of\nintercourse with this kindly, agreeable, and above all candid man.\n\nIt was the end of May. Eugene had somehow managed, in town, to get the\nvacant land freed from the mortgage, so as to sell it to a merchant, and\nhad borrowed money from that same merchant to replenish his stock, that\nis to say, to procure horses, bulls, carts and, chiefly, to begin to\nbuild a necessary farm-house. The matter had been arranged. The timber\nwas being carted, the carpenters were already at work, and manure for\nthe estate was being brought on eighty carts. But everything still hung\nby a thread.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nAmid these cares something came about which, though unimportant,\ntormented Eugene at the time. As a young man he had lived as all healthy\nyoung men live, that is, he had had relations with women of various\nkinds. He was not a libertine but, as he himself said, neither was he a\nmonk. He only turned to this, however, in so far as was necessary for\nphysical health and to have his mind free, as he used to say. This had\nbegun when he was sixteen and had gone on satisfactorily. Satisfactorily\nin the sense that he did not give himself up to debauchery, was not once\ninfatuated, and had never contracted a disease. At first he had a\nseamstress in Petersburg, then she got spoilt and he made other\narrangements, and that side of his affairs was so well secured that it\ndid not trouble him.\n\nBut now he was living in the country for the second month and did not at\nall know what he was to do. Compulsory self-restraint was beginning to\nhave a bad effect on him.\n\nMust he really go to town for that purpose? And where to? How? That was\nthe only thing that disturbed Eugene Ivanich, but as he was convinced\nthat the thing was necessary and that he needed it, it really became\nnecessary, and he felt that he was not free and that involuntarily his\neyes followed every young woman.\n\nHe did not approve of having relations with a married woman or a maid in\nhis own village. He knew by report that both his father and grandfather\nhad been quite different in this matter from other land-owners of that\ntime. At home they had never had any entanglements with peasant-women,\nand he had decided that he would not do so either; but afterwards,\nfeeling himself ever more and more under compulsion, and imagining with\nhorror what might happen to him in the neighbouring country town, and\nreflecting on the fact that the days of serfdom were now over, he\ndecided that it might be done on the spot. Only it must be done so that\nno one should know of it, and not for the sake of debauchery but merely\nfor health\'s sake--as he said to himself. And when he had decided this\nhe became still more restless. When talking to the village Elder, the\npeasants, or the carpenters, he involuntarily brought the conversation\nround to women, and when it turned to women, he kept it on that theme.\nHe noticed the women more and more.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nTo settle the matter in his own mind was one thing, but to carry it out\nwas another. To approach a woman himself was impossible. Which one?\nWhere? It must be done through someone else, but to whom should he speak\nabout it?\n\nHe happened to go into a watchman\'s hut in the forest to get a drink of\nwater. The watchman had been his father\'s huntsman. Eugene Ivanich\nchatted with him, and the watchman began telling some strange tales of\nhunting sprees. It occurred to Eugene Ivanich that it would be\nconvenient to arrange matters in this hut, or in the wood. Only he did\nnot know how to manage it, and whether old Daniel would undertake the\narrangement. "Perhaps he will be horrified at such a proposal; and I\nshall have disgraced myself, but perhaps he would agree to it quite\nsimply." So he thought while listening to Daniel\'s stories. Daniel was\ntelling how once when they had been stopping at the hut of the sexton\'s\nwife in an outlying field, he had brought a woman for F\xc3\xabdor Zakharich\nPryanishnikov.\n\n"It will be all right," thought Eugene.\n\n"Your father, may the kingdom of heaven be his, did not go in for\nnonsense of that kind."\n\n"It won\'t do," thought Eugene. But to test the matter he said: "How was\nit you engaged on such bad things?"\n\n"But what is there bad in it? She was glad of it, and F\xc3\xabdor Zakharich\nwas satisfied, very satisfied. I got a ruble. Why, what was he to do? He\ntoo is a lively limb, apparently, and drinks wine."\n\n"Yes, I may speak," thought Eugene, and at once proceeded to do so.\n\n"And, do you know, Daniel, I don\'t know how to endure it,"--he felt\nhimself going scarlet.\n\nDaniel smiled.\n\n"I am not a monk,--I have been accustomed to it."\n\nHe felt that what he was saying was stupid, but was glad to see that\nDaniel approved.\n\n"Why of course, you should have told me long ago. It can all be\narranged," said he: "Only tell me which one you want."\n\n"Oh, it is really all the same to me. Of course not an ugly one, and she\nmust be healthy."\n\n"I understand!" said Daniel briefly. He reflected.\n\n"Ah! There is a tasty morsel," he began. Again Eugene went red. "A tasty\nmorsel. See here, she was married last autumn." Daniel whispered,--"and\nhe hasn\'t been able to do anything. Think what that is worth to one who\nwants it!"\n\nEugene even frowned with shame.\n\n"No, no," he said. "I don\'t want that at all. I want, on the contrary\n(what could the contrary be?), on the contrary I only want that she\nshould be healthy and that there should be as little fuss as possible--a\nwoman whose husband is away in the army, or something of that kind."\n\n"I know. It\'s Stepanida I must bring you. Her husband is away in town,\njust the same as a soldier. And she is a fine woman, and clean. You will\nbe satisfied. As it is I was saying to her the other day--you should go,\nbut she . . ."\n\n"Well then, when is it to be?"\n\n"To-morrow if you like. I shall be going to get some tobacco and I will\ncall in, and at the dinner-hour come here, or to the bath-house behind\nthe kitchen garden. There will be nobody about. Besides after dinner\neverybody takes a nap."\n\n"All right, then."\n\nA terrible excitement seized Eugene as he rode home. "What will happen?\nWhat is a peasant woman like? Suppose it turns out that she is hideous,\nhorrible. No, she is handsome," he told himself, remembering some he had\nbeen noticing. "But what shall I say? What shall I do?"\n\nHe was not himself all that day. Next day at noon he went to the\nforester\'s hut. Daniel stood at the door and silently and significantly\nnodded towards the wood. The blood rushed to Eugene\'s heart, he was\nconscious of it and went to the kitchen-garden. No one was there. He\nwent to the bath-house--there was no one about, he looked in, came out,\nand suddenly heard the crackling of a breaking twig. He looked\nround--and she was standing in the thicket beyond the little ravine. He\nrushed there across the ravine. There were nettles in it which he had\nnot noticed. They stung him and, losing the pince-nez from his nose, he\nran up the slope on the farther side. In a white embroidered apron, in a\nred-brown skirt and a bright red kerchief, barefoot, fresh, firm, and\nhandsome, she stood shyly smiling.\n\n"There is a path leading round,--you should have gone round," she said.\n"I came long ago, ever so long."\n\nHe went up to her and, looking her over, touched her.\n\nA quarter of an hour later they separated; he found his pince-nez,\ncalled in to see Daniel, and in reply to his question: "Are you\nsatisfied, master?" gave him a ruble and went home.\n\nHe was satisfied. Only at first had he felt ashamed, then it had passed\noff. And it had all gone well. The best thing was that he now felt at\nease, tranquil and vigorous. As for her, he had not even seen her\nthoroughly. He remembered that she was clean, fresh, not bad-looking,\nand simple, without any pretence. "Whose wife is she?" said he to\nhimself. "Pechnikov\'s, Daniel said. What Pechnikov is that? There are\ntwo households of that name. Probably she is old Michael\'s\ndaughter-in-law. Yes, that must be it. His son does live in Moscow. I\'ll\nask Daniel about it some time."\n\nFrom then onward that previously important drawback to country\nlife--enforced self-restraint--was eliminated. Eugene\'s freedom of mind\nwas no longer disturbed and he was able to attend freely to his affairs.\n\nAnd the matter Eugene had undertaken was far from easy: it sometimes\nseemed to him that he would not be able to go through with it, and that\nit would end in his having to sell the estate after all, so that all his\nefforts would be wasted and it would turn out that he had failed, and\nbeen unable to accomplish what he had undertaken. That prospect\ndisturbed him most of all. Before he had time to stop up one hole a new\none would unexpectedly show itself.\n\nAll this time more and more debts of his father\'s, which he had not\nexpected, came to light. It was evident that his father had latterly\nborrowed right and left. At the time of the settlement in May, Eugene\nhad thought he at last knew everything, but suddenly, in the middle of\nthe summer, he received a letter from which it appeared that there was\nstill a debt of 12,000 rubles to the widow Esipova. There was no\npromissory note, but only an ordinary receipt, which his lawyer told him\ncould be disputed. But it did not enter Eugene\'s head to refuse to pay a\ndebt of his father\'s merely because the document could be challenged. He\nonly wanted to know for certain whether there had been such a debt.\n\n"Mamma! Who is Kaleriya Vladimirovna Esipova?" he asked his mother, when\nthey met as usual for dinner.\n\n"Esipova? She was brought up by your grandfather. Why?"\n\nEugene told his mother about the letter.\n\n"I wonder she is not ashamed to ask for it. Your father gave her so\nmuch!"\n\n"But do we owe her this?"\n\n"Well now, how shall I say? It is not a debt. Papa, out of his unbounded\nkindness . . ."\n\n"Yes, but did Papa consider it a debt?"\n\n"I cannot say. I don\'t know. I only know it is hard enough for you\nwithout that."\n\nEugene saw that Mary Pavlovna did not know what to say, and was as it\nwere sounding him.\n\n"I see from what you say, that it must be paid," said the son. "I will\ngo to see her to-morrow and have a chat, and see if it cannot be\ndeferred."\n\n"Ah, how sorry I am for you, but, you know, that will be best. Tell her\nshe must wait," said Mary Pavlovna, evidently tranquillized and proud of\nher son\'s decision.\n\nEugene\'s position was particularly hard because his mother, who was\nliving with him, did not at all realize his position. She had been so\naccustomed all her life long to live extravagantly that she could not\neven imagine to herself the position her son was in, that is to say,\nthat to-day or to-morrow matters might shape themselves so that they\nwould have nothing left, and he would have to sell everything, and live\nand support his mother on what salary he could earn, which at the very\nmost would be 2,000 rubles. She did not understand that they could only\nsave themselves from that position by cutting down expense in\neverything, and so she could not understand why Eugene was so careful\nabout trifles, in expenditure on gardeners, coachmen, servants--even on\nfood. Also, like most widows, she nourished feelings of devotion to the\nmemory of her departed spouse quite different from those she had felt\nfor him while he lived, and she did not admit the thought that what the\ndeparted had done, or had arranged, could be wrong or could be altered.\n\nEugene by great efforts managed to keep up the garden and the\nconservatory with two gardeners, and the stables with two coachmen. And\nMary Pavlovna na\xc3\xafvely thought that she was sacrificing herself for her\nson and doing all a mother could do, by not complaining of the food\nwhich the old man-cook prepared, of the fact that the paths in the park\nwere not all swept clean, and that instead of footmen they had only a\nboy.\n\nSo, too, concerning this new debt, in which Eugene saw an almost\ncrushing blow to all his undertakings, Mary Pavlovna only saw an\nincident displaying Eugene\'s noble nature.\n\nMary Pavlovna moreover did not feel much anxiety about Eugene\'s\nposition, because she was confident that he would make a brilliant\nmarriage which would put everything right. And he could make a very\nbrilliant marriage: she knew a dozen families who would be glad to give\ntheir daughters to him. And she wished to arrange the matter as soon as\npossible.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nEugene himself dreamt of marriage, but not in the same way as his\nmother. The idea of using marriage as a means of putting his affairs in\norder was repulsive to him. He wished to marry honourably, for love. He\nobserved the girls whom he met and those he knew, and compared himself\nwith them, but no decision had yet been taken. Meanwhile contrary to his\nexpectations his relations with Stepanida continued, and even acquired\nthe character of a settled affair. Eugene was so far from debauchery, it\nwas so hard for him secretly to do this thing which he felt to be bad,\nthat he could not arrange these meetings himself, and even after the\nfirst one hoped not to see Stepanida again; but it turned out that after\nsome time the same restlessness (due, he believed, to that cause) again\novercame him. And his restlessness this time was no longer impersonal,\nbut suggested just those same bright, black eyes, and that deep voice,\nsaying, "ever so long," that same scent of something fresh and strong,\nand that same full bread lifting the bib of her apron, and all this in\nthat hazel and maple thicket, bathed in bright sunlight.\n\nThough he felt ashamed, he again approached Daniel. And again a\nrendezvous was fixed for midday, in the wood. This time Eugene looked\nher over more carefully, and everything about her seemed attractive. He\ntried talking to her, and asked about her husband. He really was\nMichael\'s son, and lived as a coachman in Moscow.\n\n"Well, then, how is it you . . ." Eugene wanted to ask how it was she\nwas untrue to him.\n\n"What about \'how is it\'?" asked she. Evidently she was clever and\nquick-witted.\n\n"Well, how is it you come to me?"\n\n"There now," said she merrily. "I bet he goes on the spree there. Why\nshouldn\'t I?"\n\nEvidently she was putting on an air of sauciness and assurance. And this\nseemed charming to Eugene. But all the same he did not himself fix a\nrendezvous with her. Even when she proposed that they should meet\nwithout the aid of Daniel, to whom she seemed not very well-disposed,\nEugene did not consent. He hoped that this meeting would be the last. He\nliked her. He thought such intercourse was necessary for him and that\nthere was nothing bad about it, but in the depth of his soul there was a\nstricter judge, who did not approve of it and hoped that this would be\nthe last time, or if he did not hope that, at any rate did not wish to\nparticipate in arrangements to repeat it another time.\n\nSo the whole summer passed, during which they met a dozen times and\nalways by Daniel\'s help. It happened once that she could not be there\nbecause her husband had come home, and Daniel proposed another woman,\nbut Eugene refused with disgust. Then the husband went away, and the\nmeetings continued as before, at first through Daniel, but afterwards he\nsimply fixed the time and she came with another woman, Prokhorova--as it\nwould not do for a peasant-woman to go about alone.\n\nOnce at the very time fixed for the rendezvous a family came to call on\nMary Pavlovna, with the very girl she wished Eugene to marry, and it was\nimpossible for Eugene to get away. As soon as he could do so, he went\nout as though to the thrashing-floor, and round by the path to their\nmeeting-place in the wood. She was not there, but at the accustomed spot\neverything within reach of one\'s hand had been broken--the black alder,\nthe hazel-twigs, and even a young maple the thickness of a stake. She\nhad waited, had become excited and angry, and had skittishly left him a\nremembrance. He waited, waited, and went to Daniel to ask him to call\nher for to-morrow. She came, and was just as usual.\n\nSo the summer passed. The meetings were always arranged in the wood, and\nonly once, when it grew towards autumn, in the shed that stood in her\nback-yard.\n\nIt did not enter Eugene\'s head that these relations of his had any\nimportance for him. About her he did not even think. He gave her money\nand nothing more. At first he did not know and did not think that the\naffair was known and she was envied throughout the village, or that her\nrelations took money from her and encouraged her, and that her\nconception of any sin in the matter had been quite obliterated by the\ninfluence of the money and her family\'s approval. It seemed to her that\nif people envied her, then what she was doing was good.\n\n"It is simply necessary for one\'s health," thought Eugene. "I grant it\nis not right, and though no one says anything, everybody, or many\npeople, know of it. The woman who comes with her knows. And once she\nknows, she is sure to have told others. But what\'s to be done? I am\nacting badly," thought Eugene, "but what\'s one to do? Anyhow it is not\nfor long."\n\nWhat chiefly disturbed Eugene was the thought of the husband. At first,\nfor some reason, it seemed to him that the husband must be a poor sort,\nand this, as it were, partly justified his conduct. But he saw the\nhusband and was struck: he was a fine fellow and smartly dressed, in no\nway a worse man, but surely better, than himself. At their next meeting\nhe told her he had seen her husband and had been surprised to see that\nhe was such a fine fellow.\n\n"There\'s not such another in the village," said she proudly.\n\nThis surprised Eugene. The thought of the husband tormented him still\nmore after that. He happened to be at Daniel\'s one day and Daniel,\nhaving begun chatting, plainly said to him:\n\n"And Michael, the other day, asked me: \'Is it true that the master is\nliving with my wife?\' I said I did not know. Anyway, I said, better with\nthe master than with a peasant."\n\n"Well, and what did he say?"\n\n"He said,--\'Wait a bit. I\'ll get to know, and I\'ll give it her all the\nsame.\'"\n\n"Yes, if the husband returned to live here, I would give her up,"\nthought Eugene.\n\nBut the husband lived in town and for the present their intercourse\ncontinued.\n\n"When necessary, I will break it off, and there will be nothing left of\nit," thought he.\n\nAnd this seemed to him certain, especially as during the whole summer\nmany different things occupied him very fully: the erection of the new\nfarm-house, and the harvest, and building, and above all meeting the\ndebts and selling the waste land. All these were affairs that completely\nabsorbed him and on which he spent his thoughts when he lay down and\nwhen he rose. All that was, real life. His intercourse--he did not even\ncall it connection--with Stepanida was something quite unnoticed. It is\ntrue that when the wish to see her arose, it came with such strength\nthat he could think of nothing else. But this did not last long. A\nmeeting was arranged, and he again forgot her for a week or even for a\nmonth.\n\nIn autumn Eugene often rode to town, and there became friendly with the\nAnnenskis. They had a daughter who had just finished the Institute.[1]\nAnd then, to Mary Pavlovna\'s great grief, it happened that Eugene, as\nshe expressed it, "cheapened himself,"--by falling in love with Liza\nAnnenskaya and proposing to her.\n\nFrom that time the relations with Stepanida ceased.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: The Institute was a boarding-school for the daughters of\nthe nobility and gentry, in which great attention was paid to the\nmanners and accomplishments of the pupils.]\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nIt is impossible to explain why Eugene chose Liza Annenskaya, as it is\nnever possible to explain why a man chooses this and not that woman.\nThere were many reasons--positive and negative. One reason was that she\nwas not a very rich heiress such as his mother sought for him, another\nthat she was na\xc3\xafve and to be pitied in her relations with her mother,\nthen there was the fact that she was not a beauty who attracted general\nattention to herself, but yet was not bad looking. The chief reason was\nthat his acquaintance with her began at the time when Eugene was ripe\nfor marriage. He fell in love because he knew that he would marry.\n\nLiza Annenskaya was at first merely pleasing to Eugene, but when he\ndecided to make her his wife, his feelings for her became much stronger.\nHe felt that he was in love.\n\nLiza was tall, slender, and long. Everything about her was long; her\nface, and her nose--not prominently but downwards--and her fingers, and\nher feet. The colour of her face was very delicate, yellowish white and\ndelicately pink; her hair was long, light brown, soft, curly, and she\nhad beautiful, clear, mild, confiding eyes. Those eyes especially struck\nEugene. And when he thought of Liza he always saw those clear, mild,\nconfiding eyes.\n\nSuch was she physically; spiritually he knew nothing of her, but only\nsaw those eyes. And those eyes seemed to tell him all he needed to know.\nThe meaning of those eyes was this:\n\nWhile still in the Institute, when she was fifteen, Liza used\ncontinually to fall in love with all attractive men and was animated and\nhappy only when she was in love. After leaving the Institute she\ncontinued to fall in love, in just the same way, with all the young men\nshe met, and of course fell in love with Eugene as soon as she made his\nacquaintance. It was this being in love which gave her eyes that\nparticular expression which so captivated Eugene. Already that winter\nshe had been, at one and the same time, in love with two young men, and\nblushed and became excited not only when they entered the room but\nwhenever their names were mentioned. But afterwards, when her mother\nhinted to her that Irtenev seemed to have serious intentions, her love\nfor him increased so that she became almost indifferent to the two\nprevious attractions, and when Irtenev began to come to their balls and\nparties, and danced with her more than with others and evidently only\nwished to know whether she loved him, her love for him became painful.\nShe dreamed of him in her sleep and seemed to see him when she was awake\nin a dark room, and everyone else vanished from her mind. But when he\nproposed and they were formally engaged, and when they had kissed one\nanother and were a betrothed couple, then she had no thoughts but of\nhim, no desire but to be with him, to love him, and to be loved by him.\nShe was also proud of him and felt emotional about him and herself and\nher love, and quite melted and felt faint from love of him.\n\nThe more he got to know her the more he loved her. He had not at all\nexpected to find such love, and it strengthened his own feeling still\nmore.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nTowards spring he went to his estate at Sem\xc3\xabnovskoe to have a look at\nit and to give directions about the management, and especially about the\nhouse which was being done up for his wedding.\n\nMary Pavlovna was dissatisfied with her son\'s choice, not only because\nthe match was not as brilliant as it might have been, but also because\nshe did not like Varvara Alexeevna, his future mother-in-law. Whether\nshe was good-natured or not she did not know and could not decide, but\nthat she was not well-bred, not _comme il faut_, "not a lady" as Mary\nPavlovna said to herself,--she saw from their first acquaintance, and\nthis distressed her; distressed her because she was accustomed to value\nbreeding and knew that Eugene was sensitive to it, and she foresaw that\nhe would suffer much annoyance on this account. But she liked the girl.\nLiked her chiefly because Eugene did. One could not help loving her. And\nMary Pavlovna was quite sincerely ready to do so.\n\nEugene found his mother contented and in good spirits. She was getting\neverything straight in the house and preparing to go away herself as\nsoon as he brought his young wife. Eugene persuaded her to stay for the\ntime being, and the future remained undecided.\n\nIn the evening after tea Mary Pavlovna played patience as usual. Eugene\nsat by, helping her. This was the hour of their most intimate talks.\nHaving finished one game of patience and while preparing to begin\nanother, Mary Pavlovna looked up at Eugene and, with a little\nhesitation, began thus:\n\n"I wanted to tell you, Jenya,--of course I do not know, but in general I\nwanted to suggest to you that before your wedding it is absolutely\nnecessary to have finished with all your bachelor affairs, so that\nnothing may disturb either you or your wife. God forbid that it should.\nYou understand me?"\n\nAnd indeed Eugene at once understood that Mary Pavlovna was hinting at\nhis relations with Stepanida which had ended in the previous autumn; and\nthat she attributed much more importance to those relations than they\ndeserved, as single women always do. Eugene blushed, and not from shame\nso much as from vexation that good-natured Mary Pavlovna was\nbothering--out of affection no doubt--but still was bothering about\nmatters that were not her business and that she did not and could not\nunderstand. He answered that he had nothing that needed concealment, and\nthat he had always conducted himself so that there should be nothing to\nhinder his marrying.\n\n"Well, dear, that is excellent. Only, Jenya, don\'t be vexed with me,"\nsaid Mary Pavlovna, in confusion.\n\nBut Eugene saw that she had not finished and had not said what she\nwanted to. So it appeared when a little later she began to tell him of\nhow, in his absence, she had been asked to stand godmother at . . . the\nPechnikovs.\n\nEugene flushed now, not with vexation or shame, but with some strange\nconsciousness of the importance of what was about to be told him--an\ninvoluntary consciousness quite at variance with his conclusions. And\nwhat he expected happened. Mary Pavlovna, as if merely by way of\nconversation, mentioned that this year only boys were being\nborn,--evidently a sign of a coming war. Both at the Vasins and the\nPechnikovs the young wife had a first child--at each house a boy. Mary\nPavlovna wanted to say this casually, but she herself felt ashamed when\nshe saw the colour mount to her son\'s face and saw him nervously\nremoving, tapping, and replacing his pince-nez and hurriedly lighting a\ncigarette. She became silent. He too was silent and could not think how\nto break that silence. So they both understood that they had understood\none another.\n\n"Yes, the chief thing is that there should be justice and no favouritism\nin the village,--as under your grandfather."\n\n"Mamma,"--said Eugene suddenly,--"I know why you are saying this. You\nhave no need to be disturbed. My future family-life is so sacred to me\nthat I should not infringe it in any case. And as to what occurred in my\nbachelor days, that is quite ended. I never formed any union and no one\nhas any claims on me."\n\n"Well, I am glad," said his mother. "I know how noble your feelings\nare."\n\nEugene accepted his mother\'s words as a tribute due to him, and did not\nreply.\n\nNext day he drove to town thinking of his fianc\xc3\xa9e and of anything in\nthe world except of Stepanida. But, as if purposely to remind him, on\napproaching the church he met people walking and driving back from it.\nHe met old Matvey with Simon, some lads and girls, and then two women,\none elderly, the other smartly dressed with a bright red kerchief, who\nseemed familiar. The woman was walking lightly, boldly, carrying a child\nin her arms. He came up to them, the elder woman bowed, stopping in the\nold-fashioned way, but the young woman with the child only bent her\nhead, and from under the kerchief gleamed familiar, merry, smiling eyes.\n\nYes, this was she, but all was over and it was no use looking at her:\n"and the child may be mine," flashed through his mind. No, what\nnonsense! There was her husband, she used to see him. He did not even\nconsider the matter further, so settled in his mind was it that it had\nbeen necessary for his health,--he had paid her money and there was no\nmore to be said; there was, there had been, and there could be, no\nquestion of any union between them. It was not that he stifled the voice\nof conscience, no--his conscience simply said nothing to him. And he\nthought no more about her after the conversation with his mother and\nafter this meeting. Nor did he meet her again.\n\nEugene was married in town the week after Easter, and left at once with\nhis young wife for his country estate. The house had been arranged as\nusual for a young couple. Mary Pavlovna wished to leave, but Eugene and\nstill more strongly Liza begged her to remain, and she only moved into a\ndetached wing of the house.\n\nAnd so a new life began for Eugene.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe first year of his marriage was a hard one for Eugene. It was hard\nbecause affairs he had managed to put off during the time of his\ncourtship now, after his marriage, all came upon him at once.\n\nTo escape from debts was impossible. An outlying part of the estate was\nsold and the most pressing obligations met, but others remained, and he\nhad no money. The estate yielded a good revenue, but he had had to send\npayments to his brother, and to spend on his own marriage, so that there\nwas no ready money and the factory could not carry on and would have to\nbe closed down. The only way of escape was to use his wife\'s money.\nLiza, having realized her husband\'s position, insisted on this herself.\nEugene agreed, but only on condition that he should give her a mortgage\non half his estate; and this he did. Of course it was not for the sake\nof his wife, who felt offended at it, but to appease his mother-in-law.\n\nThese affairs, with various fluctuations of success and failure, helped\nto poison Eugene\'s life that first year. Another thing was his wife\'s\nill-health. That same first year, seven months after their marriage, in\nautumn, a misfortune befell Liza. She drove out to meet her husband who\nwas returning from town; the quiet horse became rather playful, and she\nwas frightened and jumped out. Her jump was comparatively fortunate--she\nmight have been caught by the wheel--but she was pregnant, and that same\nnight the pains began and she had a miscarriage from which she was long\nin recovering. The loss of the expected child and his wife\'s illness,\ntogether with the disorder in his affairs, and above all the presence of\nhis mother-in-law, who arrived as soon as Liza fell ill--all this\ntogether made the year still harder for Eugene.\n\nBut notwithstanding these difficult circumstances, towards the end of\nthe first year Eugene felt very well. First of all his cherished hope of\nrestoring his fallen fortune and renewing his grandfather\'s way of life\nin a new form, was approaching accomplishment, though slowly and with\ndifficulty. There was no longer any question of having to sell the whole\nestate to meet the debts. The chief estate, though transferred to his\nwife\'s name, was saved, and if only the beet crop succeeded and the\nprice kept up, by next year his position of want and stress might be\nreplaced by one of complete prosperity. That was one thing.\n\nAnother was that however much he had expected from his wife, he had\nnever expected to find in her what he actually found. It was not what he\nhad expected, but it was much better. Emotion, raptures of love--though\nhe tried to produce them--did not take place or were very slight, but\nsomething quite different appeared, namely, that he was not merely more\ncheerful and happier but that it became easier to live. He did not know\nwhy this should be so, but it was.\n\nIt happened because immediately after the marriage she decided that\nEugene Irtenev was superior to, wiser, purer, and nobler than, anyone\nelse in the world, and therefore it was right for everyone to serve him\nand do what would please him; but as it was impossible to make everyone\ndo this, she to the limit of her strength must do it herself. So she\ndid; and therefore all her strength of mind was directed towards\nlearning and guessing what he liked, and then doing just that, whatever\nit was and however difficult it might be.\n\nShe had the gift which furnishes the chief delight of intercourse with a\nloving woman; thanks to her love of her husband she penetrated into his\nsoul. She knew--better it seemed to him than he himself--his every\nstate, and every shade of his feeling, and she behaved correspondingly,\nand therefore never hurt his feelings, but always lessened his\ndistresses and strengthened his joys. And she understood not only his\nfeelings but also his joys. Things quite foreign to her--concerning the\nfarming, the factory, or the appraisement of others, she immediately\nunderstood so that she could not merely converse with him, but could\noften, as he himself said, be a useful and irreplaceable counsellor. She\nregarded affairs and people, and everything in the world, only through\nhis eyes. She loved her mother, but having seen that Eugene disliked his\nmother-in-law\'s interference in their life she immediately took her\nhusband\'s side, and did so with such decision that he had to restrain\nher.\n\nBesides all this she had very much taste, tact, and above all,\npeacefulness. All that she did, she did unnoticed; only the results of\nwhat she did were observable, namely, that always and in everything\nthere was cleanliness, order, and elegance. Liza had at once understood\nin what her husband\'s ideal of life consisted, and she tried to attain,\nand in the arrangement and order of the house did attain, what he\nwanted. Children, it is true, were lacking, but there was hope of this\nalso. In winter she went to Petersburg to see a specialist, and he\nassured them that she was quite well and could have children.\n\nAnd this desire was accomplished. By the end of the year she was again\npregnant.\n\nThe one thing that threatened, not to say poisoned, their happiness was\nher jealousy; a jealousy she restrained and did not exhibit, but from\nwhich she often suffered. Not only might Eugene not love anyone--because\nthere was not a woman on earth worthy of him (as to whether she herself\nwas worthy or not, she never asked herself),--but not a single woman\nmight, therefore, dare to love him.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nThey lived thus: he rose, as he always had done, early, and went to see\nto the farm or the factory, where work was going on, or sometimes to the\nfields. Towards ten o\'clock he would come back to his coffee: they had\nit on the verandah, Mary Pavlovna, an uncle who lived with them, and\nLiza. After a conversation which was often very animated while they\ndrank their coffee, they dispersed till dinner-time. At two o\'clock they\ndined and then went for a walk, or a drive. In the evening when he\nreturned from his office they drank their evening tea, and sometimes he\nread aloud while she worked, or when there were guests they had music or\ntalked. When he went away on business he wrote to his wife, and received\nletters from her, every day. Sometimes she accompanied him, and then\nthey were particularly merry. On his name-day and on hers guests\nassembled, and it was pleasant to him to see how well she managed to\narrange things so that it was pleasant for everybody. He saw, and heard\nalso, that they all admired her, the young, agreeable hostess, and he\nloved her still more for this.\n\nAll went excellently. She bore her pregnancy easily, and though they\nwere afraid, they both began making plans as to how they would bring the\nchild up. The system of education and the arrangements were all decided\nby Eugene, and her only wish was obediently to carry out his desires.\nEugene on his part read up medical works, and intended to bring the\nchild up according to all the precepts of science. She, of course,\nagreed to everything and made preparations, making warm and also cool\n"envelopes,"[2] and preparing a cradle. Thus the second year of their\nmarriage arrived, and the second spring.\n\n\n[Footnote 2: An "envelope" was a small mattress with attached\ncoverlet, on which babies were carried about.]\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nIt was just before Trinity Sunday. Liza was in her fifth month, and,\nthough careful, she was brisk and active. Both the mothers, his and\nhers, were living in the house, but under pretext of watching and\nsafeguarding her only upset her by their tiffs. Eugene was specially\nengrossed with a new experiment for the cultivation of sugar-beet on a\nlarge scale.\n\nJust before Trinity Liza decided that it was necessary to have a\nthorough house-cleaning, as it had not been done since Easter, and she\nhired two women by the day, to help the servants wash the floors and\nwindows, beat the furniture and the carpets, and put covers on them. The\nwomen came early in the morning, heated the coppers, and set to work.\nOne of the two was Stepanida, who had just weaned her baby boy. Through\nthe office-clerk--whom she now carried on with--she had begged for the\njob of washing the floors. She wanted to have a good look at the new\nmistress. Stepanida was living by herself, as formerly, her husband\nbeing away, and she was up to tricks, as she had formerly been first\nwith old Daniel (who had once caught her taking some logs of firewood),\nafterwards with the master, and now with the young clerk. She was not\nconcerning herself any longer about her master. "He has a wife now," she\nthought. But it would be good to have a look at the lady and at her\nestablishment: folk said it was well arranged.\n\nEugene had not seen her since he had met her with the child. Having a\nbaby to attend to she had not been going out to work, and he seldom\nwalked through the village. That morning, on the eve of Trinity Sunday,\nEugene rose at five o\'clock and rode to the fallow land which was to be\nsprinkled with phosphates, and he left the house before the women were\nabout it, and while they were still engaged lighting the copper fires.\n\nMerry, contented, and hungry, Eugene returned to breakfast. He\ndismounted from his mare at the gate and handed her over to the\ngardener. Flicking the high grass with his whip and repeating, as one\noften does, a phrase he had just uttered, he walked towards the house.\nThe phrase he repeated was: "phosphates justify"--what or to whom he\nneither knew nor reflected.\n\nThey were beating a carpet on the grass. The furniture had been brought\nout.\n\n"There now! What a house-cleaning Liza has undertaken! . . . Phosphates\njustify. . . . What a manageress she is! A manageress! Yes, a\nmanageress," said he to himself, vividly imagining her in her white\nwrapper and with her smiling joyful face, as it nearly always was when\nhe looked at her. "Yes, I must change my boots, or else \'phosphates\njustify,\' that is, smell of manure, and the manageress is in such a\ncondition. Why \'in such a condition\'? Because a new little Irtenev is\ngrowing there inside her," he thought. "Yes, phosphates justify," and\nsmiling at his thoughts he put his hand to the door of his room.\n\nBut he had not time to push the door before it opened of itself and he\nmet, face to face, a woman coming towards him carrying a pail, barefoot,\nand with sleeves turned up high. He stepped aside to let her pass, she\ntoo stepped aside, adjusting her kerchief with a wet hand.\n\n"Go on, go on, I won\'t go there, if you . . ." began Eugene and,\nsuddenly, recognizing her, stopped.\n\nShe glanced merrily at him with smiling eyes, and pulling down her skirt\nwent out by the door.\n\n"What nonsense! . . . It is impossible," said Eugene to himself,\nfrowning and waving his hand as though to get rid of a fly, displeased\nat having noticed her. He was vexed that he had noticed her and yet he\ncould not take his eyes from her strong body, swayed by the agile\nstrides of her bare feet, or from her arms, shoulders, and the pleasing\nfolds of her shirt and handsome skirt, tucked up high above her white\ncalves.\n\n"But why am I looking?" said he to himself, lowering his eyes so as not\nto see her. "But anyhow I must go in to get some other boots." And he\nturned back to go into his own room, but had not gone five steps before,\nwithout knowing why or wherefore, he again glanced round to have another\nlook at her. She was just going round the corner and also glanced at\nhim.\n\n"Ah, what am I doing!" said he to himself. "She may think . . . It is\neven certain that she already does think . . ."\n\nHe entered his damp room. Another woman, an old and skinny one, was\nthere, and was still washing it. Eugene passed on tiptoe across the\nfloor wet with dirty water to the wall where his boots stood, and he was\nabout to leave the room, when the woman herself went out.\n\n"This one has gone and the other, Stepanida, will come here alone,"\nsomeone within him began to reflect.\n\n"My God, what am I thinking of and what am I doing!" He seized his boots\nand ran out with them into the hall, put them on there, brushed himself,\nand went out on to the verandah where both the mammas were already\ndrinking coffee. Liza had evidently been expecting him and came on to\nthe verandah through another door at the same time.\n\n"My God! If she, who considers me so honourable, pure, and innocent,--if\nshe only knew!"--thought he.\n\nLiza, as usual, met him with shining face. But to-day somehow she seemed\nto him particularly pale, yellow, long, and weak.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nDuring coffee, as often happened, a peculiarly feminine kind of\nconversation went on which had no logical sequence, but which evidently\nwas connected in some way for it went on uninterruptedly.\n\nThe two old ladies were pin-pricking one another, and Liza was skilfully\nman\xc5\x93uvring between them.\n\n"I am so vexed that we had not finished washing your room before you got\nback," she said to her husband. "But I do so want to get everything\narranged."\n\n"Well, did you sleep well after I got up?"\n\n"Yes, I slept well, and I feel well."\n\n"How can a woman be well in her condition during this intolerable heat,\nwhen her windows face the sun," said Varvara Alexeevna, her mother. "And\nthey have no venetian-blinds or awnings. I always had awnings."\n\n"But you know we are in the shade after ten o\'clock," said Mary\nPavlovna.\n\n"That\'s what causes fever; it comes of dampness," said Varvara\nAlexeevna, not noticing that what she was saying did not agree with what\nshe had just said. "My doctor always says that it is impossible to\ndiagnose an illness unless one knows the patient. And he certainly\nknows, for he is the leading physician and we pay him a hundred rubles a\nvisit. My late husband did not believe in doctors, but he did not grudge\nme anything."\n\n"How can a man grudge anything to a woman when perhaps her life and the\nchild\'s depend . . ."\n\n"Yes, when she has means, a wife need not depend on her husband. A good\nwife submits to her husband," said Varvara Alexeevna,--"only Liza is too\nweak after her illness."\n\n"Oh no, mamma, I feel quite well. But why have they not brought you any\nboiled cream?"\n\n"I don\'t want any. I can do with raw cream."\n\n"I offered some to Varvara Alexeevna, but she declined," said Mary\nPavlovna, as if justifying herself.\n\n"No, I don\'t want any to-day." And as if to terminate an unpleasant\nconversation and yield magnanimously, Varvara Alexeevna turned to Eugene\nand said: "Well, and have you sprinkled the phosphates?"\n\nLiza ran to fetch the cream.\n\n"But I don\'t want it. I don\'t want it."\n\n"Liza, Liza, go gently,"--said Mary Pavlovna. "Such rapid movements do\nher harm."\n\n"Nothing does harm, if one\'s mind is at peace," said Varvara Alexeevna\nas if referring to something, though she knew that there was nothing\nthat her words could refer to.\n\nLiza returned with the cream, Eugene drank his coffee and listened\nmorosely. He was accustomed to these conversations, but to-day he was\nparticularly annoyed by its lack of sense. He wanted to think over what\nhad happened to him, but this chatter disturbed him. Having finished her\ncoffee Varvara Alexeevna went away in a bad humour. Liza, Eugene, and\nMary Pavlovna stayed behind, and their conversation was simple and\npleasant. But Liza, being sensitive, at once noticed that something was\ntormenting Eugene, and she asked him whether anything unpleasant had\nhappened. He was not prepared for this question, and hesitated a little\nbefore replying that there had been nothing unpleasant. And this reply\nmade Liza think all the more; that something was tormenting, and greatly\ntormenting, him was as evident to her as the fact that a fly had fallen\ninto the milk, yet he did not speak of it. What could it be?\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nAfter breakfast they all dispersed. Eugene as usual went to his study.\nHe did not begin reading or writing his letters, but sat smoking one\ncigarette after another and thinking. He was terribly surprised and\ndisturbed by the expected recrudescence within him of the bad feeling\nfrom which he had thought himself free since his marriage. Since then he\nhad not once experienced that feeling, either for her--the woman he had\nknown--or for any other woman except his wife. He had often felt glad of\nthis emancipation, and now suddenly a chance meeting, seemingly so\nunimportant, revealed to him the fact that he was not free. What now\ntormented him was not that he was yielding to that feeling and desired\nher--he did not dream of so doing--but that the feeling was awake within\nhim and he had to be on his guard against it. He had no doubt but that\nhe would suppress it.\n\nHe had a letter to answer and a paper to write. He sat down at his\nwriting-table and began to work. Having finished it and quite forgotten\nwhat had disturbed him, he went out to go to the stables. And again as\nill-luck would have it, either by unfortunate chance or intentionally,\nas soon as he stepped from the porch, a red skirt and red kerchief\nappeared from round the corner, and she went past him swinging her arms\nand swaying her body. She not only went past him, but on passing him\nran, as if playfully, to overtake her fellow-servant.\n\nAgain the bright midday, the nettles, the back of Daniel\'s hut, and in\nthe shade of the plane-trees her smiling face biting some leaves, rose\nin his imagination.\n\n"No, it is impossible to let matters continue so," he said to himself,\nand waiting till the women had passed out of sight he went to the\noffice.\n\nIt was just the dinner-hour and he hoped to find the steward still\nthere. So it happened. The steward was just waking up from his\nafter-dinner nap. Standing in the office, stretching himself and\nyawning, he was looking at the herdsman who was telling him something.\n\n"Vasili Nikolaich!" said Eugene to the steward.\n\n"What is your pleasure?"\n\n"I want to speak to you."\n\n"What is your pleasure?"\n\n"Just finish what you are saying."\n\n"Aren\'t you going to bring it in?" said Vasili Nikolaich to the\nherdsman.\n\n"It\'s heavy, Vasili Nikolaich."\n\n"What is it?" asked Eugene.\n\n"Why, a cow has calved in the meadow. Well, all right, I\'ll order them\nto harness a horse at once. Tell Nicholas Lysukh to get out the dray\ncart."\n\nThe herdsman went out.\n\n"Do you know," began Eugene, flushing and conscious that he was doing\nso, "do you know, Vasili Nikolaich, while I was a bachelor I went off\nthe track a bit. . . . You may have heard . . ."\n\nVasili Nikolaich with smiling eyes and evidently sorry for his master,\nsaid: "Is it about Stepanida?"\n\n"Why, yes. Look here. Please, please do not engage her to help in the\nhouse. You understand, it is very awkward for me . . ."\n\n"Yes, it must have been Vanya, the clerk, who arranged it."\n\n"Yes, please. . . . Well, and hadn\'t the rest of the phosphates better\nbe strewn?" said Eugene, to hide his confusion.\n\n"Yes, I am just going to see to it."\n\nSo it ended. And Eugene calmed down, hoping that as he had lived for a\nyear without seeing her, so things would go on now. "Besides, Vasili\nNikolaich will speak to Ivan the clerk; Ivan will speak to her, and she\nwill understand that I don\'t want it," said Eugene to himself, and he\nwas glad that he had forced himself to speak to Vasili Nikolaich, hard\nas it had been to do so.\n\n"Yes, it is better, better, than that feeling of doubt, that feeling of\nshame." He shuddered at the mere remembrance of his sin in thought.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nThe moral effort he had made to overcome his shame and speak to Vasili\nNikolaich, tranquillized Eugene. It seemed to him that the matter was\nall over now. Liza at once noticed that he was quite calm, and even\nhappier than usual. "No doubt he was upset by our mothers pin-pricking\none another. It really is disagreeable, especially for him who is so\nsensitive and noble, always to hear such unfriendly and ill-mannered\ninsinuations," thought she.\n\nThe next day was Trinity Sunday. The weather was beautiful, and the\npeasant-women, according to custom, on their way into the woods to plait\nwreaths, came to the landowner\'s home and began to sing and dance. Mary\nPavlovna and Varvara Alexeevna came out on to the porch in smart\nclothes, carrying sunshades, and went up to the ring of singers. With\nthem, in a jacket of Chinese silk, came out the uncle, a flabby\nlibertine and drunkard, who was living that summer with Eugene.\n\nAs usual there was a bright, many-coloured ring of young women and\ngirls, the centre of everything, and around these from different sides\nlike attendant planets that had detached themselves and were circling\nround, went girls hand in hand, rustling in their new print gowns; young\nlads giggling and running backwards and forwards after one another;\nfull-grown lads in dark blue or black coats and caps and with red\nshirts, who unceasingly spat out sunflower-seed shells; and the domestic\nservants or other outsiders watching the dance-circle from aside. Both\nthe old ladies went close up to the ring, and Liza accompanied them in a\nlight blue dress, with light blue ribbons on her head, and with wide\nsleeves under which her long white arms and angular elbows were visible.\n\nEugene did not wish to come out, but it was ridiculous to hide, and he\ntoo came out on to the porch smoking a cigarette, bowed to the men and\nlads, and talked with one of them. The women meanwhile shouted a\ndance-song with all their might, snapping their fingers, clapping their\nhands, and dancing.\n\n"They are calling for the master," said a youngster, coming up to\nEugene\'s wife who had not noticed the call. Liza called Eugene to look\nat the dance and at one of the women dancers who particularly pleased\nher. This was Stepanida. She wore a yellow skirt, a velveteen sleeveless\njacket and a silk kerchief, and was broad, energetic, ruddy, and merry.\nNo doubt she danced well. He saw nothing.\n\n"Yes, yes," said he, removing and replacing his pince-nez. "Yes, yes,"\nrepeated he. "So it seems I cannot be rid of her," he thought.\n\nHe did not look at her as he was afraid of her attraction, and just on\nthat account what his passing glance caught of her seemed to him\nespecially attractive. Besides this he saw by her sparkling look that\nshe saw him and saw that he admired her. He stood there as long as\npropriety demanded, and seeing that Varvara Alexeevna had called her,\nsenselessly and insincerely, "my dear," and was talking to her, he\nturned aside and went away.\n\nHe went into the house. He retired in order not to see her, but on\nreaching the upper story, without knowing how or why, he approached the\nwindow, and as long as the women remained at the porch he stood there\nand looked and looked at her, feasting his eyes on her.\n\nHe ran, while there was no one to see him, and then went with quiet\nsteps on to the verandah, and from there, smoking a cigarette and as if\ngoing for a stroll, he passed through the garden and followed the\ndirection she had taken. He had not gone two steps along the alley\nbefore he noticed behind the trees a velveteen sleeveless jacket, with a\npink and yellow skirt and a red kerchief. She was going somewhere with\nanother woman. "Where are they going?"\n\nAnd suddenly a terrible desire scorched him, as though a hand were\nseizing his heart. As if by someone else\'s wish he looked round and went\ntowards her.\n\n"Eugene Ivanich, Eugene Ivanich! I have come to see your honour," said a\nvoice behind him, and Eugene, seeing old Samokhin, who was digging a\nwell for him, roused himself and, turning quickly round, went to meet\nSamokhin. While speaking with him he turned sideways and saw that she\nand the woman who was with her went down the slope, evidently to the\nwell, or making an excuse of the well, and having stopped there a little\nwhile, ran back to the dance-circle.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nAfter talking to Samokhin, Eugene returned to the house as depressed as\nif he had committed a crime. In the first place she had understood him,\nbelieved that he wanted to see her, and desired it herself. Secondly,\nthat other woman, Anna Prokhorova, evidently knew of it.\n\nAbove all, he felt that he was conquered, that he was not master of his\nown will but that there was another power moving him, that he had been\nsaved only by good fortune, and that, if not to-day, to-morrow or a day\nlater, he would perish all the same.\n\n"Yes, perish," he did not understand it otherwise: to be unfaithful to\nhis young and loving wife with a peasant woman in the village, in the\nsight of everyone,--what was it but to perish, perish utterly, so that\nit would be impossible to live? No, something must be done.\n\n"My God, my God! What am I to do? Can it be that I shall perish like\nthis?" said he to himself. "Is it not possible to do anything? Yet\nsomething must be done. Do not think about her"--he ordered himself. "Do\nnot think!" and immediately he began thinking and seeing her before him,\nand seeing also the shade of the plane tree.\n\nHe remembered having read of a hermit who, to avoid the temptation he\nfelt for a woman on whom he had to lay his hand to heal her, thrust his\nother hand into a brazier and burnt his fingers. He called that to mind.\n"Yes, I am ready to burn my fingers rather than to perish." He looked\nround to make sure that there was no one in the room, lit a candle, and\nput a finger into the flame. "There now think about her," he said to\nhimself ironically. It hurt him and he withdrew his smoke-stained\nfinger, threw away the match, and laughed at himself. What nonsense!\nThat was not what had to be done. But it was necessary to do something,\nto avoid seeing her--either to go away himself or to send her away.\nYes,--send her away. Offer her husband money to remove to town, or to\nanother village. People would hear of it and would talk about it. Well,\nwhat of that? At any rate it was better than this danger. "Yes, that\nmust be done," he said to himself; and at the very time he was looking\nat her without moving his eyes. "Where is she going?" he suddenly asked\nhimself. She, as it seemed to him, had seen him at the window and now,\nhaving glanced at him and taken another woman by the hand, was going\ntowards the garden swinging her arm briskly. Without knowing why or\nwherefore, merely in accord with what he had been thinking, he went to\nthe office.\n\nVasili Nikolaich in holiday costume and with oiled hair was sitting at\ntea with his wife and a guest who was wearing an oriental kerchief.\n\n"I want a word with you, Vasili Nikolaich!"\n\n"Please say what you want to. We have finished tea."\n\n"No. I\'d rather you came out with me."\n\n"Directly; only let me get my cap. Tanya, put out the samovar,"--said\nVasili Nikolaich, stepping outside cheerfully.\n\nIt seemed to Eugene that Vasili had been drinking, but what was to be\ndone? It might be all the better--he would sympathize with him in his\ndifficulties the more readily.\n\n"I have come again to speak about that same matter, Vasili Nikolaich,"\nsaid Eugene,--"about that woman."\n\n"Well, what of her? I told them not to take her again on any account."\n\n"No, I have been thinking in general, and this is what I wanted to take\nyour advice about. Isn\'t it possible to get them away, to send the whole\nfamily away?"\n\n"Where can they be sent?" said Vasili, disapprovingly and ironically as\nit seemed to Eugene.\n\n"Well, I thought of giving them money, or even some land in\nKoltovski,--so that she should not be here."\n\n"But how can they be sent away? Where is he to go--torn up from his\nroots? And why should you do it? What harm can she do you?"\n\n"Ah, Vasili Nikolaich, you must understand that it would be dreadful for\nmy wife to hear of it."\n\n"But who will tell her?"\n\n"How can I live with this dread? The whole thing is very painful for\nme."\n\n"But really, why should you distress yourself? Whoever stirs up the\npast--out with his eye! Who is not a sinner before God and to blame\nbefore the Tsar, as the saying is?"\n\n"All the same it would be better to get rid of them. Can\'t you speak to\nthe husband?"\n\n"But it is no use speaking! Eh, Eugene Ivanich, what is the matter with\nyou? It is all past and forgotten. All sorts of things happen. Who is\nthere that would now say anything bad of you? Everybody sees you."\n\n"But all the same go and have a talk with him."\n\n"All right, I will speak to him."\n\nThough he knew that nothing would come of it, this talk somewhat calmed\nEugene. Above all, it made him feel that through excitement he had been\nexaggerating the danger.\n\nHad he gone to meet her by appointment? It was impossible. He had simply\ngone to stroll in the garden and she had happened to run out at the same\ntime.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nAfter dinner that very Trinity Sunday Liza while walking from the garden\nto the meadow, where her husband wanted to show her the clover, took a\nfalse step and fell when crossing a little ditch. She fell gently, on\nher side; but she gave an exclamation, and her husband saw an expression\nin her face not only of fear but of pain. He wished to help her up, but\nshe motioned him away with her hand.\n\n"No, wait a bit, Eugene," she said, with a weak smile, and as it seemed\nto him, she looked up guiltily. "My foot only gave way under me."\n\n"There, I always say," remarked Varvara Alexeevna, "can anyone in her\ncondition possibly jump over ditches?"\n\n"But no, mamma, it is all right. I shall get up directly." With her\nhusband\'s help she did get up, but immediately turned pale, and her face\nshowed fear.\n\n"Yes, I am not well," and she whispered something to her mother.\n\n"Oh, my God, what have you done! I said you ought not to go\nthere,"--cried Varvara Alexeevna. "Wait,--I will call the servants. She\nmust not walk. She must be carried!"\n\n"Don\'t be afraid, Liza, I will carry you," said Eugene, putting his left\narm round her. "Hold me by the neck. Like that." And stooping down he\nput his right arm under her knees and lifted her. He could never\nafterwards forget the suffering and yet beatific expression of her face.\n\n"I am too heavy for you, dear,"--she said with a smile. "Mamma is\nrunning, tell her!" And she bent towards him and kissed him. She\nevidently wanted her mother to see how he was carrying her.\n\nEugene shouted to Varvara Alexeevna not to hurry, and that he would\ncarry Liza home. Varvara Alexeevna stopped and began to shout still\nlouder.\n\n"You will drop her, you\'ll be sure to drop her. You want to destroy her.\nYou have no conscience!"\n\n"But I am carrying her excellently."\n\n"I do not want to watch you killing my daughter, and I can\'t." And she\nran round the bend in the alley.\n\n"Never mind, it will pass," said Liza, smiling.\n\n"Yes. If only it does not have consequences like last time."\n\n"No. I am not speaking of that. That is all right. I mean mamma. You are\ntired. Rest a bit."\n\nBut though he found it heavy, Eugene carried his burden proudly and\ngladly to the house and did not hand her over to the housemaid and the\nman-cook whom Varvara Alexeevna had found and sent to meet them. He\ncarried her to the bedroom and placed her on the bed.\n\n"Now go away," she said and drawing his hand to her she kissed it.\n"Annushka and I will manage all right."\n\nMary Pavlovna also ran in from her rooms in the wing. They undressed\nLiza and laid her on the bed. Eugene sat in the drawing-room with a book\nin his hand, waiting. Varvara Alexeevna went past him with such a\nreproachfully gloomy air that he felt alarmed.\n\n"Well, how is it?" he asked.\n\n"How? What\'s the good of asking? It is probably what you wanted when you\nmade your wife jump over the ditch."\n\n"Varvara Alexeevna!" he cried. "This is impossible. If you want to\ntorment people and to poison their life,"--he wanted to say, "then go\nelsewhere to do it," but he restrained himself. "How is it that it does\nnot hurt you?"\n\n"It is too late now." And shaking her cap in a triumphant manner she\npassed out by the door.\n\nThe fall had really been a bad one, Liza\'s foot had twisted awkwardly\nand there was danger of her having another miscarriage. Everyone knew\nthat there was nothing to be done, but that she must just lie quietly,\nyet all the same they decided to send for a doctor.\n\n"Dear Nikolay Sem\xc3\xabnich," wrote Eugene to the doctor, "you have always\nbeen so kind to us, that I hope you will not refuse to come to my wife\'s\nassistance. She . . ." and so on. Having written the letter he went to\nthe stables to arrange about the horses and the carriage. Horses had to\nbe got ready to bring the doctor, and others to take him back. When an\nestate is not run on a large scale, such things cannot be quickly\ndecided but have to be considered. Having arranged it all and dispatched\nthe coachman, it was past nine before he got back to the house. His wife\nwas lying down, and said that she felt perfectly well and had no pain.\nBut Varvara Alexeevna was sitting with a lamp screened from Liza by some\nsheets of music and knitting a large red coverlet, with a mien that said\nthat after what had happened peace was impossible; but that no matter\nwhat anyone else did, she at any rate would do her duty.\n\nEugene noticed this but, to appear as if he had not seen it, he tried to\nassume a cheerful and tranquil air and told how he had chosen the horses\nand how the mare, Kabushka, had galloped capitally as left trace-horse\nin the troika.\n\n"Yes, of course, it is just the time to exercise the horses when help is\nneeded. Probably the doctor will also be thrown into the ditch,"\nremarked Varvara Alexeevna, examining her knitting from under her\npince-nez and moving it close up to the lamp.\n\n"But you know we had to send one way or other, and I made the best\narrangement I could."\n\n"Yes, I remember very well how your horses galloped with me under the\ngateway arch." This was her long-standing fancy, and Eugene now was\ninjudicious enough to remark that was not quite what had happened.\n\n"It is not for nothing that I have always said, and have often remarked\nto the prince, that it is hardest of all to live with people who are\nuntruthful and insincere; I can endure anything except that."\n\n"Well, if anyone has to suffer more than another, it is certainly I,"\nsaid Eugene. "But you . . ."\n\n"Yes, it is evident."\n\n"What?"\n\n"Nothing, I am only counting my stitches."\n\nEugene was standing at the time by the bed and Liza was looking at him,\nand one of her moist hands outside the coverlet caught his hand and\npressed it. "Bear with her for my sake. You know she cannot prevent our\nloving one another," was what her look said.\n\n"I won\'t do so again. It\'s nothing," whispered he, and he kissed her\ndamp, long hand and then her affectionate eyes, which closed while he\nkissed them.\n\n"Can it be the same thing over again?" he asked. "How are you feeling?"\n\n"I am afraid to say, for fear of being mistaken, but I feel that he is\nalive and will live," said she, glancing at her stomach.\n\n"Ah, it is dreadful, dreadful to think of."\n\nNotwithstanding Liza\'s insistence that he should go away, Eugene spent\nthe night with her, hardly closing an eye and ready to attend on her.\n\nBut she passed the night well, and had they not sent for the doctor she\nwould perhaps have got up.\n\nBy dinner-time the doctor arrived and of course said that, though if the\nsymptoms recurred there might be cause for apprehension, yet actually\nthere were no positive symptoms, but as there were also no contrary\nindications one might suppose on the one hand that--and on the other\nhand that. . . . And therefore she must lie still, and that "though I do\nnot like prescribing, yet all the same she should take this mixture and\nshould lie quiet." Besides this, the doctor gave Varvara Alexeevna a\nlecture on woman\'s anatomy, during which Varvara Alexeevna nodded her\nhead significantly. Having received his fee, as usual into the backmost\npart of his palm, the doctor drove away and the patient was left to lie\nin bed for a week.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nMost of his time Eugene spent by his wife\'s bedside, talking to her,\nreading to her, and what was hardest of all, enduring without murmur\nVarvara Alexeevna\'s attacks, and even contriving to turn these into\njokes.\n\nBut he could not stay at home. In the first place his wife sent him\naway, saying that he would fall ill if he always remained with her; and,\nsecondly, the farming was progressing in a way that demanded his\npresence at every step. He could not stay at home; but was in the\nfields, in the wood, in the garden, at the thrashing-floor; and\neverywhere, not merely the thought but the vivid image of Stepanida\npursued him, and he only occasionally forgot her. But that would not\nhave mattered, he could perhaps have mastered his feeling; but what was\nworst of all was that, whereas he had previously lived for months\nwithout seeing her, he now continually came across her. She evidently\nunderstood that he wished to renew relations with her, and tried to come\nin his way. Nothing was said either by him or by her, and therefore\nneither he nor she went directly to a rendezvous, but only sought\nopportunities of meeting.\n\nThe place where it was possible for them to meet each other was in the\nforest, where peasant-women went with sacks to collect grass for their\ncows. Eugene knew this and therefore went every day by that wood. Every\nday he told himself that he would not go there, and every day it ended\nby his making his way to the forest and, on hearing the sound of voices,\nstanding behind the bushes with sinking heart looking to see if she was\nthere.\n\nWhy he wanted to know whether it was she who was there, he did not know.\nIf it had been she and she had been alone, he would not have gone to\nher--so he believed--he would have run away; but he wanted to see her.\n\nOnce he met her. As he was entering the forest she came out of it with\ntwo other women, carrying a heavy sack, full of grass, on her back. A\nlittle earlier he would perhaps have met her in the forest. But now,\nwith the other women there, she could not go back to him in the forest.\nBut though he realized this impossibility, he stood for a long time, at\nthe risk of attracting the other women\'s attention, behind a hazel-bush.\nOf course she did not return, but he stayed there a long time. And,\ngreat heavens, how delightful his imagination made her appear to him!\nAnd this not once, but five or six times. And each time more intensely.\nNever had she seemed so attractive, and never had he been so completely\nin her power.\n\nHe felt that he had lost control of himself and had become almost\ninsane. His strictness with himself was not weakened a jot; on the\ncontrary he saw all the abomination of his desire and even of his\naction, for his going to the wood was an action. He knew that he only\nneed come near her anywhere in the dark, and if possible touch her, and\nhe would yield to his feelings. He knew that it was only shame before\npeople, before her, and no doubt before himself also, that restrained\nhim. And he knew too that he had sought conditions in which that shame\nwould not be apparent--darkness or proximity--in which it would be\nstifled by animal passion. And therefore he knew that he was a wretched\ncriminal, and despised and hated himself with all his soul. He hated\nhimself because he still had not surrendered: every day he prayed God to\nstrengthen him, to save him from perishing; every day he determined that\nfrom to-day onward he would not take a step to see her, and would forget\nher. Every day he devised means of delivering himself from this\nenticement, and he made use of those means.\n\nBut it was all in vain.\n\nOne of the means was continual occupation; another was intense physical\nwork and fasting; a third was imagining clearly to himself the shame\nthat would fall upon him when everybody knew of it--his wife, his\nmother-in-law, and the folk around. He did all this, and it seemed to\nhim that he was conquering, but the hour came, midday: the hour of their\nformer meetings and the hour when he had met her carrying the grass, and\nhe went to the forest. Thus five days of torment passed. He only saw her\nfrom a distance, but did not once encounter her.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nLiza was gradually recovering, she could move about and was only uneasy\nat the change that had taken place in her husband, which she did not\nunderstand.\n\nVarvara Alexeevna had gone away for a while and the only visitor was\nEugene\'s uncle. Mary Pavlovna was as usual at home.\n\nEugene was in his semi-insane condition when there came two days of\npouring rain, as often happens after thunder in June. The rain stopped\nall work. They even ceased carting manure, on account of the dampness\nand dirt. The peasants remained at home. The herdsmen wore themselves\nout with the cattle, and eventually drove them home. The cows and sheep\nwandered about in the pastureland and ran loose in the grounds. The\npeasant-women, barefoot and wrapped in shawls, splashing through the mud\nrushed about to seek the runaway cows. Streams flowed everywhere along\nthe paths, all the leaves and all the grass were saturated with water,\nand streams flowed unceasingly from the spouts into the bubbling\npuddles.\n\nEugene sat at home with his wife who was particularly wearisome that\nday. She questioned Eugene several times as to the cause of his\ndiscontent; and he replied with vexation that nothing was the matter.\nShe ceased questioning him, but was still distressed.\n\nThey were sitting after breakfast in the drawing-room. His uncle for the\nhundredth time was recounting fabrications about his society\nacquaintances. Liza was knitting a jacket and sighed, complaining of the\nweather and of a pain in the small of her back. The uncle advised her to\nlie down, and asked for vodka for himself. It was terribly dull for\nEugene in the house. Everything was weak and dull. He read a book and a\nmagazine, but understood nothing of them.\n\n"Yes, I must go out and look at the rasping-machine they brought\nyesterday," said he. He got up and went out.\n\n"Take an umbrella with you."\n\n"Oh, no, I have a leather coat. And I am only going as far as the\nboiling-room."\n\nHe put on his boots and his leather coat and went to the factory; but he\nhad not gone twenty steps before, coming towards him, he met her with\nher skirts tucked up high above her white calves. She was walking,\nholding down the shawl in which her head and shoulders were wrapped.\n\n"Where are you going?" said he, not recognizing her the first instant.\nWhen he recognized her it was already too late. She stopped, smiling,\nand looked long at him.\n\n"I am looking for a calf. Where are you off to in such weather?" said\nshe, as if she were seeing him every day.\n\n"Come to the shed," said he suddenly, without knowing how he said it. It\nwas as if someone else had uttered the words.\n\nShe bit her shawl, winked, and ran in the direction which led from the\ngarden to the shed, but he continued his path, intending to turn off\nbeyond the lilac-bush and go there too.\n\n"Master," he heard a voice behind him. "The mistress is calling you, and\nwants you to come back for a minute."\n\nThis was Misha, his man-servant.\n\n"My God! This is the second time you have saved me," thought Eugene, and\nimmediately turned back. His wife reminded him that he had promised to\ntake some medicine at the dinner-hour to a sick woman, and he had better\ntake it with him.\n\nWhile they were getting the medicine some five minutes elapsed, and\nthen, going away with the medicine, he hesitated to go direct to the\nshed, lest he should be seen from the house, but as soon as he was out\nof sight he promptly turned and made his way to it. He already saw her\nin imagination, inside the shed, smiling gaily. But she was not there,\nand there was nothing in the shed to show that she had been there.\n\nHe was already thinking that she had not come, had not heard or\nunderstood his words--he had muttered them through his nose as if afraid\nof her hearing them--or perhaps she had not wanted to come. "And why did\nI imagine that she would rush to me? She has her own husband; it is only\nI who am such a wretch as to have a wife, and a good one, and to run\nafter another." Thus he thought sitting in the shed, the thatch of which\nhad a leak and dripped from its straw. "But how delightful it would be\nif she did come,--alone here in this rain. If only I could embrace her\nonce again; then let happen what may. But yes," he recollected, "one\ncould tell if she has been here by her footprints." He looked at the\ntrodden ground near the shed and at the path overgrown by grass; and the\nfresh print of bare feet, and even of one that had slipped, was visible.\n"Yes, she has been here. Well now it is settled. Wherever I may see her\nI shall go straight to her. I will go to her at night." He sat for a\nlong time in the shed, and left it exhausted and crushed. He delivered\nthe medicine, returned home, and lay down in his room to wait for\ndinner.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nBefore dinner Liza came to him and, still wondering what could be the\ncause of his discontent, began to say that she was afraid that he did\nnot like the idea of her going to Moscow for her confinement, and that\nshe had decided that she would remain at home and would on no account go\nto Moscow. He knew how she feared both her confinement itself and the\nrisk of not having a healthy child, and therefore he could not help\nbeing touched at seeing how ready she was to sacrifice everything for\nhis sake. All was so nice, so pleasant, so clean, in the house; and in\nhis soul it was so dirty, despicable, and horrid. The whole evening\nEugene was tormented by knowing that notwithstanding his sincere\nrepulsion at his own weakness, notwithstanding his firm intention to\nbreak off,--the same thing would happen again to-morrow.\n\n"No, this is impossible," he said to himself, walking up and down in his\nroom. "There must be some remedy for it. My God! What am I to do?"\n\nSomeone knocked at the door as foreigners do. He knew this must be his\nuncle. "Come in," he said.\n\nThe uncle had come as a self-appointed ambassador from Liza.\n\n"Do you know, I really do notice that there is a change in you," he\nsaid,--"and Liza--I understand how it troubles her. I understand that\nit must be hard for you to leave all the business you have so\nexcellently started, but _que veux-tu_?[3] I should advise you to go\naway. It will be more satisfactory both for you and for her. And do you\nknow, I should advise you to go to the Crimea. The climate is beautiful\nand there is an excellent _accoucheur_ there, and you would be just in\ntime for the best of the grape season."\n\n"Uncle," Eugene suddenly exclaimed. "Can you keep a secret? A secret\nthat is terrible to me, a shameful secret."\n\n"Oh, come--do you really feel any doubt of me?"\n\n"Uncle, you can help me. Not only help, but save me!" said Eugene. And\nthe thought that he would disclose his secret to his uncle whom he did\nnot respect, the thought that he would show himself in the worst light\nand humiliate himself before him, was pleasant. He felt himself to be\ndespicable and guilty, and wished to punish himself.\n\n"Speak, my dear fellow, you know how fond I am of you," said the uncle,\nevidently well content that there was a secret and that it was a\nshameful one, and that it would be communicated to him, and that he\ncould be of use.\n\n"First of all I must tell you that I am a wretch, a good-for-nothing, a\nscoundrel--a real scoundrel."\n\n"Now what are you saying . . ." began his uncle, as if he were offended.\n\n"What! Not a wretch when I,--Liza\'s husband, Liza\'s! One has only to\nknow her purity, her love--and that I, her husband, want to be untrue to\nher with a peasant-woman!"\n\n"How\'s that? Why do you want to--you have not been unfaithful to her?"\n\n"Yes, at least just the same as being untrue, for it did not depend on\nme. I was ready to do so. I was hindered, or else I should . . . now. I\ndo not know what I should have done . . ."\n\n"But please, explain to me . . ."\n\n"Well, it is like this. When I was a bachelor I was stupid enough to\nhave relations with a woman here in our village. That is to say, I used\nto have meetings with her in the forest, in the field . . ."\n\n"Was she pretty?" asked his uncle.\n\nEugene frowned at this question, but he was in such need of external\nhelp that he made as if he did not hear it, and continued:\n\n"Well, I thought this was just casual and that I should break it off and\nhave done with it. And I did break it off before my marriage. For nearly\na year I did not see her or think about her." It seemed strange to\nEugene himself to hear the description of his own condition,--"Then\nsuddenly, I don\'t myself know why,--really one sometimes believes in\nwitchcraft--I saw her, and a worm crept into my heart--and it gnaws. I\nreproach myself, I understood the full horror of my action, that is to\nsay, of the act I may commit any moment, and yet I myself turned to it,\nand if I have not committed it is only because God preserved me.\nYesterday I was on my way to see her when Liza sent for me."\n\n"What, in the rain?"\n\n"Yes; I am worn out, Uncle, and have decided to confess to you and to\nask your help."\n\n"Yes, of course, it\'s a bad thing on your own estate. People will get to\nknow. I understand that Liza is weak and that it is necessary to spare\nher, but why on your own estate?"\n\nAgain Eugene tried not to hear what his uncle was saying, and hurried on\nto the core of the matter.\n\n"Yes, save me from myself. That is what I ask of you. To-day I was\nhindered by chance. But to-morrow or next time no one will hinder me.\nAnd she knows now. Don\'t leave me alone."\n\n"Yes, all right," said his uncle,--"but are you really so in love?"\n\n"Ah, it is not that at all. It is not that, it is some kind of power\nthat has seized me and holds me. I do not know what to do. Perhaps I\nshall gain strength, and then . . ."\n\n"Well, it turns out as I suggested," said his uncle. "Let us be off to\nthe Crimea."\n\n"Yes, yes, let us go; and meanwhile you will be with me, and will talk\nto me."\n\n\n[Footnote 3: What will you have?]\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nThe fact that Eugene had confided his secret to his uncle, but chiefly\nthe sufferings of his conscience and the feeling of shame he experienced\nafter that rainy day, sobered him. It was settled that they would start\nfor Yalta in a week\'s time. During that week Eugene drove to town to get\nmoney for the journey, gave instructions from the house and from the\noffice concerning the management of the estate, again became gay and\nfriendly with his wife, and began to awaken morally.\n\nSo without having once seen Stepanida after that rainy day he left with\nhis wife for the Crimea. There he spent an excellent two months. He\nreceived so many new impressions that it seemed to him that the past was\nobliterated from his memory. In the Crimea they met former acquaintances\nand became particularly friendly with them, and they also made new\nacquaintances. Life in the Crimea was a continual holiday for Eugene,\nbesides being instructive and beneficial. They became friendly there\nwith the former Marshal of the Nobility of their province; a clever and\nLiberal-minded man, who became fond of Eugene and coached him, and\nattracted him to his Party.\n\nAt the end of August Liza gave birth to a beautiful, healthy daughter,\nand her confinement was unexpectedly easy.\n\nIn September they returned home, the four of them, including the baby\nand its wet-nurse, as Liza was unable to nurse it herself. Eugene\nreturned home entirely free from the former horrors and quite a new and\nhappy man. Having gone through all that a husband goes through when his\nwife bears a child, he loved his wife more than ever. His feeling for\nthe child when he took it in his arms, was a funny, new, very pleasant\nand, as it were, a tickling feeling. Another new thing in his life now\nwas that, besides his occupation with the estate, thanks to his\nacquaintance with Dumchin (the ex-Marshal) a new interest occupied his\nmind, that of the Zemstvo--partly an ambitious interest, partly a\nfeeling of duty. In October there was to be a special Assembly, at which\nhe was to be elected. After arriving home he drove once to town and\nanother time to Dumchin.\n\nOf the torments of his temptation and struggle he had forgotten even to\nthink, and could with difficulty recall them to mind. It seemed to him\nsomething like an attack of insanity he had undergone.\n\nTo such an extent did he now feel free from it that he was not even\nafraid to make inquiries on the first occasion when he remained alone\nwith the steward. As he had previously spoken to him about the matter he\nwas not ashamed to ask.\n\n"Well, and is Sidor Pechnikov still away from home?" he inquired.\n\n"Yes, he is still in town."\n\n"And his wife?"\n\n"Oh, she is a worthless woman. She is now carrying on with Zenovi. She\nhas quite gone on the loose."\n\n"Well, that is all right," thought Eugene. "How wonderfully indifferent\nto it I am! How I have changed."\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nAll that Eugene had wished had been realized. He had obtained the\nproperty, the factory was working successfully, the beet-crops were\nexcellent, and his expected income would be a large one; his wife had\nborne a child satisfactorily, his mother-in-law had left, and he had\nbeen unanimously elected to the Zemstvo.\n\nEugene was returning home from town after the election. He had been\ncongratulated and had had to return thanks. He had had dinner and had\ndrunk some five glasses of champagne. Quite new plans of life now\npresented themselves to him. He was driving home and thinking about\nthese. It was the Indian summer: an excellent road and a hot sun. As he\napproached his home Eugene was thinking of how, as a result of this\nelection, he would occupy among the people the position of which he had\nalways dreamed; that is to say, one in which he would be able to serve\nthem not only by production, which gave employment, but also by direct\ninfluence. He imagined how in another three years his own and the other\npeasants would think of him. "For instance this one," he thought,\ndriving just then through the village and glancing at a peasant who with\na peasant-woman was crossing the street in front of him carrying a full\nwater-tub. They stopped to let his carriage pass. The peasant was old\nPechnikov, and the woman was Stepanida. Eugene looked at her, recognized\nher, and was glad to feel that he remained quite tranquil. She was still\nas good-looking as ever, but this did not touch him at all. He drove\nhome.\n\n"Well, may we congratulate you?" said his uncle.\n\n"Yes, I was elected."\n\n"Capital! We must drink to it!"\n\nNext day Eugene drove about to see to the farming which he had been\nneglecting. At the outlying farmstead a new thrashing machine was at\nwork. While watching it Eugene stepped among the women, trying not to\ntake notice of them; but try as he would he once or twice noticed the\nblack eyes and red kerchief of Stepanida, who was carrying away the\nstraw. Once or twice he glanced sideways at her and felt that something\nwas happening, but could not account for it to himself. Only next day,\nwhen he again drove to the thrashing-floor and spent two hours there\nquite unnecessarily, without ceasing to caress with his eyes the\nfamiliar, handsome figure of the young woman, did he feel that he was\nlost, irremediably lost. Again those torments! Again all that horror and\nfear, and there was no saving himself.\n\n\nWhat he expected happened to him. The evening of the next day, without\nknowing how, he found himself at her back-yard, by her hay-shed, where\nin autumn they had once had a meeting. As though having a stroll, he\nstopped there lighting a cigarette. A neighbouring peasant-woman saw\nhim, and as he turned back he heard her say to someone: "Go, he is\nwaiting for you,--on my dying word he is standing there. Go, you fool!"\n\nHe saw how a woman--she--ran to the hay-shed; but as a peasant had met\nhim, it was no longer possible for him to turn back, and so he went\nhome.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nWhen he entered the drawing-room everything seemed strange and unnatural\nto him. He had risen that morning vigorous, determined to fling it all\naside, to forget it and not to allow himself to think about it. But\nwithout noticing how it occurred he had all the morning not merely not\ninterested himself in the work, but tried to avoid it. What had formerly\nbeen important and had cheered him, was now insignificant. Unconsciously\nhe tried to free himself from business. It seemed to him that he had to\ndo so in order to think and to plan. And he freed himself and remained\nalone. But as soon as he was alone he began to wander about in the\ngarden and the forest. And all those spots were besmirched in his\nrecollection by memories that gripped him. He felt that he was walking\nin the garden and pretending to himself that he was thinking out\nsomething, but that really he was not thinking out anything, but\ninsanely and unreasonably expecting her; expecting that by some miracle\nshe would be aware that he was expecting her, and would come here at\nonce and go somewhere where no one would see them, or would come at\nnight when there would be no moon and no one, not even she herself,\nwould see,--on such a night she would come and he would touch her\nbody. . . .\n\n"There now, talking of breaking off when I wish to," said he to himself.\n"Yes, and that is having a clean healthy woman for one\'s health\'s sake!\nNo, it seems one can\'t play with her like that. I thought I had taken\nher, but it was she who took me; took me and does not let me go. Why, I\nthought I was free, but I was not free and was deceiving myself when I\nmarried. It was all nonsense,--fraud. From the time I had her I\nexperienced a new feeling, the real feeling of a husband. Yes, I ought\nto have lived with her.\n\n"One of two lives is possible for me: that which I began with Liza:\nservice, estate management, the child, and people\'s respect. If that is\nlife, it is necessary that she, Stepanida, should not be there. She must\nbe sent away, as I said, or destroyed so that she shall not exist. And\nthe other life--is this. For me to take her away from her husband, pay\nhim money, disregard the shame and disgrace, and live with her. But in\nthat case it is necessary that Liza should not exist, nor Mimi (the\nbaby). No, that is not so, the baby does not matter, but it is necessary\nthat there should be no Liza,--that she should go away--that she should\nknow, curse me, and go away. That she should know that I have exchanged\nher for a peasant-woman, that I am a deceiver and a scoundrel!--No, that\nis too terrible! It is impossible. But it might happen," he went on\nthinking,--"it might happen that Liza might fall ill and die. Die, and\nthen everything would be capital.\n\n"Capital! Oh, scoundrel! No, if someone must die it should be she. If\nshe, Stepanida, were to die, how good it would be.\n\n"Yes, that is how men come to poison or kill their wives or lovers. Take\na revolver and go and call her, and instead of embracing her, shoot her\nin the breast and have done with it.\n\n"Really she is--a devil. Simply a devil. She has possessed herself of me\nagainst my own will.\n\n"Kill? Yes. There are only two ways out: to kill my wife, or her. For it\nis impossible to live like this.[4] It is impossible. I must consider\nthe matter and look ahead. If things remain as they are what will\nhappen? I shall again be saying to myself that I do not wish it and that\nI will throw her off, but I shall only say it, and in the evening I\nshall be at her back-yard,--and she will know it and will come out. And\nif people know of it and tell my wife, or if I tell her myself,--for I\ncan\'t lie--I shall not be able to live so. I cannot! People will know.\nThey will all know--Parasha and the blacksmith. Well, is it possible to\nlive so?"\n\n[Footnote 4: At this place the alternative ending, printed at the end of\nthe story, begins.]\n\n"Impossible. There are only two ways out: to kill my wife, or to kill\nher. Yes, or else . . . Ah, yes, there is a third way: to kill myself,"\nsaid he softly, and suddenly a shudder ran over his skin. "Yes, kill\nmyself, then I shall not need to kill them." He became frightened, for\nhe felt that only that way was possible. He had a revolver. "Shall I\nreally kill myself? It is something I never thought of,--how strange it\nwill be . . ."\n\nHe returned to his study and at once opened the cupboard where the\nrevolver lay, but before he had taken it out of its case, his wife\nentered the room.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nHe threw a newspaper over the revolver.\n\n"Again the same!" said she aghast when she had looked at him.\n\n"What is the same?"\n\n"The same terrible expression that you had before and would not explain\nto me. Jenya, dear one, tell me about it. I see that you are suffering.\nTell me and you will feel easier. Whatever it may be, it will be better\nthan for you to suffer so. Don\'t I know that it is nothing bad."\n\n"You know? While . . ."\n\n"Tell me, tell me, tell me. I won\'t let you go."\n\nHe smiled a piteous smile.\n\n"Shall I?--No, it is impossible. And there is nothing to tell."\n\nPerhaps he might have told her, but at that moment the wet-nurse entered\nto ask if she should go for a walk. Liza went out to dress the baby.\n\n"Then you will tell me? I will be back directly."\n\n"Yes, perhaps . . ."\n\nShe never could forget the piteous smile with which he said this. She\nwent out.\n\nHurriedly, stealthily like a robber, he seized the revolver and took it\nout of its case. It was loaded, yes, but long ago, and one cartridge was\nmissing.\n\n"Well, how will it be?" He put it to his temple and hesitated a little,\nbut as soon as he remembered Stepanida,--his decision not to see her,\nhis struggle, temptation, fall, and renewed struggle,--he shuddered with\nhorror. "No, this is better," and he pulled the trigger . . .\n\nWhen Liza ran into the room--she had only had time to step down from the\nbalcony--he was lying face downwards on the floor: black, warm blood was\ngushing from the wound, and his corpse was twitching.\n\nThere was an inquest. No one could understand or explain the suicide. It\nnever even entered his uncle\'s head that its cause could be anything in\ncommon with the confession Eugene had made to him two months previously.\n\nVarvara Alexeevna assured them that she had always foreseen it. It had\nbeen evident from his way of disputing. Neither Liza nor Mary Pavlovna\ncould at all understand why it had happened, but still they did not\nbelieve what the doctors said, namely, that he was mentally deranged--a\npsychopath. They were quite unable to accept this, for they knew he was\nsaner than hundreds of their acquaintances.\n\nAnd indeed if Eugene Irtenev was mentally deranged everyone is similarly\ninsane; the most mentally deranged people are certainly those who see in\nothers indications of insanity they do not notice in themselves.\n\n\n\n\nVARIATION OF THE CONCLUSION OF\n_THE DEVIL_\n\n\n"To kill, yes. There were only two ways out: to kill his wife, or to\nkill her. For it is impossible to live like this," said he to himself,\nand going up to the table he took from it a revolver which, having\nexamined--one cartridge was wanting--he put in his trouser pocket.\n\n"My God! What am I doing?" he suddenly exclaimed, and folding his hands\nhe began to pray.\n\n"Oh, God, help me and deliver me. Thou knowest that I do not desire\nevil, but by myself am powerless. Help me," said he, making the sign of\nthe cross on his breast before the icon.\n\n"Yes, I can control myself. I will go out, walk about and think things\nover."\n\nHe went to the entrance-hall, put on his overcoat and went out on to the\nporch. Unconsciously his steps took him past the garden along the field\npath to the outlying farmstead. There the thrashing machine was still\ndroning and the cries of the driver-lads were heard. He entered the\nbarn. She was there. He saw her at once. She was raking up the corn, and\non seeing him she, with laughing eyes, ran briskly and merrily over the\nscattered corn, raking it up with agility. Eugene could not help\nwatching her though he did not wish it. He only recollected himself when\nshe was no longer in sight. The clerk informed him that they were now\nfinishing thrashing the corn that had been beaten down--that was why it\nwas going slower and the output was less. Eugene went up to the drum,\nwhich occasionally gave a knock as sheaves not evenly fed in passed\nunder it, and he asked the clerk if there were many such sheaves of\nbeaten-down corn.\n\n"There will be five cartloads of it."\n\n"Then look here . . ." began Eugene, but he did not finish the sentence.\nShe had gone close up to the drum and was raking the corn from under it,\nand she scorched him with her laughing eyes. That look spoke of a merry\ncareless love between them, of the fact that she knew he wanted her and\nhad come to her shed, and that she, as always, was ready to live and be\nmerry with him regardless of all conditions or consequences. Eugene felt\nhimself to be in her power, but did not wish to yield.\n\nHe remembered his prayer and tried to repeat it. He began saying it to\nhimself, but at once felt that it was useless. A single thought now\nengrossed him entirely: how to arrange a meeting with her so that the\nothers should not notice it.\n\n"If we finish this lot to-day, are we to start on a fresh stack or leave\nit till to-morrow?" asked the clerk.\n\n"Yes, yes," replied Eugene, involuntarily following her to the heap to\nwhich with the other women she was raking the corn.\n\n"But can I really not master myself?" said he to himself. "Have I really\nperished? Oh, God! But there is no God. There is only a devil. And it is\nshe. She has possessed me. But I won\'t, I won\'t! A devil, yes, a devil."\n\nAgain he went up to her, drew the revolver from his pocket and shot her,\nonce, twice, thrice, in the back. She ran a few steps and fell on the\nheap of corn.\n\n"Good Lord, oh dear! What is that?" cried the women.\n\n"No, it was not an accident. I killed her on purpose," cried Eugene.\n"Send for the police-officer."\n\nHe went home and, without speaking to his wife, went to his study and\nlocked himself in.\n\n"Do not come to me," he cried to his wife through the door. "You will\nknow all about it."\n\nAn hour later he rang, and bade the man-servant who answered the bell:\n"Go and find out whether Stepanida is alive."\n\nThe servant already knew all about it, and told him she had died an hour\nago.\n\n"Well, all right. Now leave me alone,--when the police-officer or the\nmagistrate comes, let me know."\n\nThe police-officer and magistrate arrived next morning, and Eugene,\nhaving bidden his wife and the baby farewell, was taken to prison.\n\nHe was tried. It was during the early days of trial by jury;[5] and the\nverdict was one of temporary insanity, and he was sentenced only to\nperform church penance.\n\nHe had been kept in prison for nine months and was then confined in a\nmonastery for one month.\n\n\n[Footnote 5: Trial by jury was introduced in 1864, and at first the\njuries were inclined to be extremely lenient to the prisoners.]\n'
