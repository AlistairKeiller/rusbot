But I warn you, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that this means war,\nif you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that\nAntichrist\xe2\x80\x94I really believe he is Antichrist\xe2\x80\x94I will have nothing\nmore to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my\n\xe2\x80\x98faithful slave,\xe2\x80\x99 as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I\nhave frightened you\xe2\x80\x94sit down and tell me all the news.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\nSch\xc3\xa9rer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress M\xc3\xa1rya F\xc3\xabdorovna.\nWith these words she greeted Prince Vas\xc3\xadli Kur\xc3\xa1gin, a man of high\nrank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering\nfrom la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used\nonly by the elite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10\xe2\x80\x94Annette\nSch\xc3\xa9rer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens! what a virulent attack!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the prince, not in the\nleast disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna,\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend\xe2\x80\x99s\nmind at rest,\xe2\x80\x9d said he without altering his tone, beneath the\npoliteness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony\ncould be discerned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times\nlike these if one has any feeling?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\nstaying the whole evening, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the fete at the English ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s? Today is Wednesday. I\nmust put in an appearance there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince. \xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter is\ncoming for me to take me there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought today\xe2\x80\x99s fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have\nbeen put off,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force\nof habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novos\xc3\xadltsev\xe2\x80\x99s\ndispatch? You know everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can one say about it?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the prince in a cold, listless\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\nburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale\npart. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna Sch\xc3\xa9rer on the contrary, despite her forty years,\noverflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had\nbecome her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not\nfeel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the\nexpectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it\ndid not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,\nas in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,\nwhich she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to\ncorrect.\n\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna burst\nout:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\nthings, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She\nis betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign\nrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one\nthing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform\nthe noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will\nnot forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of\nrevolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of\nthis murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just\none.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial\nspirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s\nloftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to\nfind, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer\ndid Novos\xc3\xadltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot\nunderstand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for\nhimself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they\npromised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not\nperform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and\nthat all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a\nword that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian\nneutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty\ndestiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you had been\nsent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King\nof Prussia\xe2\x80\x99s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me\na cup of tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a moment. \xc3\x80 propos,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, becoming calm again, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\nexpecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who\nis connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best\nFrench families. He is one of the genuine \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s, the good ones. And\nalso the Abb\xc3\xa9 Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been\nreceived by the Emperor. Had you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be delighted to meet them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\ntell me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just\noccurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief\nmotive of his visit, \xe2\x80\x9cis it true that the Dowager Empress wants\nBaron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all\naccounts is a poor creature.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were\ntrying through the Dowager Empress M\xc3\xa1rya F\xc3\xabdorovna to secure it for\nthe baron.\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor\nanyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was\npleased with.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her\nsister,\xe2\x80\x9d was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\n\nAs she named the Empress, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s face suddenly assumed an\nexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\nsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\npatroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke\nbeaucoup d\xe2\x80\x99estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\n\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and\ncourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\nwished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man\nrecommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she\nsaid:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came\nout everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly\nbeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often think,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer\nto the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political\nand social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate\nconversation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life\nare distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children?\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nadded in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than\nanyone, and so you don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to have them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince. \xe2\x80\x9cLavater would have said I\nlack the bump of paternity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know\nI am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves\xe2\x80\x9d (and her\nface assumed its melancholy expression), \xe2\x80\x9che was mentioned at Her\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s and you were pitied....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,\nawaiting a reply. He frowned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have me do?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I did all\na father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.\nHippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That\nis the only difference between them.\xe2\x80\x9d He said this smiling in a way\nmore natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round\nhis mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and\nunpleasant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a\nfather there would be nothing I could reproach you with,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna, looking up pensively.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my\nchildren are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That\nis how I explain it to myself. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a\ngesture. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna meditated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nasked. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who\nis very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess\nMary Bolk\xc3\xb3nskaya.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and\nperception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of\nthe head that he was considering this information.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad\ncurrent of his thoughts, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Anatole is costing me forty thousand\nrubles a year? And,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will it be in\nfive years, if he goes on like this?\xe2\x80\x9d Presently he added: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours\nrich?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is\nthe well-known Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski who had to retire from the army under\nthe late Emperor, and was nicknamed \xe2\x80\x98the King of Prussia.\xe2\x80\x99 He is\nvery clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy.\nShe has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.\nHe is an aide-de-camp of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s and will be here tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, dear Annette,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince, suddenly taking Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. \xe2\x80\x9cArrange\nthat affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe\nwith an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich\nand of good family and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the\nmaid of honor\xe2\x80\x99s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro\nas he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttendez,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, reflecting, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to\nLise, young Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the\nthing can be arranged. It shall be on your family\xe2\x80\x99s behalf that I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nstart my apprenticeship as old maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest\nPetersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age\nand character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, the beautiful H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, came to take her\nfather to the ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and\nher badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolk\xc3\xb3nskaya,\nknown as la femme la plus s\xc3\xa9duisante de P\xc3\xa9tersbourg, * was also there.\nShe had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did\nnot go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.\nThe Abb\xc3\xa9 Morio and many others had also come.\n\n     * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.\n\nTo each new arrival Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not yet seen my\naunt,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know my aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d and very gravely conducted\nhim or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her\ncap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests\nbegan to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her\naunt, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna mentioned each one\xe2\x80\x99s name and then left them.\n\nEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not\none of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them\ncared about; Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna observed these greetings with mournful and\nsolemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in\nthe same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her\nMajesty, \xe2\x80\x9cwho, thank God, was better today.\xe2\x80\x9d And each visitor,\nthough politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman\nwith a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not\nreturn to her the whole evening.\n\nThe young Princess Bolk\xc3\xb3nskaya had brought some work in a\ngold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a\ndelicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth,\nbut it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she\noccasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case\nwith a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect\xe2\x80\x94the shortness of her\nupper lip and her half-open mouth\xe2\x80\x94seemed to be her own special and\npeculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty\nyoung woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and\ncarrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones\nwho looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a\nlittle while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life\nand health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile\nand the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a\nspecially amiable mood that day.\n\nThe little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying\nsteps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat\ndown on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a\npleasure to herself and to all around her. \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought my work,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe added, turning to her hostess. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wrote that it was to be quite\na small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.\xe2\x80\x9d And she\nspread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray\ndress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone\nelse,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in\nFrench, turning to a general, \xe2\x80\x9cmy husband is deserting me? He is going\nto get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nadded, addressing Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, and without waiting for an answer she\nturned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a delightful woman this little princess is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with\nclose-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable\nat that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout\nyoung man was an illegitimate son of Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov, a well-known\ngrandee of Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man\nhad not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only\njust returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his\nfirst appearance in society. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna greeted him with the nod she\naccorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of\nthis lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight\nof something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face\nwhen she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than\nthe other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to\nthe clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which\ndistinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor\ninvalid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her\naunt as she conducted him to her.\n\nPierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as\nif in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little\nprincess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the\naunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s health.\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna in dismay detained him with the words: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the\nAbb\xc3\xa9 Morio? He is a most interesting man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very\ninteresting but hardly feasible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna in order to say something\nand get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now\ncommitted a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before\nshe had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to\nanother who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet\nspread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abb\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s\nplan chimerical.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will talk of it later,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna with a smile.\n\nAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she\nresumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready\nto help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As\nthe foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes\nround and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that\ncreaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the\nmachine or set it in proper motion, so Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna moved about her\ndrawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a\nword or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,\nproper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about\nPierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached\nthe group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and\nagain when he passed to another group whose center was the abb\xc3\xa9.\n\nPierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all\nthe intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a\nchild in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing\nany clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident\nand refined expression on the faces of those present he was always\nexpecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio.\nHere the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an\nopportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed\nsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,\nbeside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face\nwas rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had\nsettled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round\nthe abb\xc3\xa9. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful\nPrincess H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and the little Princess\nBolk\xc3\xb3nskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age.\nThe third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished\nmanners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of\npoliteness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in\nwhich he found himself. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna was obviously serving him up as\na treat to her guests. As a clever ma\xc3\xaetre d\xe2\x80\x99h\xc3\xb4tel serves up as a\nspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in\nthe kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna served up to\nher guests, first the vicomte and then the abb\xc3\xa9, as peculiarly choice\nmorsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the\nmurder of the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Enghien\nhad perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular\nreasons for Buonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s hatred of him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna,\nwith a pleasant feeling that there was something \xc3\xa0 la Louis XV in the\nsound of that sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cContez nous \xc3\xa7ela, Vicomte.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to\ncomply. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to\nlisten to his tale.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe vicomte knew the duc personally,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna to\none of the guests. \xe2\x80\x9cThe vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,\xe2\x80\x9d said she\nto another. \xe2\x80\x9cHow evidently he belongs to the best society,\xe2\x80\x9d said she\nto a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest\nand most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef\non a hot dish.\n\nThe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome over here, H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna to the\nbeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of\nanother group.\n\nThe princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which\nshe had first entered the room\xe2\x80\x94the smile of a perfectly beautiful\nwoman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss\nand ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling\ndiamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking\nat any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the\nprivilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders,\nback, and bosom\xe2\x80\x94which in the fashion of those days were very much\nexposed\xe2\x80\x94and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as\nshe moved toward Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne was so lovely that not only\ndid she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even\nappeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She\nseemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his\nshoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary\nwhen she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her\nunchanging smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\nsmilingly inclining his head.\n\nThe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered\na reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was\nbeing told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,\naltered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more\nbeautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time\nto time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story\nproduced an effect she glanced at Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, at once adopted just\nthe expression she saw on the maid of honor\xe2\x80\x99s face, and again relapsed\ninto her radiant smile.\n\nThe little princess had also left the tea table and followed H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get my work.... Now then, what are you\nthinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. \xe2\x80\x9cFetch me my\nworkbag.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking\nmerrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her\nseat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I am all right,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she\ntook up her work.\n\nPrince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and\nmoving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.\n\nLe charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance\nto his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of\nthis resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,\nself-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the\nwonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary\nwas dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen\nself-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and\nmouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms\nand legs always fell into unnatural positions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a ghost story?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, sitting down beside\nthe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this\ninstrument he could not begin to speak.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy no, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the astonished narrator, shrugging\nhis shoulders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I hate ghost stories,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Hippolyte in a tone\nwhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he\nhad uttered them.\n\nHe spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure\nwhether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in\na dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe\neffray\xc3\xa9e, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.\n\nThe vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,\nto the effect that the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to\nvisit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte,\nwho also enjoyed the famous actress\xe2\x80\x99 favors, and that in his presence\nNapoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was\nsubject, and was thus at the duc\xe2\x80\x99s mercy. The latter spared him, and\nthis magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.\n\nThe story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point\nwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked\nagitated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna with an inquiring glance at the\nlittle princess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into\nher work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story\nprevented her from going on with it.\n\nThe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully\nprepared to continue, but just then Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, who had kept a\nwatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was\ntalking too loudly and vehemently with the abb\xc3\xa9, so she hurried to the\nrescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abb\xc3\xa9 about\nthe balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young\nman\xe2\x80\x99s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both\nwere talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna disapproved.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of\nthe people,\xe2\x80\x9d the abb\xc3\xa9 was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only necessary for one\npowerful nation like Russia\xe2\x80\x94barbaric as she is said to be\xe2\x80\x94to place\nherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object\nthe maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the\nworld!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how are you to get that balance?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre was beginning.\n\nAt that moment Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,\nasked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian\xe2\x80\x99s\nface instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary\nexpression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the\nsociety, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had\nthe honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of\nthe climate,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nNot letting the abb\xc3\xa9 and Pierre escape, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, the more\nconveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the\nlarger circle.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nJust then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski, the little princess\xe2\x80\x99 husband. He was a very handsome young\nman, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about\nhim, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,\noffered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was\nevident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had\nfound them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to\nthem. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed\nto bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from\nher with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are off to the war, Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Kut\xc3\xbazov,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, speaking French and stressing\nthe last syllable of the general\xe2\x80\x99s name like a Frenchman, \xe2\x80\x9chas been\npleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Lise, your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will go to the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndr\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d said his wife, addressing her husband in the same\ncoquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, \xe2\x80\x9cthe vicomte has\nbeen telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from\nthe moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,\naffectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round\nPrince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was\ntouching his arm, but when he saw Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s beaming face he gave him an\nunexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now!... So you, too, are in the great world?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would be here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cI will come to supper\nwith you. May I?\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the\nvicomte who was continuing his story.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He\nwished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vas\xc3\xadli and his\ndaughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must excuse me, dear Vicomte,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Vas\xc3\xadli to the\nFrenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent\nhis rising. \xe2\x80\x9cThis unfortunate fete at the ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s deprives me\nof a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave\nyour enchanting party,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nHis daughter, Princess H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, passed between the chairs, lightly\nholding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more\nradiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,\nalmost frightened, eyes as she passed him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery lovely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\nIn passing Prince Vas\xc3\xadli seized Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s hand and said to Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna: \xe2\x80\x9cEducate this bear for me! He has been staying with me\na whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.\nNothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever\nwomen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his\nfather to be a connection of Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s. The elderly lady who\nhad been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed\nhad left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety\nand fear.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about my son Bor\xc3\xads, Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, hurrying after him into\nthe anteroom. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what\nnews I may take back to my poor boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlthough Prince Vas\xc3\xadli listened reluctantly and not very politely\nto the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an\ningratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go\naway.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he\nwould be transferred to the Guards at once?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should\nadvise you to appeal to Rumy\xc3\xa1ntsev through Prince Gol\xc3\xadtsyn. That would\nbe the best way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe elderly lady was a Princess Drubetsk\xc3\xa1ya, belonging to one of the\nbest families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of\nsociety had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to\nPetersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son.\nIt was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vas\xc3\xadli that she had obtained an\ninvitation to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s reception and had sat listening to\nthe vicomte\xe2\x80\x99s story. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s words frightened her, an\nembittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment;\nthen she smiled again and clutched Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s arm more tightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never yet asked you\nfor anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake to\ndo this for my son\xe2\x80\x94and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe added hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, but promise! I have asked\nGol\xc3\xadtsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, we shall be late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, turning her\nbeautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she\nstood waiting by the door.\n\nInfluence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized\nif it is to last. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli knew this, and having once realized\nthat if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be\nunable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But\nin Princess Drubetsk\xc3\xa1ya\xe2\x80\x99s case he felt, after her second appeal,\nsomething like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was\nquite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in\nhis career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of\nthose women\xe2\x80\x94mostly mothers\xe2\x80\x94who, having once made up their minds,\nwill not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if\nnecessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even\nto make scenes. This last consideration moved him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna,\xe2\x80\x9d said he with his usual familiarity and\nweariness of tone, \xe2\x80\x9cit is almost impossible for me to do what you\nask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father\xe2\x80\x99s\nmemory, I will do the impossible\xe2\x80\x94your son shall be transferred to the\nGuards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you\xe2\x80\x94I knew your\nkindness!\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait\xe2\x80\x94just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are on good terms with Michael Ilari\xc3\xb3novich\nKut\xc3\xbazov ... recommend Bor\xc3\xads to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at\nrest, and then...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t promise that. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how Kut\xc3\xbazov is pestered\nsince his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that\nall the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as\nadjutants.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but do promise! I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you go! My dear benefactor...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa,\xe2\x80\x9d said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe shall be late.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; but about Kut\xc3\xbazov, I don\xe2\x80\x99t promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo promise, do promise, Vas\xc3\xadli!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna as he\nwent, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably\ncame naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.\n\nApparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed\nall the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face\nresumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the\ngroup where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to\nlisten, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was\naccomplished.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at\nMilan?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, \xe2\x80\x9cand of the comedy of the people of\nGenoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and\nMonsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of\nthe nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one\xe2\x80\x99s head whirl! It is as\nif the whole world had gone crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew looked Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna straight in the face with a\nsarcastic smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Dieu me la donne, gare \xc3\xa0 qui la touche!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 * They say he was\nvery fine when he said that,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, repeating the words in\nItalian: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Dio mi l\xe2\x80\x99ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\n\n     * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run\nover,\xe2\x80\x9d Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sovereigns will not be able to\nendure this man who is a menace to everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,\xe2\x80\x9d said the vicomte, polite\nbut hopeless: \xe2\x80\x9cThe sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis\nXVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d and he became\nmore animated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd believe me, they are reaping the reward of their\nbetrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending\nambassadors to compliment the usurper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.\n\nPrince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time\nthrough his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the\nlittle princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Cond\xc3\xa9\ncoat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity\nas if she had asked him to do it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cB\xc3\xa2ton de gueules, engr\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9 de gueules d\xe2\x80\x99azur\xe2\x80\x94maison Cond\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid he.\n\nThe princess listened, smiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,\xe2\x80\x9d the\nvicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which\nhe is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but\nfollows the current of his own thoughts, \xe2\x80\x9cthings will have gone too\nfar. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society\xe2\x80\x94I\nmean good French society\xe2\x80\x94will have been forever destroyed, and\nthen....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to\nmake a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna,\nwho had him under observation, interrupted:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor Alexander,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with the melancholy which\nalways accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, \xe2\x80\x9chas\ndeclared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose\ntheir own form of government; and I believe that once free from the\nusurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms\nof its rightful king,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, trying to be amiable to the\nroyalist emigrant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is doubtful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur le Vicomte quite\nrightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will\nbe difficult to return to the old regime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom what I have heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, blushing and breaking into\nthe conversation, \xe2\x80\x9calmost all the aristocracy has already gone over to\nBonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s side.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the Buonapartists who say that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the vicomte without\nlooking at Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the present time it is difficult to know the\nreal state of French public opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBonaparte has said so,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic\nsmile.\n\nIt was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his\nremarks at him, though without looking at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow\nit,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s words. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I opened my antechambers and they crowded\nin.\xe2\x80\x99 I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the vicomte. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the murder of the\nduc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some\npeople,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, turning to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, \xe2\x80\x9che ever was a hero,\nafter the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one\nhero less on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBefore Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna and the others had time to smile their\nappreciation of the vicomte\xe2\x80\x99s epigram, Pierre again broke into the\nconversation, and though Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna felt sure he would say something\ninappropriate, she was unable to stop him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe execution of the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Enghien,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Monsieur Pierre,\n\xe2\x80\x9cwas a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon\nshowed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole\nresponsibility of that deed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDieu! Mon Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna in a terrified whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows\ngreatness of soul?\xe2\x80\x9d said the little princess, smiling and drawing her\nwork nearer to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed several voices.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his\nknee with the palm of his hand.\n\nThe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his\naudience over his spectacles and continued.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say so,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued desperately, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the Bourbons fled\nfrom the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone\nunderstood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,\nhe could not stop short for the sake of one man\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you come over to the other table?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nBut Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, becoming more and more eager, \xe2\x80\x9cNapoleon is great\nbecause he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,\npreserved all that was good in it\xe2\x80\x94equality of citizenship and freedom\nof speech and of the press\xe2\x80\x94and only for that reason did he obtain\npower.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to\ncommit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have\ncalled him a great man,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the vicomte.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might\nrid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great\nman. The Revolution was a grand thing!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Monsieur Pierre,\nbetraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme\nyouth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...\nBut won\xe2\x80\x99t you come to this other table?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRousseau\xe2\x80\x99s Contrat Social,\xe2\x80\x9d said the vicomte with a tolerant\nsmile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,\xe2\x80\x9d again interjected an\nironical voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most\nimportant. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from\nprejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon\nhas retained in full force.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiberty and equality,\xe2\x80\x9d said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at\nlast deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words\nwere, \xe2\x80\x9chigh-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does\nnot love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and\nequality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the\ncontrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the\nvicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s outburst Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, despite her social experience, was\nhorror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s sacrilegious words\nhad not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was\nimpossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in\na vigorous attack on the orator.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear Monsieur Pierre,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you explain the\nfact of a great man executing a duc\xe2\x80\x94or even an ordinary man who\xe2\x80\x94is\ninnocent and untried?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the vicomte, \xe2\x80\x9cto ask how monsieur explains\nthe 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not\nat all like the conduct of a great man!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nlittle princess, shrugging her shoulders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a low fellow, say what you will,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Prince Hippolyte.\n\nPierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His\nsmile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,\nhis grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by\nanother\xe2\x80\x94a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to\nask forgiveness.\n\nThe vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that\nthis young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were\nsilent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you expect him to answer you all at once?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nAndrew. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish\nbetween his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.\nSo it seems to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of\nthis reinforcement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne must admit,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Napoleon as a man\nwas great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he\ngave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts\nwhich it is difficult to justify.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to\ngo.\n\nSuddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,\nand asking them all to be seated began:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.\nExcuse me, Vicomte\xe2\x80\x94I must tell it in Russian or the point will be\nlost....\xe2\x80\x9d And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian\nas a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.\nEveryone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their\nattention to his story.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must\nhave two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her\ntaste. And she had a lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid, also big. She said....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHere Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with\ndifficulty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe said.... Oh yes! She said, \xe2\x80\x98Girl,\xe2\x80\x99 to the maid, \xe2\x80\x98put on a\nlivery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some\ncalls.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHere Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his\naudience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several\npersons, among them the elderly lady and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, did however\nsmile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and\nher long hair came down....\xe2\x80\x9d Here he could contain himself no\nlonger and went on, between gasps of laughter: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the whole world\nknew....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told\nit, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna and the\nothers appreciated Prince Hippolyte\xe2\x80\x99s social tact in so agreeably\nending Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote\nthe conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last\nand next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and\nwhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nHaving thanked Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began\nto take their leave.\n\nPierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge\nred hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing\nroom and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something\nparticularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was\nabsent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the\ngeneral\xe2\x80\x99s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume,\ntill the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and\ninability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by\nhis kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna turned toward\nhim and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his\nindiscretion, nodded and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope to see you again, but I also\nhope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody\nsaw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, \xe2\x80\x9cOpinions are\nopinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.\xe2\x80\x9d And\neveryone, including Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, felt this.\n\nPrince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders\nto the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened\nindifferently to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also\ncome into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant\nprincess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in, Annette, or you will catch cold,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little princess,\ntaking leave of Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is settled,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in a low\nvoice.\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she\ncontemplated between Anatole and the little princess\xe2\x80\x99 sister-in-law.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rely on you, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, also in a low tone.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au\nrevoir! \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she left the hall.\n\nPrince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face\nclose to her, began to whisper something.\n\nTwo footmen, the princess\xe2\x80\x99 and his own, stood holding a shawl and\na cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to\nthe French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of\nunderstanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual\nspoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad I did not go to the ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nHippolyte \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94so dull\xe2\x80\x94. It has been a delightful evening, has it\nnot? Delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say the ball will be very good,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the princess, drawing\nup her downy little lip. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the pretty women in society will be\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot all, for you will not be there; not all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Hippolyte\nsmiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he\neven pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from\nawkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the\nshawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as\nthough embracing her.\n\nStill smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her\nhusband. Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he\nseem.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked his wife, looking past her.\n\nPrince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion\nreached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch\nfollowing the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincesse, au revoir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well\nas with his feet.\n\nThe princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark\ncarriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under\npretense of helping, was in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,\ndisagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am expecting you, Pierre,\xe2\x80\x9d said the same voice, but gently and\naffectionately.\n\nThe postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte\nlaughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte\nwhom he had promised to take home.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mon cher,\xe2\x80\x9d said the vicomte, having seated himself beside\nHippolyte in the carriage, \xe2\x80\x9cyour little princess is very nice, very\nnice indeed, quite French,\xe2\x80\x9d and he kissed the tips of his fingers.\nHippolyte burst out laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,\xe2\x80\x9d\ncontinued the vicomte. \xe2\x80\x9cI pity the poor husband, that little officer\nwho gives himself the airs of a monarch.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you were\nsaying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to\nknow how to deal with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s study like\none quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took\nfrom the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s\nCommentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done to Mlle Sch\xc3\xa9rer? She will be quite ill now,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white\nhands.\n\nPierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager\nface to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat abb\xc3\xa9 is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the\nright light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but\xe2\x80\x94I do not\nknow how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract\nconversation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have\nyou at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a\ndiplomatist?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.\n\nPierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like either the one or the\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must decide on something! Your father expects it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abb\xc3\xa9 as tutor,\nand had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow\nhis father dismissed the abb\xc3\xa9 and said to the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cNow go\nto Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to\nanything. Here is a letter to Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, and here is money. Write\nto me all about it, and I will help you in everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre had\nalready been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided\non anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking.\nPierre rubbed his forehead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he must be a Freemason,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, referring to the abb\xc3\xa9 whom\nhe had met that evening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew again interrupted him, \xe2\x80\x9clet\nus talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted\nto tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for\nfreedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army;\nbut to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is\nnot right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s childish words.\nHe put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such\nnonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other\nanswer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this na\xc3\xafve question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no\nwars,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that would be splendid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew smiled ironically.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why are you going to the war?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I must. Besides that I am going....\xe2\x80\x9d He\npaused. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going because the life I am leading here does not suit\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe rustle of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress was heard in the next room. Prince\nAndrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it\nhad had in Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from\nthe sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house\ndress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely\nplaced a chair for her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it,\xe2\x80\x9d she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly\nand fussily in the easy chair, \xe2\x80\x9chow is it Annette never got married?\nHow stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying\nso, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you\nare, Monsieur Pierre!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am still arguing with your husband. I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why he\nwants to go to the war,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre, addressing the princess\nwith none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their\nintercourse with young women.\n\nThe princess started. Evidently Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s words touched her to the\nquick.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that is just what I tell him!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least understand why men can\xe2\x80\x99t live\nwithout wars. How is it that we women don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything of the kind,\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t need it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here\nhe is Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so\nwell known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the\nApr\xc3\xa1ksins\xe2\x80\x99 I heard a lady asking, \xe2\x80\x98Is that the famous Prince\nAndrew?\xe2\x80\x99 I did indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is so well received\neverywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know\nthe Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of\nhow to arrange it. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the\nconversation, gave no reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you starting?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of his going, don\xe2\x80\x99t! I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear it spoken\nof,\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which\nshe had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly\nill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday when I remembered that all these delightful associations\nmust be broken off ... and then you know, Andr\xc3\xa9...\xe2\x80\x9d (she looked\nsignificantly at her husband) \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d she\nwhispered, and a shudder ran down her back.\n\nHer husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides\nPierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of\nfrigid politeness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim\nof his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone\nin the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith my father and sister, remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew gently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to\nbe afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a\njoyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she\nfelt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the\ngist of the matter lay in that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still can\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you are afraid of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nAndrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.\n\nThe princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.\nPrince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.\n\nPierre looked over his spectacles with na\xc3\xafve surprise, now at him and\nnow at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the little\nprincess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful\ngrimace. \xe2\x80\x9cI have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed\nso to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no\npity for me. Why is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLise!\xe2\x80\x9d was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed\nan entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself\nregret her words. But she went on hurriedly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave\nlike that six months ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLise, I beg you to desist,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew still more\nemphatically.\n\nPierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to\nall this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the\nsight of tears and was ready to cry himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you\nI myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me!\nAn outsider is out of place here.... No, don\xe2\x80\x99t distress yourself....\nGood-by!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew caught him by the hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of\nthe pleasure of spending the evening with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he thinks only of himself,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the princess without\nrestraining her angry tears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLise!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch\nwhich indicates that patience is exhausted.\n\nSuddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess\xe2\x80\x99 pretty\nface changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes\nglanced askance at her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face, and her own assumed the timid,\ndeprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its\ndrooping tail.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu, mon Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered, and lifting her dress with one\nhand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night, Lise,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand\nas he would have done to a stranger.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre\ncontinually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead\nwith his small hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and have supper,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a sigh, going to the door.\n\nThey entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.\nEverything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore\nthat imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married.\nHalfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,\nwith a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on\nhis face, began to talk\xe2\x80\x94as one who has long had something on his mind\nand suddenly determines to speak out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never marry, my dear fellow! That\xe2\x80\x99s my advice: never marry\ntill you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of,\nand until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen\nher plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable\nmistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing\xe2\x80\x94or all that is\ngood and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles.\nYes! Yes! Yes! Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me with such surprise. If you marry\nexpecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every\nstep that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing\nroom, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an\nidiot!... But what\xe2\x80\x99s the good?...\xe2\x80\x9d and he waved his arm.\n\nPierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and\nthe good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend\nin amazement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cis an excellent woman, one\nof those rare women with whom a man\xe2\x80\x99s honor is safe; but, O God, what\nwould I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to\nwhom I mention this, because I like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\nwho had lolled in Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s easy chairs and with half-closed\neyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his\nthin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which\nthe fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant\nlight. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary\ntimes, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid\nirritation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why I say this,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is\nthe whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), \xe2\x80\x9cbut Bonaparte when\nhe worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing\nbut his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with\na woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you\nhave of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with\nregret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality\xe2\x80\x94these are\nthe enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war,\nthe greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for\nnothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Prince\nAndrew, \xe2\x80\x9cand at Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s they listen to me. And that stupid\nset without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only\nknew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is\nright. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everything\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\nwomen are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them\nin society it seems as if there were something in them, but there\xe2\x80\x99s\nnothing, nothing, nothing! No, don\xe2\x80\x99t marry, my dear fellow; don\xe2\x80\x99t\nmarry!\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems funny to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you, you should\nconsider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have\neverything before you, everything. And you....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he\nthought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can he talk like that?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. He considered his\nfriend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the\nhighest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might\nbe best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary\nmemory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything,\nand had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for\nwork and study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s lack\nof capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was\nparticularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a\nsign of strength.\n\nEven in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise\nand commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels\nthat they may run smoothly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy part is played out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of\ntalking about me? Let us talk about you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after a silence,\nsmiling at his reassuring thoughts.\n\nThat smile was immediately reflected on Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is there to say about me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, his face relaxing\ninto a careless, merry smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I? An illegitimate son!\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great\neffort to say this. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout a name and without means... And it\nreally...\xe2\x80\x9d But he did not say what \xe2\x80\x9cit really\xe2\x80\x9d was. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the\npresent I am free and am all right. Only I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the least idea what\nI am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance\xe2\x80\x94friendly and\naffectionate as it was\xe2\x80\x94expressed a sense of his own superiority.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our\nwhole set. Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re all right! Choose what you will; it\xe2\x80\x99s all the\nsame. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting\nthose Kur\xc3\xa1gins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so\nbadly\xe2\x80\x94all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have, my dear fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pierre, shrugging\nhis shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen, my dear fellow; women!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen who are\ncomme il faut, that\xe2\x80\x99s a different matter; but the Kur\xc3\xa1gins\xe2\x80\x99 set of\nwomen, \xe2\x80\x98women and wine\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre was staying at Prince Vas\xc3\xadli Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s and sharing the\ndissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to\nreform by marrying him to Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cseriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such\na life I can\xe2\x80\x99t decide or think properly about anything. One\xe2\x80\x99s head\naches, and one spends all one\xe2\x80\x99s money. He asked me for tonight, but I\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou give me your word of honor not to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my honor!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nIt was past one o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a\ncloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending\nto drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he\nfelt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light\nenough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like\nmorning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole\nKur\xc3\xa1gin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which\nthere was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind\nPierre was very fond of.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to go to Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\nBut he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go\nthere. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so\npassionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to\nthat he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his\npromise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it\nhe had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering;\n\xe2\x80\x9cbesides,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9call such \xe2\x80\x98words of honor\xe2\x80\x99 are\nconventional things with no definite meaning, especially if\none considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so\nextraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the\nsame!\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying\nall his decisions and intentions. He went to Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nReaching the large house near the Horse Guards\xe2\x80\x99 barracks, in which\nAnatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs,\nand went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty\nbottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of\nalcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.\n\nCards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed.\nPierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the\nremains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on\nthe sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of\nlaughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and\ngeneral commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously\nround an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one\npulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet a hundred on Stevens!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind, no holding on!\xe2\x80\x9d cried another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet on D\xc3\xb3lokhov!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a third. \xe2\x80\x9cKur\xc3\xa1gin, you part our\nhands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, leave Bruin alone; here\xe2\x80\x99s a bet on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt one draught, or he loses!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a fourth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJacob, bring a bottle!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow\nwho stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine\nlinen shirt unfastened in front. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, you fellows.... Here is\nP\xc3\xa9tya! Good man!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, addressing Pierre.\n\nAnother voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,\nparticularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober\nring, cried from the window: \xe2\x80\x9cCome here; part the bets!\xe2\x80\x9d This was\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, an officer of the Sem\xc3\xabnov regiment, a notorious gambler and\nduelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him\nmerrily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. What\xe2\x80\x99s it all about?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, and\ntaking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all you must drink!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at\nthe tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening\nto their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s glass while\nexplaining that D\xc3\xb3lokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval\nofficer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge\nof the third floor window with his legs hanging out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, you must drink it all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, giving Pierre the last\nglass, \xe2\x80\x9cor I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you go!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up\nto the window.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov was holding the Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s hand and clearly and distinctly\nrepeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to\nAnatole and Pierre.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He\nwas about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache,\nso that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly\nseen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle\nof the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm\nlower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually\nround the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute,\ninsolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it\nimpossible not to notice his face. D\xc3\xb3lokhov was a man of small means\nand no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of\nrubles, D\xc3\xb3lokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a\nfooting that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him\nmore than they did Anatole. D\xc3\xb3lokhov could play all games and nearly\nalways won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness.\nBoth Kur\xc3\xa1gin and D\xc3\xb3lokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes\nand scapegraces of Petersburg.\n\nThe bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone\nfrom sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who\nwere evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of\nthe gentlemen around.\n\nAnatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to\nsmash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but\ncould not move it. He smashed a pane.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a try, Hercules,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning to Pierre.\n\nPierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with\na crash.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it right out, or they\xe2\x80\x99ll think I\xe2\x80\x99m holding on,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst-rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, looking at D\xc3\xb3lokhov, who with a bottle\nof rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of\nthe sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window\nsill. \xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, standing there and addressing those in the\nroom. All were silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet fifty imperials\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he spoke French that the Englishman might\nunderstand him, but he did not speak it very well\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI bet fifty\nimperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?\xe2\x80\x9d added he,\naddressing the Englishman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, fifty,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the latter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of\nrum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this\nspot\xe2\x80\x9d (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window)\n\xe2\x80\x9cand without holding on to anything. Is that right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Englishman.\n\nAnatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons\nof his coat and looking down at him\xe2\x80\x94the Englishman was short\xe2\x80\x94began\nrepeating the terms of the wager to him in English.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xc3\xb3lokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window\nsill to attract attention. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, Kur\xc3\xa1gin. Listen! If\nanyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to\naccept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though\nhe kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the\nLife Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window\nsill, leaned over, and looked down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, looking down from the window at the\nstones of the pavement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up!\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xc3\xb3lokhov, pushing him away from the window. The\nlad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.\n\nPlacing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered\nhis legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself\non his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to\nthe left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and\nplaced them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit\nup from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in\nfront. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others\npresent, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted\nto seize hold of D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s shirt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, this is folly! He\xe2\x80\x99ll be killed,\xe2\x80\x9d said this more sensible\nman.\n\nAnatole stopped him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t touch him! You\xe2\x80\x99ll startle him and then he\xe2\x80\x99ll be killed.\nEh?... What then?... Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged\nhimself on his seat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone comes meddling again,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, emitting the words\nseparately through his thin compressed lips, \xe2\x80\x9cI will throw him down\nthere. Now then!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSaying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle\nand lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand\nto balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some\nbroken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the\nwindow and from D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s back. Anatole stood erect with staring\neyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man\nwho had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw\nhimself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from\nwhich a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed\nhorror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes.\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown\nfurther back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand\nholding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the\neffort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher\nand his head tilting yet further back. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it so long?\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nPierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed.\nSuddenly D\xc3\xb3lokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm\ntrembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip\nas he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and\narm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch\nthe window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered\nhis eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was\naware of a stir all around. He looked up: D\xc3\xb3lokhov was standing on the\nwindow sill, with a pale but radiant face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s empty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. D\xc3\xb3lokhov\njumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done!... Fine fellow!... There\xe2\x80\x99s a bet for you!... Devil take\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d came from different sides.\n\nThe Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the\nwindow sill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the same thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe suddenly cried. \xe2\x80\x9cEven without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a\nbottle. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.... Bring a bottle!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him do it, let him do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov, smiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go\ngiddy even on a staircase,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed several voices.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll drink it! Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a bottle of rum!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Pierre,\nbanging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to\nclimb out of the window.\n\nThey seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who\ntouched him was sent flying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never manage him that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a\nbit and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get round him.... Listen! I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your bet tomorrow,\nbut now we are all going to \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cCome on!... And we\xe2\x80\x99ll take Bruin\nwith us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,\nand began dancing round the room with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetsk\xc3\xa1ya\nwho had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Bor\xc3\xads on the evening of\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an\nexception made, and Bor\xc3\xads transferred into the regiment of Sem\xc3\xabnov\nGuards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment\nto Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s staff despite all Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s endeavors and\nentreaties. Soon after Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s reception Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\nreturned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling\nB\xc3\xb3ry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being\nat once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from\nchildhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left\nPetersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in\nMoscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radziv\xc3\xadlov.\n\nIt was St. Natalia\xe2\x80\x99s day and the name day of two of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x94the\nmother and the youngest daughter\xe2\x80\x94both named Nataly. Ever since\nthe morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going\ncontinually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va\xe2\x80\x99s big house on\nthe Povarsk\xc3\xa1ya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and\nher handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors\nwho came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in\nrelays.\n\nThe countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type\nof face, evidently worn out with childbearing\xe2\x80\x94she had had twelve.\nA languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a\ndistinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\nDrubetsk\xc3\xa1ya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the\ndrawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young\npeople were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to\ntake part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw\nthem off, inviting them all to dinner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cma ch\xc3\xa8re\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\ncalled everyone without exception and without the slightest variation\nin his tone, \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d whether they were above or below him in\nrank\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name\nday we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended,\nma ch\xc3\xa8re! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!\xe2\x80\x9d\nThese words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and\nwith the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the\nsame firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As\nsoon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were\nstill in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily\nspreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air\nof a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and\nfro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on\nquestions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but\nself-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in\nthe fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking\nhis scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.\nSometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the\nconservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables\nwere being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who\nwere bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask\ntable linen, he would call Dm\xc3\xadtri Vas\xc3\xadlevich, a man of good family and\nthe manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the\nenormous table would say: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Dm\xc3\xadtri, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that things are\nall as they should be? That\xe2\x80\x99s right! The great thing is the serving,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d And with a complacent sigh he would return to the\ndrawing room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1rya Lv\xc3\xb3vna Kar\xc3\xa1gina and her daughter!\xe2\x80\x9d announced the\ncountess\xe2\x80\x99 gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing\nroom. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold\nsnuffbox with her husband\xe2\x80\x99s portrait on it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite worn out by these callers. However, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see her and\nno more. She is so affected. Ask her in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the footman in a\nsad voice, as if saying: \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, finish me off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling\ndaughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ...\nat the Razum\xc3\xb3vski\xe2\x80\x99s ball ... and Countess Apr\xc3\xa1ksina ... I was\nso delighted...\xe2\x80\x9d came the sounds of animated feminine voices,\ninterrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and\nthe scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last\nout until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses\nand say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so delighted... Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s health... and Countess\nApr\xc3\xa1ksina...\xe2\x80\x9d and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put\non cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief\ntopic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s day, Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov, and about his illegitimate son\nPierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s\nreception.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so sorry for the poor count,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in\nsuch bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the countess as if she did not know what the\nvisitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of\nCount Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s distress some fifteen times.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what comes of a modern education,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the visitor.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do\nas he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible\nthings that he has been expelled by the police.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the countess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe chose his friends badly,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s son, he, and a certain D\xc3\xb3lokhov have, it is said,\nbeen up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s son sent\nback to Moscow. Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s father managed somehow to get his\nson\xe2\x80\x99s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what have they been up to?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the countess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are regular brigands, especially D\xc3\xb3lokhov,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\nvisitor. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a son of M\xc3\xa1rya Iv\xc3\xa1novna D\xc3\xb3lokhova, such a worthy\nwoman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere,\nput it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The\npolice tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied\na policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka\nCanal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his\nback!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nthe count, dying with laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all they could do to rescue the poor man,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\nvisitor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think it is Cyril Vlad\xc3\xadmirovich Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s son\nwho amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so\nwell educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has\ndone for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in\nspite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite\ndeclined: I have my daughters to consider.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say this young man is so rich?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the countess,\nturning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is\nillegitimate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe visitor made a gesture with her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think he has a score of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently\nwishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in\nsociety.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact of the matter is,\xe2\x80\x9d said she significantly, and also in a\nhalf whisper, \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone knows Count Cyril\xe2\x80\x99s reputation.... He has\nlost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow handsome the old man still was only a year ago!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the\ncountess. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen a handsomer man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very much altered now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, as\nI was saying, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli is the next heir through his wife, but the\ncount is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to\nthe Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death\xe2\x80\x94and he is\nso ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from\nPetersburg\xe2\x80\x94no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre\nor Prince Vas\xc3\xadli. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know\nit all very well for Prince Vas\xc3\xadli told me himself. Besides, Cyril\nVlad\xc3\xadmirovich is my mother\xe2\x80\x99s second cousin. He\xe2\x80\x99s also my B\xc3\xb3ry\xe2\x80\x99s\ngodfather,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the\nfact.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince Vas\xc3\xadli arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on\nsome inspection business,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the visitor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but between ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is a\npretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vlad\xc3\xadmirovich,\nhearing how ill he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count;\nand seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the\nyoung ladies. \xe2\x80\x9cI can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman\ncut!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form\nagain shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats\nwell and, in particular, drinks well. \xe2\x80\x9cSo do come and dine with us!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nSilence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably,\nbut not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they\nnow rose and took their leave. The visitor\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was already\nsmoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when\nsuddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls\nrunning to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl\nof thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock,\ndarted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident\nthat she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in\nthe doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer\nof the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short\njacket.\n\nThe count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide\nand threw them round the little girl who had run in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here she is!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cMy pet, whose name day\nit is. My dear pet!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa ch\xc3\xa8re, there is a time for everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess with\nfeigned severity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou spoil her, Ily\xc3\xa1,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning to her\nhusband.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name\nday,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a charming child,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\naddressing the mother.\n\nThis black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life\xe2\x80\x94with\nchildish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her\nbodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs\nin lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers\xe2\x80\x94was just at that\ncharming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not\nyet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed\nface in the lace of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s mantilla\xe2\x80\x94not paying the least\nattention to her severe remark\xe2\x80\x94and began to laugh. She laughed, and in\nfragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced\nfrom the folds of her frock.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...\xe2\x80\x9d was all Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nmanaged to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against\nher mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even\nthe prim visitor could not help joining in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nmother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning\nto the visitor she added: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is my youngest girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, raising her face for a moment from her mother\xe2\x80\x99s mantilla,\nglanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.\n\nThe visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it\nnecessary to take some part in it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9cis Mimi a relation of\nyours? A daughter, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not like the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s tone of condescension to childish\nthings. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.\n\nMeanwhile the younger generation: Bor\xc3\xads, the officer, Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count\xe2\x80\x99s eldest\nson; S\xc3\xb3nya, the count\xe2\x80\x99s fifteen-year-old niece, and little P\xc3\xa9tya,\nhis youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were\nobviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement\nand mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms,\nfrom which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had\nbeen more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the\nweather, and Countess Apr\xc3\xa1ksina. Now and then they glanced at one\nanother, hardly able to suppress their laughter.\n\nThe two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood,\nwere of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. Bor\xc3\xads\nwas tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate\nfeatures. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression.\nDark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face\nexpressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered\nthe drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but\nfailed. Bor\xc3\xads on the contrary at once found his footing, and related\nquietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was\nstill quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged\nduring the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked\nright across the skull. Having said this he glanced at Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\nShe turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was\nscrewing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable\nto control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as\nfast as her nimble little feet would carry her. Bor\xc3\xads did not laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were meaning to go out, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you, Mamma? Do you want the\ncarriage?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked his mother with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered,\nreturning his smile.\n\nBor\xc3\xads quietly left the room and went in search of Nat\xc3\xa1sha. The plump\nboy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been\ndisturbed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the\nyoung lady visitor and the countess\xe2\x80\x99 eldest daughter (who was four\nyears older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person),\nwere Nicholas and S\xc3\xb3nya, the niece. S\xc3\xb3nya was a slender little\nbrunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long\nlashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny\ntint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but\ngraceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements,\nby the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain\ncoyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown\nkitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently\nconsidered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by\nsmiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes\nwatched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate\ngirlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose\nupon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to\nspring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as\nthey too could, like Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Bor\xc3\xads, escape from the drawing room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, addressing the visitor and\npointing to Nicholas, \xe2\x80\x9chis friend Bor\xc3\xads has become an officer, and\nso for friendship\xe2\x80\x99s sake he is leaving the university and me, his\nold father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a\nplace and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t\nthat friendship?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the count in an inquiring tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they say that war has been declared,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the visitor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying so a long while,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My\ndear, there\xe2\x80\x99s friendship for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s joining\nthe hussars.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not at all from friendship,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Nicholas, flaring\nup and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not from\nfriendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both\nregarding him with a smile of approbation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchubert, the colonel of the P\xc3\xa1vlograd Hussars, is dining with us\ntoday. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him.\nIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, shrugging his shoulders and\nspeaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already told you, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said his son, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish to let me go, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere\nexcept in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.\xe2\x80\x94I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to hide what I feel.\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke he kept glancing\nwith the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at S\xc3\xb3nya and the young\nlady visitor.\n\nThe little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment\nto start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old count. \xe2\x80\x9cHe always flares up!\nThis Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he\nrose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded, not noticing his visitor\xe2\x80\x99s sarcastic smile.\n\nThe elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Kar\xc3\xa1gina turned to\nyoung Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity you weren\xe2\x80\x99t at the Arkh\xc3\xa1rovs\xe2\x80\x99 on Thursday. It was so\ndull without you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, giving him a tender smile.\n\nThe young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish\nsmile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation\nwithout at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart\nof S\xc3\xb3nya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk\nhe glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and\nhardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile\non her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 animation\nvanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then\nwith a distressed face left the room to find S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their\nsleeves!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousinage\xe2\x80\x94dangereux voisinage,\xe2\x80\x9d * she added.\n\n     * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess when the brightness these young people had\nbrought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no\none had put but which was always in her mind, \xe2\x80\x9cand how much suffering,\nhow much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in\nthem now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is\nalways, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both\nfor girls and boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all depends on the bringing up,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the visitor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you\xe2\x80\x99re quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the countess. \xe2\x80\x9cTill now I\nhave always, thank God, been my children\xe2\x80\x99s friend and had their full\nconfidence,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who\nimagine that their children have no secrets from them. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I shall\nalways be my daughters\xe2\x80\x99 first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with\nhis impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can\xe2\x80\x99t help it), he\nwill all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in the count,\nwho always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding\nthat everything was splendid. \xe2\x80\x9cJust fancy: wants to be an hussar.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s one to do, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a charming creature your younger girl is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor;\n\xe2\x80\x9ca little volcano!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a regular volcano,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count. \xe2\x80\x9cTakes after me! And\nwhat a voice she has; though she\xe2\x80\x99s my daughter, I tell the truth\nwhen I say she\xe2\x80\x99ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an\nItalian to give her lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train\nit at that age.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, not at all too young!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the count. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, our\nmothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she\xe2\x80\x99s in love with Bor\xc3\xads already. Just fancy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncountess with a gentle smile, looking at Bor\xc3\xads and went on, evidently\nconcerned with a thought that always occupied her: \xe2\x80\x9cNow you see if I\nwere to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they\nmight be up to on the sly\xe2\x80\x9d (she meant that they would be kissing),\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to\nme of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I\nspoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I\nwas stricter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was brought up quite differently,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the handsome\nelder daughter, Countess V\xc3\xa9ra, with a smile.\n\nBut the smile did not enhance V\xc3\xa9ra\xe2\x80\x99s beauty as smiles generally do;\non the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,\nexpression. V\xc3\xa9ra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at\nlearning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said\nwas true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone\xe2\x80\x94the visitors\nand countess alike\xe2\x80\x94turned to look at her as if wondering why she had\nsaid it, and they all felt awkward.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are always too clever with their eldest children and try to\nmake something exceptional of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said the visitor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too\nclever with V\xc3\xa9ra,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of that? She\xe2\x80\x99s\nturned out splendidly all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, winking at V\xc3\xa9ra.\n\nThe guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat manners! I thought they would never go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess,\nwhen she had seen her guests out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nWhen Nat\xc3\xa1sha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the\nconservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation\nin the drawing room, waiting for Bor\xc3\xads to come out. She was already\ngrowing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming\nat once, when she heard the young man\xe2\x80\x99s discreet steps approaching\nneither quickly nor slowly. At this Nat\xc3\xa1sha dashed swiftly among the\nflower tubs and hid there.\n\nBor\xc3\xads paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little\ndust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined\nhis handsome face. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, very still, peered out from her ambush,\nwaiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the\nglass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was about to\ncall him but changed her mind. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him look for me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought she.\nHardly had Bor\xc3\xads gone than S\xc3\xb3nya, flushed, in tears, and muttering\nangrily, came in at the other door. Nat\xc3\xa1sha checked her first impulse\nto run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watching\xe2\x80\x94as\nunder an invisible cap\xe2\x80\x94to see what went on in the world. She was\nexperiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. S\xc3\xb3nya, muttering to herself,\nkept looking round toward the drawing room door. It opened and Nicholas\ncame in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, what is the matter with you? How can you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, running\nup to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, nothing; leave me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I know what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that,\nfor a mere fancy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas taking her hand.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, not stirring\nand scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will happen now?\xe2\x80\x9d thought she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are\neverything!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will prove it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like you to talk like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I won\xe2\x80\x99t; only forgive me, S\xc3\xb3nya!\xe2\x80\x9d He drew her to him\nand kissed her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how nice,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha; and when S\xc3\xb3nya and Nicholas had\ngone out of the conservatory she followed and called Bor\xc3\xads to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBor\xc3\xads, come here,\xe2\x80\x9d said she with a sly and significant look. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nhave something to tell you. Here, here!\xe2\x80\x9d and she led him into the\nconservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.\n\nBor\xc3\xads followed her, smiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the something?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he.\n\nShe grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown\ndown on one of the tubs, picked it up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss the doll,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\nBor\xc3\xads looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not\nreply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to? Well, then, come here,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, and\nwent further in among the plants and threw down the doll. \xe2\x80\x9cCloser,\ncloser!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\n\nShe caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and\nfear appeared on her flushed face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me? Would you like to kiss me?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered almost inaudibly,\nglancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from\nexcitement.\n\nBor\xc3\xads blushed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow funny you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, bending down to her and blushing still\nmore, but he waited and did nothing.\n\nSuddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so\nthat both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing\nback her hair, kissed him full on the lips.\n\nThen she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs\nand stood, hanging her head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know that I love you, but....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in love with me?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha broke in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am, but please don\xe2\x80\x99t let us do like that.... In another four\nyears ... then I will ask for your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha considered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,\xe2\x80\x9d she counted on her slender\nlittle fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right! Then it\xe2\x80\x99s settled?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSettled!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bor\xc3\xads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForever?\xe2\x80\x9d said the little girl. \xe2\x80\x9cTill death itself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining\nsitting room.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAfter receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave\norders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to\ndinner all who came \xe2\x80\x9cto congratulate.\xe2\x80\x9d The countess wished to have\na t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from\nPetersburg. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face,\ndrew her chair nearer to that of the countess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith you I will be quite frank,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\nare not many left of us old friends! That\xe2\x80\x99s why I so value your\nfriendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna looked at V\xc3\xa9ra and paused. The countess pressed her\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cV\xc3\xa9ra,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a\nfavorite, \xe2\x80\x9chow is it you have so little tact? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see you are\nnot wanted here? Go to the other girls, or...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe handsome V\xc3\xa9ra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied\nas she rose to go to her own room.\n\nBut as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting,\none pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. S\xc3\xb3nya was\nsitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the\nfirst he had ever written. Bor\xc3\xads and Nat\xc3\xa1sha were at the other window\nand ceased talking when V\xc3\xa9ra entered. S\xc3\xb3nya and Nat\xc3\xa1sha looked at\nV\xc3\xa9ra with guilty, happy faces.\n\nIt was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but\napparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in V\xc3\xa9ra.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow often have I asked you not to take my things?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nhave a room of your own,\xe2\x80\x9d and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a minute, in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, dipping his pen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always manage to do things at the wrong time,\xe2\x80\x9d continued V\xc3\xa9ra.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed\nof you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one\nreplied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the\nroom with the inkstand in her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at your age what secrets can there be between Nat\xc3\xa1sha and\nBor\xc3\xads, or between you two? It\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, V\xc3\xa9ra, what does it matter to you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha in defense,\nspeaking very gently.\n\nShe seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to\neveryone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery silly,\xe2\x80\x9d said V\xc3\xa9ra. \xe2\x80\x9cI am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll have secrets of their own,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nat\xc3\xa1sha, getting warmer.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with you and Berg.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not,\xe2\x80\x9d said V\xc3\xa9ra, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause there can never be\nanything wrong in my behavior. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell Mamma how you are\nbehaving with Bor\xc3\xads.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1lya Ilyn\xc3\xadchna behaves very well to me,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Bor\xc3\xads. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nhave nothing to complain of.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Bor\xc3\xads! You are such a diplomat that it is really\ntiresome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly.\n(She used the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiplomat,\xe2\x80\x9d which was just then much in vogue\namong the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\ndoes she bother me?\xe2\x80\x9d And she added, turning to V\xc3\xa9ra, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll\nnever understand it, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve never loved anyone. You have no\nheart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more\xe2\x80\x9d (this nickname,\nbestowed on V\xc3\xa9ra by Nicholas, was considered very stinging), \xe2\x80\x9cand\nyour greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with\nBerg as much as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d she finished quickly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now you\xe2\x80\x99ve done what you wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Nicholas\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csaid\nunpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the\nnursery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe unpleasant things were said to me,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked V\xc3\xa9ra, \xe2\x80\x9cI said\nnone to anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted laughing voices\nthrough the door.\n\nThe handsome V\xc3\xa9ra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant\neffect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been\nsaid to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf.\nLooking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and\ncalmer.\n\n\nIn the drawing room the conversation was still going on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, \xe2\x80\x9cmy life is not all roses\neither. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I know that at the rate we are living our means won\xe2\x80\x99t\nlast long? It\xe2\x80\x99s all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the\ncountry do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what\nbesides! But don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about me; tell me how you managed\neverything. I often wonder at you, Annette\xe2\x80\x94how at your age you\ncan rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those\nministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It\xe2\x80\x99s\nquite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly\ndo it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, \xe2\x80\x9cGod grant you never\nknow what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love\nto distraction! One learns many things then,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a certain\npride. \xe2\x80\x9cThat lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those\nbig people I write a note: \xe2\x80\x98Princess So-and-So desires an interview\nwith So and-So,\xe2\x80\x99 and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or\nfour times\xe2\x80\x94till I get what I want. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind what they think of\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and to whom did you apply about B\xc3\xb3ry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the countess.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas\nis going as a cadet. There\xe2\x80\x99s no one to interest himself for him. To\nwhom did you apply?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Prince Vas\xc3\xadli. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything,\nand put the matter before the Emperor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she\nhad endured to gain her end.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Prince Vas\xc3\xadli aged much?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the countess. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not\nseen him since we acted together at the Rumy\xc3\xa1ntsovs\xe2\x80\x99 theatricals. I\nexpect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe countess, with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is just the same as ever,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna,\n\xe2\x80\x9coverflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head\nat all. He said to me, \xe2\x80\x98I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear\nPrincess. I am at your command.\xe2\x80\x99 Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very\nkind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do\nanything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my\nposition is now a terrible one,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, sadly,\ndropping her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no\nprogress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow how to equip Bor\xc3\xads.\xe2\x80\x9d She took out her handkerchief and began to\ncry. \xe2\x80\x9cI need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble\nnote. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril\nVlad\xc3\xadmirovich Bez\xc3\xbakhov. If he will not assist his godson\xe2\x80\x94you know\nhe is B\xc3\xb3ry\xe2\x80\x99s godfather\xe2\x80\x94and allow him something for his maintenance,\nall my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able to\nequip him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe countess\xe2\x80\x99 eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI often think, though, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s a sin,\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat here lives Count Cyril Vlad\xc3\xadmirovich Bez\xc3\xbakhov so rich, all\nalone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It\xe2\x80\x99s a\nburden to him, and B\xc3\xb3ry\xe2\x80\x99s life is only just beginning....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely he will leave something to Bor\xc3\xads,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.\nStill, I will take Bor\xc3\xads and go to see him at once, and I shall speak\nto him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it\xe2\x80\x99s\nreally all the same to me when my son\xe2\x80\x99s fate is at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d The\nprincess rose. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s now two o\xe2\x80\x99clock and you dine at four. There\nwill just be time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of\ntime, Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the\nanteroom with him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to the countess who saw her to the\ndoor, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, \xe2\x80\x9cWish me\ngood luck.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to Count Cyril Vlad\xc3\xadmirovich, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncount coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the\nhouse, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my\ndear. We will see how Tar\xc3\xa1s distinguishes himself today. He says Count\nOrl\xc3\xb3v never gave such a dinner as ours will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Bor\xc3\xads,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna to her son as\nCountess Rost\xc3\xb3va\xe2\x80\x99s carriage in which they were seated drove over the\nstraw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril\nVlad\xc3\xadmirovich Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s house. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Bor\xc3\xads,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nmother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying\nit timidly and tenderly on her son\xe2\x80\x99s arm, \xe2\x80\x9cbe affectionate and\nattentive to him. Count Cyril Vlad\xc3\xadmirovich is your godfather after\nall, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice\nto him, as you so well know how to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of\nit...\xe2\x80\x9d answered her son coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have promised and will do it\nfor your sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlthough the hall porter saw someone\xe2\x80\x99s carriage standing at the\nentrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to\nbe announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the\nrows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady\xe2\x80\x99s old\ncloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and,\nhearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse\ntoday, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may as well go back,\xe2\x80\x9d said the son in French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand\non his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.\n\nBor\xc3\xads said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking\noff his cloak.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna in gentle tones, addressing\nthe hall porter, \xe2\x80\x9cI know Count Cyril Vlad\xc3\xadmirovich is very ill...\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him,\nmy friend... I only need see Prince Vas\xc3\xadli Serg\xc3\xa9evich: he is staying\nhere, is he not? Please announce me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned\naway.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Drubetsk\xc3\xa1ya to see Prince Vas\xc3\xadli Serg\xc3\xa9evich,\xe2\x80\x9d he called\nto a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat,\nwho ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.\n\nThe mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large\nVenetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly\nascended the carpeted stairs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a\ntouch, \xe2\x80\x9cyou promised me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.\n\nThey entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the\napartments assigned to Prince Vas\xc3\xadli.\n\nJust as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were\nabout to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they\nentered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\ncame out\xe2\x80\x94wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast,\nas was his custom when at home\xe2\x80\x94taking leave of a good-looking,\ndark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is certain?\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince, humanum est errare, * but...\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor,\nswallowing his r\xe2\x80\x99s, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French\naccent.\n\n     * To err is human.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, very well...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSeeing Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna and her son, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli dismissed the\ndoctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of\ninquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly\nclouded his mother\xe2\x80\x99s face, and he smiled slightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our\ndear invalid?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look\nfixed on her.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli stared at her and at Bor\xc3\xads questioningly and perplexed.\nBor\xc3\xads bowed politely. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli without acknowledging the bow\nturned to Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, answering her query by a movement of the\nhead and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how awful!\nIt is terrible to think.... This is my son,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, indicating\nBor\xc3\xads. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to thank you himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads bowed again politely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, Prince, a mother\xe2\x80\x99s heart will never forget what you\nhave done for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, arranging his lace frill, and in\ntone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna whom he had placed\nunder an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he\nhad done in Petersburg at Anna Sch\xc3\xa9rer\xe2\x80\x99s reception.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to serve well and show yourself worthy,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, addressing\nBor\xc3\xads with severity. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad.... Are you here on leave?\xe2\x80\x9d he went\non in his usual tone of indifference.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreplied Bor\xc3\xads, betraying neither annoyance at the prince\xe2\x80\x99s brusque\nmanner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly\nand respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you living with your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am living at Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bor\xc3\xads, again\nadding, \xe2\x80\x9cyour excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, with Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v who married Nataly Shinshin\xc3\xa1,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Prince Vas\xc3\xadli in his monotonous voice.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that\nunlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too,\nI am told.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a very kind man, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna with a\npathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rost\xc3\xb3v deserved this\ncensure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\ndo the doctors say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the princess after a pause, her worn face\nagain expressing deep sorrow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey give little hope,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the prince.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me\nand Bor\xc3\xads. He is his godson,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, her tone suggesting that\nthis fact ought to give Prince Vas\xc3\xadli much satisfaction.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna saw that\nhe was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s fortune,\nand hastened to reassure him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, \xe2\x80\x9cI\nknow his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with\nhim except the young princesses.... They are still young....\xe2\x80\x9d She bent\nher head and continued in a whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cHas he performed his final duty,\nPrince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no\nworse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill.\nWe women, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d and she smiled tenderly, \xe2\x80\x9calways know how to say\nthese things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for\nme. I am used to suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEvidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done\nat Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us wait until evening. The doctors are\nexpecting a crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the\nwelfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a\nChristian...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the\ncount\xe2\x80\x99s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her\nbody was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\nturned to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill the same; but what can you expect, this noise...\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nprincess, looking at Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna as at a stranger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear, I hardly knew you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna with a\nhappy smile, ambling lightly up to the count\xe2\x80\x99s niece. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come,\nand am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you\nhave gone through,\xe2\x80\x9d and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.\n\nThe princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she\nhad conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vas\xc3\xadli to\ntake a seat beside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBor\xc3\xads,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her son with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go in to see\nthe count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to give him the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 invitation. They ask him\nto dinner. I suppose he won\xe2\x80\x99t go?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, turning to the\nprince.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the prince, who had plainly become\ndepressed, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young\nman.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Bor\xc3\xads down one flight of\nstairs and up another, to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s rooms.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nPierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in\nPetersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and\nsent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s was true.\nPierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been\nfor some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be\nalready known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father\xe2\x80\x94who were\nnever favorably disposed toward him\xe2\x80\x94would have used it to turn the\ncount against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the\nprincesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom\nwere sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the\neldest who was reading\xe2\x80\x94the one who had met Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna. The\ntwo younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they\ndiffered only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her\nmuch prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper.\nThe eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him\nwith frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression;\nwhile the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and\nlively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked\nby the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the\ncanvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying\nto make out the pattern.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recognize you only too well, too well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is the count? Can I see him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,\nbut unabashed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you\nhave done your best to increase his mental sufferings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I see the count?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre again asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see\nhim... Olga, go and see whether Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s beef tea is ready\xe2\x80\x94it is\nalmost time,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were\nbusy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,\nPierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.\n\nOlga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cThen I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the\nsister with the mole.\n\nNext day Prince Vas\xc3\xadli had arrived and settled in the count\xe2\x80\x99s house.\nHe sent for Pierre and said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, if you are going\nto behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that\nis all I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must\nnot see him at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSince then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in\nhis rooms upstairs.\n\nWhen Bor\xc3\xads appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room,\nstopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall,\nas if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely\nover his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering\nindistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEngland is done for,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, scowling and pointing his finger\nat someone unseen. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the\nrights of man, is sentenced to...\xe2\x80\x9d But before Pierre\xe2\x80\x94who at that\nmoment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just\neffected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured\nLondon\xe2\x80\x94could pronounce Pitt\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, he saw a well-built and\nhandsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left\nMoscow when Bor\xc3\xads was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him,\nbut in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Bor\xc3\xads by the hand\nwith a friendly smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bor\xc3\xads quietly with a pleasant smile.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,\xe2\x80\x9d\nanswered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.\n\nBor\xc3\xads felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider\nit necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least\nembarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount Rost\xc3\xb3v asks you to come to dinner today,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after a\nconsiderable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Count Rost\xc3\xb3v!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pierre joyfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you are his\nson, Ily\xc3\xa1? Only fancy, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you at first. Do you remember\nhow we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It\xe2\x80\x99s such an\nage...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads deliberately, with a bold and\nslightly sarcastic smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI am Bor\xc3\xads, son of Princess Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna Drubetsk\xc3\xa1ya. Rost\xc3\xb3v, the father, is Ily\xc3\xa1, and his son is\nNicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, what am I thinking about? I\xe2\x80\x99ve mixed everything up. One\nhas so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Bor\xc3\xads? Of course. Well, now\nwe know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition?\nThe English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the\nChannel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a mess of things!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the\npapers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve\xe2\x80\x99s name.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal\nthan with politics,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in his quiet ironical tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI know\nnothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy\nwith gossip,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cJust now they are talking about you and\nyour father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion\xe2\x80\x99s\nsake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.\nBut Bor\xc3\xads spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoscow has nothing else to do but gossip,\xe2\x80\x9d Bor\xc3\xads went on.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,\nthough he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is all very horrid,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cvery horrid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say\nsomething disconcerting to himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it must seem to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads flushing slightly, but not\nchanging his tone or attitude, \xe2\x80\x9cit must seem to you that everyone is\ntrying to get something out of the rich man?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it does,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are\nquite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are\nvery poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that\nyour father is rich, I don\xe2\x80\x99t regard myself as a relation of his, and\nneither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped\nup from the sofa, seized Bor\xc3\xads under the elbow in his quick, clumsy\nway, and, blushing far more than Bor\xc3\xads, began to speak with a feeling\nof mingled shame and vexation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know\nvery well...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Bor\xc3\xads again interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You\nmust excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put\nat ease by him, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I hope I have not offended you. I always make it\na rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to\ndinner at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Bor\xc3\xads, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and\nextricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,\nbecame quite pleasant again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, calming down, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are a wonderful\nfellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we\nwere children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand.\nI could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but\nit\xe2\x80\x99s splendid. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nqueer,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should have suspected\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d He began to laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of it! I hope we\xe2\x80\x99ll get better\nacquainted,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pressed Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 hand. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, I have not\nonce been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for\nhim as a man, but what can one do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nBor\xc3\xads with a smile.\n\nPierre saw that Bor\xc3\xads wished to change the subject, and being of the\nsame mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the\nBoulogne expedition.\n\nA footman came in to summon Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x94the princess was going. Pierre, in\norder to make Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner,\nand warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles\ninto Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and\ndown the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with\nhis imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant,\nintelligent, and resolute young man.\n\nAs often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely\nlife, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up\nhis mind that they would be friends.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her eyes\nand her face was tearful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is dreadful, dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cbut cost me what it\nmay I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be\nleft like this. Every moment is precious. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think why his nieces\nput it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!...\nAdieu, Prince! May God support you...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, ma bonne,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Prince Vas\xc3\xadli turning away from her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is in a dreadful state,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother to her son when\nthey were in the carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hardly recognizes anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, Mamma\xe2\x80\x94what is his attitude to Pierre?\xe2\x80\x9d\nasked the son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you expect that he will leave us anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Heaven! How ill he is!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the mother.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAfter Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril\nVlad\xc3\xadmirovich Bez\xc3\xbakhov, Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va sat for a long time all\nalone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d she said crossly to the maid\nwho kept her waiting some minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you wish to serve me? Then\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll find you another place.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe countess was upset by her friend\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow and humiliating poverty,\nand was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always\nfound expression in calling her maid \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear\xe2\x80\x9d and speaking to her\nwith exaggerated politeness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the maid.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk the count to come to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as\nusual.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, little countess? What a saut\xc3\xa9 of game au mad\xc3\xa8re we are to\nhave, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Tar\xc3\xa1s were\nnot ill-spent. He is worth it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling\nhis gray hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are your commands, little countess?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my dear... What\xe2\x80\x99s that mess?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing to his\nwaistcoat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the saut\xc3\xa9, most likely,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a smile.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, Count, I want some money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer face became sad.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, little countess!\xe2\x80\x9d ... and the count began bustling to get out\nhis pocketbook.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,\xe2\x80\x9d and taking\nout her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d he called out\nin a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will\nrush to obey the summons. \xe2\x80\x9cSend Dm\xc3\xadtri to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDm\xc3\xadtri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I want, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count to the\ndeferential young man who had entered. \xe2\x80\x9cBring me...\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected\na moment, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don\xe2\x80\x99t\nbring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones\nfor the countess.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Dm\xc3\xadtri, clean ones, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, sighing\ndeeply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen would you like them, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dm\xc3\xadtri. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow\nme to inform you... But, don\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, noticing that\nthe count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always\na sign of approaching anger. \xe2\x80\x9cI was forgetting... Do you wish it\nbrought at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a treasure that Dm\xc3\xadtri is,\xe2\x80\x9d added the count with a smile when\nthe young man had departed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is never any \xe2\x80\x98impossible\xe2\x80\x99 with\nhim. That\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I hate! Everything is possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the countess. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am in great need of this sum.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncount, and having kissed his wife\xe2\x80\x99s hand he went back to his study.\n\nWhen Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna returned from Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s the money, all\nin clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess\xe2\x80\x99\nlittle table, and Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna noticed that something was agitating\nher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the countess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so\nill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnnette, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t refuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d the countess\nbegan, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified,\nelderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be\nready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is for Bor\xc3\xads from me, for his outfit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess\nwept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were\nkindhearted, and because they\xe2\x80\x94friends from childhood\xe2\x80\x94had to think\nabout such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over....\nBut those tears were pleasant to them both.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nCountess Rost\xc3\xb3va, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was\nalready seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen into\nhis study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes. From\ntime to time he went out to ask: \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t she come yet?\xe2\x80\x9d They\nwere expecting M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna Akhros\xc3\xadmova, known in society as le\nterrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for\ncommon sense and frank plainness of speech. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna was known\nto the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both\ncities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told\ngood stories about her, while none the less all without exception\nrespected and feared her.\n\nIn the count\xe2\x80\x99s room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked\nof the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the\nrecruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew\nit had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were\nsmoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head\nfirst to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident\npleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he\negged on against each other.\n\nOne of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled\nface, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable\nyoung man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,\nhaving stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the\nsmoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor,\nShinsh\xc3\xadn, a cousin of the countess\xe2\x80\x99, a man with \xe2\x80\x9ca sharp tongue\xe2\x80\x9d\nas they said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to\nhis companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards,\nirreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the\nmiddle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting\nit escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an\nofficer in the Sem\xc3\xabnov regiment with whom Bor\xc3\xads was to travel to join\nthe army, and about whom Nat\xc3\xa1sha had teased her elder sister V\xc3\xa9ra,\nspeaking of Berg as her \xe2\x80\x9cintended.\xe2\x80\x9d The count sat between them and\nlistened attentively. His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a\ncard game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he\nsucceeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, old chap, mon tr\xc3\xa8s honorable Alphonse K\xc3\xa1rlovich,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Shinsh\xc3\xadn, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian\nexpressions with the choicest French phrases\xe2\x80\x94which was a peculiarity\nof his speech. \xe2\x80\x9cVous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat; *\nyou want to make something out of your company?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * You expect to make an income out of the government.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Peter Nikol\xc3\xa1evich; I only want to show that in the cavalry\nthe advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own\nposition now, Peter Nikol\xc3\xa1evich...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBerg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His\nconversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm\nand silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing\non himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put\nout of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as\nsoon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk\ncircumstantially and with evident satisfaction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider my position, Peter Nikol\xc3\xa1evich. Were I in the cavalry I\nshould get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even\nwith the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and\nthirty,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking at Shinsh\xc3\xadn and the count with a joyful,\npleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must\nalways be the chief desire of everyone else.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides that, Peter Nikol\xc3\xa1evich, by exchanging into the Guards\nI shall be in a more prominent position,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Berg, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nvacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think\nwhat can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to\nput a little aside and to send something to my father,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\nemitting a smoke ring.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the\nproverb says,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Shinsh\xc3\xadn, moving his pipe to the other side\nof his mouth and winking at the count.\n\n      * So that squares matters.\n\nThe count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that Shinsh\xc3\xadn\nwas talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference,\ncontinued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already\ngained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime\nthe company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company,\nmight easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in\nthe regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently\nenjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others,\ntoo, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily\nsedate, and the na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that\nhe disarmed his hearers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get along wherever you go\xe2\x80\x94foot or\nhorse\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shinsh\xc3\xadn, patting him on the\nshoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.\n\nBerg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into the\ndrawing room.\n\nIt was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests,\nexpecting the summons to zak\xc3\xbaska, * avoid engaging in any long\nconversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order\nto show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and\nhostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another,\nand the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are\nwaiting for\xe2\x80\x94some important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish\nthat is not yet ready.\n\n     * Hors d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvres.\n\nPierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the\nmiddle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across,\nblocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk,\nbut he went on na\xc3\xafvely looking around through his spectacles as if in\nsearch of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He\nwas in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of\nthe guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity\nat this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest\nfellow could have played such a prank on a policeman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have only lately arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d the countess asked him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOui, madame,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, looking around him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not yet seen my husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNon, madame.\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled quite inappropriately.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s very\ninteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna. The latter\nunderstood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and\nsitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he\nanswered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other\nguests were all conversing with one another. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Razum\xc3\xb3vskis... It\nwas charming... You are very kind... Countess Apr\xc3\xa1ksina...\xe2\x80\x9d was heard\non all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna?\xe2\x80\x9d came her voice from there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerself,\xe2\x80\x9d came the answer in a rough voice, and M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\nentered the room.\n\nAll the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very\noldest rose. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout,\nholding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood\nsurveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if\nrolling them up. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna always spoke in Russian.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHealth and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her\nchildren,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all\nothers. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you old sinner,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, turning to the count\nwho was kissing her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay?\nNowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just\nsee how these nestlings are growing up,\xe2\x80\x9d and she pointed to the girls.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x99s my Cossack?\xe2\x80\x9d (M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\nalways called Nat\xc3\xa1sha a Cossack) and she stroked the child\xe2\x80\x99s arm as\nshe came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI know she\xe2\x80\x99s a scamp\nof a girl, but I like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and,\nhaving given them to the rosy Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who beamed with the pleasure\nof her saint\xe2\x80\x99s-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, assuming a soft high\ntone of voice. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here, my friend...\xe2\x80\x9d and she ominously tucked\nup her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a\nchildlike way through his spectacles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell\nyour father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it\xe2\x80\x99s my\nevident duty.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to\nfollow, for this was clearly only a prelude.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed\nand he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,\nsir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep\nfrom laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose it is time we were at table?\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna.\n\nThe count went in first with M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, the countess followed\non the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because\nNicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\nwith Shinsh\xc3\xadn. Berg gave his arm to V\xc3\xa9ra. The smiling Julie Kar\xc3\xa1gina\nwent in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the\nwhole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses\nfollowed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the\nband struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their\nplaces. Then the strains of the count\xe2\x80\x99s household band were replaced\nby the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the\nsoft steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna on her right and Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna on her left, the\nother lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count,\nwith the hussar colonel on his left and Shinsh\xc3\xadn and the other male\nvisitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the\ngrown-up young people: V\xc3\xa9ra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Bor\xc3\xads; and\non the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind\nthe crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his\nwife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled\nhis neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn,\nwithout omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from\nbehind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed\nby their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the\nladies\xe2\x80\x99 end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the\ncolonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so\nmuch that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg\nwith tender smiles was saying to V\xc3\xa9ra that love is not an earthly but\na heavenly feeling. Bor\xc3\xads was telling his new friend Pierre who the\nguests were and exchanging glances with Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who was sitting\nopposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a\ngreat deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and\nwent on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines.\nThese latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a\nnapkin, from behind the next man\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders and whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cDry\nMadeira\xe2\x80\x9d... \xe2\x80\x9cHungarian\xe2\x80\x9d... or \xe2\x80\x9cRhine wine\xe2\x80\x9d as the case might\nbe. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count\xe2\x80\x99s monogram\nthat stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank\nwith enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other\nguests. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who sat opposite, was looking at Bor\xc3\xads as girls of\nthirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for\nthe first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny\nlively little girl\xe2\x80\x99s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing\nwhy.\n\nNicholas sat at some distance from S\xc3\xb3nya, beside Julie Kar\xc3\xa1gina, to\nwhom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. S\xc3\xb3nya wore\na company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned\npale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas\nand Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round\nuneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the\nchildren. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines,\nand kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner\nto his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler\nwith a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to\nappear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because\nno one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from\ngreediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for\nknowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nAt the men\xe2\x80\x99s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated.\nThe colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared\nin Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day\nbeen forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\nShinsh\xc3\xadn. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has stopped Austria\xe2\x80\x99s cackle and I fear it will be\nour turn next.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to\nthe service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinsh\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s remark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is for the reasson, my goot sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, speaking with a\nGerman accent, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He\ndeclares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger\nvreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell\nas ze sanctity of its alliances...\xe2\x80\x9d he spoke this last word with\nparticular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.\n\nThen with the unerring official memory that characterized him he\nrepeated from the opening words of the manifesto:\n\n... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s sole and absolute\naim\xe2\x80\x94to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations\xe2\x80\x94has now decided\nhim to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition\nfor the attainment of that purpose.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cZat, my dear sir, is vy...\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, drinking a tumbler of\nwine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cConnaissez-vous le Proverbe:* \xe2\x80\x98Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but\nturn spindles at home!\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d said Shinsh\xc3\xadn, puckering his brows and\nsmiling. \xe2\x80\x9cCela nous convient \xc3\xa0 merveille.*(2) Suv\xc3\xb3rov now\xe2\x80\x94he knew\nwhat he was about; yet they beat him \xc3\xa0 plate couture,*(3) and where\nare we to find Suv\xc3\xb3rovs now? Je vous demande un peu,\xe2\x80\x9d *(4) said he,\ncontinually changing from French to Russian.\n\n     *Do you know the proverb?\n\n     *(2) That suits us down to the ground.\n\n     *(3) Hollow.\n\n     *(4) I just ask you that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVe must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!\xe2\x80\x9d said the colonel,\nthumping the table; \xe2\x80\x9cand ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill\npe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible\xe2\x80\x9d... he dwelt\nparticularly on the word possible... \xe2\x80\x9cas po-o-ossible,\xe2\x80\x9d he ended,\nagain turning to the count. \xe2\x80\x9cZat is how ve old hussars look at it, and\nzere\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar,\nhow do you judge of it?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he\nheard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with\neyes and ears intent on the colonel.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite of your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning\nhis plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision\nand desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great\ndanger. \xe2\x80\x9cI am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nconcluded, conscious\xe2\x80\x94as were others\xe2\x80\x94after the words were uttered\nthat his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and\nwere therefore awkward.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you said just now was splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d said his partner Julie.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and\ndown to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.\n\nPierre listened to the colonel\xe2\x80\x99s speech and nodded approvingly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young man\xe2\x80\x99s a real hussar!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the colonel, again\nthumping the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you making such a noise about over there?\xe2\x80\x9d M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the\ntable. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thumping the table for?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded of the\nhussar, \xe2\x80\x9cand why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French\nare here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am speaking ze truce,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hussar with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all about the war,\xe2\x80\x9d the count shouted down the table. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nknow my son\xe2\x80\x99s going, M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna? My son is going.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have four sons in the army but still I don\xe2\x80\x99t fret. It is all\nin God\xe2\x80\x99s hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a\nbattle,\xe2\x80\x9d replied M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s deep voice, which easily\ncarried the whole length of the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOnce more the conversations concentrated, the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 at the one end\nand the men\xe2\x80\x99s at the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t ask,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s little brother was saying; \xe2\x80\x9cI know\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t ask!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nHer face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half\nrose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what\nwas coming, and turning to her mother:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma!\xe2\x80\x9d rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,\naudible the whole length of the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her\nsternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.\n\nThe conversation was hushed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! What sweets are we going to have?\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s voice\nsounded still more firm and resolute.\n\nThe countess tried to frown, but could not. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna shook her\nfat finger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCossack!\xe2\x80\x9d she said threateningly.\n\nMost of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the\nelders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better take care!\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! What sweets are we going to have?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha again cried\nboldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in\ngood part.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya and fat little P\xc3\xa9tya doubled up with laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see! I have asked,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Nat\xc3\xa1sha to her little brother\nand to Pierre, glancing at him again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIce pudding, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t get any,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like ice\ncream.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarrot ices.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! What kind, M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna? What kind?\xe2\x80\x9d she almost screamed;\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the\nguests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s answer\nbut at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had\ndared to treat M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna in this fashion.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha only desisted when she had been told that there would be\npineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band\nagain struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving\ntheir seats, went up to \xe2\x80\x9ccongratulate\xe2\x80\x9d the countess, and reached\nacross the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and\nwith one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and\nin the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the\nguests returned to the drawing room and to the count\xe2\x80\x99s study.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nThe card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the\ncount\xe2\x80\x99s visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms,\nsome in the sitting room, some in the library.\n\nThe count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from\ndropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything.\nThe young people, at the countess\xe2\x80\x99 instigation, gathered round the\nclavichord and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she\nhad played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined the\nother young ladies in begging Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Nicholas, who were noted for\ntheir musical talent, to sing something. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who was treated as\nthough she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the\nsame time felt shy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we sing?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Brook,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, let\xe2\x80\x99s be quick. Bor\xc3\xads, come here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is S\xc3\xb3nya?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to\nlook for her.\n\nRunning into S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s room and not finding her there, Nat\xc3\xa1sha ran to\nthe nursery, but S\xc3\xb3nya was not there either. Nat\xc3\xa1sha concluded that\nshe must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was\nthe place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rost\xc3\xb3v\nhousehold. And there in fact was S\xc3\xb3nya lying face downward on Nurse\xe2\x80\x99s\ndirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink\ndress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing\nso convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\nface, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint\xe2\x80\x99s day, suddenly\nchanged: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad\nneck and the corners of her mouth drooped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!\xe2\x80\x9d And\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she\nbegan to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that S\xc3\xb3nya was\ncrying. S\xc3\xb3nya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and\nhid her face still deeper in the bed. Nat\xc3\xa1sha wept, sitting on the\nblue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort S\xc3\xb3nya\nsat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas is going away in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time, his... papers... have\ncome... he told me himself... but still I should not cry,\xe2\x80\x9d and she\nshowed a paper she held in her hand\xe2\x80\x94with the verses Nicholas had\nwritten, \xe2\x80\x9cstill, I should not cry, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t... no one can\nunderstand... what a soul he has!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and\nBor\xc3\xads also,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, gaining a little strength; \xe2\x80\x9che is nice...\nthere are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin...\none would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma\xe2\x80\x9d (S\xc3\xb3nya looked upon\nthe countess as her mother and called her so) \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am spoiling\nNicholas\xe2\x80\x99 career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God\nis my witness,\xe2\x80\x9d and she made the sign of the cross, \xe2\x80\x9cI love her so\nmuch, and all of you, only V\xc3\xa9ra... And what for? What have I done\nto her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice\neverything, only I have nothing....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in\nthe feather bed. Nat\xc3\xa1sha began consoling her, but her face showed that\nshe understood all the gravity of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s trouble.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya,\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true\nreason of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure V\xc3\xa9ra has said something\nto you since dinner? Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others,\nand she found them on my table and said she\xe2\x80\x99d show them to Mamma, and\nthat I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry\nme, but that he\xe2\x80\x99ll marry Julie. You see how he\xe2\x80\x99s been with her all\nday... Nat\xc3\xa1sha, what have I done to deserve it?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Nat\xc3\xa1sha lifted\nher up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting\nher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, don\xe2\x80\x99t believe her, darling! Don\xe2\x80\x99t believe her! Do you\nremember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting\nroom after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nquite remember how, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember that it could all be\narranged and how nice it all was? There\xe2\x80\x99s Uncle Shinsh\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s brother\nhas married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know.\nAnd Bor\xc3\xads says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all about\nit. And he is so clever and so good!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou cry, S\xc3\xb3nya, dear love, darling S\xc3\xb3nya!\xe2\x80\x9d and she kissed her and\nlaughed. \xe2\x80\x9cV\xc3\xa9ra\xe2\x80\x99s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right\nand she won\xe2\x80\x99t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself,\nand he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care at all for Julie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha kissed her on the hair.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it\nseemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin\nplaying with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?... Really? Truly?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quickly smoothing her\nfrock and hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, truly!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nat\xc3\xa1sha, pushing in a crisp lock that had\nstrayed from under her friend\xe2\x80\x99s plaits.\n\nBoth laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s go and sing \xe2\x80\x98The Brook.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!\xe2\x80\x9d said\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, stopping suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel so happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd she set off at a run along the passage.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the\nverses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran\nafter Nat\xc3\xa1sha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face\nand light, joyous steps. At the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 request the young people\nsang the quartette, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Brook,\xe2\x80\x9d with which everyone was delighted.\nThen Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:\n\n   At nighttime in the moon\xe2\x80\x99s fair glow\n     How sweet, as fancies wander free,\n   To feel that in this world there\xe2\x80\x99s one\n     Who still is thinking but of thee!\n\n   That while her fingers touch the harp\n     Wafting sweet music o\xe2\x80\x99er the lea,\n   It is for thee thus swells her heart,\n     Sighing its message out to thee...\n\n   A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,\n     But oh! till then I cannot live!...\n\nHe had not finished the last verse before the young people began to\nget ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the\ncoughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.\n\n\nPierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinsh\xc3\xadn had engaged him,\nas a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in\nwhich several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began\nNat\xc3\xa1sha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and\nblushing:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid of mixing the figures,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if you\nwill be my teacher...\xe2\x80\x9d And lowering his big arm he offered it to the\nslender little girl.\n\nWhile the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up,\nPierre sat down with his little partner. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was perfectly happy;\nshe was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was\nsitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady.\nShe had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold.\nAssuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where\nshe had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and\nsmiling over the fan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear! Just look at her!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the countess as she\ncrossed the ballroom, pointing to Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha blushed and laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised\nat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIn the midst of the third \xc3\xa9cossaise there was a clatter of chairs being\npushed back in the sitting room where the count and M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\nhad been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and\nolder visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long,\nand replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First\ncame M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The\ncount, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his\nbent arm to M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair\ngallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the\n\xc3\xa9cossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted\nup to their gallery, addressing the first violin:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSem\xc3\xabn! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis was the count\xe2\x80\x99s favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.\n(Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Nat\xc3\xa1sha to the whole company, and quite\nforgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her\ncurly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.\n\nAnd indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the\njovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner,\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his\nshoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by\na smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the\nonlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay\nstrains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant\ndance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly\nfilled by the domestic serfs\xe2\x80\x94the men on one side and the women on\nthe other\xe2\x80\x94who with beaming faces had come to see their master making\nmerry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look at the master! A regular eagle he is!\xe2\x80\x9d loudly remarked\nthe nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.\n\nThe count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not\nwant to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms\nhanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her\nstern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed\nby the whole of the count\xe2\x80\x99s plump figure, in M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna found\nexpression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose.\nBut if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed\nthe spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and\nthe agility with which he capered about on his light feet, M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions\xe2\x80\x94the least\neffort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp\nher foot\xe2\x80\x94which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual\nseverity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could\nnot attract a moment\xe2\x80\x99s attention to their own evolutions and did not\neven try to do so. All were watching the count and M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to\n\xe2\x80\x9clook at Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d though as it was they never took their eyes off the\ncouple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved\nand shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster;\nlightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying\nround M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until,\nturning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas,\nraising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling\nand making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and\nlaughter led by Nat\xc3\xa1sha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily\nand wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how we used to dance in our time, ma ch\xc3\xa8re,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncount.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a Daniel Cooper!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, tucking up\nher sleeves and puffing heavily.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nWhile in the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced,\nto a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired\nfootmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov had a\nsixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute\nconfession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations\nmade for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle\nand thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond\nthe gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up,\nwaited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral.\nThe Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending\naides-de-camp to inquire after the count\xe2\x80\x99s health, came himself\nthat evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s court, Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov.\n\nThe magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up\nrespectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an\nhour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their\nbows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed\non him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days,\nescorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in\nlow tones.\n\nWhen the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli sat down all alone\non a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other,\nleaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After\nsitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened\neyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading\nto the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.\n\nThose who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous\nwhispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man\xe2\x80\x99s\nroom, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at\nhis door, which creaked slightly when opened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be\no\xe2\x80\x99erpassed,\xe2\x80\x9d said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat\nbeside him and was listening na\xc3\xafvely to his words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\nlady, adding the priest\xe2\x80\x99s clerical title, as if she had no opinion of\nher own on the subject.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, madam, it is a great sacrament,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the priest, passing\nhis hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his\nbald head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was that? The Military Governor himself?\xe2\x80\x9d was being asked at\nthe other side of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cHow young-looking he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes\nanyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red\nfrom weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a\ngraceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a\ntable.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor in answer to a remark about the\nweather. \xe2\x80\x9cThe weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow\none feels as if one were in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the princess with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cSo he may have\nsomething to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLorrain considered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he taken his medicine?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe doctor glanced at his watch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDere has neffer been a gase,\xe2\x80\x9d a German doctor was saying to an\naide-de-camp, \xe2\x80\x9cdat one liffs after de sird stroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a well-preserved man he was!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the aide-de-camp.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who will inherit his wealth?\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt von\xe2\x80\x99t go begging,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the German with a smile.\n\nEveryone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second\nprincess went in with the drink she had prepared according to\nLorrain\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he can last till morning?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the German,\naddressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.\n\nLorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before\nhis nose.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonight, not later,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a low voice, and he moved away\nwith a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to\nunderstand and state the patient\xe2\x80\x99s condition.\n\nMeanwhile Prince Vas\xc3\xadli had opened the door into the princess\xe2\x80\x99 room.\n\nIn this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before\nthe icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.\nThe room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots,\ncupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was\njust visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, is it you, cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth\nthat it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with\nvarnish.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anything happened?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so terrified.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business,\nCatiche,\xe2\x80\x9d * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair\nshe had just vacated. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have made the place warm, I must say,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nremarked. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sit down: let\xe2\x80\x99s have a talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     *Catherine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought perhaps something had happened,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with her\nunchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the\nprince, she prepared to listen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, taking her hand and bending it\ndownwards as was his habit.\n\nIt was plain that this \xe2\x80\x9cwell?\xe2\x80\x9d referred to much that they both\nunderstood without naming.\n\nThe princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her\nlegs, looked directly at Prince Vas\xc3\xadli with no sign of emotion in her\nprominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons\nwith a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow\nand devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli understood it as an expression of weariness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I?\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think it is easier for me? I am as worn\nout as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a\nvery serious talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,\nnow on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant\nexpression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes\ntoo seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the\nnext glanced round in alarm.\n\nThe princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony\nhands, looked attentively into Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s eyes evidently\nresolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till\nmorning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Sem\xc3\xabnovna,\xe2\x80\x9d\ncontinued Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, returning to his theme, apparently not\nwithout an inner struggle; \xe2\x80\x9cat such a moment as this one must think\nof everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you\nall, like children of my own, as you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same\ndull expression.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then of course my family has also to be considered,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Catiche, that we\xe2\x80\x94you three sisters, M\xc3\xa1montov, and\nmy wife\xe2\x80\x94are the count\xe2\x80\x99s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard\nit is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for\nme; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for\nanything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to\nhis portrait, \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitely demanded that he should be called.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make\nout whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was\nsimply looking at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow\nhis noble soul peacefully to leave this...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Prince Vas\xc3\xadli impatiently,\nrubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little\ntable that he had pushed away. \xe2\x80\x9cBut... in short, the fact is... you\nknow yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left\nall his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has made wills enough!\xe2\x80\x9d quietly remarked the princess. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\ncannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Vas\xc3\xadli suddenly, clutching the little\ntable and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: \xe2\x80\x9cwhat if\na letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the\ncount\xe2\x80\x99s services, his request would be granted?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the\nsubject under discussion than those they are talking with.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you more,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, seizing her hand,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew\nof it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then\nas soon as all is over,\xe2\x80\x9d and Prince Vas\xc3\xadli sighed to intimate what he\nmeant by the words all is over, \xe2\x80\x9cand the count\xe2\x80\x99s papers are opened,\nthe will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition\nwill certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate\nson.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd our share?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the princess smiling ironically, as if\nanything might happen, only not that.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the\nlegal heir to everything and you won\xe2\x80\x99t get anything. You must know,\nmy dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have\nbeen destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you\nought to know where they are, and must find them, because...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next?\xe2\x80\x9d the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not\nchanging the expression of her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a woman, and you think we\nare all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit...\nun b\xc3\xa2tard!\xe2\x80\x9d* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the\nword would effectively prove to Prince Vas\xc3\xadli the invalidity of his\ncontention.\n\n     * A bastard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really, Catiche! Can\xe2\x80\x99t you understand! You are so\nintelligent, how is it you don\xe2\x80\x99t see that if the count has written a\nletter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it\nfollows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov,\nand will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and\nletter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation\nof having been dutiful et tout ce qui s\xe2\x80\x99ensuit!* That\xe2\x80\x99s certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * And all that follows therefrom.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid;\nand you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nprincess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are\nsaying something witty and stinging.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Princess Catherine Sem\xc3\xabnovna,\xe2\x80\x9d began Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\nimpatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cI came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about\nyour interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I\ntell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the\nwill in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s favor are among the count\xe2\x80\x99s papers, then, my dear\ngirl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me,\nthen believe an expert. I have just been talking to Dm\xc3\xadtri On\xc3\xbafrich\xe2\x80\x9d\n(the family solicitor) \xe2\x80\x9cand he says the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess\xe2\x80\x99 ideas;\nher thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice\nwhen she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself\nevidently did not expect.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a fine thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI never wanted anything\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this is gratitude\xe2\x80\x94this is recognition for those who have\nsacrificed everything for his sake!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s splendid!\nFine! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything, Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...\xe2\x80\x9d\nreplied Prince Vas\xc3\xadli.\n\nBut the princess did not listen to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect\nnothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude\xe2\x80\x94the\nblackest ingratitude\xe2\x80\x94in this house...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you or do you not know where that will is?\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli, his cheeks twitching more than ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and\nsacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has\nbeen intriguing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She\nhad the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race.\nShe gave her companion an angry glance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was\nall done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards\nforgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his\nlast moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let\nhim die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho sacrificed everything for him,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in the princess, who\nwould again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, \xe2\x80\x9cthough\nhe never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d she added with a sigh,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward,\nthat in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one\nhas to be cunning and cruel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have a wicked heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your heart,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the prince. \xe2\x80\x9cI value your friendship\nand wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t upset yourself,\nand let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it\nbut an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where\nit is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the\ncount. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it.\nYou understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his\nwishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him\nand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I see it all! I know who has been intriguing\xe2\x80\x94I know!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\nthe princess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the point, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s that prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetsk\xc3\xa1ya,\nthat Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the\ninfamous, vile woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not let us lose any time...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and\ntold the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about\nSophie\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t repeat them\xe2\x80\x94that it made the count quite ill and he\nwould not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this\nvile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to it at last\xe2\x80\x94why did you not tell me about it\nsooner?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the princess, ignoring his question. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I know! Yes; if I have\na sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!\xe2\x80\x9d almost shrieked\nthe princess, now quite changed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does she come worming\nherself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time\nwill come!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nWhile these conversations were going on in the reception room and the\nprincess\xe2\x80\x99 room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for)\nand Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was\ndriving into the court of Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s house. As the wheels\nrolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna,\nhaving turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that\nhe was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre\nfollowed Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna out of the carriage, and only then began\nto think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He\nnoticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back\ndoor. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who\nlooked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the\nshadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other\nmen of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides.\nBut neither Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who\ncould not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems\nto be all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna.\nShe hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to\nPierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it\nwas necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had\nto go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s air\nof assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely\nnecessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by\nsome men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots\nclattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them\nthere.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the way to the princesses\xe2\x80\x99 apartments?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna of one of them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were\nnow permissible; \xe2\x80\x9cthe door to the left, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the count did not ask for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre when he reached\nthe landing. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better go to my own room.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna paused and waited for him to come up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, touching his arm as she had done her\nson\xe2\x80\x99s when speaking to him that afternoon, \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve me I suffer no\nless than you do, but be a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut really, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I better go away?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking kindly at\nher over his spectacles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you.\nThink that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.\xe2\x80\x9d She\nsighed. \xe2\x80\x9cI have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to\nme, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had\nto be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna who was\nalready opening a door.\n\nThis door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the\nprincesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been\nin this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of\nthese rooms. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past\nwith a decanter on a tray as \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmy sweet,\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nabout the princess\xe2\x80\x99 health and then led Pierre along a stone passage.\nThe first door on the left led into the princesses\xe2\x80\x99 apartments. The\nmaid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything\nin the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli and the eldest princess were sitting close together\ntalking. Seeing them pass, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli drew back with obvious\nimpatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of\ndesperation slammed the door with all her might.\n\nThis action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre\nstopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as\nif to say that this was no more than she had expected.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,\xe2\x80\x9d said she in\nreply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.\n\nPierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what\n\xe2\x80\x9cwatching over his interests\xe2\x80\x9d meant, but he decided that all these\nthings had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly\nlit room adjoining the count\xe2\x80\x99s reception room. It was one of those\nsumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front\napproach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water\nhad been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer\nand by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They\nwent into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian\nwindows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full\nlength portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still\nsitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one\nanother. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who,\nhanging his head, meekly followed her.\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive\nmoment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now,\nkeeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than\nthat afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the\ndying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid\nglance at all those in the room and noticing the count\xe2\x80\x99s confessor\nthere, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet\nseeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing\nfirst of one and then of another priest.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be thanked that you are in time,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to one of the\npriests; \xe2\x80\x9call we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young\nman is the count\xe2\x80\x99s son,\xe2\x80\x9d she added more softly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a terrible\nmoment!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving said this she went up to the doctor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthis young man is the count\xe2\x80\x99s son. Is\nthere any hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his\nshoulders. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna with just the same movement raised her\nshoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away\nfrom the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and\ntenderly sad voice, she said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust in His mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit\nand wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was\nwatching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.\n\nPierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved\ntoward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna had\ndisappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him\nwith something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they\nwhispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind\nof awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before\nreceived was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to\nthe priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up\nand returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully\nsilent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre\nwished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to\npick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not\neven in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and\nthat tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful\nrite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound\nto accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the\naide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady\xe2\x80\x99s chair, placing his huge hands\nsymmetrically on his knees in the na\xc3\xafve attitude of an Egyptian statue,\nand decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in\norder not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his\nown ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of\nthose who were guiding him.\n\nNot two minutes had passed before Prince Vas\xc3\xadli with head erect\nmajestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three\nstars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning;\nhis eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed\nPierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do),\nand drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly\nfixed on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is\nwell!\xe2\x80\x9d and he turned to go.\n\nBut Pierre thought it necessary to ask: \xe2\x80\x9cHow is...\xe2\x80\x9d and hesitated,\nnot knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man \xe2\x80\x9cthe\ncount,\xe2\x80\x9d yet ashamed to call him \xe2\x80\x9cfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my\nfriend...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s mind was in such a confused state that the word \xe2\x80\x9cstroke\xe2\x80\x9d\nsuggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\nin perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of\nillness. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli said something to Lorrain in passing and went\nthrough the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his\nwhole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and\nthe priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door.\nThrough that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and\nat last Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, still with the same expression, pale but\nresolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly\non the arm said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be\nadministered. Come.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed\nthat the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all\nfollowed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to\nenter that room.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nPierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its\nwalls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the\ncolumns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and\non the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated\nwith red light like a Russian church during evening service. Under\nthe gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair\non snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre\nsaw\xe2\x80\x94covered to the waist by a bright green quilt\xe2\x80\x94the familiar,\nmajestic figure of his father, Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov, with that gray mane of\nhair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep\ncharacteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay\njust under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the\nright hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust\nbetween forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from\nbehind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood the priests,\ntheir long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments,\nwith lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the\nservice. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding\nhandkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest\nsister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on\nthe icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for\nherself should she glance round. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, with a meek,\nsorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door\nnear the strange lady. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli in front of the door, near the\ninvalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on\nthe carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose,\nand was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward\neach time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety\nand resignation to the will of God. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do not understand these\nsentiments,\xe2\x80\x9d he seemed to be saying, \xe2\x80\x9cso much the worse for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBehind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants;\nthe men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing\nthemselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting\nof deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of\nfeet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, with\nan air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she\nwas about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave\nhim a taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him,\nbegan crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.\n\nSophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole,\nwatched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained\nwith it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she\nagain began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him\nwithout laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of\ntemptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst\nof the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered\nto one another, and the old servant who was holding the count\xe2\x80\x99s hand\ngot up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna stepped\nforward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from\nbehind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning\nagainst one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he,\na foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full\nimportance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. He\nnow approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor\nof life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the\nhand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected\na moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a\nstir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service\ncontinued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\nleft the chair on which he had been leaning, and\xe2\x80\x94with an air\nwhich intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not\nunderstand him it was so much the worse for them\xe2\x80\x94did not go up to the\ndying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved\nwith her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its\nsilken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vas\xc3\xadli and the princess\npassed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the\nother before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention\nto this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his\nmind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was\nin some way essential.\n\nThe chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was\nheard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the\nsacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around\nhim everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s was the most distinct.\n\nPierre heard her say:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be\nimpossible...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants\nthat Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray\nmane\xe2\x80\x94which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight\nof for a single moment during the whole service. He judged by the\ncautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that\nthey had lifted the dying man and were moving him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch hold of my arm or you\xe2\x80\x99ll drop him!\xe2\x80\x9d he heard one of the\nservants say in a frightened whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cCatch hold from underneath.\nHere!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the\nbearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the\nweight they were carrying were too much for them.\n\nAs the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, passed the young man\nhe caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying\nman\xe2\x80\x99s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by\nthose who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly,\nleonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones,\nits handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was\nnot disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre\nremembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to\nPetersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven\nmovements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon\nnothing.\n\nAfter a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had\ncarried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna touched Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nhand and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome.\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre went with her to the bed on which the\nsick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony\njust completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His\nhands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms\ndownward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but\nwith a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal\nman. Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes\nthey must look somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated,\nnot knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick\nman\xe2\x80\x99s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre,\ncarefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her\nsuggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither\nthe hand nor a single muscle of the count\xe2\x80\x99s face stirred. Once more\nPierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna to see what he was to\ndo next. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood\nbeside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were\ndoing right. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell\ninto the na\xc3\xafvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently\ndistressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing\nhis utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who\nstill gazed at the spot where Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s face had been before he sat\ndown. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of\nthe pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the\nfather and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an\nhour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count\xe2\x80\x99s face began\nto twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one\nside (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and\nfrom that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna looked attentively at the sick man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, trying to\nguess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink,\nthen named Prince Vas\xc3\xadli in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the\nquilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an\neffort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the\nbed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWants to turn on the other side,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the servant, and got up\nto turn the count\xe2\x80\x99s heavy body toward the wall.\n\nPierre rose to help him.\n\nWhile the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back\nhelplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he\nnoticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm,\nor whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any\nrate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s terror-stricken\nface, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile\nappeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride\nhis own helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected\nquivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his\neyes. The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall.\nHe sighed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is dozing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, observing that one of the\nprincesses was coming to take her turn at watching. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre went out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nThere was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vas\xc3\xadli and the\neldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the\nGreat and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion\nthey became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide\nsomething as she whispered:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear the sight of that woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli to Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and take something, my poor Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, or you will not hold out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze\nbelow the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna into the small\ndrawing room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup\nof this delicious Russian tea,\xe2\x80\x9d Lorrain was saying with an air of\nrestrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese\nhandleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid\nin the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count\nBez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves.\nPierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors\nand little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not\nknow how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies\nwho, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and\npearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly\nlighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. Now\nthis same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea\nthings and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the\nnight a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly\nwhispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none\nof them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the\nbedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have\nliked to. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was\nagain going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli and the eldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was\nessential, and after a short interval followed her. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\nwas standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited\nwhispers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not\nnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the\nsame state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear princess,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna blandly but\nimpressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other\nfrom passing, \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment\nwhen he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is\nalready prepared...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude,\nwith one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so\nflabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but\nhe wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were\nsaying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my dear Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You\nknow how fond the count is of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what is in this paper,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger of\nthe two ladies, addressing Prince Vas\xc3\xadli and pointing to an inlaid\nportfolio she held in her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is that his real will is\nin his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe tried to pass Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar\nher path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, my dear, kind princess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, seizing\nthe portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous\nen conjure...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the\nportfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if\nthe princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none\nof its honeyed firmness and softness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a\nfamily consultation; is it not so, Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak, cousin?\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly shrieked the princess so\nloud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\ndo you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to\ninterfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man\xe2\x80\x99s room?\nIntriguer!\xe2\x80\x9d she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the\nportfolio.\n\nBut Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the\nportfolio, and changed her grip.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli rose. \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he with reproach and surprise,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess let go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you too!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna did not obey him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will go\nand ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, \xe2\x80\x9cafter such a solemn\nsacrament, allow him a moment\xe2\x80\x99s peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your\nopinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite\nclose, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess\nwhich had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember that you will answer for the consequences,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli severely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVile woman!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli bent his head and spread out his hands.\n\nAt this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long\nand which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged\nagainst the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out\nwringing her hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is dying and you\nleave me alone with him!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, stooping, quickly\ncaught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest\nprincess and Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, recovering themselves, followed her. A few\nminutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again\nbiting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an\nirrepressible hatred.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, now you may be glad!\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is what you have\nbeen waiting for.\xe2\x80\x9d And bursting into tears she hid her face in her\nhandkerchief and rushed from the room.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was\nsitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre\nnoticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an\nague.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was\nin his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it\nbefore. \xe2\x80\x9cHow often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am\nnear sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is\nawful...\xe2\x80\x9d and he burst into tears.\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet\nsteps.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPierre!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nPierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his\nforehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is no more....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre looked at her over his spectacles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as\ntears.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could\nsee his face. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna left him, and when she returned he was\nfast asleep with his head on his arm.\n\nIn the morning Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna said to Pierre:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you.\nBut God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command\nof an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you\nwell enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes\nduties on you, and you must be a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre was silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been\nthere, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised\nme only the day before yesterday not to forget Bor\xc3\xads. But he had\nno time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father\xe2\x80\x99s\nwish?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in\nsilence at Princess Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna returned to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 and went to bed. On waking in\nthe morning she told the Rost\xc3\xb3vs and all her acquaintances the details\nof Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s death. She said the count had died as she would\nherself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As\nto the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she\ncould not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved\nbetter during those awful moments\xe2\x80\x94the father who so remembered\neverything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to\nthe son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he\nwith grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his\ndying father. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the\nsoul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\nOf the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vas\xc3\xadli she spoke\ndisapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nAt Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andr\xc3\xa9evich Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s estate, the\narrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but\nthis expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old\nprince\xe2\x80\x99s household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andr\xc3\xa9evich\n(nicknamed in society, \xe2\x80\x9cthe King of Prussia\xe2\x80\x9d) ever since the Emperor\nPaul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously\nwith his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle\nBourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the\ncapitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that\nanyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to\nBald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to\nsay that there are only two sources of human vice\xe2\x80\x94idleness and\nsuperstition, and only two virtues\xe2\x80\x94activity and intelligence. He\nhimself undertook his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s education, and to develop these two\ncardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry\ntill she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was\noccupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving\nproblems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working\nin the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on\nat his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity,\nregularity in his household was carried to the highest point of\nexactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions,\nand not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about\nhim, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably\nexacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear\nand respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was\nin retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high\nofficial appointed to the province in which the prince\xe2\x80\x99s estate lay\nconsidered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber\njust as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince\nappeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this\nantechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when\nthe enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather\nsmall old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray\neyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd,\nyouthfully glittering eyes.\n\nOn the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess\nMary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the\nmorning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a\nsilent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning\nprayed that the daily interview might pass off well.\n\nAn old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose\nquietly and said in a whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease walk in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThrough the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly\nopened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the\nentrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round\ncontinued his work.\n\nThe enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use.\nThe large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted\nbookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while\nstanding up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with\ntools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around\xe2\x80\x94all indicated\ncontinuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of the small foot\nshod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure\nof the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the\ntenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. After a few more turns\nof the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel,\ndropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching\nthe table, summoned his daughter. He never gave his children a blessing,\nso he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding\nher tenderly and attentively, said severely:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite well? All right then, sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d He took the exercise book\ncontaining lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair\nwith his foot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor tomorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, quickly finding the page and making a\nscratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.\n\nThe princess bent over the exercise book on the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, here\xe2\x80\x99s a letter for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man suddenly,\ntaking a letter addressed in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand from a bag hanging above\nthe table, onto which he threw it.\n\nAt the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the\nprincess\xe2\x80\x99 face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom H\xc3\xa9lo\xc3\xafse?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his\nstill sound, yellowish teeth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s from Julie,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the princess with a timid glance\nand a timid smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll let two more letters pass, but the third I\xe2\x80\x99ll read,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe prince sternly; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid you write much nonsense. I\xe2\x80\x99ll read\nthe third!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead this if you like, Father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess, blushing still\nmore and holding out the letter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe third, I said the third!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the prince abruptly, pushing\nthe letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him\nthe exercise book containing geometrical figures.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, stooping over the book close to his\ndaughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat,\nso that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of\nold age and tobacco, which she had known so long. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, madam, these\ntriangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess looked in a scared way at her father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes glittering\nclose to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was\nplain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her\nfear would prevent her understanding any of her father\xe2\x80\x99s further\nexplanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the\nteacher\xe2\x80\x99s fault or the pupil\xe2\x80\x99s, this same thing happened every day:\nthe princess\xe2\x80\x99 eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear\nanything, but was only conscious of her stern father\xe2\x80\x99s withered face\nclose to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only\nof how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in\npeace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was\nsitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself\nand not become vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded,\nand sometimes flung the exercise book away.\n\nThe princess gave a wrong answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the prince, pushing the book\naside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and\ndown, lightly touched his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hair and sat down again.\n\nHe drew up his chair, and continued to explain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis won\xe2\x80\x99t do, Princess; it won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when Princess\nMary, having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day\xe2\x80\x99s\nlesson, was about to leave: \xe2\x80\x9cMathematics are most important, madam!\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll like it,\xe2\x80\x9d and he patted her cheek. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will drive all the\nnonsense out of your head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut\nbook from the high desk.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your H\xc3\xa9lo\xc3\xafse has\nsent you. Religious! I don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with anyone\xe2\x80\x99s belief... I\nhave looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.\n\nPrincess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that\nrarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She\nsat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and\nwhich was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as\nher father was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke\nthe seal of her letter. It was from her most intimate friend from\nchildhood; that same Julie Kar\xc3\xa1gina who had been at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99\nname-day party.\n\nJulie wrote in French:\n\nDear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is\nseparation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness\nare wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us\nour hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against\nfate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot\novercome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since\nwe parted. Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big\nstudy, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as\nthree months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle,\ncalm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me\nas I write?\n\nHaving read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror\nwhich stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and\nthin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness\nat her reflection in the glass. \xe2\x80\x9cShe flatters me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the\nprincess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter\nher friend, the princess\xe2\x80\x99 eyes\xe2\x80\x94large, deep and luminous (it seemed\nas if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)\xe2\x80\x94were\nso beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face\nthey gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty. But the\nprincess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes\xe2\x80\x94the look\nthey had when she was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her\nface assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a\nglass. She went on reading:\n\nAll Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already\nabroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march\nto the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought\nintends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant\nthat the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may\nbe overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His\ngoodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this\nwar has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart. I mean\nyoung Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain\ninactive and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to\nyou, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for\nthe army was a great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you\nlast summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which\none seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly,\nhe is so frank and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that\nmy relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the\nsweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much.\nSomeday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then.\nThat is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know\nthese poignant joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are\ngenerally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too\nyoung ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship,\nthis poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of\nthis! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of\nold Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses\nhave received very little, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli nothing, and it is Monsieur\nPierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been\nrecognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov and\npossessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he\nreturned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.\n\nI confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and\ninheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used\nto know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov and the\nowner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to\nwatch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by\nmarriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward\nhim, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort\nof fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves\nby finding husbands for me (most of whom I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know), the\nmatchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess\nBez\xc3\xbakhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post.\n\xc3\x80 propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal\nauntie Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of\na plan of marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to\nsomeone rich and distingu\xc3\xa9e, and it is on you that his relations\xe2\x80\x99\nchoice has fallen. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you will think of it, but\nI consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very\nhandsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find\nout about him.\n\nBut enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and\nMamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apr\xc3\xa1ksins\xe2\x80\x99. Read the\nmystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though\nthere are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it\nis an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give\nmy respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle\nBourienne. I embrace you as I love you.\n\nJULIE\n\nP.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.\n\nThe princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous\neyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then she suddenly\nrose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of\npaper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote,\nalso in French:\n\nDear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great\ndelight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which\nyou say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect\non you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if I\ndared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if\nwe had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why do you\nsuppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young\nman? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I understand such\nfeelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of\nthem, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me that Christian\nlove, love of one\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor, love of one\xe2\x80\x99s enemy, is worthier,\nsweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a\nyoung man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself.\n\nThe news of Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s death reached us before your letter\nand my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last\nrepresentative but one of the great century, and that it is his own\nturn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as\npossible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!\n\nI cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always\nseemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value\nmost in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine\nSaviour\xe2\x80\x99s words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the\neye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are\nterribly true. I pity Prince Vas\xc3\xadli but am still more sorry for Pierre.\nSo young, and burdened with such riches\xe2\x80\x94to what temptations he will be\nexposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be\npoorer than the poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the\nvolume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since\nyou tell me that among some good things it contains others which our\nweak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to\nspend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear\nno fruit. I never could understand the fondness some people have for\nconfusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken\ntheir doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for\nexaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read\nthe Epistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries\nthey contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the\nterrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh\nwhich forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us\nrather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our\ndivine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to\nconform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less\nwe let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who\nrejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek\nto fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will\nHe vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.\n\nMy father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he\nhas received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vas\xc3\xadli. In\nregard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet\nfriend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must\nconform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay\nthe duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as\nfaithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings\ntoward him whom He may give me for husband.\n\nI have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival\nat Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one,\nhowever, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war\ninto which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you\nare\xe2\x80\x94at the heart of affairs and of the world\xe2\x80\x94is the talk all of\nwar, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature\xe2\x80\x94which townsfolk\nconsider characteristic of the country\xe2\x80\x94rumors of war are heard\nand painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and\ncountermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day\nbefore yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a\nheartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our\npeople and starting to join the army. You should have seen the state of\nthe mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should\nhave heard the sobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten the\nlaws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of\ninjuries\xe2\x80\x94and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing\none another.\n\nAdieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy\nMother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!\n\nMARY\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched\nmine. I have written to my poor mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the smiling Mademoiselle\nBourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r\xe2\x80\x99s.\nShe brought into Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s strenuous, mournful, and gloomy\nworld a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and\nself-satisfied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess, I must warn you,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, lowering her voice and\nevidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with\nexaggerated grasseyement, \xe2\x80\x9cthe prince has been scolding Michael\nIv\xc3\xa1novich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Princess Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cI have asked you never\nto warn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge\nhim and would not have others do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes\nlate in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting\nroom with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, as the\nday was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the\nclavichord.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nThe gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of\nthe prince, who was in his large study. From the far side of the house\nthrough the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages\xe2\x80\x94twenty\ntimes repeated\xe2\x80\x94of a sonata by Dussek.\n\nJust then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the\nporch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to\nalight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old T\xc3\xadkhon, wearing\na wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in\na whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door.\nT\xc3\xadkhon knew that neither the son\xe2\x80\x99s arrival nor any other unusual\nevent must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince\nAndrew apparently knew this as well as T\xc3\xadkhon; he looked at his watch\nas if to ascertain whether his father\xe2\x80\x99s habits had changed since he\nwas at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he\nturned to his wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\nroom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes\nand her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as\nmerrily and prettily as ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is a palace!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her husband, looking around\nwith the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s come, quick, quick!\xe2\x80\x9d And with a glance round, she smiled at\nT\xc3\xadkhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that Mary practicing? Let\xe2\x80\x99s go quietly and take her by\nsurprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve grown older, T\xc3\xadkhon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in passing to the old man,\nwho kissed his hand.\n\nBefore they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord\ncame, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nrushed out apparently beside herself with delight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! what joy for the princess!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed she: \xe2\x80\x9cAt last! I must\nlet her know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe little princess, kissing her. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you already through my\nsister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s friendship for you. She was not expecting us?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound\nof the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and\nmade a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.\n\nThe little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the\nmiddle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s heavy tread and the\nsound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who\nhad only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they\nhappened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her\nhand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to\ncry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as\nlovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two women let go\nof one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each\nother\xe2\x80\x99s hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began\nkissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s surprise\nboth began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to\ncry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women\nit seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never\nentered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear!... Ah! Mary!...\xe2\x80\x9d they suddenly exclaimed, and then\nlaughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI dreamed last night...\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou were not expecting\nus?...\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mary, you have got thinner?...\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have grown\nstouter!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew the princess at once,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I had no idea!...\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Andrew, I\ndid not see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and\nhe told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had\nturned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm,\ngentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment,\nrested on Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\nThe little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip\ncontinually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary\nand drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of\nglittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had\nhad on the Sp\xc3\xa1sski Hill which might have been serious for her in her\ncondition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left\nall her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have\nto dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty\nOd\xc3\xbdntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary,\na real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was\nstill looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full\nof love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of\nthought independent of her sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s words. In the midst of a\ndescription of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are really going to the war, Andrew?\xe2\x80\x9d she said sighing.\n\nLise sighed too.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and even tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her brother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had\npromotion...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of\nthought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it certain?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nThe face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nquite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s\nand unexpectedly again began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe needs rest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew with a frown. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you,\nLise? Take her to your room and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Father. How is he? Just the\nsame?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just the same. Though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your opinion will\nbe,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the princess joyfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the\nlathe?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which\nshowed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was\naware of his weaknesses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and\nmy geometry lessons,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons\nin geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.\n\nWhen the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old\nprince to get up, T\xc3\xadkhon came to call the young prince to his father.\nThe old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his\nson\xe2\x80\x99s arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while\nhe dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned\nstyle, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew\nentered his father\xe2\x80\x99s dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and\nmanner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which\nhe talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered\nchair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to T\xc3\xadkhon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! here\xe2\x80\x99s the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nold man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which T\xc3\xadkhon\nwas holding fast to plait, would allow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like\nthis he\xe2\x80\x99ll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?\xe2\x80\x9d And he\nheld out his cheek.\n\nThe old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He\nused to say that a nap \xe2\x80\x9cafter dinner was silver\xe2\x80\x94before dinner,\ngolden.\xe2\x80\x9d) He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his\nthick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on\nthe spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father\xe2\x80\x99s favorite\ntopic\xe2\x80\x94making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly\nof Bonaparte.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is\npregnant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s face with an eager and respectful look. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is your\nhealth?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from\nmorning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God,\xe2\x80\x9d said his son smiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\nreturning to his hobby; \xe2\x80\x9ctell me how the Germans have taught you to\nfight Bonaparte by this new science you call \xe2\x80\x98strategy.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me time to collect my wits, Father,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a smile\nthat showed that his father\xe2\x80\x99s foibles did not prevent his son from\nloving and honoring him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I have not yet had time to settle\ndown!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to\nsee whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nhouse for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and\nshow her over, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk nineteen to the dozen. That\xe2\x80\x99s\ntheir woman\xe2\x80\x99s way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About\nMikhelson\xe2\x80\x99s army I understand\xe2\x80\x94Tolst\xc3\xb3y\xe2\x80\x99s too... a simultaneous\nexpedition.... But what\xe2\x80\x99s the southern army to do? Prussia is\nneutral... I know that. What about Austria?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, rising from his\nchair and pacing up and down the room followed by T\xc3\xadkhon, who ran after\nhim, handing him different articles of clothing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of Sweden? How\nwill they cross Pomerania?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began\xe2\x80\x94at first\nreluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit\nchanging unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on\xe2\x80\x94to explain\nthe plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army,\nninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out\nof her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was\nto join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty\nthousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in\nItaly and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English\nwere to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand\nmen was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did\nnot evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were\nnot listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three\ntimes unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nwhite one, the white one!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis meant that T\xc3\xadkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.\nAnother time he interrupted, saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will she soon be confined?\xe2\x80\x9d and shaking his head reproachfully\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s bad! Go on, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his\ndescription. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:\n\xe2\x80\x9cMalbrook s\xe2\x80\x99en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cMarlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he\xe2\x80\x99ll\n     return.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nHis son only smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s a plan I approve of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the son; \xe2\x80\x9cI am\nonly telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now,\nnot worse than this one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ve told me nothing new,\xe2\x80\x9d and the old man repeated,\nmeditatively and rapidly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nAt the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the\ndining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle\nBourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by\na strange caprice of his employer\xe2\x80\x99s was admitted to table though the\nposition of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly\nnot have caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept\nvery strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important\ngovernment officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael\nIv\xc3\xa1novich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his\nchecked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals,\nand had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cnot a whit worse than you or I.\xe2\x80\x9d At dinner the prince usually\nspoke to the taciturn Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich more often than to anyone else.\n\nIn the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was\nexceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen\xe2\x80\x94one\nbehind each chair\xe2\x80\x94stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head\nbutler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making\nsigns to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door\nby which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large\ngilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted\nportrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate)\nof a ruling prince, in a crown\xe2\x80\x94an alleged descendant of R\xc3\xbarik and\nancestor of the Bolk\xc3\xb3nskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that\ngenealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at\na portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow thoroughly like him that is!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Princess Mary, who had\ncome up to him.\n\nPrincess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand\nwhat he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with\nreverence and was beyond question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone has his Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 heel,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Prince Andrew.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\ncriticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard\ncoming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was\nhis wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners\nwith the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock\nstruck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing\nroom. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under\ntheir thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on\nthe little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the\nsensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around\nhim. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of\nher neck.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad, glad, to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking attentively into\nher eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\nsit down! Sit down, Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved\nthe chair for her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, ho!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a hurry. That\xe2\x80\x99s bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only\nand not with his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid.\n\nThe little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was\nsilent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and\nshe began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and\nshe became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings\nfrom various people and retelling the town gossip.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCountess Apr\xc3\xa1ksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has\ncried her eyes out,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, growing more and more lively.\n\nAs she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly,\nand suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a\ndefinite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time\nof it. Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x9d (he always spoke thus of his son) \xe2\x80\x9chas been\ntelling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I\nnever thought much of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMichael Iv\xc3\xa1novich did not at all know when \xe2\x80\x9cyou and I\xe2\x80\x9d had said\nsuch things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as\na peg on which to hang the prince\xe2\x80\x99s favorite topic, he looked\ninquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a great tactician!\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince to his son, pointing to\nthe architect.\n\nAnd the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the\ngenerals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not\nonly that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the\nA B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant\nlittle Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any\nPot\xc3\xabmkins or Suv\xc3\xb3rovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced\nthat there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war,\nbut only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing,\npretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him\nwith evident pleasure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe past always seems good,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut did not Suv\xc3\xb3rov\nhimself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know\nhow to escape?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that? Who?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the prince. \xe2\x80\x9cSuv\xc3\xb3rov!\xe2\x80\x9d And he\njerked away his plate, which T\xc3\xadkhon briskly caught. \xe2\x80\x9cSuv\xc3\xb3rov!...\nConsider, Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suv\xc3\xb3rov; Moreau!...\nMoreau would have been a prisoner if Suv\xc3\xb3rov had had a free hand; but\nhe had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have\npuzzled the devil himself! When you get there you\xe2\x80\x99ll find out what\nthose Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suv\xc3\xb3rov couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage them so\nwhat chance has Michael Kut\xc3\xbazov? No, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou and your generals won\xe2\x80\x99t get on against Buonaparte; you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nhave to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight\ntogether. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to\nfetch the Frenchman, Moreau,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, alluding to the invitation made\nthat year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... \xe2\x80\x9cWonderful!...\nWere the Pot\xc3\xabmkins, Suv\xc3\xb3rovs, and Orl\xc3\xb3vs Germans? No, lad, either you\nfellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help\nyou, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great\ncommander among them! Hm!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t at all say that all the plans are good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nAndrew, \xe2\x80\x9cI am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You\nmay laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great\ngeneral!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael Iv\xc3\xa1novich!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old prince to the architect who,\nbusy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t\nI tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the architect.\n\nThe prince again laughed his frigid laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got\nsplendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only\nidlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody\nhas beaten the Germans. They beat no one\xe2\x80\x94except one another. He made\nhis reputation fighting them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to\nhim, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His\nson made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were\npresented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He\nlistened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this\nold man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and\ndiscuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and\npolitical events.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think I\xe2\x80\x99m an old man and don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the present state\nof affairs?\xe2\x80\x9d concluded his father. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it troubles me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nsleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown\nhis skill?\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would take too long to tell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nexclaimed in excellent French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDieu sait quand reviendra.\xe2\x80\x9d hummed the prince out of tune and, with\na laugh still more so, he quitted the table.\n\nThe little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of\nthe dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her\nfather-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she\ntook her sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s arm and drew her into another room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a clever man your father is,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps that is why\nI am afraid of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he is so kind!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Princess Mary.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nPrince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering\nhis routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was in\nher sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without\nepaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him.\nAfter inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he\nordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those things he always kept\nwith him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted\nwith silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber\xe2\x80\x94a present from\nhis father who had brought it from the siege of Och\xc3\xa1kov. All these\ntraveling effects of Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s were in very good order: new,\nclean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.\n\nWhen starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable\nof reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments\none reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s face\nlooked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced\nbriskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him\nand thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was\nhe sad at leaving his wife?\xe2\x80\x94perhaps both, but evidently he did not\nwish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he\nhurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the\ncover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable\nexpression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear you have given orders to harness,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, panting (she\nhad apparently been running), \xe2\x80\x9cand I did so wish to have another talk\nwith you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not\nangry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andr\xc3\xbasha,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\nas if to explain such a question.\n\nShe smiled as she uttered his pet name, \xe2\x80\x9cAndr\xc3\xbasha.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\nobviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be\nAndr\xc3\xbasha\xe2\x80\x94the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in\nchildhood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is Lise?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, answering her question only by a\nsmile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.\nOh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, sitting\ndown on the sofa, facing her brother. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is quite a child: such a\ndear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and\ncontemptuous look that showed itself on his face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,\nAndrew? Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that she has grown up and been educated in\nsociety, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into\neveryone\xe2\x80\x99s situation. Tout comprendre, c\xe2\x80\x99est tout pardonner. * Think\nwhat it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to,\nto be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her\ncondition! It\xe2\x80\x99s very hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * To understand all is to forgive all.\n\nPrince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we\nthink we thoroughly understand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou live in the country and don\xe2\x80\x99t think the life terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nreplied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI... that\xe2\x80\x99s different. Why speak of me? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any other\nlife, and can\xe2\x80\x99t, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young\nsociety woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her\nlife, all alone\xe2\x80\x94for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what\npoor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society.\nThere is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nAndrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she\xe2\x80\x99s much to be\npitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need her,\nand she\xe2\x80\x99s even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am\neven more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and\nMichael Iv\xc3\xa1novich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and\nkind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says:\n\xe2\x80\x98We don\xe2\x80\x99t love people so much for the good they have done us, as\nfor the good we have done them.\xe2\x80\x99 Father took her when she was homeless\nafter losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father\nlikes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads\nsplendidly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father\xe2\x80\x99s character sometimes\nmakes things trying for you, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew asked\nsuddenly.\n\nPrincess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me? For me?... Trying for me!...\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe always was rather harsh; and now I should think he\xe2\x80\x99s getting\nvery trying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their\nfather in order to puzzle or test his sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of\nintellectual pride,\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess, following the train of her own\nthoughts rather than the trend of the conversation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s a\ngreat sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling\nexcept veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so\ncontented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I\nam.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer brother shook his head incredulously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth,\nAndrew... is Father\xe2\x80\x99s way of treating religious subjects. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is\nas clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing\nthat makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of\nimprovement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a\nmonk he received and had a long talk with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your\npowder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.\nAndrew...\xe2\x80\x9d she said timidly after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a\ngreat favor to ask of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble\nand is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,\nAndr\xc3\xbasha!...\xe2\x80\x9d said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet\ntaking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were\nthe subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was\ngranted.\n\nShe looked timidly at her brother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if it were a great deal of trouble...\xe2\x80\x9d answered Prince Andrew,\nas if guessing what it was about.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as\nyou please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father\xe2\x80\x99s father, our\ngrandfather, wore it in all his wars.\xe2\x80\x9d (She still did not take out\nwhat she was holding in her reticule.) \xe2\x80\x9cSo you promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will\nnever take it off. Do you promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it does not weigh a hundredweight and won\xe2\x80\x99t break my neck...\nTo please you...\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing\nthe pained expression his joke had brought to his sister\xe2\x80\x99s face, he\nrepented and added: \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgainst your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you\nto Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,\xe2\x80\x9d said she in a voice\ntrembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her\nbrother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold\nsetting, on a finely wrought silver chain.\n\nShe crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Andrew, for my sake!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit\nup the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother\nwould have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood,\ncrossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for\nhe was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d She kissed him on the forehead and sat down\nagain on the sofa. They were silent for a while.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always\nused to be. Don\xe2\x80\x99t judge Lise harshly,\xe2\x80\x9d she began. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is so\nsweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think I have complained of my wife to you, M\xc3\xa1sha, or blamed\nher. Why do you say all this to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRed patches appeared on Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s face and she was silent as if\nshe felt guilty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And\nI am sorry for that,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\n\nThe patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to\nsay something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little\nprincess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings\nabout her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her\nfate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen\nasleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow this, M\xc3\xa1sha: I can\xe2\x80\x99t reproach, have not reproached, and never\nshall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself\nwith anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever\ncircumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if\nyou want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this\nis so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed\nher forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and\nunaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over\nher head toward the darkness of the open doorway.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to her, I must say good-by. Or\xe2\x80\x94go and wake and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\ncome in a moment. Petr\xc3\xbashka!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to his valet: \xe2\x80\x9cCome here,\ntake these away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him\nto give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been\nanswered.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, M\xc3\xa1sha; I\xe2\x80\x99ll come\nimmediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the way to his sister\xe2\x80\x99s room, in the passage which connected one\nwing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling\nsweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and\nartless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I thought you were in your room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, for some reason\nblushing and dropping her eyes.\n\nPrince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly\ncame over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead\nand hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the\nFrenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying\none word after another, came through the open door. She was speaking as\nusual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make\nup for lost time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but imagine the old Countess Z\xc3\xbabova, with false curls and her\nmouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age....\nHa, ha, ha! Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis very sentence about Countess Z\xc3\xbabova and this same laugh Prince\nAndrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some\nfive times. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and\nrosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking\nincessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince\nAndrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after\ntheir journey. She answered him and continued her chatter.\n\nThe coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn\nnight, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.\nServants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense\nhouse was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The\ndomestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to\nthe young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the\nreception hall: Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess\nMary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All\nwere waiting for them to come out.\n\nWhen Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age\nspectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his\nson, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing?\xe2\x80\x9d And he went on writing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come to say good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss me here,\xe2\x80\x9d and he touched his cheek: \xe2\x80\x9cThanks, thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you thank me for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s apron strings.\nThe Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d And he went on\nwriting, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have\nanything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your\nhands....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy talk nonsense? Say what you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let\nhim be here....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his\nstern eyes on his son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Andrew, evidently confused. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that out of a million\ncases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been\ntelling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm... Hm...\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he\nwas writing. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to\nlaugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bad business, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is bad, Father?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wife!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old prince, briefly and significantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\nall like that; one can\xe2\x80\x99t unmarry. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid; I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell\nanyone, but you know it yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked\nstraight into his son\xe2\x80\x99s face with keen eyes which seemed to see\nthrough him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.\n\nThe son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The\nold man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing\ndown the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done? She\xe2\x80\x99s pretty! I will do everything. Make your\nmind easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.\n\nAndrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father\nunderstood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t worry about your wife: what can be\ndone shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilari\xc3\xb3novich. *\nI have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not\nkeep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember\nand like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all\nright\xe2\x80\x94serve him. Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s son need not serve under\nanyone if he is in disfavor. Now come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     *Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\nHe spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son\nwas accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the\nlid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his\nbold, tall, close handwriting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs;\nhand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond\nand a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of\nSuv\xc3\xb3rov\xe2\x80\x99s wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for\nyou to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAndrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time\nyet. He felt that he must not say it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do it all, Father,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me,\nyour old father...\xe2\x80\x9d he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous\nvoice suddenly shrieked: \xe2\x80\x9cbut if I hear that you have not behaved like\na son of Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, I shall be ashamed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not have said that to me, Father,\xe2\x80\x9d said the son with a\nsmile.\n\nThe old man was silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also wanted to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cif I\xe2\x80\x99m\nkilled and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you\xe2\x80\x94as I\nsaid yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot let the wife have him?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, and laughed.\n\nThey stood silent, facing one another. The old man\xe2\x80\x99s sharp eyes were\nfixed straight on his son\xe2\x80\x99s. Something twitched in the lower part of\nthe old prince\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve said good-by. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry\nvoice, opening his door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What?\xe2\x80\x9d asked both princesses when they saw for a moment\nat the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white\ndressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.\n\nPrince Andrew sighed and made no reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to his wife.\n\nAnd this \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: \xe2\x80\x9cNow\ngo through your performance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew, already!\xe2\x80\x9d said the little princess, turning pale and\nlooking with dismay at her husband.\n\nHe embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.\n\nHe cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face,\nand carefully placed her in an easy chair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdieu, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand\nand kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.\n\nThe little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing\nher temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked\nwith her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince\nAndrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From\nthe study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man\nangrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study\ndoor opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white\ndressing gown looked out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone? That\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; and looking angrily at the\nunconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed\nthe door.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TWO: 1805\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIn October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of\nthe Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from\nRussia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the\ninhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the headquarters of\nthe commander in chief, Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\nOn October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached\nBraunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected\nby the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the\nlocality and surroundings\xe2\x80\x94fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs,\nand hills in the distance\xe2\x80\x94and despite the fact that the inhabitants\n(who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the\nregiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for\nan inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.\n\nOn the evening of the last day\xe2\x80\x99s march an order had been received that\nthe commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though\nthe words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and\nthe question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or\nnot, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders\nto present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is\nalways better to \xe2\x80\x9cbow too low than not bow low enough.\xe2\x80\x9d So the\nsoldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all\nnight long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and\ncompany commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the\nregiment\xe2\x80\x94instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on\nits last march the day before\xe2\x80\x94presented a well-ordered array of two\nthousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every button\nand every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only\nexternally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief\nto look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean\nshirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, \xe2\x80\x9cawl,\nsoap, and all,\xe2\x80\x9d as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance\nconcerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of the\nsoldiers\xe2\x80\x99 boots. More than half the men\xe2\x80\x99s boots were in holes. But\nthis defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for\nin spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian\ncommissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.\n\nThe commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and\nthick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from\nchest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform\nshowing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes\nwhich seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He\nhad the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of\nhis life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled\nhimself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander\nadmired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was\nengrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military\nmatters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his\nthoughts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Michael M\xc3\xadtrich, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing one of the\nbattalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that\nthey both felt happy). \xe2\x80\x9cWe had our hands full last night. However, I\nthink the regiment is not a bad one, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not be turned off the field even on the Tsar\xc3\xadtsin\nMeadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the commander.\n\nAt that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been\nposted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aide-de-camp\nfollowed by a Cossack.\n\nThe aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been\nclearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief\nwished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on\nthe march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation\nwhatever.\n\nA member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kut\xc3\xbazov the day\nbefore with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of\nthe Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kut\xc3\xbazov, not considering this\njunction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view,\nto show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops\narrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the regiment;\nso the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander\nin chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know these\ncircumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the\nmen should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the\ncommander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the\nregimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and\nspread out his arms with a choleric gesture.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine mess we\xe2\x80\x99ve made of it!\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you, Michael M\xc3\xadtrich, that if it was said\n\xe2\x80\x98on the march\xe2\x80\x99 it meant in greatcoats?\xe2\x80\x9d said he reproachfully to\nthe battalion commander. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, stepping resolutely\nforward. \xe2\x80\x9cCompany commanders!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in a voice accustomed to\ncommand. \xe2\x80\x9cSergeants major!... How soon will he be here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\nthe aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the\npersonage he was referring to.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time, I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we have time to change clothes?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, General....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the\nsoldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders ran off\nto their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats\nwere not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up\nto then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and\nhum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing\nup their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps\nover their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on\nwith upraised arms.\n\nIn half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray\ninstead of black. The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps\nto the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever is this? This!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted and stood still. \xe2\x80\x9cCommander\nof the third company!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to\nthe general... third company to the commander.\xe2\x80\x9d The words passed along\nthe lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.\n\nWhen the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in\na cry of: \xe2\x80\x9cThe general to the third company,\xe2\x80\x9d the missing officer\nappeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged man\nand not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his\ntoes toward the general. The captain\xe2\x80\x99s face showed the uneasiness of\na schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned. Spots\nappeared on his nose, the redness of which was evidently due to\nintemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The general looked the\ncaptain up and down as he came up panting, slackening his pace as he\napproached.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing\nat a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish\ncloth, which contrasted with the others. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been after?\nThe commander in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nteach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior,\npressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this\npressure lay his only hope of salvation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a\nHungarian?\xe2\x80\x9d said the commander with an austere gibe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your\nexcellency?... nobody knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency, it\xe2\x80\x99s the officer D\xc3\xb3lokhov, who has been reduced\nto the ranks,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain softly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier?\nIf a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the\nothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGave him leave? Leave? That\xe2\x80\x99s just like you young men,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nregimental commander cooling down a little. \xe2\x80\x9cLeave indeed.... One says\na word to you and you... What?\xe2\x80\x9d he added with renewed irritation, \xe2\x80\x9cI\nbeg you to dress your men decently.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky\nsteps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display of\nanger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for\nwrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another\nbecause his line was not straight, he reached the third company.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cH-o-o-w are you standing? Where\xe2\x80\x99s your leg? Your leg?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nthe commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were\nstill five men between him and D\xc3\xb3lokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his\nclear, insolent eyes in the general\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his coat...\nthe ras...\xe2\x80\x9d he did not finish.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...\xe2\x80\x9d\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov hurriedly interrupted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot bound to endure insults,\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov concluded in loud, ringing\ntones.\n\nThe eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became silent,\nangrily pulling down his tight scarf.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI request you to have the goodness to change your coat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as\nhe turned away.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the signaler at that moment.\n\nThe regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup\nwith trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself,\ndrew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening\nhis mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered like a bird\npreening its plumage and became motionless.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAtt-ention!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking\nvoice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and\nwelcome for the approaching chief.\n\nAlong the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high,\nlight blue Viennese cal\xc3\xa8che, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn\nby six horses at a smart trot. Behind the cal\xc3\xa8che galloped the suite\nand a convoy of Croats. Beside Kut\xc3\xbazov sat an Austrian general, in\na white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones. The\ncal\xc3\xa8che stopped in front of the regiment. Kut\xc3\xbazov and the Austrian\ngeneral were talking in low voices and Kut\xc3\xbazov smiled slightly as\ntreading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two\nthousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did\nnot exist.\n\nThe word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a\njingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence the\nfeeble voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment roared,\n\xe2\x80\x9cHealth to your ex... len... len... lency!\xe2\x80\x9d and again all became\nsilent. At first Kut\xc3\xbazov stood still while the regiment moved; then he\nand the general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the\nranks.\n\nFrom the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and\ndevoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from\nthe way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward\nand hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he\ndarted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief,\nit was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even\ngreater zeal than his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness and\nassiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that\nhad reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition. There\nwere only 217 sick and stragglers. Everything was in good order except\nthe boots.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few\nfriendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes\nalso to the soldiers. Looking at their boots he several times shook his\nhead sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression\nwhich seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help\nnoticing what a bad state of things it was. The regimental commander\nran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the\ncommander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s regarding the regiment. Behind Kut\xc3\xbazov, at a\ndistance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard, followed\nsome twenty men of his suite. These gentlemen talked among themselves\nand sometimes laughed. Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked\na handsome adjutant. This was Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. Beside him was his\ncomrade Nesv\xc3\xadtski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a\nkindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes. Nesv\xc3\xadtski could hardly\nkeep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked\nbeside him. This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or a\nchange in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental\ncommander\xe2\x80\x99s back and mimicked his every movement. Each time the\ncommander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward\nin exactly the same manner. Nesv\xc3\xadtski laughed and nudged the others to\nmake them look at the wag.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were\nstarting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the\nthird company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected this,\ninvoluntarily came closer to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Tim\xc3\xb3khin!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had\nbeen reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.\n\nOne would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself\nmore than Tim\xc3\xb3khin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental\ncommander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew\nhimself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained\nit had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kut\xc3\xbazov,\nwho evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good,\nquickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his\nscarred and puffy face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother Ismail comrade,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cA brave officer! Are you\nsatisfied with him?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the regimental commander.\n\nAnd the latter\xe2\x80\x94unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar\nofficer as in a looking glass\xe2\x80\x94started, moved forward, and answered:\n\xe2\x80\x9cHighly satisfied, your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all have our weaknesses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov smiling and walking away\nfrom him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe used to have a predilection for Bacchus.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did\nnot answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed\ncaptain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose\nwith such exactitude that Nesv\xc3\xadtski could not help laughing. Kut\xc3\xbazov\nturned round. The officer evidently had complete control of his face,\nand while Kut\xc3\xbazov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume\na most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.\n\nThe third company was the last, and Kut\xc3\xbazov pondered, apparently trying\nto recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the\nsuite and said in French:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told me to remind you of the officer D\xc3\xb3lokhov, reduced to the\nranks in this regiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is D\xc3\xb3lokhov?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, who had already changed into a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s gray greatcoat,\ndid not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired\nsoldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went\nup to the commander in chief, and presented arms.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you a complaint to make?\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov asked with a slight frown.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is D\xc3\xb3lokhov,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your\nduty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shan\xe2\x80\x99t forget you if you deserve\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as\nthey had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression\nto tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief\nso widely from a private.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing I ask of your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov said in his firm,\nringing, deliberate voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI ask an opportunity to atone for my fault\nand prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had\nturned from Captain Tim\xc3\xb3khin again flitted over his face. He turned\naway with a grimace as if to say that everything D\xc3\xb3lokhov had said to\nhim and everything he could say had long been known to him, that he was\nweary of it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away and\nwent to the carriage.\n\nThe regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed\nquarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and\nto rest after their hard marches.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t bear me a grudge, Prokh\xc3\xb3r Ign\xc3\xa1tych?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nregimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its\nquarters and riding up to Captain Tim\xc3\xb3khin who was walking in front.\n(The regimental commander\xe2\x80\x99s face now that the inspection was happily\nover beamed with irrepressible delight.) \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nservice... it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on\nparade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was very\npleased!\xe2\x80\x9d And he held out his hand to the captain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mention it, General, as if I\xe2\x80\x99d be so bold!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\ncaptain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where\ntwo front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end\nof a gun at Ismail.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd tell Mr. D\xc3\xb3lokhov that I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget him\xe2\x80\x94he may be quite\neasy. And tell me, please\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meaning to ask\xe2\x80\x94how is he\nbehaving himself, and in general...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency;\nbut his character...\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim\xc3\xb3khin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about his character?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the regimental commander.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s different on different days,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\nday he is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next he\xe2\x80\x99s\na wild beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, well!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the regimental commander. \xe2\x80\x9cStill, one\nmust have pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important\nconnections... Well, then, you just...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim\xc3\xb3khin, showing by his smile that\nhe understood his commander\xe2\x80\x99s wish.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe regimental commander sought out D\xc3\xb3lokhov in the ranks and, reining\nin his horse, said to him:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the next affair... epaulettes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking\nsmile on his lips change.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the regimental commander. \xe2\x80\x9cA\ncup of vodka for the men from me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added so that the soldiers\ncould hear. \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you all! God be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d and he rode past that\ncompany and overtook the next one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s really a good fellow, one can serve under him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nTim\xc3\xb3khin to the subaltern beside him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a word, a hearty one...\xe2\x80\x9d said the subaltern, laughing (the\nregimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).\n\nThe cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the\nsoldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 voices could be\nheard on every side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they said Kut\xc3\xbazov was blind of one eye?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so he is! Quite blind!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are. Boots and leg bands...\nhe noticed everything...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were\nsmeared with chalk\xe2\x80\x94as white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as\nthey do the guns.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, F\xc3\xa9deshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You\nwere near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow! The Prussians are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are\nputting them down. When they\xe2\x80\x99ve been put down, the war with Buonaparte\nwill begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you\xe2\x80\x99re a fool.\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d better listen more carefully!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is\nturning into the village already... they will have their buckwheat\ncooked before we reach our quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a biscuit, you devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you give me tobacco yesterday? That\xe2\x80\x99s just it, friend! Ah,\nwell, never mind, here you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey might call a halt here or we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do another four miles\nwithout eating.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still\nand are drawn along.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here, friend, the people are quite beggarly. There they all\nseemed to be Poles\xe2\x80\x94all under the Russian crown\xe2\x80\x94but here they\xe2\x80\x99re\nall regular Germans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSingers to the front\xe2\x80\x9d came the captain\xe2\x80\x99s order.\n\nAnd from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A\ndrummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing\nhis arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 song, commencing with the\nwords: \xe2\x80\x9cMorning dawned, the sun was rising,\xe2\x80\x9d and concluding: \xe2\x80\x9cOn\nthen, brothers, on to glory, led by Father K\xc3\xa1menski.\xe2\x80\x9d This song had\nbeen composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the\nonly change being that the words \xe2\x80\x9cFather K\xc3\xa1menski\xe2\x80\x9d were replaced by\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Kut\xc3\xbazov.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms\nas if flinging something to the ground, the drummer\xe2\x80\x94a lean, handsome\nsoldier of forty\xe2\x80\x94looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his\neyes. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him,\nhe raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious\nobject above his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly\nflung it down and began:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my bower, oh, my bower...!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my bower new...!\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet\nplayer, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front\nand, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and\nflourished his castanets as if threatening someone. The soldiers,\nswinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long\nsteps. Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs,\nand the tramp of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs were heard. Kut\xc3\xbazov and his suite were\nreturning to the town. The commander in chief made a sign that the\nmen should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed\npleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing\nsoldier and the gay and smartly marching men. In the second file\nfrom the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company,\na blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was D\xc3\xb3lokhov\nmarching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and\nlooking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that\nmoment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s\nsuite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the\ncarriage and rode up to D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\nHussar cornet Zherk\xc3\xb3v had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to\nthe wild set led by D\xc3\xb3lokhov. Zherk\xc3\xb3v had met D\xc3\xb3lokhov abroad as a\nprivate and had not seen fit to recognize him. But now that Kut\xc3\xbazov had\nspoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of\nan old friend.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he through the singing, making\nhis horse keep pace with the company.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I?\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov answered coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am as you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy\ngaiety with which Zherk\xc3\xb3v spoke, and to the intentional coldness of\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you get on with the officers?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Zherk\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto the\nstaff?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was attached; I\xe2\x80\x99m on duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBoth were silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve,\xe2\x80\x9d went the\nsong, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness.\nTheir conversation would probably have been different but for the effect\nof that song.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true that Austrians have been beaten?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil only knows! They say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad,\xe2\x80\x9d answered D\xc3\xb3lokhov briefly and clearly, as the song\ndemanded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, come round some evening and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a game of faro!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Zherk\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, have you too much money?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo come.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ve sworn not to. I won\xe2\x80\x99t drink and won\xe2\x80\x99t play till\nI get reinstated.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s only till the first engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey were again silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the\nstaff...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble. If I want anything, I won\xe2\x80\x99t\nbeg\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind; I only...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I only...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood health...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n        \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long, long way.\n        To my native land...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nZherk\xc3\xb3v touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from\nfoot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped\npast the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the\nsong.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nOn returning from the review, Kut\xc3\xbazov took the Austrian general into\nhis private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers\nrelating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the\nletters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of\nthe advanced army. Prince Andrew Bolk\xc3\xb3nski came into the room with the\nrequired papers. Kut\xc3\xbazov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath\nwere sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!...\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov glancing at Bolk\xc3\xb3nski as if by this\nexclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the\nconversation in French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I can say, General,\xe2\x80\x9d said he with a pleasant elegance\nof expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each\ndeliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kut\xc3\xbazov himself listened\nwith pleasure to his own voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I can say, General, is that if\nthe matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the\nEmperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I should long\nago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me\npersonally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command\nof the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful\ngeneral\xe2\x80\x94of whom Austria has so many\xe2\x80\x94and to lay down all this heavy\nresponsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us,\nGeneral.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Kut\xc3\xbazov smiled in a way that seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite at\nliberty not to believe me and I don\xe2\x80\x99t even care whether you do or\nnot, but you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole\npoint.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply\nin the same tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a querulous and angry tone that\ncontrasted with his flattering words, \xe2\x80\x9con the contrary, your\nexcellency\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the common action is highly valued by\nHis Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid\nRussian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been\naccustomed to win in their battles,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded his evidently\nprearranged sentence.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov bowed with the same smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which\nHis Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the\nAustrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General\nMack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need\nour aid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\nThe general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian\ndefeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors\nthat were afloat, and so Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion of an Austrian victory\nsounded much like irony. But Kut\xc3\xbazov went on blandly smiling with the\nsame expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose\nso. And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mack\xe2\x80\x99s army\ninformed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the\narmy was very favorable.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me that letter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov turning to Prince Andrew.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease have a look at it\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Kut\xc3\xbazov with an ironical smile\nabout the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the\nfollowing passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s letter:\n\nWe have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with\nwhich to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also,\nas we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of\ncommanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not\ncross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line\nof communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his\nintention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful\nally. We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial\nRussian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with\nit, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the\nmember of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect\nthe worst,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done\nwith jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round at the\naide-de-camp.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, General,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Kut\xc3\xbazov, also turning to Prince\nAndrew. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, my dear fellow, get from Kozl\xc3\xb3vski all the\nreports from our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and\nhere is one from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are\nthese,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, handing him several papers, \xe2\x80\x9cmake a neat memorandum\nin French out of all this, showing all the news we have had of the\nmovements of the Austrian army, and then give it to his excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the\nfirst not only what had been said but also what Kut\xc3\xbazov would have\nliked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both,\nstepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room.\n\nThough not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he\nhad changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face,\nin his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former\naffected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time\nto think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with\nagreeable and interesting work. His face expressed more satisfaction\nwith himself and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter\nand more attractive.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly,\npromised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants,\nand had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions.\nFrom Vienna Kut\xc3\xbazov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s father.\n\nYour son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry,\nfirmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to have such a\nsubordinate by me.\n\nOn Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s staff, among his fellow officers and in the army\ngenerally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two\nquite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be\ndifferent from themselves and from everyone else, expected great things\nof him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince\nAndrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the majority, disliked him and\nconsidered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people\nPrince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even\nfeared him.\n\nComing out of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s room into the waiting room with the papers in\nhis hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty,\nKozl\xc3\xb3vski, who was sitting at the window with a book.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kozl\xc3\xb3vski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not\nadvancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny news from Mack?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.\n\nBut at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the\norder of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head,\nwho had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door.\nPrince Andrew stopped short.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommander in Chief Kut\xc3\xbazov?\xe2\x80\x9d said the newly arrived general\nspeaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and\nadvancing straight toward the inner door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe commander in chief is engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kozl\xc3\xb3vski, going\nhurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom shall I announce?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozl\xc3\xb3vski, who was\nrather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe commander in chief is engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Kozl\xc3\xb3vski calmly.\n\nThe general\xe2\x80\x99s face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He took\nout a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the\nleaf, gave it to Kozl\xc3\xb3vski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw\nhimself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\ndo they look at me?\xe2\x80\x9d Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as\nif he intended to say something, but immediately, with affected\nindifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which\nimmediately broke off. The door of the private room opened and Kut\xc3\xbazov\nappeared in the doorway. The general with the bandaged head bent forward\nas though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides\nwith his thin legs, went up to Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVous voyez le malheureux Mack,\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered in a broken voice.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly\nimmobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave\nand his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully,\nclosed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed\nthe door himself behind him.\n\nThe report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten\nand that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct.\nWithin half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with\norders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been\ninactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.\n\nPrince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest\nlay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the\ndetails of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost,\nunderstood all the difficulties of the Russian army\xe2\x80\x99s position, and\nvividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to\nplay. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the\nhumiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week\xe2\x80\x99s time he might,\nperhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the\nFrench since Suv\xc3\xb3rov met them. He feared that Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s genius\nmight outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same\ntime could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced.\n\nExcited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his\nroom to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor\nhe met Nesv\xc3\xadtski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag Zherk\xc3\xb3v;\nthey were as usual laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so glum?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nesv\xc3\xadtski noticing Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\npale face and glittering eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be gay about,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\nJust as Prince Andrew met Nesv\xc3\xadtski and Zherk\xc3\xb3v, there came toward\nthem from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general\nwho was on Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian\narmy, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous\nevening. There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to\npass the three officers quite easily, but Zherk\xc3\xb3v, pushing Nesv\xc3\xadtski\naside with his arm, said in a breathless voice,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re coming!... they\xe2\x80\x99re coming!... Stand aside, make way,\nplease make way!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid\nembarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag Zherk\xc3\xb3v there suddenly\nappeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in German, stepping forward and\naddressing the Austrian general, \xe2\x80\x9cI have the honor to congratulate\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the\nother, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.\n\nThe member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing the\nseriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\nattention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived, quite\nwell, only a little bruised just here,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing with a\nbeaming smile to his head.\n\nThe general frowned, turned away, and went on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGott, wie naiv!\xe2\x80\x9d * said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cGood God, what simplicity!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nNesv\xc3\xadtski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and\nturned to Zherk\xc3\xb3v. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance\nof Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the\nRussian army found vent in anger at Zherk\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s untimely jest.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\nsharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent\nyour doing so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my\npresence, I will teach you to behave yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNesv\xc3\xadtski and Zherk\xc3\xb3v were so surprised by this outburst that they\ngazed at Bolk\xc3\xb3nski silently with wide-open eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? I only congratulated them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zherk\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not jesting with you; please be silent!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bolk\xc3\xb3nski,\nand taking Nesv\xc3\xadtski\xe2\x80\x99s arm he left Zherk\xc3\xb3v, who did not know what to\nsay.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, old fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski trying to\nsoothe him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in\nhis excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you understand that either we are officers\nserving our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and\ngrieving at the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely\nlackeys who care nothing for their master\xe2\x80\x99s business. Quarante mille\nhommes massacr\xc3\xa9s et l\xe2\x80\x99arm\xc3\xa9e de nos alli\xc3\xa9s d\xc3\xa9truite, et vous\ntrouvez l\xc3\xa0 le mot pour rire,\xe2\x80\x9d * he said, as if strengthening his\nviews by this French sentence. \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est bien pour un gar\xc3\xa7on de rien\ncomme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas\npour vous. *(2) Only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in Russian\xe2\x80\x94but pronouncing the word with a French\naccent\xe2\x80\x94having noticed that Zherk\xc3\xb3v could still hear him.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cForty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies\n     destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * (2) \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow\n     of whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for\n     you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nHe waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned\nand went out of the corridor.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe P\xc3\xa1vlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The\nsquadron in which Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v served as a cadet was quartered in\nthe German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were\nassigned to cavalry-captain Den\xc3\xadsov, the squadron commander, known\nthroughout the whole cavalry division as V\xc3\xa1ska Den\xc3\xadsov. Cadet Rost\xc3\xb3v,\never since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the\nsquadron commander.\n\nOn October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news\nof Mack\xe2\x80\x99s defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was\nproceeding as usual. Den\xc3\xadsov, who had been losing at cards all night,\nhad not yet come home when Rost\xc3\xb3v rode back early in the morning from\na foraging expedition. Rost\xc3\xb3v in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his\nhorse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple\nyouthful movement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to\npart from his horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Bondar\xc3\xa9nko, dear friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the hussar who rushed up\nheadlong to the horse. \xe2\x80\x9cWalk him up and down, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncontinued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young\npeople show to everyone when they are happy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his\nhead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind, walk him up and down well!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondar\xc3\xa9nko had already\nthrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head. It was\nevident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to\nserve him. Rost\xc3\xb3v patted the horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck and then his flank, and\nlingered for a moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid! What a horse he will be!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought with a smile, and\nholding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the\nporch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in\nhand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face\nimmediately brightened on seeing Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cSch\xc3\xb6n gut Morgen! Sch\xc3\xb6n\ngut Morgen!\xe2\x80\x9d * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased\nto greet the young man.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cA very good morning! A very good morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchon fleissig?\xe2\x80\x9d * said Rost\xc3\xb3v with the same gay brotherly smile\nwhich did not leave his eager face. \xe2\x80\x9cHoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen!\nKaiser Alexander hoch!\xe2\x80\x9d *(2) said he, quoting words often repeated by\nthe German landlord.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cBusy already?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * (2) \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians!\n     Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and\nwaving it above his head cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnd die ganze Welt hoch!\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cAnd hurrah for the whole world!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing,\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnd vivat die ganze Welt!\xe2\x80\x9d Though neither the German cleaning his\ncowshed nor Rost\xc3\xb3v back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any\nreason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and\nbrotherly love, wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection,\nand parted smiling, the German returning to his cowshed and Rost\xc3\xb3v\ngoing to the cottage he occupied with Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about your master?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Lavr\xc3\xbashka, Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s orderly,\nwhom all the regiment knew for a rogue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t been in since the evening. Must have been losing,\xe2\x80\x9d\nanswered Lavr\xc3\xbashka. \xe2\x80\x9cI know by now, if he wins he comes back early to\nbrag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means he\xe2\x80\x99s lost and\nwill come back in a rage. Will you have coffee?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, bring some.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTen minutes later Lavr\xc3\xbashka brought the coffee. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid he. \xe2\x80\x9cNow for trouble!\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v looked out of the window and\nsaw Den\xc3\xadsov coming home. Den\xc3\xadsov was a small man with a red face,\nsparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore an\nunfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled\nshako on the back of his head. He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging\nhis head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLavw\xc3\xbaska!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted loudly and angrily, \xe2\x80\x9ctake it off,\nblockhead!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am taking it off,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lavr\xc3\xbashka\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99re up already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov, entering the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong ago,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rost\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cI have already been for the hay,\nand have seen Fr\xc3\xa4ulein Mathilde.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeally! And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a\ndamned fool!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Den\xc3\xadsov, not pronouncing his r\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch ill\nluck! Such ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on. Hullo\nthere! Tea!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPuckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong\nteeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick\ntangled black hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what devil made me go to that wat?\xe2\x80\x9d (an officer nicknamed\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe rat\xe2\x80\x9d) he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cJust fancy, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t let me win a single cahd, not one\ncahd.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his\nfist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while he\ncontinued to shout.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it;\ngives the singles and snatches the doubles!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away.\nThen he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully\nwith his glittering, black eyes at Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf at least we had some women here; but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing foh one\nto do but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who\xe2\x80\x99s\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy\nboots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful\ncough.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe squadron quartermaster!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lavr\xc3\xbashka.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s face puckered still more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWetched!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWost\xc3\xb3v, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the\npurse undah the pillow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and went out to the quartermaster.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins\nin separate piles, began counting them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Tely\xc3\xa1nin! How d\xe2\x80\x99ye do? They plucked me last night,\xe2\x80\x9d came\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s voice from the next room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? At Bykov\xe2\x80\x99s, at the rat\xe2\x80\x99s... I knew it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied a piping\nvoice, and Lieutenant Tely\xc3\xa1nin, a small officer of the same squadron,\nentered the room.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand\nwhich was offered him. Tely\xc3\xa1nin for some reason had been transferred\nfrom the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very well in the\nregiment but was not liked; Rost\xc3\xb3v especially detested him and was\nunable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. (Rook\nwas a young horse Tely\xc3\xa1nin had sold to Rost\xc3\xb3v.)\n\nThe lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the\nface; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw you riding this morning...\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s all right, a good horse,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rost\xc3\xb3v, though the\nhorse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half\nthat sum. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hoof\xe2\x80\x99s cracked! That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you what to do\nand show you what kind of rivet to use.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, please do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you! It\xe2\x80\x99s not a secret. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a\nhorse you\xe2\x80\x99ll thank me for.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it brought round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v wishing to avoid\nTely\xc3\xa1nin, and he went out to give the order.\n\nIn the passage Den\xc3\xadsov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold\nfacing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nDen\xc3\xadsov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his\nthumb to the room where Tely\xc3\xa1nin was sitting, he frowned and gave a\nshudder of disgust.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh! I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, regardless of the\nquartermaster\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: \xe2\x80\x9cNor do I, but\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s one to do?\xe2\x80\x9d and, having given his order, he returned to\nTely\xc3\xa1nin.\n\nTely\xc3\xa1nin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rost\xc3\xb3v had\nleft him, rubbing his small white hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell there certainly are disgusting people,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v as he\nentered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you told them to bring the horse?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tely\xc3\xa1nin, getting up\nand looking carelessly about him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Den\xc3\xadsov about\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s order. Have you got it, Den\xc3\xadsov?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet. But where are you off to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nTely\xc3\xa1nin.\n\nThey went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant\nexplained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.\n\nWhen Rost\xc3\xb3v went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the\ntable. Den\xc3\xadsov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of\npaper. He looked gloomily in Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s face and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am witing\nto her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and,\nevidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to\nwrite, told Rost\xc3\xb3v the contents of his letter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my fwiend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe sleep when we don\xe2\x80\x99t love. We\nare childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one\nis pua\xe2\x80\x99 as on the fihst day of cweation... Who\xe2\x80\x99s that now? Send him\nto the devil, I\xe2\x80\x99m busy!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to Lavr\xc3\xbashka, who went up to\nhim not in the least abashed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho should it be? You yourself told him to come. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\nquartermaster for the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWetched business,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much is left in\nthe puhse?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, turning to Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven new and three old imperials.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you\nsca\xe2\x80\x99cwow? Call the quahtehmasteh,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to Lavr\xc3\xbashka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Den\xc3\xadsov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Rost\xc3\xb3v, blushing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d growled\nDen\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you won\xe2\x80\x99t accept money from me like a comrade, you will\noffend me. Really I have some,\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v repeated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Den\xc3\xadsov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you put it, Wost\xc3\xb3v?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the lower pillow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a miwacle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you dropped it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, picking up the\npillows one at a time and shaking them.\n\nHe pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you kept\nit under your head like a treasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cI put it just\nhere. Where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, turning to Lavr\xc3\xbashka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in the room. It must be where you put it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget\nit. Feel in your pockets.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of it being a treasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v,\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I remember putting it there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLavr\xc3\xbashka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under\nthe table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the\nroom. Den\xc3\xadsov silently watched Lavr\xc3\xbashka\xe2\x80\x99s movements, and when the\nlatter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found\nDen\xc3\xadsov glanced at Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWost\xc3\xb3v, you\xe2\x80\x99ve not been playing schoolboy twicks...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v felt Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and\ninstantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested\nsomewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not\ndraw breath.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and\nyourselves. It must be here somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lavr\xc3\xbashka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, you devil\xe2\x80\x99s puppet, look alive and hunt for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\nshouted Den\xc3\xadsov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with\na threatening gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the purse isn\xe2\x80\x99t found I\xe2\x80\x99ll flog you,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll flog you all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, his eyes avoiding Den\xc3\xadsov, began buttoning his coat, buckled\non his saber, and put on his cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have that purse, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Den\xc3\xadsov, shaking his\norderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDen\xc3\xadsov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v,\ngoing toward the door without raising his eyes. Den\xc3\xadsov paused, thought\na moment, and, evidently understanding what Rost\xc3\xb3v hinted at, seized\nhis arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood\nout like cords. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad, I tell you. I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow it.\nThe purse is here! I\xe2\x80\x99ll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be\nfound.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know who has taken it,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Rost\xc3\xb3v in an unsteady voice,\nand went to the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I tell you, don\xe2\x80\x99t you dahe to do it!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Den\xc3\xadsov,\nrushing at the cadet to restrain him.\n\nBut Rost\xc3\xb3v pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though\nDen\xc3\xadsov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his\nface.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a trembling\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it\nis not so, then...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe could not finish, and ran out of the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, may the devil take you and evewybody,\xe2\x80\x9d were the last words\nRost\xc3\xb3v heard.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v went to Tely\xc3\xa1nin\xe2\x80\x99s quarters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe master is not in, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to headquarters,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nTely\xc3\xa1nin\xe2\x80\x99s orderly. \xe2\x80\x9cHas something happened?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, surprised\nat the cadet\xe2\x80\x99s troubled face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve only just missed him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the orderly.\n\nThe headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and\nRost\xc3\xb3v, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was\nan inn in the village which the officers frequented. Rost\xc3\xb3v rode up to\nit and saw Tely\xc3\xa1nin\xe2\x80\x99s horse at the porch.\n\nIn the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of\nsausages and a bottle of wine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve come here too, young man!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling and\nraising his eyebrows.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v as if it cost him a great deal to utter the\nword; and he sat down at the nearest table.\n\nBoth were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the\nroom. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives\nand the munching of the lieutenant.\n\nWhen Tely\xc3\xa1nin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double\npurse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned-up\nfingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to\nthe waiter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease be quick,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe coin was a new one. Rost\xc3\xb3v rose and went up to Tely\xc3\xa1nin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to look at your purse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low, almost\ninaudible, voice.\n\nWith shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Tely\xc3\xa1nin handed him the\npurse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice purse. Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, growing suddenly\npale, and added, \xe2\x80\x9cLook at it, young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and\nlooked at Tely\xc3\xa1nin. The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way\nand suddenly seemed to grow very merry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we get to Vienna I\xe2\x80\x99ll get rid of it there but in these wretched\nlittle towns there\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere to spend it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let me\nhave it, young man, I\xe2\x80\x99m going.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v did not speak.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite\ndecently here,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Tely\xc3\xa1nin. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, let me have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rost\xc3\xb3v let go of\nit. Tely\xc3\xa1nin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the\npocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth\nslightly open, as if to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I am putting my purse in my\npocket and that\xe2\x80\x99s quite simple and is no one else\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, young man?\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted\nbrows he glanced into Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\nSome flash as of an electric spark shot from Tely\xc3\xa1nin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s and back, and back again and again in an instant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, catching hold of Tely\xc3\xa1nin\xe2\x80\x99s arm and\nalmost dragging him to the window. \xe2\x80\x9cThat money is Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s; you\ntook it...\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered just above Tely\xc3\xa1nin\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What? How dare you? What?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tely\xc3\xa1nin.\n\nBut these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for\npardon. As soon as Rost\xc3\xb3v heard them, an enormous load of doubt\nfell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the\nmiserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be\ncompleted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven only knows what the people here may imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered\nTely\xc3\xa1nin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nmust have an explanation...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it and shall prove it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEvery muscle of Tely\xc3\xa1nin\xe2\x80\x99s pale, terrified face began to quiver, his\neyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising\nto Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s face, and his sobs were audible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount!... Don\xe2\x80\x99t ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money,\ntake it...\xe2\x80\x9d He threw it on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI have an old father and\nmother!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v took the money, avoiding Tely\xc3\xa1nin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and went out of the\nroom without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced his\nsteps. \xe2\x80\x9cO God,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with tears in his eyes, \xe2\x80\x9chow could you do\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount...\xe2\x80\x9d said Tely\xc3\xa1nin drawing nearer to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t touch me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, drawing back. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you need it,\ntake the money,\xe2\x80\x9d and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThat same evening there was an animated discussion among the\nsquadron\xe2\x80\x99s officers in Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s quarters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I tell you, Rost\xc3\xb3v, that you must apologize to the colonel!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and\nmany wrinkles on his large features, to Rost\xc3\xb3v who was crimson with\nexcitement.\n\nThe staff captain, K\xc3\xadrsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for\naffairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will allow no one to call me a liar!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cHe told\nme I lied, and I told him he lied. And there it rests. He may keep me\non duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make\nme apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it\nbeneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\nthe staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an\nofficer has stolen...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of\nother officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am\nnot a diplomatist. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I joined the hussars, thinking that here\none would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying\xe2\x80\x94so let him\ngive me satisfaction...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the\npoint. Ask Den\xc3\xadsov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to\ndemand satisfaction of his regimental commander?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the\nconversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered the\nstaff captain\xe2\x80\x99s question by a disapproving shake of his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other\nofficers,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the staff captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand Bogd\xc3\xa1nich\xe2\x80\x9d (the\ncolonel was called Bogd\xc3\xa1nich) \xe2\x80\x9cshuts you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must\napologize.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot on any account!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not expect this of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the staff captain seriously and\nseverely. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to apologize, but, man, it\xe2\x80\x99s not only to\nhim but to the whole regiment\xe2\x80\x94all of us\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re to blame all round.\nThe case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and\ntaken advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the\nofficers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and\ndisgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one\nscoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We don\xe2\x80\x99t see it like that. And\nBogd\xc3\xa1nich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not pleasant, but what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done, my dear fellow? You landed\nyourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some\nconceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole\naffair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not\napologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever Bogd\xc3\xa1nich may\nbe, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! You\xe2\x80\x99re quick at\ntaking offense, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind disgracing the whole regiment!\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe staff captain\xe2\x80\x99s voice began to tremble. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been in the\nregiment next to no time, my lad, you\xe2\x80\x99re here today and tomorrow\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when\nit is said \xe2\x80\x98There are thieves among the P\xc3\xa1vlograd officers!\xe2\x80\x99 But\nit\xe2\x80\x99s not all the same to us! Am I not right, Den\xc3\xadsov? It\xe2\x80\x99s not the\nsame!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with\nhis glittering black eyes at Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou value your own pride and don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to apologize,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\nthe staff captain, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we old fellows, who have grown up in and, God\nwilling, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the\nregiment, and Bogd\xc3\xa1nich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And\nall this is not right, it\xe2\x80\x99s not right! You may take offense or not but\nI always stick to mother truth. It\xe2\x80\x99s not right!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the staff captain rose and turned away from Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s twue, devil take it!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Den\xc3\xadsov, jumping up. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\nthen, Wost\xc3\xb3v, now then!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one officer\nand then at the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, gentlemen, no... you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think... I quite understand.\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of\nthe regiment I\xe2\x80\x99d... Ah well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show that in action, and for me\nthe honor of the flag... Well, never mind, it\xe2\x80\x99s true I\xe2\x80\x99m to blame,\nto blame all round. Well, what else do you want?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, Count!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the staff captain, turning\nround and clapping Rost\xc3\xb3v on the shoulder with his big hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Den\xc3\xadsov, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s a fine fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s better, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d said the staff captain, beginning to\naddress Rost\xc3\xb3v by his title, as if in recognition of his confession.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Rost\xc3\xb3v in an imploring voice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t apologize, by God I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy\nasking forgiveness?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov began to laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be worse for you. Bogd\xc3\xa1nich is vindictive and you\xe2\x80\x99ll pay\nfor your obstinacy,\xe2\x80\x9d said K\xc3\xadrsten.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, on my word it\xe2\x80\x99s not obstinacy! I can\xe2\x80\x99t describe the feeling.\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s as you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the staff captain. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what has\nbecome of that scoundrel?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has weported himself sick, he\xe2\x80\x99s to be stwuck off the list\ntomowwow,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an illness, there\xe2\x80\x99s no other way of explaining it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe staff captain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIllness or not, he\xe2\x80\x99d better not cwoss my path. I\xe2\x80\x99d kill him!\xe2\x80\x9d\nshouted Den\xc3\xadsov in a bloodthirsty tone.\n\nJust then Zherk\xc3\xb3v entered the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat brings you here?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the officers turning to the newcomer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his\nwhole army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not true!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInto action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how\ndid you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil,\nMack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on\nMack\xe2\x80\x99s arrival... What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Rost\xc3\xb3v? You look as if you\xe2\x80\x99d\njust come out of a hot bath.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear fellow, we\xe2\x80\x99re in such a stew here these last two\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by\nZherk\xc3\xb3v. They were under orders to advance next day.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going into action, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thank God! We\xe2\x80\x99ve been sitting here too long!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over\nthe rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz). On October 23 the\nRussian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the Russian\nbaggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling\nthrough the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.\n\nIt was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out\nbefore the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the\nbridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and\nthen, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could\nbe clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below,\nthe little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its\ncathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling\nmasses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island,\nand a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of\nthe Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the\nDanube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green\ntreetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a\nwild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the\nenemy\xe2\x80\x99s horse patrols could be discerned.\n\nAmong the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of\nthe rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through\nhis fieldglass. A little behind them Nesv\xc3\xadtski, who had been sent to\nthe rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a\ngun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack\nand a flask, and Nesv\xc3\xadtski was treating some officers to pies and real\ndoppelk\xc3\xbcmmel. The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their\nknees, some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. It\xe2\x80\x99s\na fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d Nesv\xc3\xadtski\nwas saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d answered one of the officers, pleased\nto be talking to a staff officer of such importance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely\nplace! We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a\nsplendid house!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, who would have dearly liked to take\nanother pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the\ncountryside\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSee, our infantrymen have already got there. Look there\nin the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something.\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ll ransack that castle,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked with evident approval.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, but what I should like,\xe2\x80\x9d\nadded he, munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be\nto slip in over there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and\ngleamed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be fine, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officers laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls\namong them. On my word I\xe2\x80\x99d give five years of my life for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must be feeling dull, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the bolder officers,\nlaughing.\n\nMeanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to\nthe general, who looked through his field glass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, so it is, so it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the general angrily, lowering the\nfield glass and shrugging his shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cso it is! They\xe2\x80\x99ll be fired\non at the crossing. And why are they dawdling there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from\ntheir battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant report of\na shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.\n\nNesv\xc3\xadtski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould not your excellency like a little refreshment?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bad business,\xe2\x80\x9d said the general without answering him,\n\xe2\x80\x9cour men have been wasting time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn\xe2\x80\x99t I better ride over, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nesv\xc3\xadtski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, please do,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the general, and he repeated the order\nthat had already once been given in detail: \xe2\x80\x9cand tell the hussars\nthat they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the\ninflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nesv\xc3\xadtski.\n\nHe called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack\nand flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll really call in on the nuns,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the officers who\nwatched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the\nhill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, let\xe2\x80\x99s see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the general, turning to an artillery officer. \xe2\x80\x9cHave a little fun\nto pass the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrew, to your guns!\xe2\x80\x9d commanded the officer.\n\nIn a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began\nloading.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne!\xe2\x80\x9d came the command.\n\nNumber one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening\nmetallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our\ntroops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke\nshowing the spot where it burst.\n\nThe faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got\nup and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly\nvisible as if but a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw away, and the movements of the\napproaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came fully\nout from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot\nand the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and\nspirited impression.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTwo of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s shots had already flown across the bridge, where\nthere was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince Nesv\xc3\xadtski, who had\nalighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the\nrailings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few\nsteps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each time Prince\nNesv\xc3\xadtski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again\nand pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine fellow you are, friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Cossack to a convoy\nsoldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were\ncrowded together close to his wheels and his horses. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fellow!\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t wait a moment! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see the general wants to pass?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the convoyman took no notice of the word \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d and shouted\nat the soldiers who were blocking his way. \xe2\x80\x9cHi there, boys! Keep to\nthe left! Wait a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to\nshoulder, their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a dense\nmass. Looking down over the rails Prince Nesv\xc3\xadtski saw the rapid, noisy\nlittle waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of\nthe bridge chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally\nuniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos,\nknapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with\nbroad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and\nfeet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the\nbridge. Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of\nwhite foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with\na type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along;\nsometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot,\nan orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry;\nand sometimes like a log floating down the river, an officers\xe2\x80\x99 or\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on\nall sides, moved across the bridge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as if a dam had burst,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Cossack hopelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\nthere many more of you to come?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA million all but one!\xe2\x80\x9d replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat,\nwith a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x9d (he meant the enemy) \xe2\x80\x9cbegins popping at the bridge now,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the old soldier dismally to a comrade, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll forget to\nscratch yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?\xe2\x80\x9d said an\norderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.\n\nAnd he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry soldiers who\nhad evidently been drinking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt\nend of his gun...\xe2\x80\x9d a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said\ngaily, with a wide swing of his arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the ham was just delicious...\xe2\x80\x9d answered another with a loud\nlaugh. And they, too, passed on, so that Nesv\xc3\xadtski did not learn who\nhad been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they\xe2\x80\x99ll\nall be killed,\xe2\x80\x9d a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young soldier\nwith an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI felt like\ndying of fright. I did, \xe2\x80\x98pon my word, I got that frightened!\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe, as if bragging of having been frightened.\n\nThat one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone\nbefore. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and\nseemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with\na large udder was attached to the cart behind. A woman with an unweaned\nbaby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks\nwere sitting on some feather beds. Evidently these fugitives were\nallowed to pass by special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers\nturned toward the women, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace\nall the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 remarks related to the two young ones. Every face\nbore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the\nwomen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSell me the missis,\xe2\x80\x9d said another soldier, addressing the German,\nwho, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast\neyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how smart she\xe2\x80\x99s made herself! Oh, the devils!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, Fed\xc3\xb3tov, you should be quartered on them!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen as much before now, mate!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked an infantry officer who was eating an\napple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.\n\nThe German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, giving the girl an apple.\n\nThe girl smiled and took it. Nesv\xc3\xadtski like the rest of the men on the\nbridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed. When\nthey had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same\nkind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the horses of\na convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole\ncrowd had to wait.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why are they stopping? There\xe2\x80\x99s no proper order!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nsoldiers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can\xe2\x80\x99t you wait?\nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, here\xe2\x80\x99s an officer jammed\nin too\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94different voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked\nat one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge.\n\nLooking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nesv\xc3\xadtski\nsuddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching...\nsomething big, that splashed into the water.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust see where it carries to!\xe2\x80\x9d a soldier near by said sternly,\nlooking round at the sound.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEncouraging us to get along quicker,\xe2\x80\x9d said another uneasily.\n\nThe crowd moved on again. Nesv\xc3\xadtski realized that it was a cannon ball.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Cossack, my horse!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, you there! get out\nof the way! Make way!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting\ncontinually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way\nfor him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those\nnearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still\nharder from behind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNesv\xc3\xadtski, Nesv\xc3\xadtski! you numskull!\xe2\x80\x9d came a hoarse voice from\nbehind him.\n\nNesv\xc3\xadtski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated\nby the living mass of moving infantry, V\xc3\xa1ska Den\xc3\xadsov, red and shaggy,\nwith his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily\nover his shoulder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Den\xc3\xadsov\nevidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot\nwhites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small\nbare hand as red as his face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, V\xc3\xa1ska!\xe2\x80\x9d joyfully replied Nesv\xc3\xadtski. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s up with\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe squadwon can\xe2\x80\x99t pass,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted V\xc3\xa1ska Den\xc3\xadsov, showing his\nwhite teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which\ntwitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting\nwhite foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his\nhoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this? They\xe2\x80\x99re like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the\nway!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you devil with the cart! I\xe2\x80\x99ll hack\nyou with my saber!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, actually drawing his saber from its\nscabbard and flourishing it.\n\nThe soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and\nDen\xc3\xadsov joined Nesv\xc3\xadtski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s it you\xe2\x80\x99re not drunk today?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski when the\nother had ridden up to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t even give one time to dwink!\xe2\x80\x9d answered V\xc3\xa1ska\nDen\xc3\xadsov. \xe2\x80\x9cThey keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they\nmean to fight, let\xe2\x80\x99s fight. But the devil knows what this is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a dandy you are today!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski, looking at\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s new cloak and saddlecloth.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused\na smell of perfume, and put it to Nesv\xc3\xadtski\xe2\x80\x99s nose.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. I\xe2\x80\x99m going into action! I\xe2\x80\x99ve shaved, bwushed my teeth,\nand scented myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe imposing figure of Nesv\xc3\xadtski followed by his Cossack, and\nthe determination of Den\xc3\xadsov who flourished his sword and shouted\nfrantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through\nto the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the\nbridge Nesv\xc3\xadtski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order,\nand having done this he rode back.\n\nHaving cleared the way Den\xc3\xadsov stopped at the end of the bridge.\nCarelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the\nground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw\nnearer. Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping,\nresounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in\nfront and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge\non his side of it.\n\nThe infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the\ntrampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will,\nestrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually\nencounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past them in\nregular order.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmart lads! Only fit for a fair!\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good are they? They\xe2\x80\x99re led about just for show!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\nanother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t kick up the dust, you infantry!\xe2\x80\x9d jested an hussar whose\nprancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to put you on a two days\xe2\x80\x99 march with a knapsack! Your\nfine cords would soon get a bit rubbed,\xe2\x80\x9d said an infantryman, wiping\nthe mud off his face with his sleeve. \xe2\x80\x9cPerched up there, you\xe2\x80\x99re more\nlike a bird than a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Z\xc3\xadkin, they ought to put you on a horse. You\xe2\x80\x99d look\nfine,\xe2\x80\x9d said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under\nthe weight of his knapsack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a stick between your legs, that\xe2\x80\x99ll suit you for a horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe hussar shouted back.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing\ntogether as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last\nthe baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last\nbattalion came onto the bridge. Only Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s squadron of hussars\nremained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could\nbe seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from\nthe bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the\nriver flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away.\nAt the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our\nCossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the high\nground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. These were the\nFrench. A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All\nthe officers and men of Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s squadron, though they tried to talk\nof other things and to look in other directions, thought only of what\nwas there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches\nappearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s troops.\nThe weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending\nbrightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was calm, and\nat intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard\nfrom the hill. There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy\nexcept a few scattered skirmishers. An empty space of some seven hundred\nyards was all that separated them. The enemy ceased firing, and that\nstern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates\ntwo hostile armies was all the more clearly felt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing\nthe living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death. And\nwhat is there? Who is there?\xe2\x80\x94there beyond that field, that tree, that\nroof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to know. You fear\nand yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must\nbe crossed and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will\ninevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death. But you are\nstrong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such\nexcitedly animated and healthy men.\xe2\x80\x9d So thinks, or at any rate\nfeels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives\na particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that\ntakes place at such moments.\n\nOn the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose,\nand a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The\nofficers who had been standing together rode off to their places. The\nhussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole\nsquadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron\ncommander, awaiting the word of command. A second and a third cannon\nball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the hussars, but the balls\nwith rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell\nsomewhere beyond them. The hussars did not look round, but at the sound\nof each shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its\nrows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the\nball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers\nwithout turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their\ncomrades\xe2\x80\x99 impression. Every face, from Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s to that of the\nbugler, showed one common expression of conflict, irritation, and\nexcitement, around chin and mouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking\nat the soldiers as if threatening to punish them. Cadet Mir\xc3\xb3nov ducked\nevery time a ball flew past. Rost\xc3\xb3v on the left flank, mounted on his\nRook\xe2\x80\x94a handsome horse despite its game leg\xe2\x80\x94had the happy air of a\nschoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which\nhe feels sure he will distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone\nwith a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly\nhe sat under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same\nindication of something new and stern showed round the mouth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that curtseying there? Cadet Miw\xc3\xb3nov! That\xe2\x80\x99s not wight!\nLook at me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Den\xc3\xadsov who, unable to keep still on one spot,\nkept turning his horse in front of the squadron.\n\nThe black, hairy, snub-nosed face of V\xc3\xa1ska Den\xc3\xadsov, and his whole\nshort sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in\nwhich he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually\ndid, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he\nwas only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown back like birds\nwhen they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his\ngood horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the\nsaddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in\na hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols. He rode up to\nK\xc3\xadrsten. The staff captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a\nwalk to meet him. His face with its long mustache was serious as always,\nonly his eyes were brighter than usual.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what about it?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Den\xc3\xadsov. \xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t come to a\nfight. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see\xe2\x80\x94we shall retire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil only knows what they\xe2\x80\x99re about!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Wost\xc3\xb3v,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried noticing the cadet\xe2\x80\x99s bright face,\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got it at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. Rost\xc3\xb3v\nfelt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge.\nDen\xc3\xadsov galloped up to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency! Let us attack them! I\xe2\x80\x99ll dwive them off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAttack indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his\nface as if driving off a troublesome fly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why are you stopping\nhere? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without\nhaving lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front\nline followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side\nof the river.\n\nThe two P\xc3\xa1vlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the\nhill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogd\xc3\xa1nich Schubert, came\nup to Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nwithout taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the\nfirst time since their encounter concerning Tely\xc3\xa1nin. Rost\xc3\xb3v, feeling\nthat he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now\nadmitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the\ncolonel\xe2\x80\x99s athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red\nneck. It seemed to Rost\xc3\xb3v that Bogd\xc3\xa1nich was only pretending not\nto notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet\xe2\x80\x99s\ncourage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it\nseemed to him that Bogd\xc3\xa1nich rode so near in order to show him his\ncourage. Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a\ndesperate attack just to punish him\xe2\x80\x94Rost\xc3\xb3v. Then he imagined how,\nafter the attack, Bogd\xc3\xa1nich would come up to him as he lay wounded and\nwould magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation.\n\nThe high-shouldered figure of Zherk\xc3\xb3v, familiar to the P\xc3\xa1vlograds as\nhe had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel.\nAfter his dismissal from headquarters Zherk\xc3\xb3v had not remained in the\nregiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he\ncould get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded\nin attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n. He now\ncame to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear\nguard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s enemy with an air of\ngloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is an order\nto stop and fire the bridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn order to who?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the colonel morosely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t myself know \xe2\x80\x98to who,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cornet in a\nserious tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the prince told me to \xe2\x80\x98go and tell the colonel\nthat the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nZherk\xc3\xb3v was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the\ncolonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout Nesv\xc3\xadtski\ncame galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his\nweight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s this, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted as he approached. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you\nto fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all\nbeside themselves over there and one can\xe2\x80\x99t make anything out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesv\xc3\xadtski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spoke to me of inflammable material,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you said\nnothing about firing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski as he drew up, taking off his\ncap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand,\n\xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material\nhad been put in position?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not your \xe2\x80\x98dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell\nme to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders\nstrictly to obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would\nburn it, I could not know by the holy spirit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s always the way!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski with a wave of the\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get here?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning to Zherk\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the same business. But you are damp! Let me wring you out!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...\xe2\x80\x9d continued the colonel in an\noffended tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the officer of the suite, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be\nquick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout\nstaff officer, and at Zherk\xc3\xb3v, and he frowned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will the bridge fire,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a solemn tone as if to announce\nthat in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still\ndo the right thing.\n\nStriking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame\nfor everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second\nsquadron, that in which Rost\xc3\xb3v was serving under Den\xc3\xadsov, to return to\nthe bridge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, it\xe2\x80\x99s just as I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\nwishes to test me!\xe2\x80\x9d His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him see whether I am a coward!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\nAgain on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression\nappeared that they had worn when under fire. Rost\xc3\xb3v watched his enemy,\nthe colonel, closely\xe2\x80\x94to find in his face confirmation of his own\nconjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rost\xc3\xb3v, and looked\nas he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word\nof command.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook sharp! Look sharp!\xe2\x80\x9d several voices repeated around him.\n\nTheir sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the\nhussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men\nwere crossing themselves. Rost\xc3\xb3v no longer looked at the colonel, he\nhad no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid\nthat his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into\nan orderly\xe2\x80\x99s charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with\na thud. Den\xc3\xadsov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something.\nRost\xc3\xb3v saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs\ncatching and their sabers clattering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStretchers!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted someone behind him.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,\ntrying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not\nlooking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled,\nand fell on his hands. The others outstripped him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt boss zides, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard the voice of the colonel, who,\nhaving ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a\ntriumphant, cheerful face.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and\nwas about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front\nthe better. But Bogd\xc3\xa1nich, without looking at or recognizing Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nshouted to him:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come\nback, Cadet!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried angrily; and turning to Den\xc3\xadsov, who, showing\noff his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy run risks, Captain? You should dismount,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, every bullet has its billet,\xe2\x80\x9d answered V\xc3\xa1ska Den\xc3\xadsov, turning\nin his saddle.\n\n\nMeanwhile Nesv\xc3\xadtski, Zherk\xc3\xb3v, and the officer of the suite were\nstanding together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small\ngroup of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord,\nand blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at\nwhat was approaching in the distance from the opposite side\xe2\x80\x94the blue\nuniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill they burn the bridge or not? Who\xe2\x80\x99ll get there first? Will they\nget there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot\nrange and wipe them out?\xe2\x80\x9d These were the questions each man of the\ntroops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself\nwith a sinking heart\xe2\x80\x94watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright\nevening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with\ntheir bayonets and guns.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh. The hussars will get it hot!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are\nwithin grapeshot range now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken so many men,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer of the\nsuite.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nesv\xc3\xadtski; \xe2\x80\x9ctwo smart fellows could have\ndone the job just as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Zherk\xc3\xb3v, his eyes fixed on the\nhussars, but still with that na\xc3\xafve air that made it impossible to know\nwhether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, your excellency!\nHow you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the\nVlad\xc3\xadmir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the\nsquadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon. Our\nBogd\xc3\xa1nich knows how things are done.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now!\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer of the suite, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s\ngrapeshot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached\nand hurriedly removed.\n\nOn the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke\nappeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the\nmoment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two\nreports one after another, and a third.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Nesv\xc3\xadtski as if in fierce pain, seizing the\nofficer of the suite by the arm. \xe2\x80\x9cLook! A man has fallen! Fallen,\nfallen!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were Tsar I would never go to war,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski, turning\naway.\n\nThe French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue\nuniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again\nbut at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the\nbridge. But this time Nesv\xc3\xadtski could not see what was happening there,\nas a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had succeeded in\nsetting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them, no\nlonger to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was\nsomeone to fire at.\n\nThe French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars\ngot back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot went too\nhigh, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and\nknocked three of them over.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, absorbed by his relations with Bogd\xc3\xa1nich, had paused on the\nbridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he\nhad always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the\nbridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the\nother soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a\nrattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest\nto him fell against the rails with a groan. Rost\xc3\xb3v ran up to him with\nthe others. Again someone shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cStretchers!\xe2\x80\x9d Four men seized the\nhussar and began lifting him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOooh! For Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake let me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the wounded man, but\nstill he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.\n\nNicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed\ninto the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the\nsun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep!\nHow bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what soft glitter the\nwaters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer still were the faraway\nblue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and\nthe pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace\nand happiness... \xe2\x80\x9cI should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I\nwere there,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cIn myself alone and in that sunshine\nthere is so much happiness; but here... groans, suffering, fear, and\nthis uncertainty and hurry... There\xe2\x80\x94they are shouting again, and\nagain are all running back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it,\ndeath, is here above me and around... Another instant and I shall never\nagain see the sun, this water, that gorge!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other\nstretchers came into view before Rost\xc3\xb3v. And the fear of death and of\nthe stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one\nfeeling of sickening agitation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v whispered.\n\nThe hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices\nsounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, fwiend? So you\xe2\x80\x99ve smelt powdah!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted V\xc3\xa1ska Den\xc3\xadsov\njust above his ear.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over; but I am a coward\xe2\x80\x94yes, a coward!\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nRost\xc3\xb3v, and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting\none foot, from the orderly and began to mount.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that grapeshot?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes and no mistake!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Den\xc3\xadsov. \xe2\x80\x9cYou worked like wegular\nbwicks and it\xe2\x80\x99s nasty work! An attack\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant work! Hacking\naway at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them\nshooting at you like a target.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Den\xc3\xadsov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rost\xc3\xb3v, composed\nof the colonel, Nesv\xc3\xadtski, Zherk\xc3\xb3v, and the officer from the suite.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it seems that no one has noticed,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v. And this\nwas true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation\nwhich the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s something for you to report,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zherk\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cSee if I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t get promoted to a sublieutenancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInform the prince that I the bridge fired!\xe2\x80\x9d said the colonel\ntriumphantly and gaily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he asks about the losses?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA trifle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the colonel in his bass voice: \xe2\x80\x9ctwo hussars\nwounded, and one knocked out,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, unable to restrain a happy\nsmile, and pronouncing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cknocked out\xe2\x80\x9d with ringing\ndistinctness.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nPursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command\nof Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it,\nlosing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies,\nand compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had\nbeen foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded\nby Kut\xc3\xbazov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where\novertaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as\nnecessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment.\nThere had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the\ncourage and endurance\xe2\x80\x94acknowledged even by the enemy\xe2\x80\x94with which the\nRussians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more\nrapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had\njoined Kut\xc3\xbazov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and\nKut\xc3\xbazov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces. The\ndefense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an\noffensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the\nmodern science of strategics, had been handed to Kut\xc3\xbazov when he was in\nVienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable\naim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were\nadvancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth of October Kut\xc3\xbazov with his army crossed to the\nleft bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time\nwith the river between himself and the main body of the French. On the\nthirtieth he attacked Mortier\xe2\x80\x99s division, which was on the left bank,\nand broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were taken:\nbanners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a\nfortnight\xe2\x80\x99s retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight\nhad not only held the field but had repulsed the French. Though the\ntroops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number\nin killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and\nwounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter\nin which Kut\xc3\xbazov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and\nthough the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military\nhospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the\nstand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of\nthe army considerably. Throughout the whole army and at headquarters\nmost joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach\nof columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of\nthe retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.\n\nPrince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian\nGeneral Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse had been\nwounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark\nof the commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s special favor he was sent with the news of\nthis victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was\nthreatened by the French) but at Br\xc3\xbcnn. Despite his apparently delicate\nbuild Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many\nvery muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived\nat Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokht\xc3\xbarov to\nKut\xc3\xbazov, he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Br\xc3\xbcnn.\nTo be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward\npromotion.\n\nThe night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that\nhad fallen the previous day\xe2\x80\x94the day of the battle. Reviewing his\nimpressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the\nimpression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off\ngiven him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince\nAndrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a\nman who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon\nas he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the\nwheels and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that\nthe Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he\nquickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that\nthis was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away. He\nagain recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage\nduring the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark\nstarry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning. The snow was\nthawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides\nof the road were forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.\n\nAt one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded.\nThe Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front\ncart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each of\nthe long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were being\njolted over the stony road. Some of them were talking (he heard Russian\nwords), others were eating bread; the more severely wounded looked\nsilently, with the languid interest of sick children, at the envoy\nhurrying past them.\n\nPrince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what\naction they had been wounded. \xe2\x80\x9cDay before yesterday, on the Danube,\xe2\x80\x9d\nanswered the soldier. Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the\nsoldier three gold pieces.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for them all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the officer who came up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet well soon, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, turning to the soldiers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty to do still.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat news, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a\nconversation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood news!... Go on!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the driver, and they galloped\non.\n\nIt was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the paved\nstreets of Br\xc3\xbcnn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the\nlights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that\natmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a\nsoldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night,\nPrince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and\nalert than he had done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly\nand his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and\nrapidity. He again vividly recalled the details of the battle, no longer\ndim, but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself\nstating them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual\nquestions that might be put to him and the answers he would give. He\nexpected to be at once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance\nto the palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and\nlearning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will find\nthe adjutant on duty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the official. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will conduct you to\nthe Minister of War.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went\nin to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and bowing\nwith particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a\ncorridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The\nadjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any\nattempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.\n\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he\napproached the door of the minister\xe2\x80\x99s room. He felt offended, and\nwithout his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into\none of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly\nsuggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise\nthe adjutant and the minister. \xe2\x80\x9cAway from the smell of powder, they\nprobably think it easy to gain victories!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. His eyes\nnarrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with\npeculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened\nwhen he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers\nand making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes\ntaking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the\nminister\xe2\x80\x99s bent bald head with its gray temples. He went on reading\nto the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the\nsound of footsteps.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this and deliver it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to his adjutant, handing him the\npapers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.\n\nPrince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s army\ninterested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was\nconcerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that\nimpression. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that is a matter of perfect indifference to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought. The minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them\nevenly, and then raised his head. He had an intellectual and distinctive\nhead, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent\nexpression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and\nhabitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which\ndoes not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is\ncontinually receiving many petitioners one after another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom General Field Marshal Kut\xc3\xbazov?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it is\ngood news? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was\nhigh time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it\nwith a mournful expression.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! My God! Schmidt!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed in German. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\ncalamity! What a calamity!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked\nat Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is\nnot captured.\xe2\x80\x9d Again he pondered. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad you have brought\ngood news, though Schmidt\xe2\x80\x99s death is a heavy price to pay for the\nvictory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I\nthank you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the\nparade. However, I will let you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,\nreappeared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAu revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to\nsee you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, bowing his head.\n\nWhen Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest\nand happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the\nindifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The\nwhole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed\nthe memory of a remote event long past.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nPrince Andrew stayed at Br\xc3\xbcnn with Bil\xc3\xadbin, a Russian acquaintance of\nhis in the diplomatic service.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome visitor,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Bil\xc3\xadbin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cFranz, put the\nprince\xe2\x80\x99s things in my bedroom,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the servant who was\nushering Bolk\xc3\xb3nski in. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re a messenger of victory, eh?\nSplendid! And I am sitting here ill, as you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomat\xe2\x80\x99s\nluxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bil\xc3\xadbin\nsettled down comfortably beside the fire.\n\nAfter his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of\nall the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince\nAndrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such\nas he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was pleasant,\nafter his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian\n(for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he\nsupposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was\nthen particularly strong.\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as\nPrince Andrew. They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but\nhad become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kut\xc3\xbazov.\nJust as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high\nin the military profession, so to an even greater extent Bil\xc3\xadbin gave\npromise of rising in his diplomatic career. He was still a young man but\nno longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age\nof sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather\nimportant post in Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador\nin Vienna knew him and valued him. He was not one of those many\ndiplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities,\navoid doing certain things, and speak French. He was one of those,\nwho, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence would\nsometimes spend a whole night at his writing table. He worked well\nwhatever the import of his work. It was not the question \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\nbut the question \xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d that interested him. What the diplomatic\nmatter might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to\nprepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and\nelegantly. Bil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s services were valued not only for what he wrote,\nbut also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the\nhighest spheres.\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be\nmade elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say\nsomething striking and took part in a conversation only when that was\npossible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,\nfinished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the\ninner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so\nthat insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to\ndrawing room. And, in fact, Bil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s witticisms were hawked about\nin the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters\nconsidered important.\n\nHis thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which always\nlooked as clean and well washed as the tips of one\xe2\x80\x99s fingers after a\nRussian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play\nof expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds\nand his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and\ndeep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always\ntwinkled and looked out straight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now tell me about your exploits,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, described the\nengagement and his reception by the Minister of War.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of\nskittles,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in conclusion.\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCependant, mon cher,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, examining his nails from a\ndistance and puckering the skin above his left eye, \xe2\x80\x9cmalgr\xc3\xa9 la haute\nestime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, j\xe2\x80\x99avoue que\nvotre victoire n\xe2\x80\x99est pas des plus victorieuses.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox\n     Russian army, I must say that your victory was not\n     particularly victorious.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nHe went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in\nRussian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier\nand his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers!\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the victory?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can at any rate say\nwithout boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you capture one, just one, marshal for us?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness\nof a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by\nseven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have\nbeen there at seven in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Bil\xc3\xadbin with a smile.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have been there at seven in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic\nmethods that he had better leave Genoa alone?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Prince Andrew\nin the same tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Bil\xc3\xadbin, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re thinking it\xe2\x80\x99s very\neasy to take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but\nstill why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you capture him? So don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if not only\nthe Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and\nKing Francis is not much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor\nsecretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my\njoy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to the\nPrater... True, we have no Prater here...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his\nforehead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is now my turn to ask you \xe2\x80\x98why?\xe2\x80\x99 mon cher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic\nsubtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it\nout. Mack loses a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke\nKarl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder. Kut\xc3\xbazov\nalone at last gains a real victory, destroying the spell of the\ninvincibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not even care\nto hear the details.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it, my dear fellow. You see it\xe2\x80\x99s hurrah for the Tsar,\nfor Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but\nwhat do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring\nus nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one\narchduke\xe2\x80\x99s as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only\nover a fire brigade of Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s, that will be another story and\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done\non purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke\nFerdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its\ndefense\xe2\x80\x94as much as to say: \xe2\x80\x98Heaven is with us, but heaven help you\nand your capital!\xe2\x80\x99 The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you\nexpose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit\nthat more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose\nyou did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a\nvictory, what effect would that have on the general course of events?\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Occupied? Vienna occupied?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Sch\xc3\xb6nbrunn, and the count,\nour dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and\nespecially after having dined, Bolk\xc3\xb3nski felt that he could not take in\nthe full significance of the words he heard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount Lichtenfels was here this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Bil\xc3\xadbin continued,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna\nwas fully described: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that\nyour victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can\xe2\x80\x99t be\nreceived as a savior.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle\nbefore Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as\nthe fall of Austria\xe2\x80\x99s capital. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it Vienna was taken? What of\nthe bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard\nreports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is\ndefending us\xe2\x80\x94doing it very badly, I think, but still he is defending\nus. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been\ntaken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been\ngiven to blow it up. Otherwise we should long ago have been in the\nmountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would have spent a bad\nquarter of an hour between two fires.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut still this does not mean that the campaign is over,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they\ndaren\xe2\x80\x99t say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign,\nit won\xe2\x80\x99t be your skirmishing at D\xc3\xbcrrenstein, or gunpowder at all,\nthat will decide the matter, but those who devised it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin\nquoting one of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and\npausing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only question is what will come of the meeting between\nthe Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia\njoins the Allies, Austria\xe2\x80\x99s hand will be forced and there will be war.\nIf not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of\nthe new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an extraordinary genius!\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed,\nclenching his small hand and striking the table with it, \xe2\x80\x9cand what\nluck the man has!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBuonaparte?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead\nto indicate that he was about to say something witty. \xe2\x80\x9cBuonaparte?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe repeated, accentuating the u: \xe2\x80\x9cI think, however, now that he lays\ndown laws for Austria at Sch\xc3\xb6nbrunn, il faut lui faire gr\xc3\xa2ce de\nl\xe2\x80\x99u! * I shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply\nBonaparte!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cWe must let him off the u!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut joking apart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you really think the\ncampaign is over?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is\nnot used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the\nfirst place because her provinces have been pillaged\xe2\x80\x94they say the Holy\nRussian army loots terribly\xe2\x80\x94her army is destroyed, her capital\ntaken, and all this for the beaux yeux * of His Sardinian Majesty. And\ntherefore\xe2\x80\x94this is between ourselves\xe2\x80\x94I instinctively feel that we\nare being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and\nprojects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * Fine eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be too base.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we live we shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bil\xc3\xadbin, his face again becoming\nsmooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end.\n\nWhen Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a\nclean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows, he\nfelt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far\naway from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austria\xe2\x80\x99s treachery,\nBonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s new triumph, tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s levee and parade, and the\naudience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.\n\nHe closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of musketry\nand the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now\nagain drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill,\nthe French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode\nforward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around,\nand he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had not done since\nchildhood.\n\nHe woke up...\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that all happened!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and, smiling happily to himself\nlike a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nNext day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first\nthought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented\nto the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite\nAustrian adjutant, Bil\xc3\xadbin, and last night\xe2\x80\x99s conversation. Having\ndressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he\nhad not worn for a long time, he went into Bil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s study fresh,\nanimated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged. In the study were four\ngentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With Prince Hippolyte Kur\xc3\xa1gin,\nwho was a secretary to the embassy, Bolk\xc3\xb3nski was already acquainted.\nBil\xc3\xadbin introduced him to the others.\n\nThe gentlemen assembled at Bil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s were young, wealthy, gay society\nmen, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which Bil\xc3\xadbin, their\nleader, called les n\xc3\xb4tres. * This set, consisting almost exclusively of\ndiplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with\nwar or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to\nthe official side of the service. These gentlemen received Prince\nAndrew as one of themselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From\npoliteness and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions\nabout the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry\njests and gossip.\n\n    * Ours.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the best of it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, telling of the misfortune of\na fellow diplomat, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Chancellor told him flatly that his\nappointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it.\nCan you fancy the figure he cut?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the worst of it, gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94I am giving Kur\xc3\xa1gin away to\nyou\xe2\x80\x94is that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is\ntaking advantage of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its\narm. He began to laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about that!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you Don Juan! You serpent!\xe2\x80\x9d cried several voices.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin turning to Prince\nAndrew, \xe2\x80\x9cthat all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of\nthe Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing\namong the women!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa femme est la compagne de l\xe2\x80\x99homme,\xe2\x80\x9d * announced Prince\nHippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cWoman is man\xe2\x80\x99s companion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin and the rest of \xe2\x80\x9cours\xe2\x80\x9d burst out laughing in Hippolyte\xe2\x80\x99s\nface, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom\xe2\x80\x94he had to\nadmit\xe2\x80\x94he had almost been jealous on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s account, was the butt\nof this set.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I must give you a treat,\xe2\x80\x9d Bil\xc3\xadbin whispered to Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\xe2\x80\x9cKur\xc3\xa1gin is exquisite when he discusses politics\xe2\x80\x94you should see his\ngravity!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking\nto him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these\ntwo.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,\xe2\x80\x9d began\nHippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout\nexpressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless\nHis Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance...\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, I have not finished...\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Prince Andrew, seizing\nhim by the arm, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that intervention will be stronger than\nnonintervention. And...\xe2\x80\x9d he paused. \xe2\x80\x9cFinally one cannot impute the\nnonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd he released Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s arm to indicate that he had now quite\nfinished.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden\nmouth!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with\nsatisfaction.\n\nEverybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently\ndistressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild\nlaughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin, \xe2\x80\x9cBolk\xc3\xb3nski is my guest in\nthis house and in Br\xc3\xbcnn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I\ncan, with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it would\nbe easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult,\nand I beg you all to help me. Br\xc3\xbcnn\xe2\x80\x99s attractions must be shown him.\nYou can undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course\nthe women.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must let him see Amelie, she\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of\n\xe2\x80\x9cours,\xe2\x80\x9d kissing his finger tips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane\ninterests,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality,\ngentlemen, it is already time for me to go,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew\nlooking at his watch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Emperor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, au revoir, Bolk\xc3\xb3nski! Au revoir, Prince! Come back early to\ndinner,\xe2\x80\x9d cried several voices. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll take you in hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way\nthat provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin,\naccompanying him to the hall.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts,\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, smiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for giving\naudiences, but he does not like talking himself and can\xe2\x80\x99t do it, as\nyou will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAt the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had\nbeen told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his\nface and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was\nover, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor\nFrancis received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the\nconversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor\nseemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, when did the battle begin?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked hurriedly.\n\nPrince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Kut\xc3\xbazov well? When had he left Krems?\xe2\x80\x9d and so on. The Emperor\nspoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions\xe2\x80\x94the\nanswers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what o\xe2\x80\x99clock did the battle begin?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Emperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot inform Your Majesty at what o\xe2\x80\x99clock the battle began at\nthe front, but at D\xc3\xbcrrenstein, where I was, our attack began after\nfive in the afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bolk\xc3\xb3nski growing more animated and\nexpecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which\nhe had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor\nsmiled and interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many miles?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom where to where, Your Majesty?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom D\xc3\xbcrrenstein to Krems.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree and a half miles, Your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe French have abandoned the left bank?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there sufficient forage in Krems?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForage has not been supplied to the extent...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Emperor interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what o\xe2\x80\x99clock was General Schmidt killed?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock? It\xe2\x80\x99s very sad, very sad!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and\nwas immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he\nsaw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant\nreproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him\nhis own house. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the\nMaria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring\non him. The Empress\xe2\x80\x99 chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty. The\narchduchess also wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer, and\nfor a few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador\ntook him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to\nhim.\n\nContrary to Bil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully\nreceived. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kut\xc3\xbazov was awarded\nthe Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards.\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning\ncalling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five\nin the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to\nBil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle\nand his visit to Br\xc3\xbcnn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of\nluggage. Franz, Bil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s man, was dragging a portmanteau with some\ndifficulty out of the front door.\n\nBefore returning to Bil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop\nto provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some\ntime in the shop.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d said Franz, with difficulty rolling the\nportmanteau into the vehicle, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are to move on still farther. The\nscoundrel is again at our heels!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? What?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prince Andrew.\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now! Confess that this is delightful,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\naffair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without\nstriking a blow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew could not understand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the\ntown knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come from the archduchess\xe2\x80\x99. I heard nothing there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that everybody is packing up?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not... What is it all about?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Prince Andrew\nimpatiently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that\nAuersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat\nis now rushing along the road to Br\xc3\xbcnn and will be here in a day or\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was\nmined?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It\nwill be cut off,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Bil\xc3\xadbin. \xe2\x80\x9cListen! The French entered\nVienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those\ngentlemen, messieurs les mar\xc3\xa9chaux, * Murat, Lannes, and Belliard,\nmount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.)\n\xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 says one of them, \xe2\x80\x98you know the Thabor Bridge is\nmined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its\nhead and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up\nthe bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the\nEmperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take\nit!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, let\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x99 say the others. And off they go and take the\nbridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the\nDanube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * The marshalls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop jesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news\ngrieved him and yet he was pleased.\n\nAs soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless\nsituation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it\nout of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from\nthe ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame!\nListening to Bil\xc3\xadbin he was already imagining how on reaching the army\nhe would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one\nthat could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the\nexecuting of the plan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop this jesting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not jesting,\xe2\x80\x9d Bil\xc3\xadbin went on. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing is truer or sadder.\nThese gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs;\nthey assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on\ntheir way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the\nt\xc3\xaate-de-pont. * They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that\nthe war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with\nBonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The\nofficer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack\njokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to\nthe bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into\nthe water, and approaches the t\xc3\xaate-de-pont. At length appears the\nlieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself.\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars!\nHostilities are ended, we can shake one another\xe2\x80\x99s hand.... The\nEmperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg\xe2\x80\x99s\nacquaintance.\xe2\x80\x99 In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so\nbewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly\nestablished intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the\nsight of Murat\xe2\x80\x99s mantle and ostrich plumes, qu\xe2\x80\x99il n\xe2\x80\x99y voit que du\nfeu, et oublie celui qu\xe2\x80\x99il devait faire faire sur l\xe2\x80\x99ennemi!\xe2\x80\x9d *(2)\nIn spite of the animation of his speech, Bil\xc3\xadbin did not forget to\npause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nFrench battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the\nbridge is taken! But what is best of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, his excitement\nsubsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, \xe2\x80\x9cis that the\nsergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire\nthe mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French\ntroops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes\nstayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general,\ngoes up to Auersperg and says: \xe2\x80\x98Prince, you are being deceived, here\nare the French!\xe2\x80\x99 Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is\nallowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a\ntrue Gascon) and says: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize the world-famous Austrian\ndiscipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!\xe2\x80\x99 It\nwas a stroke of genius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and\norders the sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair\nof the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor\nrascality....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * Bridgehead.\n\n     * (2) That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that\n     he ought to be firing at the enemy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be treachery,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the\ngray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing,\nand the glory that awaited him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that either. That puts the court in too bad a light,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nBil\xc3\xadbin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is\njust as at Ulm... it is...\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he seemed to be trying to find the right\nexpression. \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est... c\xe2\x80\x99est du Mack. Nous sommes mack\xc3\xa9s (It is...\nit is a bit of Mack. We are Macked),\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, feeling that he\nhad produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His\nhitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a\nslight smile he began to examine his nails.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you off to?\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had\nrisen and was going toward his room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you meant to stay another two days?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now I am off at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to\nhis room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, mon cher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin following him, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\nthinking about you. Why are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles\nvanished from his face.\n\nPrince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to\nthe army now that it is in danger. I understand that. Mon cher, it is\nheroism!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other\nside of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary,\nis to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no longer fit for\nanything else.... You have not been ordered to return and have not been\ndismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our\nill luck takes us. They say we are going to Olm\xc3\xbctz, and Olm\xc3\xbctz is a\nvery decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my cal\xc3\xa8che.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo stop joking, Bil\xc3\xadbin,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are\nyou going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two\nthings,\xe2\x80\x9d and the skin over his left temple puckered, \xe2\x80\x9ceither you\nwill not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will\nshare defeat and disgrace with Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s whole army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Bil\xc3\xadbin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was\ninsoluble.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot argue about it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he\nthought: \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to save the army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, you are a hero!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThat same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War, Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\nset off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and\nfearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.\n\nIn Br\xc3\xbcnn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy\nbaggage was already being dispatched to Olm\xc3\xbctz. Near Hetzelsdorf Prince\nAndrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with\ngreat haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so obstructed\nwith carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince Andrew\ntook a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and\nweary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the\ncommander in chief and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the\nposition of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of\nthe troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCette arm\xc3\xa9e russe que l\xe2\x80\x99or de l\xe2\x80\x99Angleterre a transport\xc3\xa9e des\nextr\xc3\xa9mit\xc3\xa9s de l\xe2\x80\x99univers, nous allons lui faire \xc3\xa9prouver le m\xc3\xaame\nsort\xe2\x80\x94(le sort de l\xe2\x80\x99arm\xc3\xa9e d\xe2\x80\x99Ulm).\xe2\x80\x9d * He remembered these words\nin Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s address to his army at the beginning of the campaign,\nand they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling\nof wounded pride, and a hope of glory. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd should there be nothing\nleft but to die?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if need be, I shall do it no\nworse than others.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cThat Russian army which has been brought from the ends of\n     the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same\n     fate\xe2\x80\x94(the fate of the army at Ulm).\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nHe looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments,\ncarts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all\nkinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and\nsometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear\ncould reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts\nand gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the\nurging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers.\nAll along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some\nflayed, some not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers\nsat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their\ncompanies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or\nreturned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At\neach ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the\ndin of shouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud\npushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped,\ntraces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers\ndirecting the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their\nvoices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces\nthat they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is our dear Orthodox Russian army,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Bolk\xc3\xb3nski,\nrecalling Bil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s words.\n\nWishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to\na convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle,\nevidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and\nlooking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a cal\xc3\xa8che.\nA soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the\napron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up\nand was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention\nwas diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An\nofficer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving\nthe woman\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes\nof his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed\npiercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron\nand, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake... Protect\nme! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh\nChasseurs.... They won\xe2\x80\x99t let us pass, we are left behind and have lost\nour people...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll flatten you into a pancake!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the angry officer to\nthe soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cTurn back with your slut!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?\xe2\x80\x9d screamed the\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly let this cart pass. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see it\xe2\x80\x99s a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Andrew riding up to the officer.\n\nThe officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the\nsoldier. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to push on!... Back!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them pass, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his\nlips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy\nrage, \xe2\x80\x9cwho are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here,\nnot you! Go back or I\xe2\x80\x99ll flatten you into a pancake,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated he.\nThis expression evidently pleased him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,\xe2\x80\x9d came a voice\nfrom behind.\n\nPrince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless,\ntipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his\nchampionship of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s wife in her queer trap might expose him\nto what he dreaded more than anything in the world\xe2\x80\x94to ridicule; but\nhis instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence\nPrince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised\nhis riding whip.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind...ly let\xe2\x80\x94them\xe2\x80\x94pass!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there\xe2\x80\x99s\nthis disorder,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cDo as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with\na sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he\ngalloped on to the village where he was told who the commander in chief\nwas.\n\nOn reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house,\nintending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort\nout the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\nis a mob of scoundrels and not an army,\xe2\x80\x9d he was thinking as he went\nup to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by\nname.\n\nHe turned round. Nesv\xc3\xadtski\xe2\x80\x99s handsome face looked out of the little\nwindow. Nesv\xc3\xadtski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and\nflourishing his arm, called him to enter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBolk\xc3\xb3nski! Bolk\xc3\xb3nski!... Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear? Eh? Come quick...\xe2\x80\x9d he\nshouted.\n\nEntering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesv\xc3\xadtski and another adjutant\nhaving something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he\nhad any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm.\nThis was particularly noticeable on Nesv\xc3\xadtski\xe2\x80\x99s usually laughing\ncountenance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the commander in chief?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, in that house,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the adjutant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, is it true that it\xe2\x80\x99s peace and capitulation?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nNesv\xc3\xadtski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could\ndo to get here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we, my dear boy! It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99re getting it still worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski. \xe2\x80\x9cBut sit down and\nhave something to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,\nPrince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other\nadjutant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are headquarters?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are to spend the night in Znaim.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nNesv\xc3\xadtski. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve made up splendid packs for me\xe2\x80\x94fit to cross\nthe Bohemian mountains with. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad lookout, old fellow! But\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded, noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew.\n\nHe had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s wife and\nthe convoy officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the commander in chief doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make out at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all I can make out is that everything is abominable,\nabominable, quite abominable!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, and he went off to\nthe house where the commander in chief was.\n\nPassing by Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of\nhis suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince\nAndrew entered the passage. Kut\xc3\xbazov himself, he was told, was in the\nhouse with Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian\ngeneral who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little Kozl\xc3\xb3vski was\nsquatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned\nup, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozl\xc3\xb3vski\xe2\x80\x99s\nface looked worn\xe2\x80\x94he too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced\nat Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond line... have you written it?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued dictating to the\nclerk. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t write so fast, your honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, glancing\nangrily and disrespectfully at Kozl\xc3\xb3vski.\n\nThrough the door came the sounds of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s voice, excited and\ndissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the\nsound of these voices, the inattentive way Kozl\xc3\xb3vski looked at him, the\ndisrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and\nKozl\xc3\xb3vski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander\nin chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the\nhorses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and\ndisastrous was about to happen.\n\nHe turned to Kozl\xc3\xb3vski with urgent questions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmediately, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kozl\xc3\xb3vski. \xe2\x80\x9cDispositions for\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about capitulation?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard.\nJust as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and\nKut\xc3\xbazov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway.\nPrince Andrew stood right in front of Kut\xc3\xbazov but the expression of\nthe commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied\nwith thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He\nlooked straight at his adjutant\xe2\x80\x99s face without recognizing him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you finished?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Kozl\xc3\xb3vski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment, your excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,\nimpassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honor to present myself,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Prince Andrew rather\nloudly, handing Kut\xc3\xbazov an envelope.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov went out into the porch with Bagrati\xc3\xb3n.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n. \xe2\x80\x9cMy blessing, and\nmay Christ be with you in your great endeavor!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left\nhand he drew Bagrati\xc3\xb3n toward him, and with his right, on which he wore\na ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently\nhabitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagrati\xc3\xb3n kissed him on the\nneck instead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrist be with you!\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov repeated and went toward his\ncarriage. \xe2\x80\x9cGet in with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to remain\nwith Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s detachment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov, and noticing that Bolk\xc3\xb3nski still delayed,\nhe added: \xe2\x80\x9cI need good officers myself, need them myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is still much, much before us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as if with an old\nman\xe2\x80\x99s penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s\nmind. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added as if speaking to himself.\n\nPrince Andrew glanced at Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s face only a foot distant from him\nand involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near\nhis temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty\neye socket. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those men\xe2\x80\x99s\ndeath,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been\nsaying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying\non the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew.\nThere was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he\nquestioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the\nEmperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems\naffair, and about some ladies they both knew.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nOn November 1 Kut\xc3\xbazov had received, through a spy, news that the army\nhe commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that\nthe French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in\nimmense force upon Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s line of communication with the troops\nthat were arriving from Russia. If Kut\xc3\xbazov decided to remain at Krems,\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him\noff completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he\nwould find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If Kut\xc3\xbazov decided\nto abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia,\nhe would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian\nmountains, defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and\nabandoning all hope of a junction with Buxh\xc3\xb6wden. If Kut\xc3\xbazov decided\nto retreat along the road from Krems to Olm\xc3\xbctz, to unite with the\ntroops arriving from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road\nby the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his\nbaggage and transport, having to accept battle on the march against an\nenemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov chose this latter course.\n\nThe French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were\nadvancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles\noff on the line of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s retreat. If he reached Znaim before the\nFrench, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the\nFrench forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a\ndisgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to forestall\nthe French with his whole army was impossible. The road for the French\nfrom Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the\nRussians from Krems to Znaim.\n\nThe night he received the news, Kut\xc3\xbazov sent Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s vanguard,\nfour thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim\nto the Vienna-Znaim road. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n was to make this march without\nresting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he\nsucceeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as\npossible. Kut\xc3\xbazov himself with all his transport took the road to\nZnaim.\n\nMarching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his\nhungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers\nby the way, Bagrati\xc3\xb3n came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabr\xc3\xbcnn\na few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabr\xc3\xbcnn from\nVienna. Kut\xc3\xbazov with his transport had still to march for some days\nbefore he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagrati\xc3\xb3n with his four thousand\nhungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army\nthat came upon him at Hollabr\xc3\xbcnn, which was clearly impossible. But\na freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick\nthat had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without\na fight led Murat to try to deceive Kut\xc3\xbazov in a similar way. Meeting\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited\nthe arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna,\nand with this object offered a three days\xe2\x80\x99 truce on condition that\nboth armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared\nthat negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he\ntherefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count\nNostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed\nMurat\xe2\x80\x99s emissary and retired, leaving Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s division\nexposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace\nnegotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days\xe2\x80\x99 truce.\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse\na truce and sent his adjutant to Kut\xc3\xbazov to report the offer he had\nreceived.\n\nA truce was Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s sole chance of gaining time, giving\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and\nheavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance\nif but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and\na quite unexpected, chance of saving the army. On receiving the news\nhe immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in\nattendance on him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not merely\nto agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and\nmeanwhile Kut\xc3\xbazov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the\nmovements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim\nroad. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone\ncovered this movement of the transport and of the whole army, had to\nremain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were\nin no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass,\nand also that Murat\xe2\x80\x99s mistake would very soon be discovered, proved\ncorrect. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at Sch\xc3\xb6nbrunn, sixteen miles\nfrom Hollabr\xc3\xbcnn) received Murat\xe2\x80\x99s dispatch with the proposal of a\ntruce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following\nletter to Murat:\n\nSch\xc3\xb6nbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,\n\nat eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning\n\nTo PRINCE MURAT,\n\nI cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only\nmy advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my\norder. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break\nthe armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the\ngeneral who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no\none but the Emperor of Russia has that right.\n\nIf, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will\nratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian\narmy.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.\n\nThe Russian Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are\nnothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians\nlet themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are\nletting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor.\n\nNAPOLEON\n\nBonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to\nMurat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all\nthe Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim\nescape, and Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s four thousand men merrily lighted campfires,\ndried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time\nfor three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store\nfor him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nBetween three and four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who\nhad persisted in his request to Kut\xc3\xbazov, arrived at Grunth and reported\nhimself to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n. Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant had not yet reached\nMurat\xe2\x80\x99s detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s\ndetachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They\ntalked of peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked\nof a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement.\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n, knowing Bolk\xc3\xb3nski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant,\nreceived him with distinction and special marks of favor, explaining to\nhim that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next, and\ngiving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join\nthe rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is also\nvery important.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, there will hardly be an engagement today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\nas if to reassure Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a\nmedal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he\nwishes to stay with me, let him... he\xe2\x80\x99ll be of use here if he\xe2\x80\x99s a\nbrave officer,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Bagrati\xc3\xb3n. Prince Andrew, without replying,\nasked the prince\xe2\x80\x99s permission to ride round the position to see the\ndisposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent\nto execute an order. The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed\nman with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking\nFrench though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.\n\nOn all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who\nseemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches,\nand fencing from the village.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Prince! We can\xe2\x80\x99t stop those fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d said the staff\nofficer pointing to the soldiers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe officers don\xe2\x80\x99t keep them in\nhand. And there,\xe2\x80\x9d he pointed to a sutler\xe2\x80\x99s tent, \xe2\x80\x9cthey crowd in\nand sit. This morning I turned them all out and now look, it\xe2\x80\x99s full\nagain. I must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It won\xe2\x80\x99t take a\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, let\xe2\x80\x99s go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and\nweary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow what does this mean, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d said the staff officer, in\nthe reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more\nthan once. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it won\xe2\x80\x99t do to leave your posts like this.\nThe prince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you,\nCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who\nwithout his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry),\nin only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether\ncomfortably.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed of yourself, Captain T\xc3\xbashin?\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cOne would think that as an artillery officer you would set\na good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be\nsounded and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a pretty position without your boots!\xe2\x80\x9d (The\nstaff officer smiled.) \xe2\x80\x9cKindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of\nyou, all!\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a tone of command.\n\nPrince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer\nT\xc3\xbashin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to\nthe other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes\nfrom Prince Andrew to the staff officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe soldiers say it feels easier without boots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain\nT\xc3\xbashin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing\nto adopt a jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt that his\njest was unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly return to your posts,\xe2\x80\x9d said the staff officer trying to\npreserve his gravity.\n\nPrince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer\xe2\x80\x99s small figure.\nThere was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic,\nbut extremely attractive.\n\nThe staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.\n\nHaving ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking\nsoldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some\nentrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up\nred. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite\nthe cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants;\nspadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the\nbank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at\nthe entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it they came upon some\ndozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the\nentrenchment. They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a\ntrot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoil\xc3\xa0 l\xe2\x80\x99agr\xc3\xa9ment des camps, monsieur le prince,\xe2\x80\x9d * said the\nstaff officer.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThey rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could already be\nseen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our battery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the staff officer indicating the\nhighest point. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of the queer fellow we saw without\nhis boots. You can see everything from there; let\xe2\x80\x99s go there,\nPrince.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much, I will go on alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew,\nwishing to rid himself of this staff officer\xe2\x80\x99s company, \xe2\x80\x9cplease\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself further.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.\n\nThe farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and\ncheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had been\nin the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven\nmiles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm\ncould be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the\nmore confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in\ntheir greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company\nofficers were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in\nthe ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over\nthe whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building\nshelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others,\ndressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending\nboots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers.\nIn one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly\nat the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster\nsergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log\nbefore his shelter, had been tasted.\n\nAnother company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka,\ncrowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting\na keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him. The\nsoldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces,\nemptied them, rolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from\nthe sergeant major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and\nwiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were\nas serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful\nencampment, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in\nwhich at least half of them would be left on the field. After passing a\nchasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiers\xe2\x80\x94fine fellows\nbusy with similar peaceful affairs\xe2\x80\x94near the shelter of the regimental\ncommander, higher than and different from the others, Prince Andrew came\nout in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two\nsoldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and\nstriking him regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally.\nA stout major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the\nscreams kept repeating:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest,\nhonorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in\nhim, he\xe2\x80\x99s a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural\nscreams, continued.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, go on!\xe2\x80\x9d said the major.\n\nA young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face\nstepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant\nas he rode by.\n\nPrince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our front\nline and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks,\nbut in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that\nmorning, the lines were so near together that the men could see one\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s faces and speak to one another. Besides the soldiers who\nformed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers\nwho, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.\n\nSince early morning\xe2\x80\x94despite an injunction not to approach the picket\nline\xe2\x80\x94the officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away. The\nsoldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity,\nno longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sight-seers and\ngrew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew halted to have a look\nat the French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! Look there!\xe2\x80\x9d one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a\nRussian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and\nwas rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. \xe2\x80\x9cHark to him\njabbering! Fine, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? It\xe2\x80\x99s all the Frenchy can do to keep up\nwith him. There now, S\xc3\xaddorov!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit and listen. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine!\xe2\x80\x9d answered S\xc3\xaddorov, who was\nconsidered an adept at French.\n\nThe soldier to whom the laughers referred was D\xc3\xb3lokhov. Prince Andrew\nrecognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. D\xc3\xb3lokhov\nhad come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with\nhis captain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, go on, go on!\xe2\x80\x9d incited the officer, bending forward and\ntrying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cMore, please: more! What\xe2\x80\x99s he saying?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot\ndispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the\ncampaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was\ntrying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all\nthe way from Ulm, while D\xc3\xb3lokhov maintained that the Russians had not\nsurrendered but had beaten the French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe French grenadier.\n\nThe French onlookers and listeners laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll make you dance as we did under Suv\xc3\xb3rov...,\xe2\x80\x9d * said\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cOn vous fera danser.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQu\xe2\x80\x99 est-ce qu\xe2\x80\x99il chante?\xe2\x80\x9d * asked a Frenchman.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he singing about?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ancient history,\xe2\x80\x9d said another, guessing that it referred to\na former war. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the\nothers...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBonaparte...\xe2\x80\x9d began D\xc3\xb3lokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! Sacr\xc3\xa9 nom...!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he angrily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil skin your Emperor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd D\xc3\xb3lokhov swore at him in coarse soldier\xe2\x80\x99s Russian and shouldering\nhis musket walked away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go, Iv\xc3\xa1n Luk\xc3\xadch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the captain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way to talk French,\xe2\x80\x9d said the picket soldiers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, S\xc3\xaddorov, you have a try!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xaddorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless\nsounds very fast: \xe2\x80\x9cKari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, Kask\xc3\xa1,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\ntrying to give an expressive intonation to his voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!\xe2\x80\x9d came peals of such healthy\nand good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French\ninvoluntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be\nto unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as\nquickly as possible.\n\nBut the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and\nentrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon\nconfronted one another as before.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nHaving ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince\nAndrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had\ntold him the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, and stopped\nbeside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon. Before the guns an\nartillery sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the\nofficer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing.\nBehind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes\nand artillerymen\xe2\x80\x99s bonfires. To the left, not far from the farthest\ncannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the\nsound of officers\xe2\x80\x99 voices in eager conversation.\n\nIt was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the\ngreater part of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s opened out from this battery. Just facing\nit, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern\ncould be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops\namid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were\nevidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To the left from\nthat village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it\nwas impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was\nposted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position.\nOur infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the\ndragoons. In the center, where T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s battery stood and from which\nPrince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most\ndirect descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Sch\xc3\xb6n\nGrabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked\nthe bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was\nwider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us\non both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it\ndifficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took\nout his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the\nposition. He made some notes on two points, intending to mention them to\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n. His idea was, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the\ncenter, and secondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the\ndip. Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in chief, closely\nfollowing the mass movements and general orders, and constantly studying\nhistorical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the\ncourse of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He\nimagined only important possibilities: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the enemy attacks the right\nflank,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Kiev grenadiers and the Pod\xc3\xb3lsk\nchasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center\ncome up. In that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank\ncounterattack. If they attack our center we, having the center battery\non this high ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and\nretreat to the dip by echelons.\xe2\x80\x9d So he reasoned.... All the time\nhe had been beside the gun, he had heard the voices of the officers\ndistinctly, but as often happens had not understood a word of what they\nwere saying. Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the\nshed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a\nfamiliar voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I say is that if it were possible to know\nwhat is beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s so,\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother, a younger voice, interrupted him: \xe2\x80\x9cAfraid or not, you can\xe2\x80\x99t\nescape it anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,\xe2\x80\x9d said a third\nmanly voice interrupting them both. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you artillery men are\nvery wise, because you can take everything along with you\xe2\x80\x94vodka and\nsnacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer,\nlaughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, one is afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the first speaker, he of the\nfamiliar voice. \xe2\x80\x9cOne is afraid of the unknown, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is.\nWhatever we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is\nno sky but only an atmosphere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, stand us some of your herb vodka, T\xc3\xbashin,\xe2\x80\x9d it said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the captain who stood up\nin the sutler\xe2\x80\x99s hut without his boots.\xe2\x80\x9d He recognized the agreeable,\nphilosophizing voice with pleasure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome herb vodka? Certainly!\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xbashin. \xe2\x80\x9cBut still, to\nconceive a future life...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and\nnearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it\nhad not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near\nthe shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The ground\nseemed to groan at the terrible impact.\n\nAnd immediately T\xc3\xbashin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth\nand his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed\nfollowed by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who\nhurried off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nMounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery,\nlooking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes\nran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto\nmotionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was\na battery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two\nmounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A\nsmall but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill,\nprobably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of the first shot had\nnot yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a report.\nThe battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back\nto Grunth to find Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n. He heard the cannonade behind him\ngrowing louder and more frequent. Evidently our guns had begun to reply.\nFrom the bottom of the slope, where the parleys had taken place, came\nthe report of musketry.\n\nLemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s stern letter,\nand Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once\nmoved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian\nwings, hoping before evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to\ncrush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has begun. Here it is!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew, feeling the\nblood rush to his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where and how will my Toulon present\nitself?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPassing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking\nvodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same rapid\nmovement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready,\nand on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his\nheart. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!\xe2\x80\x9d was what\nthe face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say.\n\nBefore he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw,\nin the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward him.\nThe foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a\nwhite horse, was Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n. Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for\nhim to come up; Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n reined in his horse and recognizing\nPrince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew\ntold him what he had seen.\n\nThe feeling, \xe2\x80\x9cIt has begun! Here it is!\xe2\x80\x9d was seen even on Prince\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes.\nPrince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face\nand wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking\nand feeling at that moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything at all behind that\nimpassive face?\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked. Prince\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew\ntold him, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cVery good!\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone that seemed to imply that\neverything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he\nhad foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke\nquickly. Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, uttering his words with an Oriental accent,\nspoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that there was no\nneed to hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot in the direction\nof T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s battery. Prince Andrew followed with the suite. Behind\nPrince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n rode an officer of the suite, the prince\xe2\x80\x99s personal\nadjutant, Zherk\xc3\xb3v, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty,\nriding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilian\xe2\x80\x94an accountant who had\nasked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity. The\naccountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked around him with a na\xc3\xafve\nsmile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the\nhussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on\nhis horse with a convoy officer\xe2\x80\x99s saddle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to see a battle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zherk\xc3\xb3v to Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, pointing\nto the accountant, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach\nalready.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, leave off!\xe2\x80\x9d said the accountant with a beaming but rather\ncunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherk\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s\njoke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said the staff officer.\n(He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a\nprince, but could not get it quite right.)\n\nBy this time they were all approaching T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s battery, and a ball\nstruck the ground in front of them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that that has fallen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the accountant with a na\xc3\xafve\nsmile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA French pancake,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Zherk\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what they hit with?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the accountant. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\nawful!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished speaking\nwhen they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly\nended with a thud into something soft... f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding\na little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with\nhis horse. Zherk\xc3\xb3v and the staff officer bent over their saddles and\nturned their horses away. The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack,\nand examined him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the\nhorse still struggled.\n\nPrince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the\ncause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say,\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it worth while noticing trifles?\xe2\x80\x9d He reined in his horse with\nthe care of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his\nsaber which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber of\na kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of\nSuv\xc3\xb3rov giving his saber to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n in Italy, and the recollection\nwas particularly pleasant at that moment. They had reached the battery\nat which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose company?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n of an artilleryman standing\nby the ammunition wagon.\n\nHe asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhose company?\xe2\x80\x9d but he really meant, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\nfrightened here?\xe2\x80\x9d and the artilleryman understood him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s, your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the red-haired,\nfreckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Bagrati\xc3\xb3n as if considering something, and he\nrode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.\n\nAs he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his\nsuite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see\nthe gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its\nformer position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding\na mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with\na trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. The short,\nround-shouldered Captain T\xc3\xbashin, stumbling over the tail of the gun\ncarriage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out\nshading his eyes with his small hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLift it two lines more and it will be just right,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he in a\nfeeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to\nhis weak figure. \xe2\x80\x9cNumber Two!\xe2\x80\x9d he squeaked. \xe2\x80\x9cFire, Medv\xc3\xa9dev!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n called to him, and T\xc3\xbashin, raising three fingers to his cap\nwith a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute\nbut like a priest\xe2\x80\x99s benediction, approached the general. Though\nT\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was\nfiring incendiary balls at the village of Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern visible just\nopposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing.\n\nNo one had given T\xc3\xbashin orders where and at what to fire, but after\nconsulting his sergeant major, Zakharch\xc3\xa9nko, for whom he had great\nrespect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the\nvillage. \xe2\x80\x9cVery good!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bagrati\xc3\xb3n in reply to the officer\xe2\x80\x99s\nreport, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended\nbefore him. The French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the\nheight on which the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the\nrivulet flowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was\nheard, and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of\nthe suite pointed out to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n a French column that was outflanking\nus. To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to\nreinforce the right flank. The officer of the suite ventured to remark\nto the prince that if these battalions went away, the guns would remain\nwithout support. Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n turned to the officer and with his\ndull eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the\nofficer\xe2\x80\x99s remark was just and that really no answer could be made to\nit. But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the\ncommander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses\nof the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in\ndisorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\nbowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to\nthe right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the\nFrench. But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that\nthe commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in\nthe ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing\nmen uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the\nwood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bagrati\xc3\xb3n.\n\nAs he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and\nas it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there\nhimself, Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n sent Zherk\xc3\xb3v to tell the general in command\n(the one who had paraded his regiment before Kut\xc3\xbazov at Braunau) that\nhe must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear,\nas the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\nattack very long. About T\xc3\xbashin and the battalion that had been in\nsupport of his battery all was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened\nattentively to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s colloquies with the commanding officers\nand the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders\nwere really given, but that Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n tried to make it appear\nthat everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of\nsubordinate commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least\nin accord with his intentions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that\nthough what happened was due to chance and was independent of the\ncommander\xe2\x80\x99s will, owing to the tact Bagrati\xc3\xb3n showed, his presence\nwas very valuable. Officers who approached him with disturbed\ncountenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew\nmore cheerful in his presence, and were evidently anxious to display\ntheir courage before him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nPrince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, having reached the highest point of our right flank,\nbegan riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where\non account of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to\nthe hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness\nof the actual battlefield. They began to meet wounded men. One with a\nbleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who\nsupported him under the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he\nwas spitting blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or\nmouth. Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket,\ngroaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while\nblood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had\nthat moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering.\nCrossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men\nlying on the ground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were\nunwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and\ndespite the general\xe2\x80\x99s presence were talking loudly and gesticulating.\nIn front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the\nsmoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagrati\xc3\xb3n rushed shouting after\nthe crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n rode up\nto the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning\nthe sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked with\nsmoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it. Some\nwere using their ramrods, others putting powder on the touchpans or\ntaking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though who\nthey were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no\nwind to carry away. A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were\noften heard. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew approaching the\ncrowd of soldiers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be an attack, for they are not moving;\nit can\xe2\x80\x99t be a square\xe2\x80\x94for they are not drawn up for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a\npleasant smile\xe2\x80\x94his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes,\ngiving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n and welcomed him as\na host welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had\nbeen attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been\nrepulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He said the attack\nhad been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had\noccurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what\nhad happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and\ncould not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his\nregiment had been broken up. All he knew was that at the commencement\nof the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and\nhitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted \xe2\x80\x9cCavalry!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nour men had begun firing. They were still firing, not at the cavalry\nwhich had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into the\nhollow and were firing at our men. Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n bowed his head as a\nsign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected. Turning\nto his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the\nSixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed. Prince Andrew was struck by\nthe changed expression on Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s face at this moment. It\nexpressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of\na man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water.\nThe dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation\nof profound thought. The round, steady, hawk\xe2\x80\x99s eyes looked before him\neagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although his\nmovements were still slow and measured.\n\nThe commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, entreating\nhim to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, your excellency, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d he kept saying,\nglancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away\nfrom him. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d and he drew attention to the bullets\nwhistling, singing, and hissing continually around them. He spoke in the\ntone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who\nhas picked up an ax: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are used to it, but you, sir, will blister\nyour hands.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his\nhalf-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words. The staff\nofficer joined in the colonel\xe2\x80\x99s appeals, but Bagrati\xc3\xb3n did not reply;\nhe only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give room\nfor the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking, the curtain\nof smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began\nto move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the\nhill opposite, with the French moving about on it, opened out before\nthem. All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French column advancing\nagainst them and winding down over the uneven ground. One could already\nsee the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 shaggy caps, distinguish the officers from the men,\nand see the standard flapping against its staff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey march splendidly,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked someone in Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s suite.\n\nThe head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The clash\nwould take place on this side of it...\n\nThe remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up\nand moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came\ntwo battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had\nreached Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in\nstep could be heard. On their left flank, nearest to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, marched\na company commander, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and happy\nexpression\xe2\x80\x94the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At that\nmoment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he\nwould appear as he passed the commander.\n\nWith the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with\nhis muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full\nheight without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy\ntread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close\nto his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real\nweapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men\nwithout losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as\nif all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander\nin the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he\nwas happy. \xe2\x80\x9cLeft... left... left...\xe2\x80\x9d he seemed to repeat to himself\nat each alternate step; and in time to this, with stern but varied\nfaces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched\nin step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be\nrepeating to himself at each alternate step, \xe2\x80\x9cLeft... left...\nleft...\xe2\x80\x9d A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of\nstep; a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his\ndefection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A cannon\nball, cleaving the air, flew over the heads of Bagrati\xc3\xb3n and his suite,\nand fell into the column to the measure of \xe2\x80\x9cLeft... left!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cClose\nup!\xe2\x80\x9d came the company commander\xe2\x80\x99s voice in jaunty tones. The\nsoldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had\nfallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who\nhad stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling\ninto step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous\nsilence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one\nseemed to hear left... left... left.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to do our best, your ex\xe2\x80\x99len-lency!\xe2\x80\x9d came a confused shout\nfrom the ranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nknow that ourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d Another, without looking round, as though\nfearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.\n\nThe order was given to halt and down knapsacks.\n\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n rode round the ranks that had marched past him and\ndismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his\nfelt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of the\nFrench column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForward, with God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, in a resolute, sonorous voice,\nturning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms,\nhe went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of\na cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him\nforward, and experienced great happiness.\n\nThe French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagrati\xc3\xb3n,\ncould clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their\nfaces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered\nlegs and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.) Prince\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in\nfront of the ranks. Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the\nFrench, smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots\nsounded. Several of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer\nwho had marched so gaily and complacently. But at the moment the first\nreport was heard, Bagrati\xc3\xb3n looked round and shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah\xe2\x80\x94ah!\xe2\x80\x94ah!\xe2\x80\x9d rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and\npassing Bagrati\xc3\xb3n and racing one another they rushed in an irregular\nbut joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThe attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right\nflank. In the center T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten battery, which had managed to\nset fire to the Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The\nFrench were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus\ngave us time to retreat. The retirement of the center to the other side\nof the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the\ndifferent companies did not get mixed. But our left\xe2\x80\x94which consisted\nof the Az\xc3\xb3v and Pod\xc3\xb3lsk infantry and the P\xc3\xa1vlograd hussars\xe2\x80\x94was\nsimultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under\nLannes and was thrown into confusion. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n had sent Zherk\xc3\xb3v\nto the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat\nimmediately.\n\nZherk\xc3\xb3v, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about\nand galloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagrati\xc3\xb3n than his courage\nfailed him. He was seized by panic and could not go where it was\ndangerous.\n\nHaving reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the\nfiring was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they\ncould not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.\n\nThe command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of\nthe regiment Kut\xc3\xbazov had reviewed at Braunau and in which D\xc3\xb3lokhov was\nserving as a private. But the command of the extreme left flank had been\nassigned to the commander of the P\xc3\xa1vlograd regiment in which Rost\xc3\xb3v\nwas serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two commanders were much\nexasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on\nthe right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged\nin discussion with the sole object of offending one another. But the\nregiments, both cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the\nimpending action. From privates to general they were not expecting a\nbattle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the\nhorses and the infantry collecting wood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe higher iss dan I in rank,\xe2\x80\x9d said the German colonel of the\nhussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, \xe2\x80\x9cso\nlet him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars... Bugler,\nsount ze retreat!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling\ntogether, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes\nof Lannes\xe2\x80\x99 sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and\nforming up within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in\ncommand of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and\nhaving mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the\nP\xc3\xa1vlograd commander. The commanders met with polite bows but with\nsecret malevolence in their hearts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce again, Colonel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the general, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t leave half\nmy men in the wood. I beg of you, I beg of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cto\noccupy the position and prepare for an attack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsuddenly replied the irate colonel. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you vere in the cavalry...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if\nyou are not aware of the fact...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite avare, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly shouted the colonel,\ntouching his horse and turning purple in the face. \xe2\x80\x9cVill you be so\ngoot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nvish to destroy my men for your pleasure!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own pleasure\nand I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow it to be said!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTaking the colonel\xe2\x80\x99s outburst as a challenge to his courage, the\ngeneral expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the\nfront line, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the\nbullets. They reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and\nthey halted in silence. There was nothing fresh to be seen from the\nline, for from where they had been before it had been evident that it\nwas impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground,\nas well as that the French were outflanking our left. The general\nand colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two\nfighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs\nof cowardice in the other. Both passed the examination successfully. As\nthere was nothing to be said, and neither wished to give occasion for\nit to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire,\nthey would have remained there for a long time testing each other\xe2\x80\x99s\ncourage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry\nand a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood. The French had\nattacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible\nfor the hussars to retreat with the infantry. They were cut off from\nthe line of retreat on the left by the French. However inconvenient the\nposition, it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through\nfor themselves.\n\nThe squadron in which Rost\xc3\xb3v was serving had scarcely time to mount\nbefore it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge,\nthere was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that\nterrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear\xe2\x80\x94resembling the line\nseparating the living from the dead\xe2\x80\x94lay between them. All were\nconscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would cross\nit or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all.\n\nThe colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put\nto him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having\nhis own way, gave an order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor\nof an attack spread through the squadron. The command to form up rang\nout and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards.\nStill no one moved. The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars\nalike, felt that the commander did not himself know what to do, and this\nirresolution communicated itself to the men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only they would be quick!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v, feeling that at last\nthe time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so\noften heard from his fellow hussars.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFo\xe2\x80\x99ward, with God, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d rang out Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAt a\ntwot fo\xe2\x80\x99ward!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe horses\xe2\x80\x99 croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at the\nreins and started of his own accord.\n\nBefore him, on the right, Rost\xc3\xb3v saw the front lines of his hussars and\nstill farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but\ntook to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some way off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaster!\xe2\x80\x9d came the word of command, and Rost\xc3\xb3v felt Rook\xe2\x80\x99s flanks\ndrooping as he broke into a gallop.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v anticipated his horse\xe2\x80\x99s movements and became more and more\nelated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had been\nin the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible\xe2\x80\x94and now he\nhad crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but\neverything was becoming more and more happy and animated. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how I\nwill slash at him!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v, gripping the hilt of his saber.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHur-a-a-a-ah!\xe2\x80\x9d came a roar of voices. \xe2\x80\x9cLet anyone come my way\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go\nat a full gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was\nalready visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep\nover the squadron. Rost\xc3\xb3v raised his saber, ready to strike, but at\nthat instant the trooper Nik\xc3\xadtenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away\nfrom him, and Rost\xc3\xb3v felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried\nforward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From\nbehind him Bondarch\xc3\xbak, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked\nangrily at him. Bondarch\xc3\xbak\xe2\x80\x99s horse swerved and galloped past.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v\nasked and answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle of a\nfield. Instead of the moving horses and hussars\xe2\x80\x99 backs, he saw nothing\nbefore him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There\nwas warm blood under his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am wounded and the horse is\nkilled.\xe2\x80\x9d Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his\nrider\xe2\x80\x99s leg. Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled but could\nnot rise. Rost\xc3\xb3v also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache\nhaving become entangled in the saddle. Where our men were, and where the\nFrench, he did not know. There was no one near.\n\nHaving disentangled his leg, he rose. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere, on which side, was now\nthe line that had so sharply divided the two armies?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself\nand could not answer. \xe2\x80\x9cCan something bad have happened to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe wondered as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something\nsuperfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if\nit were not his. He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find\nblood on it. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, here are people coming,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought joyfully,\nseeing some men running toward him. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will help me!\xe2\x80\x9d In front\ncame a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned,\nand with a hooked nose. Then came two more, and many more running\nbehind. One of them said something strange, not in Russian. In among the\nhindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian hussar. He\nwas being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will\ntake me too? Who are these men?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v, scarcely believing\nhis eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cCan they be French?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at the approaching\nFrenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get\nat them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful\nthat he could not believe his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are they? Why are they\nrunning? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone\nis so fond of?\xe2\x80\x9d He remembered his mother\xe2\x80\x99s love for him, and his\nfamily\xe2\x80\x99s, and his friends\xe2\x80\x99, and the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s intention to kill him\nseemed impossible. \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps they may do it!\xe2\x80\x9d For more than ten\nseconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation.\nThe foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already so\nclose that the expression of his face could be seen. And the excited,\nalien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath,\nand running so lightly, frightened Rost\xc3\xb3v. He seized his pistol and,\ninstead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his\nmight toward the bushes. He did not now run with the feeling of doubt\nand conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the\nfeeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single sentiment, that\nof fear for his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly\nleaping the furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he\nused to show at catchplay, now and then turning his good-natured, pale,\nyoung face to look back. A shudder of terror went through him: \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\nbetter not look,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, but having reached the bushes he glanced\nround once more. The French had fallen behind, and just as he looked\nround the first man changed his run to a walk and, turning, shouted\nsomething loudly to a comrade farther back. Rost\xc3\xb3v paused. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s some mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t have wanted to\nkill me.\xe2\x80\x9d But at the same time, his left arm felt as heavy as if\na seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He could run no more. The\nFrenchman also stopped and took aim. Rost\xc3\xb3v closed his eyes and stooped\ndown. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He mustered his\nlast remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and\nreached the bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nThe infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts\nof the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and\nretreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the\nsenseless cry, \xe2\x80\x9cCut off!\xe2\x80\x9d that is so terrible in battle, and that\nword infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurrounded! Cut off? We\xe2\x80\x99re lost!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the fugitives.\n\nThe moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general\nrealized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the\nthought that he, an exemplary officer of many years\xe2\x80\x99 service who\nhad never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters\nfor negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the\nrecalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and above\nall quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation, he\nclutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to\nthe regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around, but fortunately\nmissed him. His one desire was to know what was happening and at any\ncost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he had made one, so that he,\nan exemplary officer of twenty-two years\xe2\x80\x99 service, who had never been\ncensured, should not be held to blame.\n\nHaving galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind\nthe copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and\ndescending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides\nthe fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers\nattend to the voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him,\ncontinue their flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem\nso terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance\ndistorted out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of\nhis saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the\nair, and disobeying orders. The moral hesitation which decided the fate\nof battles was evidently culminating in a panic.\n\nThe general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the\npowder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that\nmoment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent\nreason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian\nsharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was Tim\xc3\xb3khin\xe2\x80\x99s\ncompany, which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having\nlain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly.\nTim\xc3\xb3khin, armed only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such\na desperate cry and such mad, drunken determination that, taken by\nsurprise, the French had thrown down their muskets and run. D\xc3\xb3lokhov,\nrunning beside Tim\xc3\xb3khin, killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was\nthe first to seize the surrendering French officer by his collar. Our\nfugitives returned, the battalions re-formed, and the French who had\nnearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed. Our\nreserve units were able to join up, and the fight was at an end. The\nregimental commander and Major Ekon\xc3\xb3mov had stopped beside a bridge,\nletting the retreating companies pass by them, when a soldier came up\nand took hold of the commander\xe2\x80\x99s stirrup, almost leaning against him.\nThe man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack\nor cap, his head was bandaged, and over his shoulder a French munition\npouch was slung. He had an officer\xe2\x80\x99s sword in his hand. The soldier\nwas pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the commander\xe2\x80\x99s face,\nand his lips were smiling. Though the commander was occupied in giving\ninstructions to Major Ekon\xc3\xb3mov, he could not help taking notice of the\nsoldier.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency, here are two trophies,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov, pointing\nto the French sword and pouch. \xe2\x80\x9cI have taken an officer prisoner. I\nstopped the company.\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov breathed heavily from weariness and\nspoke in abrupt sentences. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole company can bear witness. I beg\nyou will remember this, your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the commander, and turned to Major\nEkon\xc3\xb3mov.\n\nBut D\xc3\xb3lokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his\nhead, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your\nexcellency!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nT\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the\naction did Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, still hearing the cannonade in the center,\nsend his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also, to order\nthe battery to retire as quickly as possible. When the supports attached\nto T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s battery had been moved away in the middle of the action\nby someone\xe2\x80\x99s order, the battery had continued firing and was only not\ncaptured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone\ncould have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended\nguns. On the contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the\nFrench to suppose that here\xe2\x80\x94in the center\xe2\x80\x94the main Russian forces\nwere concentrated. Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on\neach occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated\nguns on the hillock.\n\nSoon after Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n had left him, T\xc3\xbashin had succeeded in\nsetting fire to Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at them scurrying! It\xe2\x80\x99s burning! Just see the smoke! Fine!\nGrand! Look at the smoke, the smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the artillerymen,\nbrightening up.\n\nAll the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the\ndirection of the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the soldiers\ncried at each shot: \xe2\x80\x9cFine! That\xe2\x80\x99s good! Look at it... Grand!\xe2\x80\x9d The\nfire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns\nthat had advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge\nfor this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village\nand began firing them at T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s battery.\n\nIn their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in\nsuccessfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this\nbattery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one\nknocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon\ndriver\xe2\x80\x99s leg. Their spirits once roused were, however, not diminished,\nbut only changed character. The horses were replaced by others from a\nreserve gun carriage, the wounded were carried away, and the four guns\nwere turned against the ten-gun battery. T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s companion officer\nhad been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour\nseventeen of the forty men of the guns\xe2\x80\x99 crews had been disabled, but\nthe artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever. Twice they\nnoticed the French appearing below them, and then they fired grapeshot\nat them.\n\nLittle T\xc3\xbashin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to\n\xe2\x80\x9crefill my pipe for that one!\xe2\x80\x9d and then, scattering sparks from it,\nran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmack at \xe2\x80\x98em, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d he kept saying, seizing the guns by the\nwheels and working the screws himself.\n\nAmid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made him\njump, T\xc3\xbashin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun,\nnow aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about replacing\ndead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his\nfeeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute. His face grew more and\nmore animated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and\nturn away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always\nthe case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers,\nfor the most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an\nartillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad\nas their officer\xe2\x80\x94all looked at their commander like children in an\nembarrassing situation, and the expression on his face was invariably\nreflected on theirs.\n\nOwing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and\nactivity, T\xc3\xbashin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of\nfear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never\noccurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more elated. It\nseemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a day, since he\nhad first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner\nof the field he stood on was well-known and familiar ground. Though he\nthought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the\nbest of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to\nfeverish delirium or drunkenness.\n\nFrom the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and\nthud of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring\nfaces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood\nof men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s side\n(always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a\ngun, a horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of\nhis own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded\nhim pleasure. The enemy\xe2\x80\x99s guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes\nfrom which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere... he\xe2\x80\x99s puffing again,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered T\xc3\xbashin to himself, as a\nsmall cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by\nthe wind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look out for the ball... we\xe2\x80\x99ll throw it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, your honor?\xe2\x80\x9d asked an artilleryman, standing\nclose by, who heard him muttering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing... only a shell...\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, our Matv\xc3\xa9vna!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cMatv\xc3\xa9vna\xe2\x80\x9d *\nwas the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which\nwas large and of an old pattern. The French swarming round their guns\nseemed to him like ants. In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One\nof the second gun\xe2\x80\x99s crew was \xe2\x80\x9cuncle\xe2\x80\x9d; T\xc3\xbashin looked at him more\noften than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement.\nThe sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now\nincreasing, seemed like someone\xe2\x80\x99s breathing. He listened intently to\nthe ebb and flow of these sounds.\n\n    * Daughter of Matthew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Breathing again, breathing!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself.\n\nHe imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing\ncannon balls at the French with both hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, Matv\xc3\xa9vna, dear old lady, don\xe2\x80\x99t let me down!\xe2\x80\x9d he was\nsaying as he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called\nabove his head: \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain T\xc3\xbashin! Captain!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nT\xc3\xbashin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had turned\nhim out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping voice:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are they down on me?\xe2\x80\x9d thought T\xc3\xbashin, looking in alarm at his\nsuperior.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI... don\xe2\x80\x99t...\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon\nball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse.\nHe paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball\nstopped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRetire! All to retire!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted from a distance.\n\nThe soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same\norder.\n\nIt was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the space\nwhere T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a\nbroken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses.\nBlood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay\nseveral dead men. One ball after another passed over as he approached\nand he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine. But the mere thought\nof being afraid roused him again. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot be afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he,\nand dismounted slowly among the guns. He delivered the order and did\nnot leave the battery. He decided to have the guns removed from their\npositions and withdrawn in his presence. Together with T\xc3\xbashin, stepping\nacross the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he attended\nto the removal of the guns.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off,\xe2\x80\x9d said an\nartilleryman to Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cNot like your honor!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew said nothing to T\xc3\xbashin. They were both so busy as to seem\nnot to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two cannon\nthat remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down the hill\n(one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode\nup to T\xc3\xbashin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, till we meet again...\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding out his hand to\nT\xc3\xbashin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xbashin. \xe2\x80\x9cDear soul! Good-by, my\ndear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his\neyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nThe wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke,\nhung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing\ndark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. The\ncannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the\nright sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as T\xc3\xbashin with his guns,\ncontinually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range\nof fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff,\namong them the staff officer and Zherk\xc3\xb3v, who had been twice sent to\nT\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one\nanother, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed,\nreprimanding and reproaching him. T\xc3\xbashin gave no orders, and,\nsilently\xe2\x80\x94fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to\nweep without knowing why\xe2\x80\x94rode behind on his artillery nag. Though\nthe orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves\nafter troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty\ninfantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of\nT\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatv\xc3\xa9vna\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar\ncadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to T\xc3\xbashin and asked\nfor a seat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! I\xe2\x80\x99ve hurt my arm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said timidly.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake... I can\xe2\x80\x99t walk. For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and\nbeen refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell them to give me a seat, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him a seat,\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xbashin. \xe2\x80\x9cLay a cloak for him to sit on,\nlad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing his favorite soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is the\nwounded officer?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been set down. He died,\xe2\x80\x9d replied someone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,\nAnt\xc3\xb3nov.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe cadet was Rost\xc3\xb3v. With one hand he supported the other; he was\npale and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatv\xc3\xa9vna,\xe2\x80\x9d the gun from which they had removed the dead officer.\nThe cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his\nbreeches and arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, are you wounded, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xbashin, approaching the gun\non which Rost\xc3\xb3v sat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sprain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is this blood on the gun carriage?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired T\xc3\xbashin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the officer, your honor, stained it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\nartilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if\napologizing for the state of his gun.\n\nIt was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the\ninfantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. It\nhad grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces\noff, and the firing had begun to subside. Suddenly, near by on the\nright, shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of shot gleamed in\nthe darkness. This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers\nwho had sheltered in the village houses. They all rushed out of\nthe village again, but T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s guns could not move, and the\nartillerymen, T\xc3\xbashin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they\nawaited their fate. The firing died down and soldiers, talking eagerly,\nstreamed out of a side street.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot hurt, Petr\xc3\xb3v?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve given it \xe2\x80\x98em hot, mate! They won\xe2\x80\x99t make another push\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows!\nNothing could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there something to\ndrink?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and again in\nthe complete darkness T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s guns moved forward, surrounded by the\nhumming infantry as by a frame.\n\nIn the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing\nalways in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of\nhoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and voices of the\nwounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness\nof the night. The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their\ngroans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night.\nAfter a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on\na white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?\xe2\x80\x9d came\neager questions from all sides. The whole moving mass began pressing\ncloser together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt:\nevidently those in front had halted. All remained where they were in the\nmiddle of the muddy road.\n\nFires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain T\xc3\xbashin,\nhaving given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing\nstation or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the\nsoldiers had kindled on the road. Rost\xc3\xb3v, too, dragged himself to the\nfire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole\nbody. Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by\nan excruciating pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory\nposition. He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire,\nwhich seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered\nfigure of T\xc3\xbashin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him.\nT\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and\ncommiseration on Rost\xc3\xb3v, who saw that T\xc3\xbashin with his whole heart\nwished to help him but could not.\n\nFrom all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who\nwere walking, driving past, and settling down all around. The sound\nof voices, the tramping feet, the horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs moving in mud, the\ncrackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.\n\nIt was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the\ngloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm.\nRost\xc3\xb3v looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and\naround him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held\nhis hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind your honor?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked T\xc3\xbashin. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my\ncompany, your honor. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where... such bad luck!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to\nthe bonfire, and addressing T\xc3\xbashin asked him to have the guns moved a\ntrifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to\nthe campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying\nto snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou picked it up?... I dare say! You\xe2\x80\x99re very smart!\xe2\x80\x9d one of them\nshouted hoarsely.\n\nThen a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg\nband, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust one die like a dog?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nT\xc3\xbashin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier\nran up, begging a little fire for the infantry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow\ncountrymen. Thanks for the fire\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll return it with interest,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.\n\nNext came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed\nby the fire. One of them stumbled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil has put the logs on the road?\xe2\x80\x9d snarled he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dead\xe2\x80\x94why carry him?\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd they disappeared into the darkness with their load.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill aching?\xe2\x80\x9d T\xc3\xbashin asked Rost\xc3\xb3v in a whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor, you\xe2\x80\x99re wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid a gunner, coming up to T\xc3\xbashin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing, friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nT\xc3\xbashin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight,\nwalked away from the fire.\n\nNot far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared\nfor him, Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n sat at dinner, talking with some commanding\nofficers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with\nthe half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the\ngeneral who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a\nglass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet\nring, and Zherk\xc3\xb3v, uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew,\npale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes.\n\nIn a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and\nthe accountant with the na\xc3\xafve face was feeling its texture, shaking his\nhead in perplexity\xe2\x80\x94perhaps because the banner really interested him,\nperhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at\na dinner where there was no place for him. In the next hut there was a\nFrench colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers\nwere flocking in to look at him. Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n was thanking the\nindividual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our\nlosses. The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was\ninforming the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn\nfrom the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the\nFrench to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and\nhad broken up the French troops.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was\ndisorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them\ncome on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed\nto do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened. Perhaps\nit might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid all that\nconfusion what did or did not happen?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, your excellency, I should inform you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncontinued\xe2\x80\x94remembering D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with Kut\xc3\xbazov and his\nlast interview with the gentleman-ranker\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat Private D\xc3\xb3lokhov,\nwho was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my\npresence and particularly distinguished himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the P\xc3\xa1vlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed\nin Zherk\xc3\xb3v, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the hussars all\nthat day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\nbroke up two squares, your excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSeveral of those present smiled at Zherk\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s words, expecting one of\nhis usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to\nthe glory of our arms and of the day\xe2\x80\x99s work, they assumed a serious\nexpression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie\ndevoid of any foundation. Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n turned to the old colonel:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically:\ninfantry, cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were\nabandoned in the center?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, searching with his eyes for\nsomeone. (Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n did not ask about the guns on the left\nflank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very\nbeginning of the action.) \xe2\x80\x9cI think I sent you?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to\nthe staff officer on duty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne was damaged,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the staff officer, \xe2\x80\x9cand the other I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only\njust left.... It is true that it was hot there,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, modestly.\n\nSomeone mentioned that Captain T\xc3\xbashin was bivouacking close to the\nvillage and had already been sent for.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but you were there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, addressing Prince\nAndrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, we only just missed one another,\xe2\x80\x9d said the staff\nofficer, with a smile to Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not the pleasure of seeing you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, coldly\nand abruptly.\n\nAll were silent. T\xc3\xbashin appeared at the threshold and made his way\ntimidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the\ngenerals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the\nsight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and\nstumbled over it. Several of those present laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was it a gun was abandoned?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, frowning, not so\nmuch at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom Zherk\xc3\xb3v\nlaughed loudest.\n\nOnly now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt\nand the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present\nthemselves to T\xc3\xbashin in all their horror. He had been so excited that\nhe had not thought about it until that moment. The officers\xe2\x80\x99 laughter\nconfused him still more. He stood before Bagrati\xc3\xb3n with his lower\njaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know... your\nexcellency... I had no men... your excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have taken some from the covering troops.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nT\xc3\xbashin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that\nwas perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into\ntrouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagrati\xc3\xb3n as a schoolboy who\nhas blundered looks at an examiner.\n\nThe silence lasted some time. Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, apparently not wishing\nto be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to\nintervene. Prince Andrew looked at T\xc3\xbashin from under his brows and his\nfingers twitched nervously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were pleased to send me to Captain T\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s battery. I\nwent there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two\nguns smashed, and no supports at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n and T\xc3\xbashin looked with equal intentness at\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cwe owe today\xe2\x80\x99s success chiefly to the action of that\nbattery and the heroic endurance of Captain T\xc3\xbashin and his company,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.\n\nPrince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n looked at T\xc3\xbashin, evidently reluctant to show\ndistrust in Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully\nto credit it, bent his head, and told T\xc3\xbashin that he could go. Prince\nAndrew went out with him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xbashin.\n\nPrince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He felt\nsad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will\nall this end?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v, looking at the changing shadows before\nhim. The pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible\ndrowsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the\nimpression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged\nwith the physical pain. It was they, these soldiers\xe2\x80\x94wounded and\nunwounded\xe2\x80\x94it was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting\nthe sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To\nrid himself of them he closed his eyes.\n\nFor a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things\nappeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand,\nS\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s thin little shoulders, Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and laughter,\nDen\xc3\xadsov with his voice and mustache, and Tely\xc3\xa1nin and all that affair\nwith Tely\xc3\xa1nin and Bogd\xc3\xa1nich. That affair was the same thing as this\nsoldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier\nthat were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and\nalways dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them, but\nthey would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth.\nIt would not ache\xe2\x80\x94it would be well\xe2\x80\x94if only they did not pull it, but\nit was impossible to get rid of them.\n\nHe opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung less\nthan a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling snow were\nfluttering in that light. T\xc3\xbashin had not returned, the doctor had not\ncome. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at\nthe other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody wants me!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one to help me or\npity me. Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed\nand, doing so, groaned involuntarily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, is anything hurting you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the soldier, shaking his shirt\nout over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and\nadded: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of men have been crippled today\xe2\x80\x94frightful!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes\nfluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm,\nbright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his\nhealthy body, and all the affection and care of his family. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why\ndid I come here?\xe2\x80\x9d he wondered.\n\nNext day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s detachment was reunited to Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s army.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THREE: 1805\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans.\nStill less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He\nwas merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had\nbecome a habit. Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted\nto himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life,\nwere constantly shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the\ncircumstances and persons he met. Of these plans he had not merely one\nor two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themselves,\nsome approaching achievement, and some in course of disintegration. He\ndid not, for instance, say to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cThis man now has influence, I\nmust gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special\ngrant.\xe2\x80\x9d Nor did he say to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cPierre is a rich man, I must\nentice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles\nI need.\xe2\x80\x9d But when he came across a man of position his instinct\nimmediately told him that this man could be useful, and without any\npremeditation Prince Vas\xc3\xadli took the first opportunity to gain his\nconfidence, flatter him, become intimate with him, and finally make his\nrequest.\n\nHe had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as\nGentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of\nCouncilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to\nPetersburg and staying at his house. With apparent absent-mindedness,\nyet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing,\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had\nhe thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural\nand shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both\nabove and below him in social standing. Something always drew him toward\nthose richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in\nseizing the most opportune moment for making use of people.\n\nPierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov and a rich man, felt\nhimself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and\npreoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He had to\nsign papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of\nwhich was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his\nestate near Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not\neven wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended\nand grieved had he chosen not to see them. These different\npeople\xe2\x80\x94businessmen, relations, and acquaintances alike\xe2\x80\x94were all\ndisposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering\nmanner: they were all evidently firmly convinced of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s noble\nqualities. He was always hearing such words as: \xe2\x80\x9cWith your remarkable\nkindness,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cWith your excellent heart,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou are yourself so\nhonorable, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cWere he as clever as you,\xe2\x80\x9d and so on,\ntill he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and\nextraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it\nhad always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent.\nEven people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently\nunfriendly now became gentle and affectionate. The angry eldest\nprincess, with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll\xe2\x80\x99s,\nhad come into Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s room after the funeral. With drooping eyes\nand frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past\nmisunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for\nanything, except only for permission, after the blow she had received,\nto remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where\nshe had sacrificed so much. She could not refrain from weeping at these\nwords. Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre\ntook her hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for.\nFrom that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began\nknitting a striped scarf for him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to put up with a\ngreat deal from the deceased,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Vas\xc3\xadli to him, handing him\na deed to sign for the princess\xe2\x80\x99 benefit.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw\nthis bone\xe2\x80\x94a bill for thirty thousand rubles\xe2\x80\x94to the poor princess\nthat it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of\nthe inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess\ngrew still kinder. The younger sisters also became affectionate to him,\nespecially the youngest, the pretty one with the mole, who often made\nhim feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him.\n\nIt seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it\nwould have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could\nnot but believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides, he had\nno time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not. He\nwas always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful\nintoxication. He felt as though he were the center of some important and\ngeneral movement; that something was constantly expected of him, that if\nhe did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people, but if he\ndid this and that, all would be well; and he did what was demanded of\nhim, but still that happy result always remained in the future.\n\nMore than anyone else, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli took possession of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\naffairs and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of\nCount Bez\xc3\xbakhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air of\na man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for\npity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of\nhis old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice\nof fate and the designs of rogues. During the few days he spent in\nMoscow after the death of Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov, he would call Pierre, or\ngo to him himself, and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of\nweariness and assurance, as if he were adding every time: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\nI am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that\nI trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well that what I\npropose is the only thing possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s elbow,\nspeaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed\nupon and could not now be altered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe start tomorrow and I\xe2\x80\x99m giving\nyou a place in my carriage. I am very glad. All our important business\nhere is now settled, and I ought to have been off long ago. Here is\nsomething I have received from the chancellor. I asked him for you, and\nyou have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of\nthe Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now lies open before you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNotwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words\nwere pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career,\nwished to make some suggestion. But Prince Vas\xc3\xadli interrupted him in\nthe special deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting\nhis speech, which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was\nneeded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience,\nand there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever complained yet of\nbeing too much loved; and besides, you are free, you could throw it\nup tomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself when you get to\nPetersburg. It is high time for you to get away from these terrible\nrecollections.\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Vas\xc3\xadli sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, my boy. And my\nvalet can go in your carriage. Ah! I was nearly forgetting,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, mon cher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so\nI have received what was due from the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n estate and will keep it;\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t require it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go into the accounts later.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBy \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was due from the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n estate\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Vas\xc3\xadli meant\nseveral thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s peasants,\nwhich the prince had retained for himself.\n\nIn Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of\ngentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the\nrank (for he did nothing), that Prince Vas\xc3\xadli had procured for him,\nand acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous\nthat, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle,\nand continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never\nattained.\n\nOf his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg.\nThe Guards had gone to the front; D\xc3\xb3lokhov had been reduced to the\nranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew\nwas abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he\nused to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with\na friend older than himself and whom he respected. His whole time\nwas taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s house in the company of the stout princess, his wife, and\nhis beautiful daughter H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne.\n\nLike the others, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna Sch\xc3\xa9rer showed Pierre the change of\nattitude toward him that had taken place in society.\n\nFormerly in Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s presence, Pierre had always felt that\nwhat he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that\nremarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became\nfoolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyte\xe2\x80\x99s\nstupidest remarks came out clever and apt. Now everything Pierre said\nwas charmant. Even if Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna did not say so, he could see that\nshe wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty.\n\nIn the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added:\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find the beautiful H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne here, whom it is always\ndelightful to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some\nlink which other people recognized had grown up between himself and\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were\nbeing imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an\nentertaining supposition.\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAt Home\xe2\x80\x9d was like the former one, only the\nnovelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a\ndiplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the\nEmperor Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august\nfriends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold\nthe cause of justice against the enemy of the human race. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\nreceived Pierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently relating to the\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s recent loss by the death of Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov (everyone\nconstantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly\nafflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and her\nmelancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention\nof her most august Majesty the Empress M\xc3\xa1rya F\xc3\xabdorovna. Pierre felt\nflattered by this. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna arranged the different groups in her\ndrawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which were\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat.\nAnother group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former,\nbut Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x94who was in the excited condition of a commander on\na battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which\nthere is hardly time to put in action\xe2\x80\x94seeing Pierre, touched his\nsleeve with her finger, saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(She glanced at H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne and smiled at her.) \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, be\ncharitable to my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for\nten minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count\nwho will not refuse to accompany you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe beauty went to the aunt, but Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna detained Pierre, looking\nas if she had to give some final necessary instructions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she exquisite?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately\nbeauty as she glided away. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how she carries herself! For so young\na girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from\nher heart. Happy the man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men\nwould occupy a most brilliant position in society. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\nI only wanted to know your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna let Pierre go.\n\nPierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s\nperfection of manner. If he ever thought of H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, it was just of\nher beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in\nsociety.\n\nThe old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed\ndesirous of hiding her adoration for H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne and inclined rather\nto show her fear of Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna. She looked at her niece, as if\ninquiring what she was to do with these people. On leaving them, Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna again touched Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t\nsay that it is dull in my house again,\xe2\x80\x9d and she glanced at H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne.\n\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the\npossibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt\ncoughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to see\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome\nand the same look. In the middle of a dull and halting conversation,\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave\nto everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little\nmeaning for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt was just\nspeaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nfather, Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov, and showed them her own box. Princess H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\nasked to see the portrait of the aunt\xe2\x80\x99s husband on the box lid.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is probably the work of Vinesse,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, mentioning\na celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the\nsnuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.\n\nHe half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox,\npassing it across H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s back. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne stooped forward to make\nroom, and looked round with a smile. She was, as always at evening\nparties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at\nfront and back. Her bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre,\nwas so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive\nthe living charm of her neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that\nhe need only have bent his head a little to have touched them. He was\nconscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the\ncreaking of her corset as she moved. He did not see her marble beauty\nforming a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body\nonly covered by her garments. And having once seen this he could not\nhelp being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once\nseen through.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?\xe2\x80\x9d H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\nseemed to say. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a\nwoman who may belong to anyone\xe2\x80\x94to you too,\xe2\x80\x9d said her glance. And at\nthat moment Pierre felt that H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne not only could, but must, be his\nwife, and that it could not be otherwise.\n\nHe knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the\naltar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, he did not\neven know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why,\nthat it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.\n\nPierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see\nher as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every\nday until then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more\nthan a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the\nmist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has\nonce recognized it to be a tuft of grass. She was terribly close to him.\nShe already had power over him, and between them there was no longer any\nbarrier except the barrier of his own will.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will leave you in your little corner,\xe2\x80\x9d came Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI see you are all right there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything\nreprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him that everyone\nknew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.\n\nA little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna said\nto him: \xe2\x80\x9cI hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and\nPierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house\ndone up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, but don\xe2\x80\x99t move from Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s. It\nis good to have a friend like the prince,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling at Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli. \xe2\x80\x9cI know something about that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I? And you are still so\nyoung. You need advice. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me for exercising an old\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have\nmentioned their age. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you marry it will be a different thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He\nmuttered something and colored.\n\nWhen he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what\nhad happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely understood that\nthe woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was mentioned\nhe had said absent-mindedly: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s good looking,\xe2\x80\x9d he had\nunderstood that this woman might belong to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she\xe2\x80\x99s stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites\nin me. I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her\nand she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that that\xe2\x80\x99s why\nhe was sent away. Hippolyte is her brother... Prince Vas\xc3\xadli is her\nfather... It\xe2\x80\x99s bad....\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected, but while he was thinking this\n(the reflection was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was\nconscious that another line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking\nof her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his\nwife, how she would love him become quite different, and how all he had\nthought and heard of her might be false. And he again saw her not as the\ndaughter of Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, but visualized her whole body only veiled\nby its gray dress. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no! Why did this thought never occur to me\nbefore?\xe2\x80\x9d and again he told himself that it was impossible, that there\nwould be something unnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, in\nthis marriage. He recalled her former words and looks and the words\nand looks of those who had seen them together. He recalled Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s words and looks when she spoke to him about his house,\nrecalled thousands of such hints from Prince Vas\xc3\xadli and others, and was\nseized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself to do\nsomething that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do. But at\nthe very time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another\npart of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIn November, 1805, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli had to go on a tour of inspection\nin four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to\nvisit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole\nwhere his regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that\nrich old man. But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs,\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli had to settle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had\nlatterly spent whole days at home, that is, in Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s house\nwhere he was staying, and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s presence (as a lover should be), but had not yet proposed\nto her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very fine, but things must be settled,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that\nPierre who was under such obligations to him (\xe2\x80\x9cBut never mind that\xe2\x80\x9d)\nwas not behaving very well in this matter. \xe2\x80\x9cYouth, frivolity... well,\nGod be with him,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart,\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut it must be brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be\nL\xc3\xablya\xe2\x80\x99s name day. I will invite two or three people, and if he does\nnot understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair\xe2\x80\x94yes, my\naffair. I am her father.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSix weeks after Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAt Home\xe2\x80\x9d and after the sleepless\nnight when he had decided that to marry H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne would be a calamity and\nthat he ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision,\nhad not left Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s and felt with terror that in people\xe2\x80\x99s\neyes he was every day more and more connected with her, that it was\nimpossible for him to return to his former conception of her, that he\ncould not break away from her, and that though it would be a terrible\nthing he would have to unite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have\nbeen able to free himself but that Prince Vas\xc3\xadli (who had rarely before\ngiven receptions) now hardly let a day go by without having an evening\nparty at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil\nthe general pleasure and disappoint everyone\xe2\x80\x99s expectation. Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli, in the rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nhand in passing and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out his\nwrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say: \xe2\x80\x9cTill\ntomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cBe in to dinner or I shall not see you,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cI\nam staying in for your sake,\xe2\x80\x9d and so on. And though Prince Vas\xc3\xadli,\nwhen he stayed in (as he said) for Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s sake, hardly exchanged a\ncouple of words with him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint him.\nEvery day he said to himself one and the same thing: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time I\nunderstood her and made up my mind what she really is. Was I mistaken\nbefore, or am I mistaken now? No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent\ngirl,\xe2\x80\x9d he sometimes said to himself \xe2\x80\x9cshe never makes a mistake,\nnever says anything stupid. She says little, but what she does say is\nalways clear and simple, so she is not stupid. She never was abashed and\nis not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad woman!\xe2\x80\x9d He had often begun\nto make reflections or think aloud in her company, and she had always\nanswered him either by a brief but appropriate remark\xe2\x80\x94showing that it\ndid not interest her\xe2\x80\x94or by a silent look and smile which more palpably\nthan anything else showed Pierre her superiority. She was right in\nregarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.\n\nShe always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him\nalone, in which there was something more significant than in the general\nsmile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was\nwaiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that\nsooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror\nseized him at the thought of that dreadful step. A thousand times during\nthat month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to\nthat dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I doing? I need\nresolution. Can it be that I have none?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter\nhe lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really\npossessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel\nthemselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was overpowered\nby a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire\nparalyzed his will.\n\nOn H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s name day, a small party of just their own people\xe2\x80\x94as\nhis wife said\xe2\x80\x94met for supper at Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s. All these friends\nand relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young\ngirl would be decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper.\nPrincess Kur\xc3\xa1gina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome,\nwas sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the\nmore important guests\xe2\x80\x94an old general and his wife, and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\nSch\xc3\xa9rer. At the other end sat the younger and less important guests,\nand there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne,\nside by side. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli was not having any supper: he went round\nthe table in a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of\nthe guests. To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark\nexcept to Pierre and H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, whose presence he seemed not to notice.\nHe enlivened the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly, the\nsilver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 toilets and the gold\nand silver of the men\xe2\x80\x99s epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved\nround the table, the clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with\nthe animated hum of several conversations. At one end of the table, the\nold chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her\npassionately, at which she laughed; at the other could be heard the\nstory of the misfortunes of some Mary V\xc3\xadktorovna or other. At the\ncenter of the table, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli attracted everybody\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\nWith a facetious smile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last\nWednesday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting of the Imperial Council, at which Serg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch\nVyazm\xc3\xadtinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had\nreceived and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander\nfrom the army to Serg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch, in which the Emperor said that he was\nreceiving from all sides declarations of the people\xe2\x80\x99s loyalty, that\nthe declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that\nhe was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be\nworthy of it. This rescript began with the words: \xe2\x80\x9cSerg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch,\nFrom all sides reports reach me,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and so he never got farther than: \xe2\x80\x98Serg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\nasked one of the ladies.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly, not a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth farther,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Prince Vas\xc3\xadli,\nlaughing, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Serg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch... From all sides... From all sides...\nSerg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch...\xe2\x80\x99 Poor Vyazm\xc3\xadtinov could not get any farther!\nHe began the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered\n\xe2\x80\x98Serg\xc3\xa9y\xe2\x80\x99 he sobbed, \xe2\x80\x98Kuz-m\xc3\xad-ch,\xe2\x80\x99 tears, and \xe2\x80\x98From all\nsides\xe2\x80\x99 was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther. And again\nhis handkerchief, and again: \xe2\x80\x98Serg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch, From all sides,\xe2\x80\x99...\nand tears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKuzm\xc3\xadch... From all sides... and then tears,\xe2\x80\x9d someone repeated\nlaughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be unkind,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna from her end of the table\nholding up a threatening finger. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is such a worthy and excellent\nman, our dear Vyazm\xc3\xadtinov....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEverybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the\nhonored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the\ninfluence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a\nsuppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing\nto do with Serg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch\xe2\x80\x94a smile of bashfulness at their own\nfeelings. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much\nas they enjoyed their Rhine wine, saut\xc3\xa9, and ices, and however they\navoided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant as\nthey seemed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they gave\nthat the story about Serg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch, the laughter, and the food\nwere all a pretense, and that the whole attention of that company was\ndirected to\xe2\x80\x94Pierre and H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli mimicked the sobbing\nof Serg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his\ndaughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said:\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... it\xe2\x80\x99s getting on, it will all be settled today.\xe2\x80\x9d Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna threatened him on behalf of \xe2\x80\x9cour dear Vyazm\xc3\xadtinov,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nin her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\nread a congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\nhappiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the\nold lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh\nseemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing left for you and me but to sip\nsweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these young ones to\nbe thus boldly, provocatively happy.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what nonsense all this is\nthat I am saying!\xe2\x80\x9d thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces\nof the lovers. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s happiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nInto the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that\nsociety had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy\nand handsome young man and woman for one another. And this human feeling\ndominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter.\nJests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the animation was\nevidently forced. Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at\ntable seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked\nat the beautiful H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne with her radiant face and at the red, broad,\nand happy though uneasy face of Pierre. It seemed as if the very light\nof the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone.\n\nPierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and\nembarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation.\nHe did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only now and\nthen detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot\nunexpectedly through his mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is all finished!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how has it all happened?\nHow quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself\nalone, but because of everyone, it must inevitably come about. They are\nall expecting it, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I\ncannot, disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not know, but it\nwill certainly happen!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling\nshoulders close to his eyes.\n\nOr he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it\nawkward to attract everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention and to be considered a\nlucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris\npossessed of a Helen. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no doubt it always is and must be so!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe consoled himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides, what have I done to bring it about?\nHow did it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vas\xc3\xadli. Then there\nwas nothing. So why should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards\nwith her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her. How did it\nbegin, when did it all come about?\xe2\x80\x9d And here he was sitting by her\nside as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nearness, her\nbreathing, her movements, her beauty. Then it would suddenly seem to him\nthat it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was\nwhy they all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration\nhe would expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good\nfortune. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a\nsecond time. But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what\nwas said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am asking you when you last heard from Bolk\xc3\xb3nski,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli a third time. \xe2\x80\x9cHow absent-minded you are, my dear\nfellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at\nhim and H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of it, if you all know it?\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nPierre. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat of it? It\xe2\x80\x99s the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d and he himself smiled his\ngentle childlike smile, and H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne smiled too.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you get the letter? Was it from Olm\xc3\xbctz?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a\ndispute.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can one talk or think of such trifles?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, from Olm\xc3\xbctz,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a sigh.\n\nAfter supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the\ndrawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave\nof H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important\noccupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away,\nrefusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist preserved a mournful\nsilence as he left the drawing room. He pictured the vanity of his\ndiplomatic career in comparison with Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s happiness. The old\ngeneral grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, the\nold fool,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThat Princess H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne will be beautiful\nstill when she\xe2\x80\x99s fifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I may congratulate you,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna to the\nold princess, kissing her soundly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t this headache I\xe2\x80\x99d\nhave stayed longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s happiness.\n\nWhile the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time\nalone with H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne in the little drawing room where they were sitting.\nHe had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her,\nbut had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable,\nbut he could not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt\nashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone else\xe2\x80\x99s place here\nbeside H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne. \xe2\x80\x9cThis happiness is not for you,\xe2\x80\x9d some inner voice\nwhispered to him. \xe2\x80\x9cThis happiness is for those who have not in them\nwhat there is in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was\nsatisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manner that\nthis name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had.\n\nSome of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in\nthe large drawing room. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli came up to Pierre with languid\nfootsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli gave\nhim a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was\nso strange that one could not take it in. But then the expression of\nseverity changed, and he drew Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s hand downwards, made him sit\ndown, and smiled affectionately.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, L\xc3\xablya?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and\naddressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to\nparents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli had only acquired by imitating other parents.\n\nAnd he again turned to Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSerg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch\xe2\x80\x94From all sides\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he said, unbuttoning the top\nbutton of his waistcoat.\n\nPierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story\nabout Serg\xc3\xa9y Kuzm\xc3\xadch that interested Prince Vas\xc3\xadli just then, and\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered\nsomething and went away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was\ndisconcerted. The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world\ntouched Pierre: he looked at H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne and she too seemed disconcerted,\nand her look seemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is your own fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre,\nand he again began speaking about indifferent matters, about Serg\xc3\xa9y\nKuzm\xc3\xadch, asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it\nproperly. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne answered with a smile that she too had missed it.\n\nWhen Prince Vas\xc3\xadli returned to the drawing room, the princess, his\nwife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarriages are made in heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the elderly lady.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down\non a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to\nbe dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAline,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cgo and see what they are about.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and\nindifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne still sat talking just as before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill the same,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her husband.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his\nface assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking\nhimself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went\npast the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went\njoyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre\nrose in alarm on seeing it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Vas\xc3\xadli. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife has told me\neverything!\xe2\x80\x9d (He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his\ndaughter.)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy... L\xc3\xablya... I am very pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d (His\nvoice trembled.) \xe2\x80\x9cI loved your father... and she will make you a good\nwife... God bless you!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his\nmalodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess, come here!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\nThe old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using\nher handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s hand several times. After a while they were left alone\nagain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this had to be and could not be otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre,\n\xe2\x80\x9cso it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because\nit\xe2\x80\x99s definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre\nheld the hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful\nbosom as it rose and fell.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne!\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud and paused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething special is always said in such cases,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, but\ncould not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face.\nShe drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, take those off... those...\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing to his\nspectacles.\n\nPierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes have\nfrom which spectacles have just been removed, had also a frightened and\ninquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but\nwith a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his\nlips and met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered,\nunpleasantly excited expression.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late now, it\xe2\x80\x99s done; besides I love her,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJe vous aime!\xe2\x80\x9d * he said, remembering what has to be said at such\nmoments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nSix weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s\nlarge, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people\nsaid, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nOld Prince Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski received a letter from Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\nin November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him\na visit. \xe2\x80\x9cI am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I\nshall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at\nthe same time, my honored benefactor,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Prince Vas\xc3\xadli. \xe2\x80\x9cMy son\nAnatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will\nallow him personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his\nfather, he feels for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are\ncoming to us of their own accord,\xe2\x80\x9d incautiously remarked the little\nprincess on hearing the news.\n\nPrince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.\n\nA fortnight after the letter Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s servants came one\nevening in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.\n\nOld Bolk\xc3\xb3nski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s\ncharacter, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and\nAlexander Prince Vas\xc3\xadli had risen to high position and honors. And now,\nfrom the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess,\nhe saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into\na feeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned\nhim. On the day of Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski was\nparticularly discontented and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad\ntemper because Prince Vas\xc3\xadli was coming, or whether his being in a bad\ntemper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s visit, he was\nin a bad temper, and in the morning T\xc3\xadkhon had already advised the\narchitect not to go to the prince with his report.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear how he\xe2\x80\x99s walking?\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xadkhon, drawing the\narchitect\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the sound of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps.\n\xe2\x80\x9cStepping flat on his heels\xe2\x80\x94we know what that means....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHowever, at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable\ncollar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day\nbefore and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the\nhabit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still\nvisible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the\nsoft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The prince went\nthrough the conservatories, the serfs\xe2\x80\x99 quarters, and the outbuildings,\nfrowning and silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan a sleigh pass?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked his overseer, a venerable man,\nresembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him\nback to the house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. \xe2\x80\x9cGod be\nthanked,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the overseer, \xe2\x80\x9cthe storm has blown over!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been hard to drive up, your honor,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nheard, your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,\nfrowning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in\nhis shrill, harsh voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe road is not swept for the princess my\ndaughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor, I thought...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the prince, his words coming more and more\nrapidly and indistinctly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!...\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to think!\xe2\x80\x9d and lifting his stick he swung it and\nwould have hit Alp\xc3\xa1tych, the overseer, had not the latter instinctively\navoided the blow. \xe2\x80\x9cThought... Blackguards...\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the prince\nrapidly.\n\nBut although Alp\xc3\xa1tych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the\nstroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before\nhim, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued\nto shout: \xe2\x80\x9cBlackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!\xe2\x80\x9d did not\nlift his stick again but hurried into the house.\n\nBefore dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew\nthat the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle\nBourienne with a radiant face that said: \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing, I am the\nsame as usual,\xe2\x80\x9d and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast\neyes. What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions\nshe ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not.\nShe thought: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I seem not to notice he will think that I do not\nsympathize with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will\nsay (as he has done before) that I\xe2\x80\x99m in the dumps.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe prince looked at his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s frightened face and snorted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool... or dummy!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other one is not here. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling tales,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought\xe2\x80\x94referring to the little princess who was not in the dining\nroom.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the princess?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHiding?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not very well,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with\na bright smile, \xe2\x80\x9cso she won\xe2\x80\x99t come down. It is natural in her\nstate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm! Hm!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the prince, sitting down.\n\nHis plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he\nflung it away. T\xc3\xadkhon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little\nprincess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince\nthat, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid for the baby,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne:\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven knows what a fright might do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and\nwith a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not\nrealize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The prince\nreciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt\nfor her. When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald\nHills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole\ndays with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her\nabout the old prince and criticized him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo we are to have visitors, mon prince?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mademoiselle\nBourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cHis\nExcellency Prince Vas\xc3\xadli Kur\xc3\xa1gin and his son, I understand?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid inquiringly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm!\xe2\x80\x94his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the\nservice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince disdainfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy his son is coming I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want him.\xe2\x80\x9d (He looked at his blushing daughter.) \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\nunwell today? Eh? Afraid of the \xe2\x80\x98minister\xe2\x80\x99 as that idiot Alp\xc3\xa1tych\ncalled him this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mon p\xc3\xa8re.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice\nof a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the\nconservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and\nafter the soup the prince became more genial.\n\nAfter dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess\nwas sitting at a small table, chattering with M\xc3\xa1sha, her maid. She grew\npale on seeing her father-in-law.\n\nShe was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her cheeks\nhad sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I feel a kind of oppression,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in reply to the\nprince\xe2\x80\x99s question as to how she felt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, merci, mon p\xc3\xa8re.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe left the room and went to the waiting room where Alp\xc3\xa1tych stood with\nbowed head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the snow been shoveled back?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake... It was only\nmy stupidity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the prince, and laughing his\nunnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alp\xc3\xa1tych to kiss, and then\nproceeded to his study.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by\ncoachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to\none of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.\n\nAnatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a\ntable on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his\nlarge and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a continual round\nof amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him.\nAnd he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly\nheiress in the same way. All this might, he thought, turn out very well\nand amusingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not marry her if she really has so much money?\nThat never does any harm,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Anatole.\n\nHe shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had\nbecome habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to\nhim. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked\nround with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter\nentered, as if to say: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s how I want you to look.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?\xe2\x80\x9d Anatole asked,\nas if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been\nmentioned during the journey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious\nwith the old prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he starts a row I\xe2\x80\x99ll go away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Anatole. \xe2\x80\x9cI\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bear those old men! Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, for you everything depends on this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants\xe2\x80\x99 rooms that\nthe minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had\nbeen minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room,\nvainly trying to master her agitation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never\nhappen!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at herself in the glass. \xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I\nenter the drawing room? Even if I like him I can\xe2\x80\x99t now be myself with\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d The mere thought of her father\xe2\x80\x99s look filled her with terror.\nThe little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received\nfrom M\xc3\xa1sha, the lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid, the necessary report of how handsome the\nminister\xe2\x80\x99s son was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with\nwhat difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son\nhad followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time. Having received\nthis information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose\nchattering voices had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know they\xe2\x80\x99ve come, Marie?\xe2\x80\x9d said the little princess, waddling\nin, and sinking heavily into an armchair.\n\nShe was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning,\nbut had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her\nface was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded\noutlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still\nmore noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch\nhad been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s toilet which rendered her\nfresh and pretty face yet more attractive.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nbegan. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing\nroom and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself\nup at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily\nbegan to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be\ndressed. Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s self-esteem was wounded by the fact that\nthe arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both\nher companions\xe2\x80\x99 not having the least conception that it could be\notherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them\nwould be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to\ndress her would prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed, her\nbeautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took\non the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she\nsubmitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these women\nquite sincerely tried to make her look pretty. She was so plain that\nneither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing\nher with perfect sincerity, and with the na\xc3\xafve and firm conviction\nwomen have that dress can make a face pretty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lise, looking\nsideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a maroon\ndress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life may\nbe at stake. But this one is too light, it\xe2\x80\x99s not becoming!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary\nthat was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little\nprincess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed\nin the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on\nthe best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that\nthe frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that\nhowever they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it\nwould still remain piteous and plain. After two or three changes to\nwhich Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair had been arranged\non the top of her head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her\nlooks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the\nlittle princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the\ndress with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her\nwith her head bent first on one side and then on the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it will not do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said decidedly, clasping her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\nMary, really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little\ngray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\nto the maid, \xe2\x80\x9cbring the princess her gray dress, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\nMademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, smiling\nwith a foretaste of artistic pleasure.\n\nBut when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained\nsitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the\nmirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst\ninto sobs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, dear princess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle Bourienne, \xe2\x80\x9cjust one more\nlittle effort.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess\nMary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now we\xe2\x80\x99ll arrange something quite simple and becoming,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid.\n\nThe three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s, and Katie\xe2\x80\x99s, who\nwas laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping\nof birds.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, leave me alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary.\n\nHer voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds\nwas silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful\neyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at\nthem, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least, change your coiffure,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little princess.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, turning reproachfully to\nMademoiselle Bourienne, \xe2\x80\x9cMary\xe2\x80\x99s is a face which such a coiffure does\nnot suit in the least. Not in the least! Please change it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same to\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d answered a voice struggling with tears.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves\nthat Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual,\nbut it was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they\nboth knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess\nMary did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they\nknew that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to\nbe shaken in her determination.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will change it, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lise. And as Princess Mary\ngave no answer, she left the room.\n\nPrincess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise\xe2\x80\x99s request,\nshe not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her\nglass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and\npondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive\nbeing rose in her imagination, and carried her into a totally different\nhappy world of his own. She fancied a child, her own\xe2\x80\x94such as she had\nseen the day before in the arms of her nurse\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\xe2\x80\x94at her\nown breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the\nchild. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no, it is impossible, I am too ugly,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d came the\nmaid\xe2\x80\x99s voice at the door.\n\nShe roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and\nbefore going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her\neyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a\nlamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful\ndoubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a\nman, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of\nhappiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing\nwas for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from\nothers and even from herself, the stronger it grew. \xe2\x80\x9cO God,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9chow am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil?\nHow am I to renounce forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to\nfulfill Thy will?\xe2\x80\x9d And scarcely had she put that question than God\ngave her the answer in her own heart. \xe2\x80\x9cDesire nothing for thyself,\nseek nothing, be not anxious or envious. Man\xe2\x80\x99s future and thy own fate\nmust remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for\nanything. If it be God\xe2\x80\x99s will to prove thee in the duties of marriage,\nbe ready to fulfill His will.\xe2\x80\x9d With this consoling thought (but\nyet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing)\nPrincess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself went down, thinking\nneither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what\nshe would say. What could all that matter in comparison with the will of\nGod, without Whose care not a hair of man\xe2\x80\x99s head can fall?\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nWhen Princess Mary came down, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli and his son were already\nin the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle\nBourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels,\nthe gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess,\nindicating her to the gentlemen, said: \xe2\x80\x9cVoil\xc3\xa0 Marie!\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary\nsaw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s face,\nserious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling\nagain, and the little princess curiously noting the impression\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarie\xe2\x80\x9d produced on the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle\nBourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her unusually animated\nlook which was fixed on him, but him she could not see, she only saw\nsomething large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward her as she\nentered the room. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli approached first, and she kissed the\nbold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by\nsaying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well. Then\nAnatole came up to her. She still could not see him. She only felt a\nsoft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white\nforehead, over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade.\nWhen she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty. Anatole stood\nwith his right thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded\nand his back drawn in, slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a\nlittle bent, looked with beaming face at the princess without\nspeaking and evidently not thinking about her at all. Anatole was not\nquick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in conversation, but he had the\nfaculty, so invaluable in society, of composure and imperturbable\nself-possession. If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on\na first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of\nsuch silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is\nbad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the\nprincess\xe2\x80\x99 hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for\na very long time. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him\ntalk, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to,\xe2\x80\x9d he seemed to say. Besides this, in his\nbehavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in\nthem curiosity, awe, and even love\xe2\x80\x94a supercilious consciousness of\nhis own superiority. It was as if he said to them: \xe2\x80\x9cI know you, I know\nyou, but why should I bother about you? You\xe2\x80\x99d be only too glad, of\ncourse.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women\xe2\x80\x94even\nprobably he did not, for in general he thought very little\xe2\x80\x94but his\nlooks and manner gave that impression. The princess felt this, and as if\nwishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him,\nshe turned to his father. The conversation was general and animated,\nthanks to Princess Lise\xe2\x80\x99s voice and little downy lip that lifted over\nher white teeth. She met Prince Vas\xc3\xadli with that playful manner often\nemployed by lively chatty people, and consisting in the assumption\nthat between the person they so address and themselves there are some\nsemi-private, long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though\nno such reminiscences really exist\xe2\x80\x94just as none existed in this case.\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli readily adopted her tone and the little princess also\ndrew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of\nthings that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them\nand even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these\nmerry reminiscences.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to\nourselves, dear prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little princess (of course, in\nFrench) to Prince Vas\xc3\xadli. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not as at Annette\xe2\x80\x99s * receptions\nwhere you always ran away; you remember cette ch\xc3\xa8re Annette!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t talk politics to me like Annette!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd our little tea table?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it you were never at Annette\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d the little princess asked\nAnatole. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I know, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a sly glance, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\nbrother Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d and she shook her\nfinger at him, \xe2\x80\x9cI have even heard of your doings in Paris!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd didn\xe2\x80\x99t Hippolyte tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, turning to\nhis son and seizing the little princess\xe2\x80\x99 arm as if she would have run\naway and he had just managed to catch her, \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t he tell you how\nhe himself was pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the\ndoor? Oh, she is a pearl among women, Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to\nPrincess Mary.\n\nWhen Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the\nopportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.\n\nShe took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole\nhad left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the\nFrenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her\nabout her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole\ncame to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all bad!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, examining her, \xe2\x80\x9cnot at all bad, that\nlittle companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when we\xe2\x80\x99re\nmarried, la petite est gentille.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n    * The little one is charming.\n\nThe old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering\nwhat he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli and that son of his to me? Prince Vas\xc3\xadli is a shallow\nbraggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,\xe2\x80\x9d he grumbled to\nhimself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived\nin his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about\nwhich he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever\nbring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The\nprince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand\nthat he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only\nwith his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without\nPrincess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why should she marry?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be unhappy for\ncertain. There\xe2\x80\x99s Lise, married to Andrew\xe2\x80\x94a better husband one would\nthink could hardly be found nowadays\xe2\x80\x94but is she contented with her\nlot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They\xe2\x80\x99ll\ntake her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living\nunmarried, and even the happier for it?\xe2\x80\x9d So thought Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\nwhile dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded\nan immediate answer. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli had brought his son with the evident\nintention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask\nfor an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing against it,\xe2\x80\x9d the prince said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he must\nbe worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!\xe2\x80\x9d he added\naloud.\n\nHe entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly\nround the company. He noticed the change in the little princess\xe2\x80\x99\ndress, Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s ribbon, Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s unbecoming\ncoiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s and Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s smiles, and the\nloneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cGot herself\nup like a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, looking irritably at her. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\nshameless, and he ignores her!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe went straight up to Prince Vas\xc3\xadli.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! How d\xe2\x80\x99ye do? How d\xe2\x80\x99ye do? Glad to see you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriendship laughs at distance,\xe2\x80\x9d began Prince Vas\xc3\xadli in his usual\nrapid, self-confident, familiar tone. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is my second son; please\nlove and befriend him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski surveyed Anatole.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine young fellow! Fine young fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, come and\nkiss me,\xe2\x80\x9d and he offered his cheek.\n\nAnatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect\ncomposure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had\ntold him to expect.\n\nPrince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa\nand, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, pointed to it and began\nquestioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen\nattentively to what Prince Vas\xc3\xadli said, but kept glancing at Princess\nMary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so they are writing from Potsdam already?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, repeating\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his\ndaughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it for visitors you\xe2\x80\x99ve got yourself up like that, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe. \xe2\x80\x9cFine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for\nthe visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are\nnever to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my fault, mon p\xc3\xa8re,\xe2\x80\x9d interceded the little princess, with a\nblush.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must do as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, bowing to his\ndaughter-in-law, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she need not make a fool of herself, she\xe2\x80\x99s\nplain enough as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was\nreduced to tears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you, young prince, what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski,\nturning to Anatole, \xe2\x80\x9ccome here, let us talk and get acquainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow the fun begins,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile\nbeside the old prince.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear boy, I hear you\xe2\x80\x99ve been educated abroad, not taught\nto read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me,\nmy dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old man,\nscrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have been transferred to the line,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, hardly able\nto restrain his laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the\nTsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve.\nWell, are you off to the front?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached...\nwhat is it I am attached to, Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, turning to his\nfather with a laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA splendid soldier, splendid! \xe2\x80\x98What am I attached to!\xe2\x80\x99 Ha, ha,\nha!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, and Anatole laughed still louder.\nSuddenly Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski frowned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Anatole.\n\nAnatole returned smiling to the ladies.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you\xe2\x80\x99ve had him educated abroad, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, haven\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old prince to Prince Vas\xc3\xadli.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there\nis much better than ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The\nlad\xe2\x80\x99s a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.\xe2\x80\x9d He took\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were\nalone together, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli announced his hopes and wishes to the old\nprince.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t part from\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old prince angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idea! I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for it\ntomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You\nknow my principles\xe2\x80\x94everything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in\nyour presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d The old prince snorted. \xe2\x80\x9cLet her marry, it\xe2\x80\x99s all the\nsame to me!\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting\nfrom his son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you frankly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Vas\xc3\xadli in the tone of\na crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so\nkeen-sighted a companion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, you see right through people.\nAnatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent\nson or kinsman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time\nwithout male society, on Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s appearance all the three women of\nPrince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s household felt that their life had not been real\ntill then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately\nincreased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in\ndarkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.\n\nPrincess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The\nhandsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed\nall her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and\nmagnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams of a future\nfamily life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them away and\ntried to conceal them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut am I not too cold with him?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the princess. \xe2\x80\x9cI try\nto be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him\nalready, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine\nthat I do not like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new\nguest. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor girl, she\xe2\x80\x99s devilish ugly!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Anatole.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s\narrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman\nwithout any definite position, without relations or even a country, did\nnot intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, to reading\naloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle\nBourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to\nappreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed,\nungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her\noff; and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew\na story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she\nliked to repeat to herself. It was the story of a girl who had been\nseduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre m\xc3\xa8re) appeared, and\nreproached her for yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle\nBourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this\nstory to him, her seducer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had\nappeared. He would carry her away and then sa pauvre m\xc3\xa8re would appear\nand he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle\nBourienne\xe2\x80\x99s head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about\nParis. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a\nmoment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar\nto her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around\nhim and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.\n\nThe little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,\nunconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the\nfamiliar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any\nstruggle, but with na\xc3\xafve and lighthearted gaiety.\n\nAlthough in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man\ntired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the\nspectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was\nbeginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne\nthat passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great\nsuddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.\n\nAfter tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was\nasked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits,\ncame and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle\nBourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion.\nHer favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and\nthe look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But\nAnatole\xe2\x80\x99s expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not\nto her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s little\nfoot, which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord.\nMademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her\nlovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new\nto the princess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow she loves me!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHow happy I am now,\nand how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband?\nCan it be possible?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, not daring to look at his face, but\nstill feeling his eyes gazing at her.\n\nIn the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole\nkissed Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s hand. She did not know how she found the\ncourage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near\nto her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and\nkissed Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s hand. (This was not etiquette, but\nthen he did everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle\nBourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat delicacy!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the princess. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that\nAm\xc3\xa9lie\xe2\x80\x9d (Mademoiselle Bourienne) \xe2\x80\x9cthinks I could be jealous of her,\nand not value her pure affection and devotion to me?\xe2\x80\x9d She went up\nto her and kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little\nprincess\xe2\x80\x99 hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving\nwell I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. And\nsmilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThey all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he\ngot into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind\xe2\x80\x94yes,\nkind, that is the chief thing,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary; and fear, which\nshe had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it\nseemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the\ndark corner. And this someone was he\xe2\x80\x94the devil\xe2\x80\x94and he was also this\nman with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.\n\nShe rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long\ntime that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now\nworking herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre m\xc3\xa8re\nrebuking her for her fall.\n\nThe little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made.\nShe could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was\nawkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than\never because Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s presence had vividly recalled to her the time\nwhen she was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She\nsat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy\nand disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third\ntime, muttering to herself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you it was all lumps and holes!\xe2\x80\x9d the little princess\nrepeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not my\nfault!\xe2\x80\x9d and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.\n\nThe old prince did not sleep either. T\xc3\xadkhon, half asleep, heard him\npacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he\nhad been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed\nbecause it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he\nloved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider\nthe whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but\ninstead of that he only excited himself more and more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first man that turns up\xe2\x80\x94she forgets her father and everything\nelse, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike\nherself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice\nit. Fr... fr... fr! And don\xe2\x80\x99t I see that that idiot had eyes only for\nBourienne\xe2\x80\x94I shall have to get rid of her. And how is it she has not\npride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at\nleast have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks\nnothing of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll let her see....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a\nmistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nPrincess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to\nbe parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this\nthought, he called T\xc3\xadkhon and began to undress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat devil brought them here?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, while T\xc3\xadkhon was\nputting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never invited them. They came to disturb my life\xe2\x80\x94and there is not\nmuch of it left.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil take \xe2\x80\x98em!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, while his head was still covered by\nthe shirt.\n\nT\xc3\xadkhon knew his master\xe2\x80\x99s habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and\ntherefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of\nthe face that emerged from the shirt.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the prince.\n\nT\xc3\xadkhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli and his son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo good... no good...\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his\nfeet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing\ngown, he went to the couch on which he slept.\n\nThough no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nthey quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance,\nup to the appearance of the pauvre m\xc3\xa8re; they understood that they had\nmuch to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an\nopportunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary\nwent to her father\xe2\x80\x99s room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne\nand Anatole met in the conservatory.\n\nPrincess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation.\nIt seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be\ndecided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She\nread this in T\xc3\xadkhon\xe2\x80\x99s face and in that of Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s valet,\nwho made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot\nwater.\n\nThe old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of\nhis daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking\nexpression of her father\xe2\x80\x99s. His face wore that expression when his\ndry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in\narithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her,\nrepeating in a low voice the same words several times over.\n\nHe came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had a proposition made me concerning you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with an\nunnatural smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect you have guessed that Prince Vas\xc3\xadli has\nnot come and brought his pupil with him\xe2\x80\x9d (for some reason Prince\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski referred to Anatole as a \xe2\x80\x9cpupil\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cfor the sake of my\nbeautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account\nand, as you know my principles, I refer it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to understand you, mon p\xc3\xa8re?\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess, growing\npale and then blushing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow understand me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried her father angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cPrince Vas\xc3\xadli\nfinds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you\non his pupil\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s to be understood! \xe2\x80\x98How\nunderstand it\xe2\x80\x99!... And I ask you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what you think, Father,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the princess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to\nget married. What about you? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval,\nbut at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be\ndecided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze\nunder which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to\nsubmit from habit, and she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish only to do your will, but if\nI had to express my own desire...\xe2\x80\x9d She had no time to finish. The old\nprince interrupted her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s admirable!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will take you with your\ndowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. She\xe2\x80\x99ll be the\nwife, while you...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on his\ndaughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, now then, I\xe2\x80\x99m only joking!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember this,\nPrincess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to\nchoose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your life\xe2\x80\x99s happiness\ndepends on your decision. Never mind me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do not know, Father!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you\nor anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it\nover, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no.\nI know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had better\nthink it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!\xe2\x80\x9d he still shouted\nwhen the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the\nstudy.\n\nHer fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said\nabout Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but\nstill it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was\ngoing straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing\nanything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle\nBourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw\nAnatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. With\na horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess\nMary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle\nBourienne who had not yet seen her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that? Why? Wait a moment!\xe2\x80\x9d Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s face seemed to say.\nPrincess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At\nlast Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to\nPrincess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at\nthis strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door\nthat led to his own apartments.\n\nAn hour later, T\xc3\xadkhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince;\nhe added that Prince Vas\xc3\xadli was also there. When T\xc3\xadkhon came to her\nPrincess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping\nMademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair. The\nprincess\xe2\x80\x99 beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were\nlooking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s\npretty face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!\xe2\x80\x9d said\nMademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? I love you more than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will\ntry to do all I can for your happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so\ncarried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and went\nout.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox\nin his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face,\nas if stirred to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s core and himself regretting and laughing\nat his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took a\npinch of snuff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d he began, rising and taking her by both\nhands. Then, sighing, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cMy son\xe2\x80\x99s fate is in your hands.\nDecide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a\ndaughter!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFr... fr...\xe2\x80\x9d snorted Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. \xe2\x80\x9cThe prince is making a\nproposition to you in his pupil\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94I mean, his son\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94name. Do you\nwish or not to be Prince Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s wife? Reply: yes or no,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cand then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion\nalso. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d added Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski,\nturning to Prince Vas\xc3\xadli and answering his imploring look. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, or\nno?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my\nlife from yours. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to marry,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered positively,\nglancing at Prince Vas\xc3\xadli and at her father with her beautiful eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski,\nfrowning and taking his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand; he did not kiss her, but only\nbending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so\nthat she winced and uttered a cry.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli rose.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never\nforget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching\nthis heart, so kind and generous? Say \xe2\x80\x98perhaps\xe2\x80\x99... The future is so\nlong. Say \xe2\x80\x98perhaps.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for\nthe honor, but I shall never be your son\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, so that\xe2\x80\x99s finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have\nseen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe old prince. \xe2\x80\x9cVery, very glad to have seen you,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated he,\nembracing Prince Vas\xc3\xadli.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy vocation is a different one,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\nvocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness\nof love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange\npoor Am\xc3\xa9lie\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so\npassionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between\nthem. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my\nfather and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so\nunfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how passionately\nshe must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might\nhave done the same!...\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIt was long since the Rost\xc3\xb3vs had news of Nicholas. Not till midwinter\nwas the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son\xe2\x80\x99s\nhandwriting. On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and\nhaste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read the\nletter.\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the house,\non hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and\nfound the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same\ntime.\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still\nliving with the Rost\xc3\xb3vs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared\nto sympathize in any way.\n\nThe count sobbed yet more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNik\xc3\xb3lenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling\nboy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How\ntell the little countess!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped\nthe tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried her\nown eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and till\nteatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with God\xe2\x80\x99s\nhelp, would inform her.\n\nAt dinner Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna talked the whole time about the war news\nand about Nik\xc3\xb3lenka, twice asked when the last letter had been received\nfrom him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might\nvery likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each time that these\nhints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at\nthe count and at Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, the latter very adroitly turned\nthe conversation to insignificant matters. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who, of the whole\nfamily, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of\nintonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning\nof the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her\nfather and Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, that it had something to do with her\nbrother, and that Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as\nshe was, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything\nrelating to Nik\xc3\xb3lenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner,\nbut she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her\nchair regardless of her governess\xe2\x80\x99 remarks. After dinner, she rushed\nheadlong after Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on\nher neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAuntie, darling, do tell me what it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won\xe2\x80\x99t give up\xe2\x80\x94I know you know\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna shook her head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a little slyboots,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter from Nik\xc3\xb3lenka! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\nreading confirmation in Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your\nmamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, I will, only tell me! You won\xe2\x80\x99t? Then I will go and tell at\nonce.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the letter,\non condition that she should tell no one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, on my true word of honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, crossing herself,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone!\xe2\x80\x9d and she ran off at once to S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNik\xc3\xb3lenka... wounded... a letter,\xe2\x80\x9d she announced in gleeful\ntriumph.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas!\xe2\x80\x9d was all S\xc3\xb3nya said, instantly turning white.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, seeing the impression the news of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s wound\nproduced on S\xc3\xb3nya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the\nnews.\n\nShe rushed to S\xc3\xb3nya, hugged her, and began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he\nwrote himself,\xe2\x80\x9d said she through her tears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now! It\xe2\x80\x99s true that all you women are crybabies,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\nP\xc3\xa9tya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99m very\nglad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so.\nYou are all blubberers and understand nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha smiled through her tears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but she said that it was all over and that he\xe2\x80\x99s now an\nofficer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya, crossing herself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps she\ndeceived you. Let us go to Mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya paced the room in silence for a time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99d been in Nik\xc3\xb3lenka\xe2\x80\x99s place I would have killed even more\nof those Frenchmen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat nasty brutes they are! I\xe2\x80\x99d\nhave killed so many that there\xe2\x80\x99d have been a heap of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, P\xc3\xa9tya, what a goose you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nP\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember him?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha suddenly asked, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\nsilence.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I remember Nicholas?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, S\xc3\xb3nya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly,\nremember everything?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, with an expressive gesture,\nevidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nremember Nik\xc3\xb3lenka too, I remember him well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t remember Bor\xc3\xads. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember him a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You don\xe2\x80\x99t remember Bor\xc3\xads?\xe2\x80\x9d asked S\xc3\xb3nya in surprise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember\xe2\x80\x94I know what he is like, but not\nas I remember Nik\xc3\xb3lenka. Him\xe2\x80\x94I just shut my eyes and remember,\nbut Bor\xc3\xads... No!\xe2\x80\x9d (She shut her eyes.) \xe2\x80\x9cNo! there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing at\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Nat\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at\nher friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant\nto say and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking\nwas out of the question, \xe2\x80\x9cI am in love with your brother once for all\nand, whatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him\nas long as I live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked at S\xc3\xb3nya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and said\nnothing. She felt that S\xc3\xb3nya was speaking the truth, that there was\nsuch love as S\xc3\xb3nya was speaking of. But Nat\xc3\xa1sha had not yet felt\nanything like it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you write to him?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya became thoughtful. The question of how to write to Nicholas, and\nwhether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already an\nofficer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself\nand, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on\nhimself?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I think if he writes, I will write too,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\nblushing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you won\xe2\x80\x99t feel ashamed to write to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I should be ashamed to write to Bor\xc3\xads. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you be ashamed?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s awkward and would make me ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I know why she\xe2\x80\x99d be ashamed,\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya, offended by\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s previous remark. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because she was in love with\nthat fat one in spectacles\xe2\x80\x9d (that was how P\xc3\xa9tya described his\nnamesake, the new Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov) \xe2\x80\x9cand now she\xe2\x80\x99s in love with that\nsinger\xe2\x80\x9d (he meant Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s Italian singing master), \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhy she\xe2\x80\x99s ashamed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cP\xc3\xa9tya, you\xe2\x80\x99re stupid!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot more stupid than you, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nine-year-old P\xc3\xa9tya,\nwith the air of an old brigadier.\n\nThe countess had been prepared by Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s hints at dinner.\nOn retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a\nminiature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears\nkept coming into her eyes. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, with the letter, came on\ntiptoe to the countess\xe2\x80\x99 door and paused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t come in,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the old count who was following her.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome later.\xe2\x80\x9d And she went in, closing the door behind her.\n\nThe count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.\n\nAt first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence,\nthen both voices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps.\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna opened the door. Her face wore the proud expression\nof a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the\npublic to appreciate his skill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is done!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the\ncountess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and\nin the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.\n\nWhen she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his\nbald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait,\nand in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away\nthe bald head. V\xc3\xa9ra, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, S\xc3\xb3nya, and P\xc3\xa9tya now entered the room,\nand the reading of the letter began. After a brief description of\nthe campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part, and his\npromotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his father\xe2\x80\x99s and mother\xe2\x80\x99s\nhands asking for their blessing, and that he kissed V\xc3\xa9ra, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and\nP\xc3\xa9tya. Besides that, he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame\nSchoss, and his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for him \xe2\x80\x9cdear\nS\xc3\xb3nya, whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d When she\nheard this S\xc3\xb3nya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and, unable\nto bear the looks turned upon her, ran away into the dancing hall,\nwhirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon,\nand, flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor. The countess was\ncrying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you crying, Mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d asked V\xc3\xa9ra. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom all he says one\nshould be glad and not cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha looked\nat her reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is it she takes after?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the\ncountess.\n\nNicholas\xe2\x80\x99 letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were\nconsidered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she\ndid not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses, and\nDm\xc3\xadtri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter\neach time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh\nproofs of Nik\xc3\xb3lenka\xe2\x80\x99s virtues. How strange, how extraordinary, how\njoyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose\ntiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom\nshe used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who\nhad first learned to say \xe2\x80\x9cpear\xe2\x80\x9d and then \xe2\x80\x9cgranny,\xe2\x80\x9d that this son\nshould now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly\nwarrior doing some kind of man\xe2\x80\x99s work of his own, without help or\nguidance. The universal experience of ages, showing that children do\ngrow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist for the\ncountess. Her son\xe2\x80\x99s growth toward manhood, at each of its stages,\nhad seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the\nmillions of human beings who grew up in the same way. As twenty\nyears before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived\nsomewhere under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to\nspeak, so now she could not believe that that little creature could be\nthis strong, brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this\nletter, he now was.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a style! How charmingly he describes!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, reading the\ndescriptive part of the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a soul! Not a word about\nhimself.... Not a word! About some Den\xc3\xadsov or other, though he himself,\nI dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing about his\nsufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered\neverybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was only so\nhigh\xe2\x80\x94I always said....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of\nletters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out,\nwhile under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the\ncount, money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment\nof the newly commissioned officer were collected. Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna,\npractical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army\nauthorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself\nand her son. She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand\nDuke Constantine P\xc3\xa1vlovich, who commanded the Guards. The Rost\xc3\xb3vs\nsupposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address,\nand that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards\nthere was no reason why it should not reach the P\xc3\xa1vlograd regiment,\nwhich was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood. And so it was\ndecided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke\xe2\x80\x99s courier to\nBor\xc3\xads and Bor\xc3\xads was to forward them to Nicholas. The letters were from\nthe old count, the countess, P\xc3\xa9tya, V\xc3\xa9ra, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and S\xc3\xb3nya, and\nfinally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other\nthings the old count sent to his son.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOn the twelfth of November, Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s active army, in camp before\nOlm\xc3\xbctz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors\xe2\x80\x94the\nRussian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent\nthe night ten miles from Olm\xc3\xbctz and next morning were to come straight\nto the review, reaching the field at Olm\xc3\xbctz by ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\n\nThat day Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v received a letter from Bor\xc3\xads, telling him\nthat the Ism\xc3\xa1ylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from\nOlm\xc3\xbctz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for\nhim. Rost\xc3\xb3v was particularly in need of money now that the troops,\nafter their active service, were stationed near Olm\xc3\xbctz and the camp\nswarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering\nall sorts of tempting wares. The P\xc3\xa1vlograds held feast after feast,\ncelebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made\nexpeditions to Olm\xc3\xbctz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian,\nwho had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses.\nRost\xc3\xb3v, who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and\nthe sutlers. On receiving Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 letter he rode with a fellow officer\nto Olm\xc3\xbctz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone\nto the Guards\xe2\x80\x99 camp to find his old playmate. Rost\xc3\xb3v had not yet had\ntime to get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with\na soldier\xe2\x80\x99s cross, equally shabby cadet\xe2\x80\x99s riding breeches lined with\nworn leather, and an officer\xe2\x80\x99s saber with a sword knot. The Don horse\nhe was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign,\nand he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his\nhead. As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Bor\xc3\xads\nand all his comrades of the Guards by his appearance\xe2\x80\x94that of a\nfighting hussar who had been under fire.\n\nThe Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading\ntheir cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy stages, their\nknapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided\nexcellent dinners for the officers at every halting place. The regiments\nhad entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand\nDuke\xe2\x80\x99s orders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on\nwhich the Guards prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their\nproper posts. Bor\xc3\xads had been quartered, and had marched all the\nway, with Berg who was already in command of a company. Berg, who had\nobtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of\nhis superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money\nmatters very satisfactorily. Bor\xc3\xads, during the campaign, had made the\nacquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by\na letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become\nacquainted with Prince Andrew Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, through whom he hoped to\nobtain a post on the commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s staff. Berg and Bor\xc3\xads,\nhaving rested after yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s march, were sitting, clean and neatly\ndressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them,\nplaying chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees. Bor\xc3\xads, in\nthe accurate way characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of\nchessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting Berg\xe2\x80\x99s move,\nand watched his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s face, evidently thinking about the game as\nhe always thought only of whatever he was engaged on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how are you going to get out of that?\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll try to,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing\nhis hand.\n\nAt that moment the door opened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is at last!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Berg too! Oh, you\npetisenfans, allay cushay dormir!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, imitating his Russian\nnurse\xe2\x80\x99s French, at which he and Bor\xc3\xads used to laugh long ago.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, how you have changed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads rose to meet Rost\xc3\xb3v, but in doing so did not omit to steady and\nreplace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his\nfriend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth,\nthat dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner\ndifferent from that of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas\nwished to do something special on meeting his friend. He wanted to pinch\nhim, push him, do anything but kiss him\xe2\x80\x94a thing everybody did. But\nnotwithstanding this, Bor\xc3\xads embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and\nkissed him three times.\n\nThey had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young\nmen take their first steps on life\xe2\x80\x99s road, each saw immense changes in\nthe other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken\nthose first steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both\nwere in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if you\xe2\x80\x99d been to a fete,\nnot like us sinners of the line,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rost\xc3\xb3v, with martial swagger\nand with baritone notes in his voice, new to Bor\xc3\xads, pointing to his own\nmud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s loud\nvoice, popped her head in at the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, is she pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with a wink.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you shout so? You\xe2\x80\x99ll frighten them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads. \xe2\x80\x9cI did\nnot expect you today,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI only sent you the note yesterday\nby Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x94an adjutant of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s, who\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of mine.\nI did not think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you?\nBeen under fire already?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bor\xc3\xads.\n\nWithout answering, Rost\xc3\xb3v shook the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s Cross of St. George\nfastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm,\nglanced at Berg with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? Yes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we too have\nhad a splendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness\nrode with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and\nevery advantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and\nballs! I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. And the Tsar\xc3\xa9vich was very gracious to all\nour officers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of his\nhussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the pleasures\nand advantages of service under members of the Imperial family.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you Guards!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, send for some wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads made a grimace.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you really want it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nHe went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent\nfor wine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I have some money and a letter to give you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both\narms on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he\nglanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the\nletter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they\xe2\x80\x99ve sent you a tidy sum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg, eying the heavy\npurse that sank into the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for us, Count, we get along on our\npay. I can tell you for myself...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Berg, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you get a\nletter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk\neverything over with, and I happen to be there, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go at once, to\nbe out of your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nexclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking\namiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his\nwords, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak\nfrom my heart as to an old acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it, Count! I quite understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg,\ngetting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo across to our hosts: they invited you,\xe2\x80\x9d added Bor\xc3\xads.\n\nBerg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust,\nstood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples\nupwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having\nassured himself from the way Rost\xc3\xb3v looked at it that his coat had been\nnoticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, what a beast I am!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Rost\xc3\xb3v, as he read the\nletter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them\nsuch a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, flushing suddenly.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right let\xe2\x80\x99s have\nsome!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation\nto Bagrati\xc3\xb3n which the old countess at Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s advice had\nobtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take\nit to its destination and make use of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense! Much I need it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, throwing the letter\nunder the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you thrown that away?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bor\xc3\xads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it\nfor!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy \xe2\x80\x98What the devil\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads, picking it up and reading\nthe address. \xe2\x80\x9cThis letter would be of great use to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want nothing, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t be anyone\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Bor\xc3\xads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lackey\xe2\x80\x99s job!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are still the same dreamer, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Bor\xc3\xads, shaking\nhis head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re still the same diplomatist! But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the\npoint... Come, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as you see. So far everything\xe2\x80\x99s all right, but I confess I\nshould much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause when once a man starts on military service, he should try to\nmake as successful a career of it as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, evidently thinking of something\nelse.\n\nHe looked intently and inquiringly into his friend\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, evidently\ntrying in vain to find the answer to some question.\n\nOld Gabriel brought in the wine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we now send for Berg?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bor\xc3\xads. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would drink\nwith you. I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?\xe2\x80\x9d\nasked Rost\xc3\xb3v, with a contemptuous smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\nBor\xc3\xads.\n\nAgain Rost\xc3\xb3v looked intently into Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 eyes and sighed. Berg\nreturned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three\nofficers became animated. The Guardsmen told Rost\xc3\xb3v of their march and\nhow they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke\nof the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told\nstories of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent\nwhen the subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the\nstories of the Grand Duke\xe2\x80\x99s quick temper he related with gusto how in\nGalicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter\nmade a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of\na movement. With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke\nhad ridden up to him in a violent passion, shouting: \xe2\x80\x9cArnauts!\xe2\x80\x9d\n(\xe2\x80\x9cArnauts\xe2\x80\x9d was the Tsar\xc3\xa9vich\xe2\x80\x99s favorite expression when he was in\na rage) and called for the company commander.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew\nI was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army\nOrders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s\nPrayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and\nso my conscience was at ease. I came forward....\xe2\x80\x9d (Berg stood up and\nshowed how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really\nit would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and\nself-complacency than his did.) \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he stormed at me, as the saying\nis, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but\nrather of death, as the saying is. \xe2\x80\x98Albanians!\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98devils!\xe2\x80\x99\nand \xe2\x80\x98To Siberia!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg with a sagacious smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew I\nwas in the right so I kept silent; was not that best, Count?... \xe2\x80\x98Hey,\nare you dumb?\xe2\x80\x99 he shouted. Still I remained silent. And what do you\nthink, Count? The next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of\nthe Day. That\xe2\x80\x99s what keeping one\xe2\x80\x99s head means. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way,\nCount,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that was fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, smiling.\n\nBut Bor\xc3\xads noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and\nskillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where\nhe got his wound. This pleased Rost\xc3\xb3v and he began talking about it,\nand as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his\nSch\xc3\xb6n Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle\ngenerally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been,\nas they have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not\nat all as it really was. Rost\xc3\xb3v was a truthful young man and would on\nno account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story meaning to\ntell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily,\nand inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his\nhearers\xe2\x80\x94who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had\nformed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear\njust such a story\xe2\x80\x94they would either not have believed him or, still\nworse, would have thought that Rost\xc3\xb3v was himself to blame since what\ngenerally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened\nto him. He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and\nthat he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as\nhe could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as\nit really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of\nwill to tell only what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth,\nand young people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story\nof how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like\na storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his\nsaber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he\ntold them all that.\n\nIn the middle of his story, just as he was saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot imagine\nwhat a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince\nAndrew, whom Bor\xc3\xads was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who\nliked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance\nand being well disposed toward Bor\xc3\xads, who had managed to please him the\nday before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent\nwith papers from Kut\xc3\xbazov to the Tsar\xc3\xa9vich, he looked in on Bor\xc3\xads,\nhoping to find him alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line\nrecounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure\nthat sort of man), he gave Bor\xc3\xads a pleasant smile, frowned as with\nhalf-closed eyes he looked at Rost\xc3\xb3v, bowed slightly and wearily, and\nsat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped\nin on bad company. Rost\xc3\xb3v flushed up on noticing this, but he did not\ncare, this was a mere stranger. Glancing, however, at Bor\xc3\xads, he saw\nthat he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.\n\nIn spite of Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of\nthe contempt with which Rost\xc3\xb3v, from his fighting army point of view,\nregarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer\nwas evidently one, Rost\xc3\xb3v felt confused, blushed, and became silent.\nBor\xc3\xads inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without\nindiscretion, one might ask about our plans.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall probably advance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, evidently reluctant\nto say more in the presence of a stranger.\n\nBerg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was\nrumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be\ndoubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could\ngive no opinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed\ngaily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to your business,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew continued, addressing Bor\xc3\xads,\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe will talk of it later\xe2\x80\x9d (and he looked round at Rost\xc3\xb3v). \xe2\x80\x9cCome\nto me after the review and we will do what is possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nwhose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to\nanger he did not condescend to notice, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cI think you were\ntalking of the Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern affair? Were you there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v angrily, as if intending to insult the\naide-de-camp.\n\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski noticed the hussar\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind, and it amused him. With\na slightly contemptuous smile, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, there are many stories\nnow told about that affair!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, stories!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Rost\xc3\xb3v loudly, looking with eyes suddenly\ngrown furious, now at Bor\xc3\xads, now at Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, many stories!\nBut our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\nfire! Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those\nfellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf whom you imagine me to be one?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, with a quiet\nand particularly amiable smile.\n\nA strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man\xe2\x80\x99s\nself-possession mingled at that moment in Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s soul.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not talking about you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know you and,\nfrankly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to. I am speaking of the staff in general.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will tell you this,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of\nquiet authority, \xe2\x80\x9cyou wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with\nyou that it would be very easy to do so if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t sufficient\nself-respect, but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen.\nIn a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more\nserious duel, and besides, Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y, who says he is an old friend\nof yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to\ndisplease you. However,\xe2\x80\x9d he added rising, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know my name and\nwhere to find me, but don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that I do not regard either myself\nor you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my\nadvice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday after the review\nI shall expect you, Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y. Au revoir!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Prince Andrew,\nand with a bow to them both he went out.\n\nOnly when Prince Andrew was gone did Rost\xc3\xb3v think of what he ought to\nhave said. And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it. He\nordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Bor\xc3\xads, rode\nhome. Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected\nadjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question that worried\nhim all the way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at\nseeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by\nhis pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew\nthere was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very\nadjutant whom he so hated.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe day after Rost\xc3\xb3v had been to see Bor\xc3\xads, a review was held of the\nAustrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from Russia and\nthose who had been campaigning under Kut\xc3\xbazov. The two Emperors,\nthe Russian with his heir the Tsar\xc3\xa9vich, and the Austrian with the\nArchduke, inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.\n\nFrom early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up\non the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets\nmoved and halted at the officers\xe2\x80\x99 command, turned with banners flying,\nformed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of\ninfantry in different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of\nhoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided\nuniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan,\nor gray horses; then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the\npolished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with\nthe smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the\ninfantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position. Not only the\ngenerals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn\nin to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and\nwearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded\nofficers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and\nhis weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed\ntill its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay\nsmooth\xe2\x80\x94felt that no small matter was happening, but an important and\nsolemn affair. Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own\ninsignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and\nyet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that\nenormous whole.\n\nFrom early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten\no\xe2\x80\x99clock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were drawn\nup on the vast field. The whole army was extended in three lines: the\ncavalry in front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the\ninfantry.\n\nA space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The\nthree parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s\nfighting army (with the P\xc3\xa1vlograds on the right flank of the front);\nthose recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the\nline; and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the same lines,\nunder one command, and in a like order.\n\nLike wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re coming!\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re coming!\xe2\x80\x9d Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final\npreparation swept over all the troops.\n\nFrom the direction of Olm\xc3\xbctz in front of them, a group was seen\napproaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust\nof wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the\nlances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It\nlooked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its\njoy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was heard shouting:\n\xe2\x80\x9cEyes front!\xe2\x80\x9d Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was\nrepeated by others from various sides and all became silent.\n\nIn the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. This\nwas the Emperors\xe2\x80\x99 suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the\ntrumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march. It\nseemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army\nitself, rejoicing at the Emperors\xe2\x80\x99 approach, had naturally burst into\nmusic. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor\nAlexander was clearly heard. He gave the words of greeting, and the\nfirst regiment roared \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d so deafeningly, continuously, and\njoyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the\nimmensity of the power they constituted.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, standing in the front lines of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s army which the Tsar\napproached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in\nthat army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of\nmight, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this\ntriumph.\n\nHe felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he\nhimself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water,\ncommit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could\nnot but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d thundered from all sides, one regiment\nafter another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d... Then the general march, and again \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\ngrowing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.\n\nTill the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility\nseemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive,\nits thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had\nalready passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices,\namid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to\nstone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but\nsymmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two men\xe2\x80\x94the\nEmperors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that\nwhole mass of men was concentrated.\n\nThe handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse\nGuards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his\npleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone\xe2\x80\x99s\nattention.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had\nrecognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty\npaces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his\nhandsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness\nand ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every\nmovement of the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s seemed to him enchanting.\n\nStopping in front of the P\xc3\xa1vlograds, the Tsar said something in French\nto the Austrian Emperor and smiled.\n\nSeeing that smile, Rost\xc3\xb3v involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still\nstronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in\nsome way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar\ncalled the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cI should die of happiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tsar addressed the officers also: \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you all, gentlemen, I\nthank you with my whole heart.\xe2\x80\x9d To Rost\xc3\xb3v every word sounded like a\nvoice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have earned the St. George\xe2\x80\x99s standards and will be worthy of\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, to die, to die for him,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nThe Tsar said something more which Rost\xc3\xb3v did not hear, and the\nsoldiers, straining their lungs, shouted \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v too, bending over his saddle, shouted \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d with all his\nmight, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if\nonly to express his rapture fully.\n\nThe Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can the Emperor be undecided?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v, but then even\nthis indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything\nelse the Tsar did.\n\nThat hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s foot, in the narrow\npointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay\nmare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he\nmoved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp.\nFarther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at\nlast only his white plumes were visible to Rost\xc3\xb3v from amid the suites\nthat surrounded the Emperors.\n\nAmong the gentlemen of the suite, Rost\xc3\xb3v noticed Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, sitting\nhis horse indolently and carelessly. Rost\xc3\xb3v recalled their quarrel of\nyesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought\nnot to challenge Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not!\xe2\x80\x9d he now thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\nit worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such\nlove, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels\nand affronts matter? I love and forgive everybody now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began\na ceremonial march past him, and Rost\xc3\xb3v on Bedouin, recently purchased\nfrom Den\xc3\xadsov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadron\xe2\x80\x94that is,\nalone and in full view of the Emperor.\n\nBefore he reached him, Rost\xc3\xb3v, who was a splendid horseman, spurred\nBedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the\nanimal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his\ntail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s eye\nupon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful\naction, as if flying through the air without touching the ground.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling\nhimself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but\nblissful face \xe2\x80\x9clike a vewy devil,\xe2\x80\x9d as Den\xc3\xadsov expressed it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine fellows, the P\xc3\xa1vlograds!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Emperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire\nthis instant!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nWhen the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards,\nabout the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about\nBonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if the\nEssen corps arrived and Prussia took our side.\n\nBut the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His\nevery word and movement was described with ecstasy.\n\nThey all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the\nenemy under the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s command. Commanded by the Emperor himself\nthey could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so thought\nRost\xc3\xb3v and most of the officers after the review.\n\nAll were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles\nwould have made them.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe day after the review, Bor\xc3\xads, in his best uniform and with his\ncomrade Berg\xe2\x80\x99s best wishes for success, rode to Olm\xc3\xbctz to see\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself\nthe best post he could\xe2\x80\x94preferably that of adjutant to some important\npersonage, a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all very well for Rost\xc3\xb3v, whose father sends him ten thousand\nrubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not\nbe anyone\xe2\x80\x99s lackey, but I who have nothing but my brains have to\nmake a career and must not miss opportunities, but must avail myself of\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected.\n\nHe did not find Prince Andrew in Olm\xc3\xbctz that day, but the appearance of\nthe town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed\nand the two Emperors were living with their suites, households, and\ncourts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world.\n\nHe knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman\xe2\x80\x99s uniform, all these\nexalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages\nwith their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military\nmen, seemed so immeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the\nGuards, that they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be\naware of his existence. At the quarters of the commander in chief,\nKut\xc3\xbazov, where he inquired for Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, all the adjutants and even\nthe orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a\ngreat many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody\nwas heartily sick of them. In spite of this, or rather because of\nit, next day, November 15, after dinner he again went to Olm\xc3\xbctz and,\nentering the house occupied by Kut\xc3\xbazov, asked for Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. Prince\nAndrew was in and Bor\xc3\xads was shown into a large hall probably formerly\nused for dancing, but in which five beds now stood, and furniture of\nvarious kinds: a table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest\nthe door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing.\nAnother, the red, stout Nesv\xc3\xadtski, lay on a bed with his arms under his\nhead, laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was\nplaying a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on\nthe clavichord, sang the tune. Bolk\xc3\xb3nski was not there. None of these\ngentlemen changed his position on seeing Bor\xc3\xads. The one who was writing\nand whom Bor\xc3\xads addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\nwas on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the\nreception room if he wished to see him. Bor\xc3\xads thanked him and went to\nthe reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.\n\nWhen he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with\nthat peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nit were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment\xe2\x80\x9d), was\nlistening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very\nerect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s obsequious expression on his\npurple face, reporting something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, be so good as to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew to the\ngeneral, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected\nwhen he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Bor\xc3\xads, Prince\nAndrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring\nhim to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful\nsmile.\n\nAt that moment Bor\xc3\xads clearly realized what he had before surmised, that\nin the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the\nmilitary code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was\nanother, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced,\npurple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for\nhis own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y. More than\never was Bor\xc3\xads resolved to serve in future not according to the written\ncode, but under this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having\nbeen recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general\nwho at the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the\nGuards. Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing about\nwith Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions.\nWhen Germans start being accurate, there\xe2\x80\x99s no end to it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to\nas something generally known. But it was the first time he had heard\nWeyrother\xe2\x80\x99s name, or even the term \xe2\x80\x9cdispositions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have\nbeen thinking about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was thinking\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for some reason Bor\xc3\xads could not help\nblushing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cof asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from\nPrince Kur\xc3\xa1gin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be in action,\xe2\x80\x9d he added as if in apology.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right. We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk it over,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly let me report this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s business, and I shall be at\nyour disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x94evidently not sharing Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 conception of the advantages\nof the unwritten code of subordination\xe2\x80\x94looked so fixedly at the\npresumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to\nsay to the adjutant that Bor\xc3\xads felt uncomfortable. He turned away and\nwaited impatiently for Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s return from the commander in\nchief\xe2\x80\x99s room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the\nclavichord was. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no use your going to the commander in chief.\nHe would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinner\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cThat\nwould not be bad as regards the unwritten code,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Bor\xc3\xads),\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of\nus aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do: I have\na good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince\nDolgor\xc3\xbakov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now\nKut\xc3\xbazov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything is\nnow centered round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgor\xc3\xbakov; I have to\ngo there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We shall\nsee whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you\nsomewhere nearer the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young\nman and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining help\nof this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for\nhimself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and\nwhich attracted him. He very readily took up Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 cause and went\nwith him to Dolgor\xc3\xbakov.\n\nIt was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olm\xc3\xbctz\noccupied by the Emperors and their retinues.\n\nThat same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of\nthe Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that council, contrary\nto the views of the old generals Kut\xc3\xbazov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it\nhad been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte.\nThe council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied\nby Bor\xc3\xads arrived at the palace to find Dolgor\xc3\xbakov. Everyone at\nheadquarters was still under the spell of the day\xe2\x80\x99s council, at which\nthe party of the young had triumphed. The voices of those who counseled\ndelay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been\nso completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive\nevidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed\nat the council\xe2\x80\x94the coming battle and the victory that would certainly\nresult from it\xe2\x80\x94no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past.\nAll the advantages were on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly\nsuperior to Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s, were concentrated in one place, the troops\ninspired by the Emperors\xe2\x80\x99 presence were eager for action. The\nstrategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in\nall its details to the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident had\nordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the\nvery fields where the French had now to be fought; the adjacent\nlocality was known and shown in every detail on the maps, and Bonaparte,\nevidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.\n\nDolgor\xc3\xbakov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just\nreturned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud\nof the victory that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his\nprot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, but Prince Dolgor\xc3\xbakov politely and firmly pressing his hand\nsaid nothing to Bor\xc3\xads and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts\nwhich were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew\nin French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that\nthe one that will result from it will be as victorious! However, dear\nfellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said abruptly and eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cI must confess to having\nbeen unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother. What\nexactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what\nforesight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the smallest\ndetail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones\ncould have been devised. This combination of Austrian precision with\nRussian valor\xe2\x80\x94what more could be wished for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the attack is definitely resolved on?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has\ndecidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him\ntoday for the Emperor.\xe2\x80\x9d Dolgor\xc3\xbakov smiled significantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so? And what did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain time.\nI tell you he is in our hands, that\xe2\x80\x99s certain! But what was most\namusing,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cwas that\nwe could not think how to address the reply! If not as \xe2\x80\x98Consul\xe2\x80\x99\nand of course not as \xe2\x80\x98Emperor,\xe2\x80\x99 it seemed to me it should be to\n\xe2\x80\x98General Bonaparte.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General\nBonaparte, there is a difference,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just it,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Dolgor\xc3\xbakov quickly, laughing.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know Bil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s a very clever fellow. He suggested\naddressing him as \xe2\x80\x98Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDolgor\xc3\xbakov laughed merrily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, it was Bil\xc3\xadbin who found a suitable form for the\naddress. He is a wise and clever fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvernement\nfran\xc3\xa7ais,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolgor\xc3\xbakov, with grave satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cGood,\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he will dislike it extremely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he\xe2\x80\x99s dined with him\xe2\x80\x94the\npresent Emperor\xe2\x80\x94more than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a\nmore cunning or subtle diplomatist\xe2\x80\x94you know, a combination of French\nadroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and\nCount Mark\xc3\xb3v? Count Mark\xc3\xb3v was the only man who knew how to handle\nhim. You know the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the talkative Dolgor\xc3\xbakov, turning now to Bor\xc3\xads, now to Prince\nAndrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test Mark\xc3\xb3v, our ambassador,\npurposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking\nat Mark\xc3\xb3v, probably expecting Mark\xc3\xb3v to pick it up for him, and how\nMark\xc3\xb3v immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without\ntouching Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDelightful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have come to you, Prince,\nas a petitioner on behalf of this young man. You see...\xe2\x80\x9d but\nbefore Prince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon\nDolgor\xc3\xbakov to the Emperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a nuisance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolgor\xc3\xbakov, getting up hurriedly and\npressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Bor\xc3\xads. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I should\nbe very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of\ngood-natured, sincere, and animated levity. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you see... another\ntime!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers\nas he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious that here\nhe was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous\nmovements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny,\nobedient, and insignificant atom. They followed Prince Dolgor\xc3\xbakov out\ninto the corridor and met\xe2\x80\x94coming out of the door of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nroom by which Dolgor\xc3\xbakov had entered\xe2\x80\x94a short man in civilian clothes\nwith a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling\nhis face, gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression.\nThis short man nodded to Dolgor\xc3\xbakov as to an intimate friend and stared\nat Prince Andrew with cool intensity, walking straight toward him and\nevidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way. Prince Andrew\ndid neither: a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other\nturned away and went down the side of the corridor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bor\xc3\xads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of\nmen\xe2\x80\x94the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartor\xc3\xbdski.... It\nis such men as he who decide the fate of nations,\xe2\x80\x9d added Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\nwith a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.\n\nNext day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of\nAusterlitz, Bor\xc3\xads was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgor\xc3\xbakov\nagain and remained for a while with the Ism\xc3\xa1ylov regiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nAt dawn on the sixteenth of November, Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s squadron, in\nwhich Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v served and which was in Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s\ndetachment, moved from the place where it had spent the night, advancing\ninto action as arranged, and after going behind other columns for\nabout two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad. Rost\xc3\xb3v saw the\nCossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry\nbattalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n and Dolgor\xc3\xbakov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear\nbefore action which he had experienced as previously, all the inner\nstruggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself\nas a true hussar in this battle, had been wasted. Their squadron\nremained in reserve and Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v spent that day in a dull and\nwretched mood. At nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and\nshouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought back (there were not\nmany of them), and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French\ncavalry was brought in, convoyed by a s\xc3\xb3tnya of Cossacks. Evidently the\naffair was over and, though not big, had been a successful engagement.\nThe men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of the\noccupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French\nsquadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and\nthe cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of\nvictory which was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken\npart in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers,\nofficers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed Rost\xc3\xb3v going or\ncoming. And Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the dread that\nprecedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity, was all\nthe more depressed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, Wost\xc3\xb3v. Let\xe2\x80\x99s dwink to dwown our gwief!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nDen\xc3\xadsov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some\nfood.\n\nThe officers gathered round Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s canteen, eating and talking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! They are bringing another!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the officers,\nindicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by\ntwo Cossacks.\n\nOne of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had\ntaken from the prisoner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSell us that horse!\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov called out to the Cossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like, your honor!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner.\nThe French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German\naccent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when\nhe heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers,\naddressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been\ntaken, it was not his fault but the corporal\xe2\x80\x99s who had sent him to\nseize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there.\nAnd at every word he added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt my little horse!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nstroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he\nwas. Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now,\nimagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly\ndiscipline and zeal in the service. He brought with him into our\nrearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was\nso alien to us.\n\nThe Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rost\xc3\xb3v, being the\nrichest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt my little horse!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Alsatian good-naturedly\nto Rost\xc3\xb3v when the animal was handed over to the hussar.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlley! Alley!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Cossack, touching the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s arm to\nmake him go on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor! The Emperor!\xe2\x80\x9d was suddenly heard among the hussars.\n\nAll began to run and bustle, and Rost\xc3\xb3v saw coming up the road behind\nhim several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment everyone\nwas in his place, waiting.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.\nInstantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood\namid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of\nhimself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to\nthe Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the\nday he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of\nmeeting arrives. Not daring to look round and without looking round, he\nwas ecstatically conscious of his approach. He felt it not only from the\nsound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew\nnear everything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more\nfestive around him. Nearer and nearer to Rost\xc3\xb3v came that sun shedding\nbeams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself\nenveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm,\nand majestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe P\xc3\xa1vlograd hussars?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reserves, sire!\xe2\x80\x9d replied a voice, a very human one compared to\nthat which had said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe P\xc3\xa1vlograd hussars?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Emperor drew level with Rost\xc3\xb3v and halted. Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s face was\neven more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review. It\nshone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested\nthe liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face\nof the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the squadron, the\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s and rested on them for not more than\ntwo seconds. Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s soul (it seemed to Rost\xc3\xb3v that he understood everything),\nat any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at\nonce he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left\nfoot, and galloped on.\n\nThe younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the\nbattle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve\no\xe2\x80\x99clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped\ntoward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several\nadjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action.\n\nThis battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was\nrepresented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the\nEmperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over\nthe battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were\nretreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had\npassed, the P\xc3\xa1vlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau\nitself, a petty German town, Rost\xc3\xb3v saw the Emperor again. In the\nmarket place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there\nhad not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite\nof officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a\ndifferent one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending\nto one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked\nat a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The\nwounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity\nto the Emperor shocked Rost\xc3\xb3v. Rost\xc3\xb3v saw how the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s rather\nround shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his\nleft foot began convulsively tapping the horse\xe2\x80\x99s side with the spur,\nand how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not\nstir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to\nplace him on a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, gently! Can\xe2\x80\x99t you do it more gently?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor\napparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v saw tears filling the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and heard him, as he was\nriding away, say to Czartor\xc3\xbdski: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a terrible thing war is: what\na terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight\nof the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us\nat the least firing. The Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude was announced to the\nvanguard, rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of\nvodka. The campfires crackled and the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 songs resounded\neven more merrily than on the previous night. Den\xc3\xadsov celebrated his\npromotion to the rank of major, and Rost\xc3\xb3v, who had already drunk\nenough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s health. \xe2\x80\x9cNot\n\xe2\x80\x98our Sovereign, the Emperor,\xe2\x80\x99 as they say at official dinners,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the health of our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and\ngreat man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the\nFrench!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we fought before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cnot letting the French pass, as\nat Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We\nwill all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not\nsaying it right, I have drunk a good deal\xe2\x80\x94but that is how I feel, and\nso do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.\n\nAnd the old cavalry captain, K\xc3\xadrsten, shouted enthusiastically and no\nless sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nWhen the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, K\xc3\xadrsten filled\nothers and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the\nsoldiers\xe2\x80\x99 bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest\nshowing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light\nof the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLads! here\xe2\x80\x99s to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over\nour enemies! Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar\xe2\x80\x99s\nbaritone.\n\nThe hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.\n\nLate that night, when all had separated, Den\xc3\xadsov with his short hand\npatted his favorite, Rost\xc3\xb3v, on the shoulder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs there\xe2\x80\x99s no one to fall in love with on campaign, he\xe2\x80\x99s fallen\nin love with the Tsar,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDen\xc3\xadsov, don\xe2\x80\x99t make fun of it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is such a\nlofty, beautiful feeling, such a...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Rost\xc3\xb3v got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of\nwhat happiness it would be to die\xe2\x80\x94not in saving the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s life\n(he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his\neyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian\narms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to\nexperience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle\nof Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in\nlove, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the\nRussian arms.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician,\nwas repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops\nnear by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and\nhad slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this\nindisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by\nthe sight of the killed and wounded.\n\nAt daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with\na flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was\nbrought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The\nEmperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At midday\nhe was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with\nPrince Dolgor\xc3\xbakov to the advanced post of the French army.\n\nIt was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander\na meeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a\npersonal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince\nDolgor\xc3\xbakov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate\nwith Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were\nactuated by a real desire for peace.\n\nToward evening Dolgor\xc3\xbakov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and\nremained alone with him for a long time.\n\nOn the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced two\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 march and the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s outposts after a brief interchange\nof shots retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the\nnineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till\nthe morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz\nwas fought.\n\nTill midday on the nineteenth, the activity\xe2\x80\x94the eager talk, running to\nand fro, and dispatching of adjutants\xe2\x80\x94was confined to the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nheadquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this activity reached\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns.\nBy evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the\narmy, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole\neighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of\nvoices, and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles\nlong.\n\nThe concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nheadquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that\nfollowed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower\nclock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and a third,\nand wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to\nwork, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands to advance with\nregular motion as a result of all that activity.\n\nJust as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military\nmachine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as\nindifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted\nto them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet\nreached. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and\nthe revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a\nneighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared\nto remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever\ncatches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins\nin the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.\n\nJust as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable\nwheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the\nhands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human\nactivities of 160,000 Russians and French\xe2\x80\x94all their passions, desires,\nremorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and\nenthusiasm\xe2\x80\x94was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the\nso-called battle of the three Emperors\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, a slow movement\nof the hand on the dial of human history.\n\nPrince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the\ncommander in chief.\n\nAt six in the evening, Kut\xc3\xbazov went to the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters\nand after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand\nmarshal of the court, Count Tolst\xc3\xb3y.\n\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the\ncoming action from Dolgor\xc3\xbakov. He felt that Kut\xc3\xbazov was upset\nand dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were\ndissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters\neveryone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do\nnot know: he therefore wished to speak to Dolgor\xc3\xbakov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how d\xe2\x80\x99you do, my dear fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolgor\xc3\xbakov, who was\nsitting at tea with Bil\xc3\xadbin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fete is for tomorrow. How is your\nold fellow? Out of sorts?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be\nheard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he\ntalks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte\nfears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you have seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is\nBonaparte like? How did he impress you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as\na general engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Dolgor\xc3\xbakov, evidently prizing this\ngeneral conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with\nNapoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he weren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of a battle why did he ask for that\ninterview? Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is\nso contrary to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid,\nafraid of a general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me, what is he like, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call\nhim \xe2\x80\x98Your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x99 but who, to his chagrin, got no title from\nme! That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of man he is, and nothing more,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nDolgor\xc3\xbakov, looking round at Bil\xc3\xadbin with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDespite my great respect for old Kut\xc3\xbazov,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\nshould be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him\na chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in\nour hands! No, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget Suv\xc3\xb3rov and his rule\xe2\x80\x94not to put\nyourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Believe\nme in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all\nthe experience of old Cunctators.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the\noutposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are\nsituated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\nHe wished to explain to Dolgor\xc3\xbakov a plan of attack he had himself\nformed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d Dolgor\xc3\xbakov said quickly, and getting up\nhe spread a map on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cAll eventualities have been foreseen.\nIf he is standing before Br\xc3\xbcnn...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Prince Dolgor\xc3\xbakov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother\xe2\x80\x99s\nplan of a flanking movement.\n\nPrince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might\nhave been as good as Weyrother\xe2\x80\x99s, but for the disadvantage that\nWeyrother\xe2\x80\x99s had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew began\nto demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan,\nPrince Dolgor\xc3\xbakov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not\nat the map, but at Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be a council of war at Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s tonight, though; you\ncan say all this there,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Dolgor\xc3\xbakov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin, who,\ntill then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and\nnow was evidently ready with a joke. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether tomorrow brings\nvictory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except your\nKut\xc3\xbazov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column! The\ncommanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de\nLichtenstein, le Prince de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on\nlike all those Polish names.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, backbiter!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolgor\xc3\xbakov. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not true; there\nare now two Russians, Milor\xc3\xa1dovich, and Dokht\xc3\xbarov, and there would be\na third, Count Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, if his nerves were not too weak.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I think General Kut\xc3\xbazov has come out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nAndrew. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d he added and\nwent out after shaking hands with Dolgor\xc3\xbakov and Bil\xc3\xadbin.\n\nOn the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kut\xc3\xbazov,\nwho was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s\nbattle.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolst\xc3\xb3y and\nasked him to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? \xe2\x80\x98But, my\ndear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military\nmatters yourself!\xe2\x80\x99 Yes... That was the answer I got!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nShortly after nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening, Weyrother drove with his\nplans to Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s quarters where the council of war was to be\nheld. All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in\nchief\xe2\x80\x99s and with the exception of Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, who declined to\ncome, were all there at the appointed time.\n\nWeyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his\neagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied\nand drowsy Kut\xc3\xbazov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and\npresident of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be\nat the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable. He was\nlike a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was\npulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at\nheadlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead\nto. Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s picket\nline to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and\nAustrian, to report and explain, and to his headquarters where he had\ndictated the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he arrived\nat Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nHe was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the\ncommander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly,\nwithout looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to\nquestions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful,\nweary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and\nself-confident.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov was occupying a nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s castle of modest dimensions near\nOstralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the commander\nin chief\xe2\x80\x99s office were gathered Kut\xc3\xbazov himself, Weyrother, and the\nmembers of the council of war. They were drinking tea, and only awaited\nPrince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n to begin the council. At last Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s orderly\ncame with the news that the prince could not attend. Prince Andrew came\nin to inform the commander in chief of this and, availing himself\nof permission previously given him by Kut\xc3\xbazov to be present at the\ncouncil, he remained in the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n is not coming, we may begin,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nWeyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on\nwhich an enormous map of the environs of Br\xc3\xbcnn was spread out.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over\nhis collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair,\nwith his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound\nof Weyrother\xe2\x80\x99s voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, if you please! It is already late,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and nodding\nhis head he let it droop and again closed his eye.\n\nIf at first the members of the council thought that Kut\xc3\xbazov was\npretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that\nfollowed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed\nby a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for\nthe dispositions or anything else\xe2\x80\x94he was engaged in satisfying the\nirresistible human need for sleep. He really was asleep. Weyrother, with\nthe gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kut\xc3\xbazov and,\nhaving convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in\na loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the\nimpending battle, under a heading which he also read out:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and\nSokolnitz, November 30, 1805.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began as\nfollows:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s left wing rests on wooded hills and his right\nextends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there,\nwhile we, on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his\nright, it is advantageous to attack the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s latter wing especially\nif we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we\ncan both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between\nSchlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of\nSchlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s front. For this\nobject it is necessary that... The first column marches... The second\ncolumn marches... The third column marches...\xe2\x80\x9d and so on, read\nWeyrother.\n\nThe generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions.\nThe tall, fair-haired General Buxh\xc3\xb6wden stood, leaning his back against\nthe wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen\nor even to wish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother,\nwith his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache\ntwisted upwards, sat the ruddy Milor\xc3\xa1dovich in a military pose, his\nelbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and his shoulders\nraised. He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrother\xe2\x80\x99s face,\nand only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished\nreading. Then Milor\xc3\xa1dovich looked round significantly at the other\ngenerals. But one could not tell from that significant look whether he\nagreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements. Next\nto Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left\nhis typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading,\ngazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners\na gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the middle of one of the\nlongest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised\nhis head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his\nthin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. But the\nAustrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his\nelbows, as if to say: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can tell me your views later, but now be so\ngood as to look at the map and listen.\xe2\x80\x9d Langeron lifted his eyes with\nan expression of perplexity, turned round to Milor\xc3\xa1dovich as if seeking\nan explanation, but meeting the latter\xe2\x80\x99s impressive but meaningless\ngaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA geography lesson!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough\nto be heard.\n\nPrzebysz\xc3\xa9wski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his\nhand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in\nattention. Dohkt\xc3\xbarov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with\nan assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map\nconscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality. He\nasked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard\nand the difficult names of villages. Weyrother complied and Dohkt\xc3\xbarov\nnoted them down.\n\nWhen the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again\nbrought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at\nanyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out\nsuch a plan in which the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s position was assumed to be known,\nwhereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement.\nLangeron\xe2\x80\x99s objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief\naim was to show General Weyrother\xe2\x80\x94who had read his dispositions with\nas much self-confidence as if he were addressing school children\xe2\x80\x94that\nhe had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him something\nin military matters.\n\nWhen the monotonous sound of Weyrother\xe2\x80\x99s voice ceased, Kut\xc3\xbazov opened\nhis eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel\nis interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking,\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are still at that silly business!\xe2\x80\x9d quickly closed his eye\nagain, and let his head sink still lower.\n\nLangeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother\xe2\x80\x99s vanity\nas author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily\nattack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this\nplan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and\ncontemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections\nbe they what they might.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he could attack us, he would have done so today,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think he is powerless?\xe2\x80\x9d said Langeron.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has forty thousand men at most,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Weyrother, with the\nsmile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of\na case.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nLangeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support\nto Milor\xc3\xa1dovich who was near him.\n\nBut Milor\xc3\xa1dovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything\nrather than of what the generals were disputing about.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa foi!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ctomorrow we shall see all that on the\nbattlefield.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWeyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was\nstrange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to\nhave to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but\nhad also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from\nhis camp,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean? Either he is retreating,\nwhich is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(He smiled ironically.) \xe2\x80\x9cBut even if he also took up a position in\nthe Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our\narrangements to the minutest detail remain the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that?...\xe2\x80\x9d began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting\nan opportunity to express his doubts.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the\ngenerals.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x94or rather for today, for\nit is past midnight\xe2\x80\x94cannot now be altered,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\nheard them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is\nnothing more important...\xe2\x80\x9d he paused, \xe2\x80\x9cthan to have a good sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past\nmidnight. Prince Andrew went out.\n\nThe council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to\nexpress his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy\nimpression. Whether Dolgor\xc3\xbakov and Weyrother, or Kut\xc3\xbazov, Langeron,\nand the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were\nright\xe2\x80\x94he did not know. \xe2\x80\x9cBut was it really not possible for Kut\xc3\xbazov\nto state his views plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on\naccount of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives,\nand my life, my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be risked?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most\ndistant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered\nhis last parting from his father and his wife; he remembered the days\nwhen he first loved her. He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for\nher and for himself, and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he\nwent out of the hut in which he was billeted with Nesv\xc3\xadtski and began\nto walk up and down before it.\n\nThe night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed\nmysteriously. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, tomorrow, tomorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow\neverything may be over for me! All these memories will be no more, none\nof them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly,\nI have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all\nI can do.\xe2\x80\x9d And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the\nconcentration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all the\ncommanders. And then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had\nso long waited, presents itself to him at last. He firmly and clearly\nexpresses his opinion to Kut\xc3\xbazov, to Weyrother, and to the Emperors.\nAll are struck by the justness of his views, but no one undertakes to\ncarry them out, so he takes a regiment, a division\xe2\x80\x94stipulates that no\none is to interfere with his arrangements\xe2\x80\x94leads his division to\nthe decisive point, and gains the victory alone. \xe2\x80\x9cBut death and\nsuffering?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested another voice. Prince Andrew, however, did not\nanswer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs. The dispositions\nfor the next battle are planned by him alone. Nominally he is only an\nadjutant on Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s staff, but he does everything alone. The next\nbattle is won by him alone. Kut\xc3\xbazov is removed and he is appointed...\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell and then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the other voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIf before that you are\nnot ten times wounded, killed, or betrayed, well... what then?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew answered himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nwhat will happen and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know, and can\xe2\x80\x99t, but if I want\nthis\xe2\x80\x94want glory, want to be known to men, want to be loved by them, it\nis not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and live only\nfor that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh God!\nwhat am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men\xe2\x80\x99s esteem? Death,\nwounds, the loss of family\xe2\x80\x94I fear nothing. And precious and dear\nas many persons are to me\xe2\x80\x94father, sister, wife\xe2\x80\x94those dearest to\nme\xe2\x80\x94yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give them all at\nonce for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, of love from men I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know and never shall know, for the love of these men here,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought, as he listened to voices in Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s courtyard. The voices\nwere those of the orderlies who were packing up; one voice, probably a\ncoachman\xe2\x80\x99s, was teasing Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s old cook whom Prince Andrew knew,\nand who was called Tit. He was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTit, I say, Tit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, Tit, thresh a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d said the wag.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go to the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d called out a voice, drowned by the laughter\nof the orderlies and servants.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I\nvalue this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this\nmist!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThat same night, Rost\xc3\xb3v was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front\nof Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s detachment. His hussars were placed along the line\nin couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the\nsleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our\narmy\xe2\x80\x99s campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him;\nin front of him was misty darkness. Rost\xc3\xb3v could see nothing, peer as\nhe would into that foggy distance: now something gleamed gray, now there\nwas something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy\nought to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes. His\neyes kept closing, and in his fancy appeared\xe2\x80\x94now the Emperor, now\nDen\xc3\xadsov, and now Moscow memories\xe2\x80\x94and he again hurriedly opened his\neyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was\nriding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the\nblack figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty\ndarkness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?... It might easily happen,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any\nother officer; he\xe2\x80\x99ll say: \xe2\x80\x98Go and find out what\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x99 There\nare many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance\nway and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a place near him?\nOh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would\nunmask his deceivers!\xe2\x80\x9d And in order to realize vividly his love\ndevotion to the sovereign, Rost\xc3\xb3v pictured to himself an enemy or a\ndeceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom\nhe would slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout\naroused him. He started and opened his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and\nwatchword\xe2\x80\x94shaft, Olm\xc3\xbctz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in\nreserve tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ask leave to go to the front,\nthis may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be long\nnow before I am off duty. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take another turn and when I get back\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the general and ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d He readjusted himself in the\nsaddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars. It\nseemed to him that it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a sloping\ndescent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a\nwall. On this knoll there was a white patch that Rost\xc3\xb3v could not at\nall make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some\nunmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something moved on\nthat white spot. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect it\xe2\x80\x99s snow... that spot... a spot\xe2\x80\x94une\ntache,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThere now... it\xe2\x80\x99s not a tache... Nat\xc3\xa1sha...\nsister, black eyes... Na... tasha... (Won\xe2\x80\x99t she be surprised when\nI tell her how I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Emperor?) Nat\xc3\xa1sha... take my\nsabretache...\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cKeep to the right, your honor, there are bushes\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rost\xc3\xb3v was riding in\nthe act of falling asleep. Rost\xc3\xb3v lifted his head that had sunk almost\nto his horse\xe2\x80\x99s mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He was succumbing\nto irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what was I\nthinking? I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? No,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not it\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow. Oh yes! Nat\xc3\xa1sha... sabretache...\nsaber them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along\nthe Tversk\xc3\xa1ya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought about\nhim too, just opposite G\xc3\xbaryev\xe2\x80\x99s house... Old G\xc3\xbaryev.... Oh, but\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s a fine fellow. But that\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense. The chief thing\nis that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and wished to say\nsomething, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not. But that\xe2\x80\x99s\nnonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important thing I\nwas thinking of. Yes, Na-t\xc3\xa1sha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes! That\xe2\x80\x99s\nright!\xe2\x80\x9d And his head once more sank to his horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck. All at once\nit seemed to him that he was being fired at. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What? What?... Cut\nthem down! What?...\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, waking up. At the moment he opened\nhis eyes he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn\nshouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the hussar\nnear him pricked their ears at these shouts. Over there, where the\nshouting came from, a fire flared up and went out again, then another,\nand all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the\nshouting grew louder and louder. Rost\xc3\xb3v could hear the sound of French\nwords but could not distinguish them. The din of many voices was too\ngreat; all he could hear was: \xe2\x80\x9cahahah!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crrrr!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that? What do you make of it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v to the hussar\nbeside him. \xe2\x80\x9cThat must be the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s camp!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe hussar did not reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear it?\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v asked again, after waiting for a\nreply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho can tell, your honor?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the hussar reluctantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the direction, it must be the enemy,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be he or it may be nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the hussar. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\ndark... Steady!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried to his fidgeting horse.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground,\npricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting\ngrew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army\nof several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and\nfarther, probably along the line of the French camp. Rost\xc3\xb3v no longer\nwanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a\nstimulating effect on him. \xe2\x80\x9cVive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur! l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!\xe2\x80\x9d he now\nheard distinctly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t be far off, probably just beyond the stream,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\nto the hussar beside him.\n\nThe hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The sound\nof horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was\nheard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars\nsuddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor, the generals!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, riding up to Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with\nthe sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line.\nOne was on a white horse. Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n and Prince Dolgor\xc3\xbakov with\ntheir adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the\nlights and shouts in the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s camp. Rost\xc3\xb3v rode up to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n,\nreported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the\ngenerals were saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Dolgor\xc3\xbakov, addressing Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, \xe2\x80\x9cit\nis nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to\nkindle fires and make a noise to deceive us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bagrati\xc3\xb3n. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw them this evening on that\nknoll; if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too....\nOfficer!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bagrati\xc3\xb3n to Rost\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9care the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s skirmishers\nstill there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were there this evening, but now I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, your\nexcellency. Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nRost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s face\nin the mist.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go and see,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a pause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v spurred his horse, called to Sergeant F\xc3\xa9dchenko and two other\nhussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction\nfrom which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be\nriding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty\ndistance where no one had been before him. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n called to him from\nthe hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rost\xc3\xb3v pretended not to hear\nhim and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes\nfor trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes.\nHaving descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly\nand distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like a river,\nbut when he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto\nthe road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or\ncross it and ride over the black field up the hillside. To keep to the\nroad which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it\nwould be easier to see people coming along it. \xe2\x80\x9cFollow me!\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\ncrossed the road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the\npoint where the French pickets had been standing that evening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor, there he is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the hussars behind him. And\nbefore Rost\xc3\xb3v had time to make out what the black thing was that had\nsuddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report,\nand a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed\nout of hearing. Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan.\nRost\xc3\xb3v turned his horse and galloped back. Four more reports followed\nat intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in\ndifferent tones. Rost\xc3\xb3v reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen,\nlike his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, some\nmore! Some more!\xe2\x80\x9d a merry voice was saying in his soul. But no more\nshots came.\n\nOnly when approaching Bagrati\xc3\xb3n did Rost\xc3\xb3v let his horse gallop again,\nand with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.\n\nDolgor\xc3\xbakov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had\nonly lit fires to deceive us.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that prove?\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying as Rost\xc3\xb3v rode up. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\nmight retreat and leave the pickets.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till tomorrow morning, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out everything\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was\nin the evening,\xe2\x80\x9d reported Rost\xc3\xb3v, stooping forward with his hand at\nthe salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his\nride and especially by the sound of the bullets.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, very good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bagrati\xc3\xb3n. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, officer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I ask a favor?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached\nto the first squadron?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount Rost\xc3\xb3v.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s son?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dolgor\xc3\xbakov.\n\nBut Rost\xc3\xb3v did not reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I may reckon on it, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give the order.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the\nEmperor,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fires and shouting in the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s army were occasioned by the fact\nthat while Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s proclamation was being read to the troops the\nEmperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing him,\nlit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cVive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!\xe2\x80\x9d\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s proclamation was as follows:\n\nSoldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the\nAustrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at\nHollabr\xc3\xbcnn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position we\noccupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on\nthe right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct\nyour battalions. I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual\nvalor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s ranks, but should\nvictory be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see your Emperor\nexposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be no\ndoubt of victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the\nhonor of the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation.\n\nDo not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every\nman be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings\nof England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This victory will\nconclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh\nFrench troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace\nI shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.\n\nNAPOLEON\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAt five in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops of the\ncenter, the reserves, and Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s right flank had not yet moved,\nbut on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery,\nwhich were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French\nright flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan,\nwere already up and astir. The smoke of the campfires, into which they\nwere throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes smart. It was cold\nand dark. The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the\nsoldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to\nwarm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the\nremains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they\ndid not want or could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides\nwere moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds\nof the advance. As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near\na commanding officer\xe2\x80\x99s quarters, the regiment began to move: the\nsoldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into their boots, their\nbags into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank. The\nofficers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches,\nand moved along the ranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies\nharnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and\nbattalion and regimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave\nfinal instructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men\nwho remained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet\nresounded. The column moved forward without knowing where and unable,\nfrom the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see\neither the place they were leaving or that to which they were going.\n\nA soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as\nmuch as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has walked, whatever\nstrange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is\nalways surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so\nthe soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks, the\nsame sergeant major Iv\xc3\xa1n M\xc3\xadtrich, the same company dog Jack, and the\nsame commanders. The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which\nhis ship is sailing, but on the day of battle\xe2\x80\x94heaven knows how and\nwhence\xe2\x80\x94a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral\natmosphere of an army, announcing the approach of something decisive\nand solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of\nbattle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their\nregiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning\nwhat is going on around them.\n\nThe fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could\nnot see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level\nground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one might\nencounter an enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced\nfor a long time, always in the same fog, descending and ascending hills,\navoiding gardens and enclosures, going over new and unknown ground, and\nnowhere encountering the enemy. On the contrary, the soldiers became\naware that in front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns\nwere moving in the same direction. Every soldier felt glad to know that\nto the unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were going\ntoo.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, the K\xc3\xbarskies have also gone past,\xe2\x80\x9d was being said in\nthe ranks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last\nnight I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A regular\nMoscow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to\nthe men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of\nhumor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves\nto cheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops\nmarched gaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to\nan attack. But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog,\nthe greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness\nof some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks. How such\na consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define, but it\ncertainly is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly,\nand irrepressibly, as water does in a creek. Had the Russian army been\nalone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before\nthis consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as\nit was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid\nGermans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been\noccasioned by the sausage eaters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up\nagainst the French?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, one can\xe2\x80\x99t hear them. They\xe2\x80\x99d be firing if we had.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in\nthe middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It\xe2\x80\x99s all those damned\nGermans\xe2\x80\x99 muddling! What stupid devils!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99d send them on in front, but no fear, they\xe2\x80\x99re crowding up\nbehind. And now here we stand hungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d said an officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, those damned Germans! They don\xe2\x80\x99t know their own country!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat division are you?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted an adjutant, riding up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Eighteenth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t get there till evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat stupid orders! They don\xe2\x80\x99t themselves know what they are\ndoing!\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer and rode off.\n\nThen a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTafa-lafa! But what he\xe2\x80\x99s jabbering no one can make out,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\nsoldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d shoot them,\nthe scoundrels!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t got\nhalfway. Fine orders!\xe2\x80\x9d was being repeated on different sides.\n\nAnd the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to\nturn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the\nGermans.\n\nThe cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was\nmoving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center\nwas too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all\nordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in\nfront of the infantry, who had to wait.\n\nAt the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a\nRussian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be\nhalted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to\nblame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited. After\nan hour\xe2\x80\x99s delay they at last moved on, descending the hill. The fog\nthat was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they\nwere descending. In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another,\nat first irregularly at varying intervals\xe2\x80\x94trata...tat\xe2\x80\x94and then more\nand more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream\nbegan.\n\nNot expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having\nstumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their\ncommanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through\nthe ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front or around\nthem in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy\nlazily and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders from\nthe officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown\nsurroundings unable to find their own regiments. In this way the action\nbegan for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into\nthe valley. The fourth column, with which Kut\xc3\xbazov was, stood on the\nPratzen Heights.\n\nBelow, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the\nhigher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was\ngoing on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed,\nsix miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one\nknew till after eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\n\nIt was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea\ndown below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon\nstood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was\na clear blue sky, and the sun\xe2\x80\x99s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow,\ncrimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist. The whole French\narmy, and even Napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side\nof the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we\nintended to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this\nside, so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could\ndistinguish a mounted man from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak\nwhich he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab\nhorse a little in front of his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills\nwhich seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian\ntroops were moving in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of\nfiring in the valley. Not a single muscle of his face\xe2\x80\x94which in those\ndays was still thin\xe2\x80\x94moved. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on\none spot. His predictions were being justified. Part of the Russian\nforce had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes\nand part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack\nand regarded as the key to the position. He saw over the mist that in\na hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian\ncolumns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one\ndirection toward the valley and disappearing one after another into\nthe mist. From information he had received the evening before, from the\nsound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night,\nby the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all\nindications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away\nin front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted\nthe center of the Russian army, and that that center was already\nsufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still he did not\nbegin the engagement.\n\nToday was a great day for him\xe2\x80\x94the anniversary of his coronation.\nBefore dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and\nin good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field\nin that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything\nsucceeds. He sat motionless, looking at the heights visible above\nthe mist, and his cold face wore that special look of confident,\nself-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily\nin love. The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his\nattention. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating\nup out of the mist.\n\nWhen the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were\naglow with dazzling light\xe2\x80\x94as if he had only awaited this to begin the\naction\xe2\x80\x94he drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign\nwith it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin. The marshals,\naccompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and\na few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly\ntoward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by\nRussian troops moving down the valley to their left.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock Kut\xc3\xbazov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth\ncolumn, Milor\xc3\xa1dovich\xe2\x80\x99s, the one that was to take the place of\nPrzebysz\xc3\xa9wski\xe2\x80\x99s and Langeron\xe2\x80\x99s columns which had already gone down\ninto the valley. He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave\nthem the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead\nthat column himself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen he\nhalted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the\ncommander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s suite. He was in a state of suppressed excitement\nand irritation, though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of\na long-awaited moment. He was firmly convinced that this was the day of\nhis Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola. How it would come about he did not\nknow, but he felt sure it would do so. The locality and the position of\nour troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone\nin our army. His own strategic plan, which obviously could not now\nbe carried out, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother\xe2\x80\x99s plan,\nPrince Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects\nsuch as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.\n\nTo the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces\ncould be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would\nconcentrate. \xe2\x80\x9cThere we shall encounter difficulties, and there,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought he, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there,\nstandard in hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions.\nSeeing them he kept thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cThat may be the very standard with\nwhich I shall lead the army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was\na hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a\nmilk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which\nour troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing.\nAbove the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the vast orb\nof the sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist,\nsome wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably\nwas, for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were\nentering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and\nthen a gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the village similar masses\nof cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist. In front and\nbehind moved infantry. The commander in chief was standing at the end of\nthe village letting the troops pass by him. That morning Kut\xc3\xbazov seemed\nworn and irritable. The infantry passing before him came to a halt\nwithout any command being given, apparently obstructed by something in\nfront.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo order them to form into battalion columns and go round the\nvillage!\xe2\x80\x9d he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou understand, your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not\ndefile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the\nenemy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d\nanswered the general.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov laughed bitterly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy!\nVery fine!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the\ndispositions...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dispositions!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Kut\xc3\xbazov bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cWho told you\nthat?... Kindly do as you are ordered.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d Nesv\xc3\xadtski whispered to Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cthe old\nman is as surly as a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAn Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat\ngalloped up to Kut\xc3\xbazov and asked in the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s name had the fourth\ncolumn advanced into action.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall\nupon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s\nmalevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what\nwas being done was not his adjutant\xe2\x80\x99s fault, and still not answering\nthe Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the\nvillage. Tell it to stop and await my orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nare they doing? What are they doing?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured to himself, still\nnot replying to the Austrian.\n\nPrince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.\n\nOvertaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped\nthe third division and convinced himself that there really were no\nsharpshooters in front of our columns. The colonel at the head of the\nregiment was much surprised at the commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s order to throw\nout skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops\nin front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away.\nThere was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent\nhidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s\nname to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back. Kut\xc3\xbazov\nstill in the same place, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle\nwith the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes. The\ntroops were no longer moving, but stood with the butts of their muskets\non the ground.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a\ngeneral who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all\nthe left-flank columns had already descended.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty of time, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Kut\xc3\xbazov in the midst of\na yawn. \xe2\x80\x9cPlenty of time,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\n\nJust then at a distance behind Kut\xc3\xbazov was heard the sound of regiments\nsaluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended\nline of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were\ngreeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front\nof which Kut\xc3\xbazov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one\nside and looked round with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped\nwhat looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them\nrode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with\nwhite plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who\nwas in a white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors\nfollowed by their suites. Kut\xc3\xbazov, affecting the manners of an old\nsoldier at the front, gave the command \xe2\x80\x9cAttention!\xe2\x80\x9d and rode up\nto the Emperors with a salute. His whole appearance and manner were\nsuddenly transformed. He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys\nwithout reasoning. With an affectation of respect which evidently struck\nAlexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.\n\nThis unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face\nof the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished.\nAfter his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field\nof Olm\xc3\xbctz where Bolk\xc3\xb3nski had seen him for the first time abroad, but\nthere was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness\nin his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for\nvarying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted\ninnocent youth.\n\nAt the Olm\xc3\xbctz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed\nbrighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two\nmiles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round\nat the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own. Czartor\xc3\xbdski,\nNovos\xc3\xadltsev, Prince Volk\xc3\xb3nsky, Str\xc3\xb3gonov, and the others, all richly\ndressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly\nheated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the\nEmperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very\nerect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and\npreoccupied manner. He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked\nsome question\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMost likely he is asking at what o\xe2\x80\x99clock they\nstarted,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with\na smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Br\xc3\xbcnn.\nIn the Emperors\xe2\x80\x99 suite were the picked young orderly officers of the\nGuard and line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them were grooms\nleading the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered\ncloths.\n\nAs when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters\na stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of\nsuccess reached Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s cheerless staff with the galloping advent\nof all these brilliant young men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy aren\xe2\x80\x99t you beginning, Michael Ilari\xc3\xb3novich?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nEmperor Alexander hurriedly to Kut\xc3\xbazov, glancing courteously at the\nsame time at the Emperor Francis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting, Your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Kut\xc3\xbazov, bending forward\nrespectfully.\n\nThe Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not\nquite heard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiting, Your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Kut\xc3\xbazov. (Prince Andrew noted\nthat Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the\nword \xe2\x80\x9cwaiting.\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cNot all the columns have formed up yet, Your\nMajesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his\nrather round shoulders and glanced at Novos\xc3\xadltsev who was near him, as\nif complaining of Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Michael Ilari\xc3\xb3novich, we are not on the Empress\xe2\x80\x99 Field\nwhere a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting\nhim if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the\nEmperor Francis continued to look about him and did not listen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is just why I do not begin, sire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov in a\nresounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being\nheard, and again something in his face twitched\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThat is just why\nI do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the\nEmpress\xe2\x80\x99 Field,\xe2\x80\x9d said he clearly and distinctly.\n\nIn the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed\ndissatisfaction and reproach. \xe2\x80\x9cOld though he may be, he should not, he\ncertainly should not, speak like that,\xe2\x80\x9d their glances seemed to say.\n\nThe Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s eye\nwaiting to hear whether he would say anything more. But Kut\xc3\xbazov, with\nrespectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence lasted\nfor about a minute.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, if you command it, Your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov, lifting\nhis head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but\nsubmissive general.\n\nHe touched his horse and having called Milor\xc3\xa1dovich, the commander of\nthe column, gave him the order to advance.\n\nThe troops again began to move, and two battalions of the N\xc3\xb3vgorod and\none of the \xc3\x81psheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.\n\nAs this \xc3\x81psheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Milor\xc3\xa1dovich,\nwithout his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous\ntuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front\nand back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined\nin his horse before the Emperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be with you, general!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilit\xc3\xa9,\nsire,\xe2\x80\x9d * he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among\nthe gentlemen of the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s suite by his poor French.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to\n     do, Sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nMilor\xc3\xa1dovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little\nbehind the Emperor. The \xc3\x81psheron men, excited by the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\npassed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk\npace.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLads!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Milor\xc3\xa1dovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery\nvoice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of\nbattle, and by the sight of the gallant \xc3\x81psherons, his comrades in\nSuv\xc3\xb3rov\xe2\x80\x99s time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that he\nforgot the sovereigns\xe2\x80\x99 presence. \xe2\x80\x9cLads, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first village\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve had to take,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to do our best!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the soldiers.\n\nThe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had\ncarried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the\nfield of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and\npricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the\nEmpress\xe2\x80\x99 Field, not understanding the significance of the firing, nor\nof the nearness of the Emperor Francis\xe2\x80\x99 black cob, nor of all that was\nbeing said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.\n\nThe Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a\nremark to him, pointing to the gallant \xc3\x81psherons.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the\ncarabineers.\n\nWhen he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he\nstopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an\ninn, where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill and troops were\nmarching along both.\n\nThe fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible\nabout a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down below, on\nthe left, the firing became more distinct. Kut\xc3\xbazov had stopped and was\nspeaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was a little behind\nlooking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, look!\xe2\x80\x9d said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the\ndistance, but down the hill before him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the French!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying\nto snatch it from one another. The expression on all their faces\nsuddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a\nmile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in\nfront of us.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But\nhow is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said different voices.\n\nWith the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more\nthan five hundred paces from where Kut\xc3\xbazov was standing, a dense French\ncolumn coming up to meet the \xc3\x81psherons.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xc3\x81psherons must be stopped, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. But at\nthat very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard\nquite close at hand, and a voice of na\xc3\xafve terror barely two steps from\nPrince Andrew shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cBrothers! All\xe2\x80\x99s lost!\xe2\x80\x9d And at this as if\nat a command, everyone began to run.\n\nConfused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five\nminutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would it\nhave been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to\nbe carried back with it oneself. Bolk\xc3\xb3nski only tried not to lose\ntouch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was\nhappening in front of him. Nesv\xc3\xadtski with an angry face, red and unlike\nhimself, was shouting to Kut\xc3\xbazov that if he did not ride away at once\nhe would certainly be taken prisoner. Kut\xc3\xbazov remained in the same\nplace and without answering drew out a handkerchief. Blood was flowing\nfrom his cheek. Prince Andrew forced his way to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of\nhis lower jaw.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wound is not here, it is there!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov, pressing the\nhandkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop them!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing\nthat it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the\nright.\n\nA fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.\n\nThe troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by\nthem it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cGet on!\nWhy are you hindering us?\xe2\x80\x9d Another in the same place turned round and\nfired in the air; a third was striking the horse Kut\xc3\xbazov himself rode.\nHaving by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men,\nKut\xc3\xbazov, with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a\nsound of artillery fire near by. Having forced his way out of the crowd\nof fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near Kut\xc3\xbazov, saw on the\nslope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing\nand Frenchmen running toward it. Higher up stood some Russian infantry,\nneither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the\nfleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and\napproached Kut\xc3\xbazov. Of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s suite only four remained. They were\nall pale and exchanged looks in silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop those wretches!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Kut\xc3\xbazov to the regimental commander,\npointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish\nhim for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s suite like a flock of little birds.\n\nThe French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kut\xc3\xbazov, were firing\nat him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg;\nseveral soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the\nflag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the\nmuskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing without\norders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Kut\xc3\xbazov despairingly and looked around....\n\xe2\x80\x9cBolk\xc3\xb3nski!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness\nof the feebleness of age, \xe2\x80\x9cBolk\xc3\xb3nski!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, pointing to\nthe disordered battalion and at the enemy, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of\nshame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to\nthe standard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForward, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted in a voice piercing as a child\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and\nhearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him.\nSeveral soldiers fell.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up\nthe heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole\nbattalion would follow him.\n\nAnd really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then\nanother and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\nand overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag\nthat was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s hands, but he\nwas immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and,\ndragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw our\nartillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned\ntheir guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry\nsoldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns\nround. Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces\nof the cannon. He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and\nto right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped. But\nhe did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front\nof him\xe2\x80\x94at the battery. He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired\ngunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while\na French soldier tugged at the other. He could distinctly see the\ndistraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who\nevidently did not realize what they were doing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they about?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed?\nWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the\nFrenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to\nthe struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had\ntriumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him,\nwas about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended. It\nseemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head\nwith the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but the worst of\nit was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had\nbeen looking at.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he,\nand fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle\nof the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner\nhad been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or\nsaved. But he saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the\nsky\xe2\x80\x94the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray\nclouds gliding slowly across it. \xe2\x80\x9cHow quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not\nat all as I ran,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot as we ran, shouting\nand fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened\nand angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds\nglide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that\nlofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All\nis vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing,\nnothing, but that. But even it does not exist, there is nothing but\nquiet and peace. Thank God!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nOn our right flank commanded by Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the battle\nhad not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to Dolgor\xc3\xbakov\xe2\x80\x99s demand to\ncommence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself,\nPrince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n proposed to Dolgor\xc3\xbakov to send to inquire of the\ncommander in chief. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n knew that as the distance between the two\nflanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed\n(which he very likely would be), and found the commander in chief\n(which would be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before\nevening.\n\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite,\nand the boyish face of Rost\xc3\xb3v, breathless with excitement and hope, was\nthe first to catch his eye. He sent him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in\nchief, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, with his hand to his cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can give the message to His Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dolgor\xc3\xbakov,\nhurriedly interrupting Bagrati\xc3\xb3n.\n\nOn being relieved from picket duty Rost\xc3\xb3v had managed to get a few\nhours\xe2\x80\x99 sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute,\nwith elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in\nthat state of mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and\neasy.\n\nAll his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be a\ngeneral engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was\norderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a\nmessage to Kut\xc3\xbazov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself. The morning\nwas bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of\njoy and happiness. On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein\nand galloped along the line. At first he rode along the line of\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were\nstanding motionless; then he came to the region occupied by Uv\xc3\xa1rov\xe2\x80\x99s\ncavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle;\nhaving passed Uv\xc3\xa1rov\xe2\x80\x99s cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon\nand musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder and louder.\n\nIn the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots\nat irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two cannon shots,\nbut a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before\nPratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes\nseveral of them were not separated from one another but merged into a\ngeneral roar.\n\nHe could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another\ndown the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading,\nand mingling with one another. He could also, by the gleam of bayonets\nvisible through the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow\nlines of artillery with green caissons.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was\ngoing on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand\nor make out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men of\nsome sort were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of troops;\nbut why, whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out.\nThese sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him;\non the contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on! Go on! Give it them!\xe2\x80\x9d he mentally exclaimed at these sounds,\nand again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and\nfarther into the region where the army was already in action.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow it will be there I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but all will be well!\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nRost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nAfter passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the\nline (the Guards) was already in action.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better! I shall see it close,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\nHe was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came\ngalloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered\nranks were returning from the attack. Rost\xc3\xb3v got out of their way,\ninvoluntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is no business of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He had not ridden many\nhundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole\nwidth of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white\nuniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and\nacross his path. Rost\xc3\xb3v put his horse to full gallop to get out of the\nway of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at the\nsame speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the\nhorses were already galloping. Rost\xc3\xb3v heard the thud of their hoofs\nand the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and\neven their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our Horse Guards,\nadvancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them.\n\nThe Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses.\nRost\xc3\xb3v could already see their faces and heard the command:\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharge!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to\nfull speed. Rost\xc3\xb3v, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on\nthe French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but\nstill was not in time to avoid them.\n\nThe last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily\non seeing Rost\xc3\xb3v before him, with whom he would inevitably collide.\nThis Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rost\xc3\xb3v and his Bedouin over\n(Rost\xc3\xb3v felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men\nand horses) had it not occurred to Rost\xc3\xb3v to flourish his whip before\nthe eyes of the Guardsman\xe2\x80\x99s horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen\nhands high, shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman\ndrove his huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail\nand extending its neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse\nGuards passed Rost\xc3\xb3v before he heard them shout, \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nlooking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some\nforeign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French. He could see nothing\nmore, for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and\nsmoke enveloped everything.\n\nAt that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in\nthe smoke, Rost\xc3\xb3v hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where\nhe was sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that\namazed the French themselves. Rost\xc3\xb3v was horrified to hear later that\nof all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant,\nrich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their\nthousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see\nthe Emperor immediately!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v and galloped on.\n\nWhen he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and\naround them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so\nmuch because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on\nthe soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the\nofficers.\n\nPassing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a\nvoice calling him by name.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRost\xc3\xb3v!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, not recognizing Bor\xc3\xads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!\xe2\x80\x9d said\nBor\xc3\xads with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been\nunder fire for the first time.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, how did it go?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe drove them back!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads with animation, growing talkative.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you imagine it?\xe2\x80\x9d and he began describing how the Guards, having\ntaken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were\nAustrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged\nby those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had\nunexpectedly to go into action. Rost\xc3\xb3v without hearing Bor\xc3\xads to the\nend spurred his horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you off to?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bor\xc3\xads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a message to His Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads, thinking Rost\xc3\xb3v had said \xe2\x80\x9cHis\nHighness,\xe2\x80\x9d and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders\nand frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet\nand Horse Guards\xe2\x80\x99 jacket, shouting something to a pale, white\nuniformed Austrian officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the\nEmperor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, and was about to spur his horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount! Count!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager\nas Bor\xc3\xads. \xe2\x80\x9cCount! I am wounded in my right hand\xe2\x80\x9d (and he showed his\nbleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) \xe2\x80\x9cand I remained at\nthe front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family\xe2\x80\x94the\nvon Bergs\xe2\x80\x94have been knights!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe said something more, but Rost\xc3\xb3v did not wait to hear it and rode\naway.\n\nHaving passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rost\xc3\xb3v, to avoid\nagain getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse\nGuards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place\nwhere the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he\nheard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops,\nwhere he could never have expected the enemy to be.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThe enemy in the rear of our army?\nImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself\nand for the issue of the whole battle. \xe2\x80\x9cBut be that what it may,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe reflected, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no riding round it now. I must look for the\ncommander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with\nthe rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rost\xc3\xb3v was more and\nmore confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of\nPratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is\nfiring?\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian\nsoldiers running in confused crowds across his path.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil knows! They\xe2\x80\x99ve killed everybody! It\xe2\x80\x99s all up now!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who\nunderstood what was happening as little as he did.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKill the Germans!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay the devil take them\xe2\x80\x94the traitors!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cZum Henker diese Russen!\xe2\x80\x9d * muttered a German.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cHang these Russians!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nSeveral wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, screams,\nand groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died down.\nRost\xc3\xb3v learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing\nat one another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! What does it all mean?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here, where at\nany moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a\nhandful of scoundrels. It will soon be over, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be that, it\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be! Only to get past them quicker, quicker!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s head. Though\nhe saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where\nhe had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not,\ndid not wish to, believe that.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v had been ordered to look for Kut\xc3\xbazov and the Emperor near the\nvillage of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer\nwere there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He\nurged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but\nthe farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on\nwhich he had come out was thronged with cal\xc3\xa8ches, carriages of all\nsorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and\nsome not. This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the\ndismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries\nstationed on the Pratzen Heights.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the Emperor? Where is Kut\xc3\xbazov?\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v kept asking\neveryone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.\n\nAt last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, brother! They\xe2\x80\x99ve all bolted long ago!\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier,\nlaughing for some reason and shaking himself free.\n\nHaving left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rost\xc3\xb3v stopped the\nhorse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to\nquestion him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a\ncarriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and\nthat he was dangerously wounded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man with a self-confident smile of\nderision. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I\xe2\x80\x99ve\nseen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat in\nthe carriage as pale as anything. How they made the four black horses\nfly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! It\xe2\x80\x99s time I knew the Imperial\nhorses and Ily\xc3\xa1 Iv\xc3\xa1nych. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Ily\xc3\xa1 drives anyone except\nthe Tsar!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded\nofficer passing by addressed him:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThe commander in chief? He was\nkilled by a cannon ball\xe2\x80\x94struck in the breast before our regiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot killed\xe2\x80\x94wounded!\xe2\x80\x9d another officer corrected him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? Kut\xc3\xbazov?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Kut\xc3\xbazov, but what\xe2\x80\x99s his name\xe2\x80\x94well, never mind... there are\nnot many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders\nare there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek,\nand he walked on.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now\ngoing. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible to\ndoubt it now. Rost\xc3\xb3v rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which\nhe saw turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now to say\nto the Tsar or to Kut\xc3\xbazov, even if they were alive and unwounded?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!\xe2\x80\x9d a\nsoldier shouted to him. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d kill you there!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d said another. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he to\ngo? That way is nearer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v considered, and then went in the direction where they said he\nwould be killed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to\nsave myself?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. He rode on to the region where the greatest\nnumber of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not\nyet occupied that region, and the Russians\xe2\x80\x94the uninjured and slightly\nwounded\xe2\x80\x94had left it long ago. All about the field, like heaps of\nmanure on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded\nto each couple of acres. The wounded crept together in twos and threes\nand one could hear their distressing screams and groans, sometimes\nfeigned\xe2\x80\x94or so it seemed to Rost\xc3\xb3v. He put his horse to a trot to\navoid seeing all these suffering men, and he felt afraid\xe2\x80\x94afraid not\nfor his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not\nstand the sight of these unfortunates.\n\nThe French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and\nwounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant\nriding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots. The\nsensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around\nhim merged in Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s mind into a single feeling of terror and pity\nfor himself. He remembered his mother\xe2\x80\x99s last letter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would she\nfeel,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cif she saw me here now on this field with the\ncannon aimed at me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from\nthe field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less\ndisordered. The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire\nsounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle\nwas lost. No one whom Rost\xc3\xb3v asked could tell him where the Emperor\nor Kut\xc3\xbazov was. Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was\ncorrect, others that it was not, and explained the false rumor that had\nspread by the fact that the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s carriage had really galloped\nfrom the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal\nCount Tolst\xc3\xb3y, who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s suite. One officer told Rost\xc3\xb3v that he had seen someone\nfrom headquarters behind the village to the left, and thither Rost\xc3\xb3v\nrode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. When\nhe had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian\ntroops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men\non horseback facing the ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed\nfamiliar to Rost\xc3\xb3v; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which\nRost\xc3\xb3v fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his\nhorse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only\na little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse\xe2\x80\x99s hind hoofs.\nTurning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially\naddressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting\nthat he should do the same. The rider, whose figure seemed familiar\nto Rost\xc3\xb3v and involuntarily riveted his attention, made a gesture of\nrefusal with his head and hand and by that gesture Rost\xc3\xb3v instantly\nrecognized his lamented and adored monarch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it can\xe2\x80\x99t be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought Rost\xc3\xb3v. At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rost\xc3\xb3v\nsaw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory. The\nEmperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm,\nthe mildness of his features, was all the greater. Rost\xc3\xb3v was happy\nin the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were\nfalse. He was happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and even\nought to go straight to him and give the message Dolgor\xc3\xbakov had ordered\nhim to deliver.\n\nBut as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the\nthoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a\nchance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is\nalone with her, so Rost\xc3\xb3v, now that he had attained what he had longed\nfor more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approach\nthe Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be\ninconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of\nhis being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant or\npainful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him\nnow, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight\nof him?\xe2\x80\x9d Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor\nthat he had composed in his imagination could he now recall. Those\nspeeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the\nmost part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph, generally\nwhen he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic\ndeeds, and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right\nflank now that it is nearly four o\xe2\x80\x99clock and the battle is lost?\nNo, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his\nreflections. Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind\nlook or bad opinion from him,\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v decided; and sorrowfully and\nwith a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at the\nTsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.\n\nWhile Rost\xc3\xb3v was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away,\nCaptain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the\nEmperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him\nto cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling\nunwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him.\nRost\xc3\xb3v from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke\nlong and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping,\ncovered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Toll\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I might have been in his place!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v, and hardly\nrestraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter\ndespair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.\n\nHis despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was\nthe cause of his grief.\n\nHe might... not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign. It\nwas a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not\nmade use of it.... \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. And he turned\nround and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but\nthere was no one beyond the ditch now. Only some carts and carriages\nwere passing by. From one of the drivers he learned that Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s\nstaff were not far off, in the village the vehicles were going to.\nRost\xc3\xb3v followed them. In front of him walked Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s groom leading\nhorses in horsecloths. Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old,\nbandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTit! I say, Tit!\xe2\x80\x9d said the groom.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man absent-mindedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, Tit! Thresh a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed\nin silence, and then the same joke was repeated.\n\n\nBefore five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points. More\nthan a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.\n\nPrzebysz\xc3\xa9wski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other columns\nafter losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused\nmasses.\n\nThe remains of Langeron\xe2\x80\x99s and Dokht\xc3\xbarov\xe2\x80\x99s mingled forces were\ncrowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of\nAugesd.\n\nAfter five o\xe2\x80\x99clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade\n(delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous\nbatteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directed at our\nretreating forces.\n\nIn the rearguard, Dokht\xc3\xbarov and others rallying some battalions kept up\na musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops. It\nwas growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the\nold miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully\nangling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the\nfloundering silvery fish in the watering can, on that dam over which for\nso many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully\ndriven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty\nwith flour whitening their carts\xe2\x80\x94on that narrow dam amid the wagons\nand the cannon, under the horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs and between the wagon wheels,\nmen disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one\nanother, dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to\nmove on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way.\n\nEvery ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, or\na shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and\nsplashing with blood those near them.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x94now an officer\xe2\x80\x94wounded in the arm, and on foot, with\nthe regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company,\nrepresented all that was left of that whole regiment. Impelled by the\ncrowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in\non all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a\ncannon and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon ball killed someone\nbehind them, another fell in front and splashed D\xc3\xb3lokhov with blood.\nThe crowd, pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few\nsteps, and again stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMove on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here\nanother two minutes and it is certain death,\xe2\x80\x9d thought each one.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge\nof the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the\nslippery ice that covered the millpool.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn this way!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked\nunder him; \xe2\x80\x9cturn this way!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to those with the gun. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\nbears!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it\nwould give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon even\nunder his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to the\nbank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at the\nentrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that\neveryone ducked. It flopped into something moist, and the general fell\nfrom his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a look or thought of\nraising him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear? Go\non!\xe2\x80\x9d innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck\nthe general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were\nshouting.\n\nOne of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the\nice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond.\nThe ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped\ninto the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist.\nThe nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but\nfrom behind still came the shouts: \xe2\x80\x9cOnto the ice, why do you stop? Go\non! Go on!\xe2\x80\x9d And cries of horror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers\nnear the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and\nmove on. The horses moved off the bank. The ice, that had held under\nthose on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on\nit dashed, some forward and some back, drowning one another.\n\nStill the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the\nice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered\nthe dam, the pond, and the bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nOn the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his\nhand, lay Prince Andrew Bolk\xc3\xb3nski bleeding profusely and unconsciously\nuttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.\n\nToward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did not know\nhow long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was\nalive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw\ntoday?\xe2\x80\x9d was his first thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I did not know this suffering\neither,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did not know anything, anything at all\ntill now. But where am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices\nspeaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same lofty\nsky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and\nbetween them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and did not\nsee those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up\nand stopped near him.\n\nIt was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte riding\nover the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries\nfiring at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left\non the field.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine men!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier,\nwho, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his\nstomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your\nMajesty,\xe2\x80\x9d said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were\nfiring at Augesd.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave some brought from the reserve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon, and having gone\non a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with\nthe flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had already\nbeen taken by the French as a trophy.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fine death!\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\nPrince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was\nNapoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But he\nheard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not only\ndid they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once\nforgot them. His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death,\nand he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He knew it\nwas Napoleon\xe2\x80\x94his hero\xe2\x80\x94but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him\nsuch a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now\nbetween himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over\nit. At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over\nhim, or what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing\nnear him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to\nlife, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to\nunderstand it so differently. He collected all his strength, to stir and\nutter a sound. He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan\nwhich aroused his own pity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! He is alive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cLift this young man up and\ncarry him to the dressing station.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in\nhand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.\n\nPrince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the\nterrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while\nbeing moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station.\nHe did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other\nwounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital.\nDuring this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look\nabout him and even speak.\n\nThe first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French\nconvoy officer, who said rapidly: \xe2\x80\x9cWe must halt here: the Emperor\nwill pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen\nprisoners.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army,\nthat he is probably tired of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said another officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor\nAlexander\xe2\x80\x99s Guards,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first one, indicating a Russian\nofficer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.\n\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski recognized Prince Repn\xc3\xadn whom he had met in Petersburg\nsociety. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of\nthe Horse Guards.\n\nBonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the senior?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, on seeing the prisoners.\n\nThey named the colonel, Prince Repn\xc3\xadn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the commander of the Emperor Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s regiment of Horse\nGuards?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Napoleon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI commanded a squadron,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Repn\xc3\xadn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe praise of a great commander is a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s highest reward,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Repn\xc3\xadn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bestow it with pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is that young\nman beside you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Repn\xc3\xadn named Lieutenant Sukht\xc3\xa9len.\n\nAfter looking at him Napoleon smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very young to come to meddle with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYouth is no hindrance to courage,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Sukht\xc3\xa9len in a failing\nvoice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA splendid reply!\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cYoung man, you will go far!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\neyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his\nattention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield\nand, addressing him, again used the epithet \xe2\x80\x9cyoung man\xe2\x80\x9d that was\nconnected in his memory with Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and you, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you feel, mon\nbrave?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few\nwords to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed\nstraight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that moment\nseemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his\nhero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear,\ncompared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and\nunderstood, that he could not answer him.\n\nEverything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the\nstern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood,\nsuffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of\ngreatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and\nthe still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one\nalive could understand or explain.\n\nThe Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of\nthe officers as he went: \xe2\x80\x9cHave these gentlemen attended to and taken\nto my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds. Au revoir,\nPrince Repn\xc3\xadn!\xe2\x80\x9d and he spurred his horse and galloped away.\n\nHis face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.\n\nThe soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the\nlittle gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother\xe2\x80\x99s neck, but\nseeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to\nreturn the holy image.\n\nPrince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the\nlittle icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest\noutside his uniform.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be good,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his\nsister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, \xe2\x80\x9cit\nwould be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to\nMary. How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life,\nand what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I\nshould be if I could now say: \xe2\x80\x98Lord, have mercy on me!\xe2\x80\x99... But to\nwhom should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible,\nwhich I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in\nwords\xe2\x80\x94the Great All or Nothing-\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cor to\nthat God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing\ncertain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I\nunderstand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but\nall-important.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain;\nhis feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his father,\nwife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night\nbefore the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and\nabove all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious\nfancies.\n\nThe quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented\nitself to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that\nlittle Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of\nshortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments\nhad followed, and only the heavens promised peace. Toward morning\nall these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of\nunconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s doctor,\nLarrey, was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a nervous, bilious subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said Larrey, \xe2\x80\x9cand will not\nrecover.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of\nthe inhabitants of the district.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR: 1806\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nEarly in the year 1806 Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v returned home on leave. Den\xc3\xadsov\nwas going home to Vor\xc3\xb3nezh and Rost\xc3\xb3v persuaded him to travel with him\nas far as Moscow and to stay with him there. Meeting a comrade at\nthe last post station but one before Moscow, Den\xc3\xadsov had drunk three\nbottles of wine with him and, despite the jolting ruts across the\nsnow-covered road, did not once wake up on the way to Moscow, but lay\nat the bottom of the sleigh beside Rost\xc3\xb3v, who grew more and more\nimpatient the nearer they got to Moscow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets,\nshops, bakers\xe2\x80\x99 signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nRost\xc3\xb3v, when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and\nthey had entered Moscow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDen\xc3\xadsov! We\xe2\x80\x99re here! He\xe2\x80\x99s asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, leaning forward\nwith his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed\nof the sleigh.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov gave no answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, Zakh\xc3\xa1r,\nhas his stand, and there\xe2\x80\x99s Zakh\xc3\xa1r himself and still the same horse!\nAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Can\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou hurry up? Now then!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich house is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the driver.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that one, right at the end, the big one. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s our house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, it\xe2\x80\x99s our house!\nDen\xc3\xadsov, Den\xc3\xadsov! We\xe2\x80\x99re almost there!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDm\xc3\xadtri,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v to his valet on the box, \xe2\x80\x9cthose lights are\nin our house, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a light in your father\xe2\x80\x99s study.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they\xe2\x80\x99ve not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Mind now,\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t forget to put out my new coat,\xe2\x80\x9d added Rost\xc3\xb3v, fingering his\nnew mustache. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, get on,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the driver. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\nwake up, V\xc3\xa1ska!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, turning to Den\xc3\xadsov, whose head\nwas again nodding. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, get on! You shall have three rubles for\nvodka\xe2\x80\x94get on!\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v shouted, when the sleigh was only three\nhouses from his door. It seemed to him the horses were not moving at\nall. At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and\nRost\xc3\xb3v saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster\nbroken off, the porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He\nsprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house\nstood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it.\nThere was no one in the hall. \xe2\x80\x9cOh God! Is everyone all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then\nimmediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of\nthe familiar staircase. The well-known old door handle, which always\nangered the countess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely\nas ever. A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom.\n\nOld Michael was asleep on the chest. Prok\xc3\xb3fy, the footman, who was\nso strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat\nplaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the opening\ndoor and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one\nof delighted amazement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious heavens! The young count!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, recognizing his\nyoung master. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be? My treasure!\xe2\x80\x9d and Prok\xc3\xb3fy, trembling with\nexcitement, rushed toward the drawing room door, probably in order to\nannounce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll well?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rost\xc3\xb3v, drawing away his arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, God be thanked! Yes! They\xe2\x80\x99ve just finished supper. Let me have\na look at you, your excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs everything quite all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord be thanked, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, who had completely forgotten Den\xc3\xadsov, not wishing anyone to\nforestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the\nlarge dark ballroom. All was the same: there were the same old card\ntables and the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had\nalready seen the young master, and, before he had reached the drawing\nroom, something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began\nhugging and kissing him. Another and yet another creature of the same\nkind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more kissing,\nmore outcries, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish which was\nPapa, which Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and which P\xc3\xa9tya. Everyone shouted, talked, and\nkissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not there, he noticed\nthat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is... our own... K\xc3\xb3lya, * dear fellow... How he has\nchanged!... Where are the candles?... Tea!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me, kiss me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest... and me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, P\xc3\xa9tya, Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, V\xc3\xa9ra, and the old count\nwere all hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the\nroom, exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd me too!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face\nwith kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang away and\npranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly.\n\nAll around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all around\nwere lips seeking a kiss.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss,\nlooked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she\nlonged. S\xc3\xb3nya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at\nthis moment of happy, rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not taking\nher eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave her a\ngrateful look, but was still expectant and looking for someone. The old\ncountess had not yet come. But now steps were heard at the door, steps\nso rapid that they could hardly be his mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nYet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made since\nhe had left. All the others let him go, and he ran to her. When they\nmet, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not lift her face, but\nonly pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar\xe2\x80\x99s jacket. Den\xc3\xadsov,\nwho had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped\nhis eyes at the sight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVas\xc3\xadli Den\xc3\xadsov, your son\xe2\x80\x99s friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, introducing\nhimself to the count, who was looking inquiringly at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are most welcome! I know, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, kissing and\nembracing Den\xc3\xadsov. \xe2\x80\x9cNicholas wrote us... Nat\xc3\xa1sha, V\xc3\xa9ra, look! Here\nis Den\xc3\xadsov!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling Den\xc3\xadsov!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Nat\xc3\xa1sha, beside herself with rapture,\nspringing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him. This\nescapade made everybody feel confused. Den\xc3\xadsov blushed too, but smiled\nand, taking Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s hand, kissed it.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rost\xc3\xb3vs all\ngathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.\n\nThe old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every\nmoment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every\nmovement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully adoring\neyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest\nto him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea,\nhandkerchief, and pipe.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first\nmoment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed\ninsufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more.\n\nNext morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers slept\ntill ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\n\nIn the room next to their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers,\nsatchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly\ncleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The servants\nwere bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their\nwell-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, Gw\xc3\xadska\xe2\x80\x94my pipe!\xe2\x80\x9d came Vas\xc3\xadli Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s husky voice.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWost\xc3\xb3v, get up!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his\ndisheveled head from the hot pillow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, is it late?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLate! It\xe2\x80\x99s nearly ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\nA rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of\ngirls\xe2\x80\x99 voices came from the adjoining room. The door was opened a\ncrack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair,\nand merry faces. It was Nat\xc3\xa1sha, S\xc3\xb3nya, and P\xc3\xa9tya, who had come to\nsee whether they were getting up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas! Get up!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s voice was again heard at the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirectly!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMeanwhile, P\xc3\xa9tya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer room,\nwith the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother, and\nforgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed,\nopened the bedroom door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this your saber?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\nThe girls sprang aside. Den\xc3\xadsov hid his hairy legs under the blanket,\nlooking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The door, having let\nP\xc3\xa9tya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came from behind it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this your saber?\xe2\x80\x9d asked P\xc3\xa9tya. \xe2\x80\x9cOr is it yours?\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\naddressing the black-mustached Den\xc3\xadsov with servile deference.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing gown,\nand went out. Nat\xc3\xa1sha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting\nher foot into the other. S\xc3\xb3nya, when he came in, was twirling round and\nwas about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down. They were\ndressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and\nbright. S\xc3\xb3nya ran away, but Nat\xc3\xa1sha, taking her brother\xe2\x80\x99s arm, led\nhim into the sitting room, where they began talking. They hardly gave\none another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand\nlittle matters which could not interest anyone but themselves. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nlaughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because what\nthey were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable\nto control her joy which expressed itself by laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how nice, how splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to everything.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of love, that\nchildlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left\nhome now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his\nsoul and his face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but listen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cnow you are quite a man, aren\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou? I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully glad you\xe2\x80\x99re my brother.\xe2\x80\x9d She touched his\nmustache. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know what you men are like. Are you the same as\nwe? No?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did S\xc3\xb3nya run away?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes! That\xe2\x80\x99s a whole long story! How are you going to speak to\nher\xe2\x80\x94thou or you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs may happen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, call her you, please! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about it some other\ntime. No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you now. You know S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s my dearest friend.\nSuch a friend that I burned my arm for her sake. Look here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long,\nslender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covered\neven by a ball dress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated a ruler in the\nfire and pressed it there!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what used\nto be his old schoolroom, and looking into Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s wildly bright\neyes, Rost\xc3\xb3v re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no\nmeaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the best joys of his life;\nand the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem\nto him senseless, he understood and was not surprised at it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and is that all?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just\nnonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does it\nfor life, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that, I forget quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she loves me and you like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha suddenly flushed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you remember before you went away?... Well, she says you are to\nforget all that.... She says: \xe2\x80\x98I shall love him always, but let him be\nfree.\xe2\x80\x99 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\nasked Nat\xc3\xa1sha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what\nshe was now saying she had talked of before, with tears.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v became thoughtful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never go back on my word,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, S\xc3\xb3nya is so\ncharming that only a fool would renounce such happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9cshe and I have already talked it over.\nWe knew you\xe2\x80\x99d say so. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t do, because you see, if you say\nthat\xe2\x80\x94if you consider yourself bound by your promise\xe2\x80\x94it will seem as\nif she had not meant it seriously. It makes it as if you were marrying\nher because you must, and that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v saw that it had been well considered by them. S\xc3\xb3nya had already\nstruck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, when he had caught\na glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She was a charming girl\nof sixteen, evidently passionately in love with him (he did not doubt\nthat for an instant). Why should he not love her now, and even marry\nher, Rost\xc3\xb3v thought, but just now there were so many other pleasures\nand interests before him! \xe2\x80\x9cYes, they have taken a wise decision,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cI must remain free.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, that\xe2\x80\x99s excellent,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll talk it over\nlater on. Oh, how glad I am to have you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and are you still true to Bor\xc3\xads?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think\nabout him or anyone else, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! Then what are you up to now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and a happy smile lit up her face. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\nyou seen Duport?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot seen Duport\xe2\x80\x94the famous dancer? Well then, you won\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m up to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCurving her arms, Nat\xc3\xa1sha held out her skirts as dancers do, ran back\na few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply\ntogether, and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, I\xe2\x80\x99m standing! See!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, but could not maintain herself\non her toes any longer. \xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m up to! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never\nmarry anyone, but will be a dancer. Only don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v laughed so loud and merrily that Den\xc3\xadsov, in his bedroom, felt\nenvious and Nat\xc3\xa1sha could not help joining in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it\xe2\x80\x99s nice?\xe2\x80\x9d she kept repeating.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNice! And so you no longer wish to marry Bor\xc3\xads?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha flared up. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry anyone. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\nhim so when I see him!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s all rubbish,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha chattered on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is\nDen\xc3\xadsov nice?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very terrible,\nDen\xc3\xadsov?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy terrible?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, V\xc3\xa1ska is a splendid\nfellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou call him V\xc3\xa1ska? That\xe2\x80\x99s funny! And is he very nice?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, be quick. We\xe2\x80\x99ll all have breakfast together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Nat\xc3\xa1sha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, like a ballet\ndancer, but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile. When\nRost\xc3\xb3v met S\xc3\xb3nya in the drawing room, he reddened. He did not know\nhow to behave with her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of\nmeeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could not\nbe done; he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was\nlooking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave\nwith her. He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as\nyou\xe2\x80\x94S\xc3\xb3nya. But their eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender\nkisses. Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared, by\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s intermediacy, to remind him of his promise, and then\nthanked him for his love. His looks thanked her for offering him his\nfreedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to\nlove her, for that would be impossible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said V\xc3\xa9ra, selecting a moment when all were\nsilent, \xe2\x80\x9cthat S\xc3\xb3nya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet\nlike strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nV\xc3\xa9ra\xe2\x80\x99s remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like\nmost of her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not\nonly S\xc3\xb3nya, Nicholas, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha, but even the old countess,\nwho\xe2\x80\x94dreading this love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making\na brilliant match\xe2\x80\x94blushed like a girl.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov, to Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, appeared in the drawing room with\npomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as\nhe made himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the\nladies and gentlemen than Rost\xc3\xb3v had ever expected to see him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOn his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v was welcomed\nby his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling\nNik\xc3\xb3lenka; by his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young\nman; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good\ndancer, and one of the best matches in the city.\n\nThe Rost\xc3\xb3vs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had money enough\nthat year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas,\nacquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the\nlatest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the\nlatest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs,\npassed his time very gaily. After a short period of adapting himself\nto the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be\nat home again. He felt that he had grown up and matured very much. His\ndespair at failing in a Scripture examination, his borrowing money from\nGavr\xc3\xadl to pay a sleigh driver, his kissing S\xc3\xb3nya on the sly\xe2\x80\x94he now\nrecalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind.\nNow he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket laced with silver, and\nwearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to soldiers for bravery in\naction, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and respected racing\nmen was training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a lady on one\nof the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led the mazurka\nat the Arkh\xc3\xa1rovs\xe2\x80\x99 ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal\nK\xc3\xa1menski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate terms with a\ncolonel of forty to whom Den\xc3\xadsov had introduced him.\n\nHis passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But still, as\nhe did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke\nabout him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he\nhad not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the\nEmperor not everyone could understand, and with his whole soul he shared\nthe adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of\nas the \xe2\x80\x9cangel incarnate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDuring Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army, he\ndid not draw closer to S\xc3\xb3nya, but rather drifted away from her. She was\nvery pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him, but he was\nat the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no\ntime for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and\nprizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things. When he\nthought of S\xc3\xb3nya, during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself,\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there will be, and there are, many more such girls somewhere whom\nI do not yet know. There will be time enough to think about love when I\nwant to, but now I have no time.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides, it seemed to him that the\nsociety of women was rather derogatory to his manhood. He went to balls\nand into ladies\xe2\x80\x99 society with an affectation of doing so against his\nwill. The races, the English Club, sprees with Den\xc3\xadsov, and visits to\na certain house\xe2\x80\x94that was another matter and quite the thing for a\ndashing young hussar!\n\nAt the beginning of March, old Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v was very busy\narranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n at the English Club.\n\nThe count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving\norders to the club steward and to the famous Feokt\xc3\xadst, the club\xe2\x80\x99s\nhead cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and\nfish for this dinner. The count had been a member and on the committee\nof the club from the day it was founded. To him the club entrusted the\narrangement of the festival in honor of Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, for few men knew\nso well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale,\nand still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of\ntheir own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete.\nThe club cook and the steward listened to the count\xe2\x80\x99s orders with\npleased faces, for they knew that under no other management could they\nso easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing\nseveral thousand rubles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, mind and have cocks\xe2\x80\x99 comb in the turtle soup, you\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we have three cold dishes then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the cook.\n\nThe count considered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t have less\xe2\x80\x94yes, three... the mayonnaise, that\xe2\x80\x99s one,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid he, bending down a finger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen am I to order those large sterlets?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the steward.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped if they won\xe2\x80\x99t take less. Ah, dear me! I\nwas forgetting. We must have another entr\xc3\xa9e. Ah, goodness gracious!\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe clutched at his head. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is going to get me the flowers? Dm\xc3\xadtri!\nEh, Dm\xc3\xadtri! Gallop off to our Moscow estate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the factotum\nwho appeared at his call. \xe2\x80\x9cHurry off and tell Maks\xc3\xadm, the gardener,\nto set the serfs to work. Say that everything out of the hothouses must\nbe brought here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two hundred pots\nhere on Friday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving given several more orders, he was about to go to his \xe2\x80\x9clittle\ncountess\xe2\x80\x9d to have a rest, but remembering something else of\nimportance, he returned again, called back the cook and the club\nsteward, and again began giving orders. A light footstep and the\nclinking of spurs were heard at the door, and the young count, handsome,\nrosy, with a dark little mustache, evidently rested and made sleeker by\nhis easy life in Moscow, entered the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my boy, my head\xe2\x80\x99s in a whirl!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man with a smile,\nas if he felt a little confused before his son. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, if you would\nonly help a bit! I must have singers too. I shall have my own orchestra,\nbut shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we get the gypsy singers as well? You military men like\nthat sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, Papa, I believe Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n worried himself less before\nthe battle of Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern than you do now,\xe2\x80\x9d said his son with a\nsmile.\n\nThe old count pretended to be angry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you talk, but try it yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and respectful\nexpression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and\nson.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feokt\xc3\xadst?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe. \xe2\x80\x9cLaughing at us old fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good\ndinner, but providing it and serving it all up, that\xe2\x80\x99s not their\nbusiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, that\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing\nhis son by both hands, he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you, so take the\nsleigh and pair at once, and go to Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s, and tell him \xe2\x80\x98Count\nIly\xc3\xa1 has sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples.\xe2\x80\x99 We\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get them from anyone else. He\xe2\x80\x99s not there himself, so you\xe2\x80\x99ll\nhave to go in and ask the princesses; and from there go on to the\nRasguly\xc3\xa1y\xe2\x80\x94the coachman Ip\xc3\xa1tka knows\xe2\x80\x94and look up the gypsy\nIly\xc3\xbashka, the one who danced at Count Orl\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s, you remember, in a\nwhite Cossack coat, and bring him along to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nicholas,\nlaughing. \xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike,\npreoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon the count in his\ndressing gown every day, he invariably became confused and begged her to\nexcuse his costume.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter at all, my dear count,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, meekly closing her\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s myself. Pierre has arrived, and\nnow we shall get anything we want from his hothouses. I have to see him\nin any case. He has forwarded me a letter from Bor\xc3\xads. Thank God, Bor\xc3\xads\nis now on the staff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe count was delighted at Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s taking upon herself one\nof his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell Bez\xc3\xbakhov to come. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put his name down. Is his wife with\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was depicted\non her face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf what\nwe hear is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing\nwhen we were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul\nas young Bez\xc3\xbakhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give\nhim what consolation I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWh-what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked both the young and old Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna sighed deeply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xc3\xb3lokhov, Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna\xe2\x80\x99s son,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a mysterious\nwhisper, \xe2\x80\x9chas compromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him\nup, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here\nand that daredevil after her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, wishing to show\nher sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile\nbetraying her sympathy for the \xe2\x80\x9cdaredevil,\xe2\x80\x9d as she called D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear! But still tell him to come to the club\xe2\x80\x94it will all blow\nover. It will be a tremendous banquet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext day, the third of March, soon after one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, two hundred and\nfifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the\nguest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, to\ndinner.\n\nOn the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow had\nbeen bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to victories\nthat on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it,\nwhile others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an\nevent. In the English Club, where all who were distinguished, important,\nand well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in\nDecember, nothing was said about the war and the last battle, as\nthough all were in a conspiracy of silence. The men who set the tone\nin conversation\xe2\x80\x94Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn, Prince Y\xc3\xbari Dolgor\xc3\xbakov, Val\xc3\xbaev,\nCount Mark\xc3\xb3v, and Prince Vy\xc3\xa1zemski\xe2\x80\x94did not show themselves at the\nclub, but met in private houses in intimate circles, and the\nMoscovites who took their opinions from others\xe2\x80\x94Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v among\nthem\xe2\x80\x94remained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject\nof the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that something was\nwrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult, and so it was best\nto be silent. But after a while, just as a jury comes out of its room,\nthe bigwigs who guided the club\xe2\x80\x99s opinion reappeared, and everybody\nbegan speaking clearly and definitely. Reasons were found for the\nincredible, unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat,\neverything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things\nbegan to be said. These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a\ndefective commissariat, the treachery of the Pole Przebysz\xc3\xa9wski and of\nthe Frenchman Langeron, Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s incapacity, and (it was whispered)\nthe youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted worthless\nand insignificant people. But the army, the Russian army, everyone\ndeclared, was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor. The\nsoldiers, officers, and generals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was\nPrince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, distinguished by his Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern affair and by\nthe retreat from Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column\nunbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous\nas his own. What also conduced to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s being selected as\nMoscow\xe2\x80\x99s hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city\nand was a stranger there. In his person, honor was shown to a simple\nfighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one\nwho was associated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of\nSuv\xc3\xb3rov. Moreover, paying such honor to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n was the best way of\nexpressing disapproval and dislike of Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad there been no Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, it would have been necessary to\ninvent him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wit Shinsh\xc3\xadn, parodying the words of Voltaire.\nKut\xc3\xbazov no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers,\ncalling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.\n\nAll Moscow repeated Prince Dolgor\xc3\xbakov\xe2\x80\x99s saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you go on\nmodeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting\nconsolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and the\nwords of Rostopch\xc3\xadn, that French soldiers have to be incited to battle\nby highfalutin words, and Germans by logical arguments to show them\nthat it is more dangerous to run away than to advance, but that Russian\nsoldiers only need to be restrained and held back! On all sides, new and\nfresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by\nour officers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a standard, another\nhad killed five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded.\nBerg was mentioned, by those who did not know him, as having, when\nwounded in the right hand, taken his sword in the left, and gone\nforward. Of Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, nothing was said, and only those who knew him\nintimately regretted that he had died so young, leaving a pregnant wife\nwith his eccentric father.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nOn that third of March, all the rooms in the English Club were filled\nwith a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming in springtime.\nThe members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither, sat,\nstood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in evening dress,\nand a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaft\xc3\xa1ns.\nPowdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings,\nstood at every door anxiously noting visitors\xe2\x80\x99 every movement in order\nto offer their services. Most of those present were elderly, respected\nmen with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures\nand voices. This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual\nplaces and met in certain habitual groups. A minority of those present\nwere casual guests\xe2\x80\x94chiefly young men, among whom were Den\xc3\xadsov,\nRost\xc3\xb3v, and D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x94who was now again an officer in the Sem\xc3\xabnov\nregiment. The faces of these young people, especially those who were\nmilitary men, bore that expression of condescending respect for their\nelders which seems to say to the older generation, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are prepared to\nrespect and honor you, but all the same remember that the future belongs\nto us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNesv\xc3\xadtski was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who at his\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles,\nwent about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull. Here,\nas elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to\nhis wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people, he\ntreated them with absent-minded contempt.\n\nBy his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his wealth\nand connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests, and\nso he went from one group to another. Some of the most important old men\nwere the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully\nto hear the voices of well-known men. The largest circles formed round\nCount Rostopch\xc3\xadn, Val\xc3\xbaev, and Nar\xc3\xbdshkin. Rostopch\xc3\xadn was describing\nhow the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to\nforce their way through them with bayonets.\n\nVal\xc3\xbaev was confidentially telling that Uv\xc3\xa1rov had been sent from\nPetersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.\n\nIn the third circle, Nar\xc3\xbdshkin was speaking of the meeting of the\nAustrian Council of War at which Suv\xc3\xb3rov crowed like a cock in reply to\nthe nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. Shinsh\xc3\xadn, standing close\nby, tried to make a joke, saying that Kut\xc3\xbazov had evidently failed to\nlearn from Suv\xc3\xb3rov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a\ncock, but the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him\nfeel that in that place and on that day, it was improper to speak so of\nKut\xc3\xbazov.\n\nCount Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft\nboots between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the\nimportant and unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all\nequals, while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up\nyoung son, resting on him and winking joyfully at him. Young Rost\xc3\xb3v\nstood at a window with D\xc3\xb3lokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately\nmade and highly valued. The old count came up to them and pressed\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease come and visit us... you know my brave boy... been together\nout there... both playing the hero... Ah, Vas\xc3\xadli Ign\xc3\xa1tovich...\nHow d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, old fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to an old man who was\npassing, but before he had finished his greeting there was a general\nstir, and a footman who had run in announced, with a frightened face:\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s arrived!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and\xe2\x80\x94like rye shaken together\nin a shovel\xe2\x80\x94the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms\ncame together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the\nballroom.\n\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword,\nwhich, in accord with the club custom, he had given up to the hall\nporter. He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip\nover his shoulder, as when Rost\xc3\xb3v had seen him on the eve of the battle\nof Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign\nOrders, and the Star of St. George on his left breast. Evidently just\nbefore coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed,\nwhich changed his appearance for the worse. There was something na\xc3\xafvely\nfestive in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and virile\nfeatures, gave him a rather comical expression. Beklesh\xc3\xabv and Theodore\nUv\xc3\xa1rov, who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him,\nas the guest of honor, to enter first. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n was embarrassed, not\nwishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and this caused some delay\nat the doors, but after all he did at last enter first. He walked shyly\nand awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room, not knowing\nwhat to do with his hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed\nfield under fire, as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at\nSch\xc3\xb6n Grabern\xe2\x80\x94and he would have found that easier. The committeemen\nmet him at the first door and, expressing their delight at seeing such a\nhighly honored guest, took possession of him as it were, without waiting\nfor his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It was\nat first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of\nmembers and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look\nat Bagrati\xc3\xb3n over each other\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, as if he were some rare\nanimal. Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v, laughing and repeating the words, \xe2\x80\x9cMake\nway, dear boy! Make way, make way!\xe2\x80\x9d pushed through the crowd more\nenergetically than anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, and\nseated them on the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members\nof the club, beset the new arrivals. Count Ily\xc3\xa1, again thrusting his\nway through the crowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a\nminute later with another committeeman, carrying a large silver salver\nwhich he presented to Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n. On the salver lay some verses\ncomposed and printed in the hero\xe2\x80\x99s honor. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, on seeing the\nsalver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help. But all eyes\ndemanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in their power, he\nresolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and\nreproachfully at the count who had presented it to him. Someone\nobligingly took the dish from Bagrati\xc3\xb3n (or he would, it seemed, have\nheld it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and drew his\nattention to the verses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will read them, then!\xe2\x80\x9d Bagrati\xc3\xb3n seemed to say, and,\nfixing his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and\nserious expression. But the author himself took the verses and began\nreading them aloud. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n bowed his head and listened:\n\n   Bring glory then to Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s reign\n   And on the throne our Titus shield.\n   A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,\n   A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!\n   E\xe2\x80\x99en fortunate Napoleon\n   Knows by experience, now, Bagrati\xc3\xb3n,\n   And dare not Herculean Russians trouble...\n\nBut before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced\nthat dinner was ready! The door opened, and from the dining room came\nthe resounding strains of the polonaise:\n\n   Conquest\xe2\x80\x99s joyful thunder waken,\n   Triumph, valiant Russians, now!...\n\nand Count Rost\xc3\xb3v, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading\nhis verses, bowed to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner\nwas more important than verses, and Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, again preceding all the\nrest, went in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between\ntwo Alexanders\xe2\x80\x94Beklesh\xc3\xabv and Nar\xc3\xbdshkin\xe2\x80\x94which was a significant\nallusion to the name of the sovereign. Three hundred persons took their\nseats in the dining room, according to their rank and importance: the\nmore important nearer to the honored guest, as naturally as water flows\ndeepest where the land lies lowest.\n\nJust before dinner, Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v presented his son to Bagrati\xc3\xb3n,\nwho recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward,\nas were all the words he spoke that day, and Count Ily\xc3\xa1 looked joyfully\nand proudly around while Bagrati\xc3\xb3n spoke to his son.\n\nNicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v, with Den\xc3\xadsov and his new acquaintance, D\xc3\xb3lokhov, sat\nalmost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince\nNesv\xc3\xadtski. Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v with the other members of the committee\nsat facing Bagrati\xc3\xb3n and, as the very personification of Moscow\nhospitality, did the honors to the prince.\n\nHis efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and the\nother fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the\nend of the meal. He winked at the butler, whispered directions to the\nfootmen, and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety. Everything\nwas excellent. With the second course, a gigantic sterlet (at sight of\nwhich Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v blushed with self-conscious pleasure), the footmen\nbegan popping corks and filling the champagne glasses. After the fish,\nwhich made a certain sensation, the count exchanged glances with\nthe other committeemen. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be many toasts, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to\nbegin,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, and taking up his glass, he rose. All were\nsilent, waiting for what he would say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and at the\nsame moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm.\nThe band immediately struck up \xe2\x80\x9cConquest\xe2\x80\x99s joyful thunder\nwaken...\xe2\x80\x9d All rose and cried \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d Bagrati\xc3\xb3n also rose and\nshouted \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted\nit on the field at Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern. Young Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s ecstatic voice\ncould be heard above the three hundred others. He nearly wept. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the\nhealth of our Sovereign, the Emperor!\xe2\x80\x9d he roared, \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nemptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many followed\nhis example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time. When the\nvoices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody\nsat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging\nremarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside\nhis plate, and proposed a toast, \xe2\x80\x9cTo the health of the hero of our\nlast campaign, Prince Peter Iv\xc3\xa1novich Bagrati\xc3\xb3n!\xe2\x80\x9d and again his blue\neyes grew moist. \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the three hundred voices again,\nbut instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by Paul\nIv\xc3\xa1novich Kut\xc3\xbazov:\n\n   Russians! O\xe2\x80\x99er all barriers on!\n   Courage conquest guarantees;\n   Have we not Bagrati\xc3\xb3n?\n   He brings foemen to their knees,... etc.\n\nAs soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was proposed\nand Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v became more and more moved, more glass was\nsmashed, and the shouting grew louder. They drank to Beklesh\xc3\xabv,\nNar\xc3\xbdshkin, Uv\xc3\xa1rov, Dolgor\xc3\xbakov, Apr\xc3\xa1ksin, Val\xc3\xbaev, to the committee,\nto all the club members and to all the club guests, and finally to\nCount Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v separately, as the organizer of the banquet. At that\ntoast, the count took out his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept\noutright.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nPierre sat opposite D\xc3\xb3lokhov and Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v. As usual, he ate and\ndrank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately noticed that\nsome great change had come over him that day. He was silent all through\ndinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and\na look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his\nnose. His face was depressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and hear\nnothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some\ndepressing and unsolved problem.\n\nThe unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the\nprincess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s intimacy with\nhis wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which\nin the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw\nbadly through his spectacles, but that his wife\xe2\x80\x99s connection with\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov was a secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely\ndisbelieved both the princess\xe2\x80\x99 hints and the letter, but he feared\nnow to look at D\xc3\xb3lokhov, who was sitting opposite him. Every time\nhe chanced to meet D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt\nsomething terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly\naway. Involuntarily recalling his wife\xe2\x80\x99s past and her relations with\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be\ntrue, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife.\nHe involuntarily remembered how D\xc3\xb3lokhov, who had fully recovered his\nformer position after the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come\nto him. Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon\ncompanion, D\xc3\xb3lokhov had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put\nhim up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne had smilingly\nexpressed disapproval of D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s living at their house, and how\ncynically D\xc3\xb3lokhov had praised his wife\xe2\x80\x99s beauty to him and from that\ntime till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is very handsome,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know him. It\nwould be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule\nme, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him,\nand helped him. I know and understand what a spice that would add to the\npleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it were true,\nbut I do not believe it. I have no right to, and can\xe2\x80\x99t, believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe remembered the expression D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s face assumed in his moments\nof cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them\ninto the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any\nreason, or shot a post-boy\xe2\x80\x99s horse with a pistol. That expression\nwas often on D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s face when looking at him. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is a\nbully,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cto kill a man means nothing to him. It must\nseem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him.\nHe must think that I, too, am afraid of him\xe2\x80\x94and in fact I am afraid of\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous\nrising in his soul. D\xc3\xb3lokhov, Den\xc3\xadsov, and Rost\xc3\xb3v were now sitting\nopposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rost\xc3\xb3v was talking merrily to his\ntwo friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious\nduelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at\nPierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very\nnoticeable one at the dinner. Rost\xc3\xb3v looked inimically at Pierre,\nfirst because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the\nhusband of a beauty, and in a word\xe2\x80\x94an old woman; and secondly because\nPierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized\nRost\xc3\xb3v and had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nhealth was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his\nglass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you about?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Rost\xc3\xb3v, looking at him in an ecstasy\nof exasperation. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you hear it\xe2\x80\x99s His Majesty the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nhealth?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting till\nall were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. But Rost\xc3\xb3v was otherwise\nengaged; he was shouting \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you renew the acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov to Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound him, he\xe2\x80\x99s a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne should make up to the husbands of pretty women,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\nPierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking\nabout him. He reddened and turned away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now to the health of handsome women!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov, and\nwith a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of\nhis mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s to the health of lovely women, Peterkin\xe2\x80\x94and their\nlovers!\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\nPierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets\nwith Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the\nprincipal guests. He was just going to take it when D\xc3\xb3lokhov, leaning\nacross, snatched it from his hand and began reading it. Pierre looked\nat D\xc3\xb3lokhov and his eyes dropped, the something terrible and monstrous\nthat had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him.\nHe leaned his whole massive body across the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you take it?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\nHearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesv\xc3\xadtski and the\nneighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bez\xc3\xbakhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t! Don\xe2\x80\x99t! What are you about?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered their frightened\nvoices.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that\nsmile of his which seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! This is what I like!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shan\xe2\x80\x99t have it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said distinctly.\n\nPale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!\xe2\x80\x9d he ejaculated, and,\npushing back his chair, he rose from the table.\n\nAt the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt\nthat the question of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s guilt which had been tormenting him\nthe whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative.\nHe hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s\nrequest that he would take no part in the matter, Rost\xc3\xb3v agreed to be\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for\nthe duel with Nesv\xc3\xadtski, Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s second. Pierre went home, but\nRost\xc3\xb3v with D\xc3\xb3lokhov and Den\xc3\xadsov stayed on at the club till late,\nlistening to the gypsies and other singers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, till tomorrow at Sok\xc3\xb3lniki,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov, as he took\nleave of Rost\xc3\xb3v in the club porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you feel quite calm?\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v asked.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov paused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two\nwords. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write\naffectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be\nkilled, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm\nintention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and\nthen all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostrom\xc3\xa1 used to tell\nme. \xe2\x80\x98Everyone fears a bear,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98but when you see one your\nfear\xe2\x80\x99s all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!\xe2\x80\x99\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is with me. \xc3\x80 demain, mon cher.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n    * Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.\n\nNext day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesv\xc3\xadtski drove to the\nSok\xc3\xb3lniki forest and found D\xc3\xb3lokhov, Den\xc3\xadsov, and Rost\xc3\xb3v already\nthere. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which\nhad no connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow.\nHe had evidently not slept that night. He looked about distractedly and\nscrewed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely absorbed\nby two considerations: his wife\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, of which after his sleepless\nnight he had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was\nnothing to him.... \xe2\x80\x9cI should perhaps have done the same thing in his\nplace,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s even certain that I should have done\nthe same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I shall kill him, or\nhe will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee. Can\xe2\x80\x99t I go away from\nhere, run away, bury myself somewhere?\xe2\x80\x9d passed through his mind. But\njust at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in a\nparticularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired the respect of\nthe onlookers, \xe2\x80\x9cWill it be long? Are things ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers,\nand the pistols loaded, Nesv\xc3\xadtski went up to Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not be doing my duty, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in timid tones,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done\nme in choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very\ngrave, moment I did not tell you the whole truth. I think there is no\nsufficient ground for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it....\nYou were not right, not quite in the right, you were impetuous...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, it is horribly stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent\nwill accept them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nesv\xc3\xadtski (who like the others concerned in\nthe affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that\nthe affair had come to an actual duel). \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Count, it is much\nmore honorable to admit one\xe2\x80\x99s mistake than to let matters become\nirreparable. There was no insult on either side. Allow me to\nconvey....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! What is there to talk about?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all the\nsame.... Is everything ready?\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly tell me where to go\nand where to shoot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.\n\nHe took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the\ntrigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his hand\xe2\x80\x94a fact that he\ndid not wish to confess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo apologies, none whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov to Den\xc3\xadsov (who on\nhis side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to\nthe appointed place.\n\nThe spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road,\nwhere the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest\ncovered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up during the\nlast few days. The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther\nedge of the clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces, left tracks in\nthe deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and\nNesv\xc3\xadtski\xe2\x80\x99s and D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s sabers, which were stuck into the\nground ten paces apart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and misty; at\nforty paces\xe2\x80\x99 distance nothing could be seen. For three minutes all had\nbeen ready, but they still delayed and all were silent.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, begin!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling\nof dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly begun\ncould no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s will.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov first went to the barrier and announced: \xe2\x80\x9cAs the\nadve\xe2\x80\x99sawies have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. Take your\npistols, and at the word thwee begin to advance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO-ne! T-wo! Thwee!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted angrily and stepped aside.\n\nThe combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to\none another, beginning to see one another through the mist. They had the\nright to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier. D\xc3\xb3lokhov\nwalked slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his\nbright, sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist\xe2\x80\x99s face. His mouth wore\nits usual semblance of a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I can fire when I like!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, and at the word\n\xe2\x80\x9cthree,\xe2\x80\x9d he went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and\nstepping into the deep snow. He held the pistol in his right hand at\narm\xe2\x80\x99s length, apparently afraid of shooting himself with it. His left\nhand he held carefully back, because he wished to support his right\nhand with it and knew he must not do so. Having advanced six paces and\nstrayed off the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet,\nthen quickly glanced at D\xc3\xb3lokhov and, bending his finger as he had been\nshown, fired. Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shuddered\nat the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations, stood still. The\nsmoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing anything\nfor an instant, but there was no second report as he had expected. He\nonly heard D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s hurried steps, and his figure came in view\nthrough the smoke. He was pressing one hand to his left side, while\nthe other clutched his drooping pistol. His face was pale. Rost\xc3\xb3v ran\ntoward him and said something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-o-o!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered D\xc3\xb3lokhov through his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cno, it\xe2\x80\x99s not\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the\nsaber, he sank on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he wiped\nit on his coat and supported himself with it. His frowning face was\npallid and quivered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlea...\xe2\x80\x9d began D\xc3\xb3lokhov, but could not at first pronounce the\nword.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease,\xe2\x80\x9d he uttered with an effort.\n\nPierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward D\xc3\xb3lokhov and\nwas about to cross the space between the barriers, when D\xc3\xb3lokhov cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your barrier!\xe2\x80\x9d and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by\nhis saber. Only ten paces divided them. D\xc3\xb3lokhov lowered his head to\nthe snow, greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself,\ndrew in his legs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity. He sucked\nand swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still\nsmiling, glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his\nremaining strength. He raised his pistol and aimed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Nesv\xc3\xadtski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCover yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d even Den\xc3\xadsov cried to his adversary.\n\nPierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs\nhelplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov and looked sorrowfully at him. Den\xc3\xadsov, Rost\xc3\xb3v, and\nNesv\xc3\xadtski closed their eyes. At the same instant they heard a report\nand D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s angry cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissed!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted D\xc3\xb3lokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards\non the snow.\n\nPierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest,\ntrampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFolly... folly! Death... lies...\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, puckering his face.\n\nNesv\xc3\xadtski stopped him and took him home.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v and Den\xc3\xadsov drove away with the wounded D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\nThe latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer\na word to the questions addressed to him. But on entering Moscow he\nsuddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took Rost\xc3\xb3v, who\nwas sitting beside him, by the hand. Rost\xc3\xb3v was struck by the\ntotally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? How do you feel?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad! But it\xe2\x80\x99s not that, my friend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov with a\ngasping voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we? In Moscow, I know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\nbut I have killed her, killed... She won\xe2\x80\x99t get over it! She won\xe2\x80\x99t\nsurvive....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov pressed Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s hand and burst into tears.\n\nWhen he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rost\xc3\xb3v that he was\nliving with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it.\nHe implored Rost\xc3\xb3v to go on and prepare her.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise\nlearned that D\xc3\xb3lokhov the brawler, D\xc3\xb3lokhov the bully, lived in Moscow\nwith an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate\nof sons and brothers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nPierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in\nMoscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after the\nduel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained in his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s room, that huge room in which Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov had died.\n\nHe lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that\nhad happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of feelings,\nthoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall\nasleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the\nroom with rapid steps. Now he seemed to see her in the early days of\ntheir marriage, with bare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on\nher face, and then immediately he saw beside her D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s handsome,\ninsolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and\nthen that same face pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when\nhe reeled and sank on the snow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI have killed her lover,\nyes, killed my wife\xe2\x80\x99s lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come\nto do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you married her,\xe2\x80\x9d answered an inner voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in what was I to blame?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIn marrying her without\nloving her; in deceiving yourself and her.\xe2\x80\x9d And he vividly recalled\nthat moment after supper at Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s, when he spoke those\nwords he had found so difficult to utter: \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt all\ncomes from that! Even then I felt it,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt then that\nit was not so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.\nParticularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of\nhow one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his\nstudy a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head\nsteward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and at\nhis dressing gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing respectful\nunderstanding of his employer\xe2\x80\x99s happiness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic beauty\nand social tact,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he; \xe2\x80\x9cbeen proud of my house, in which she\nreceived all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and beauty. So\nthis is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did not understand\nher. How often when considering her character I have told myself that\nI was to blame for not understanding her, for not understanding that\nconstant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires,\nand the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved\nwoman. Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become\nclear.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her\nnaked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but let herself be\nkissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied\nwith a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: \xe2\x80\x98Let\nhim do what he pleases,\xe2\x80\x99 she used to say of me. One day I asked her if\nshe felt any symptoms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said\nshe was not a fool to want to have children, and that she was not going\nto have any children by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the\nvulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had\nbeen brought up in the most aristocratic circles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous\npromener,\xe2\x80\x9d * she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with\nyoung and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not\nlove her.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cYou clear out of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I never loved her,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cI knew she was a\ndepraved woman,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cbut dared not admit it to myself.\nAnd now there\xe2\x80\x99s D\xc3\xb3lokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and\nperhaps dying, while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of what\nis called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their troubles. He\ndigested his sufferings alone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all, all her fault,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what of that?\nWhy did I bind myself to her? Why did I say \xe2\x80\x98Je vous aime\xe2\x80\x99 * to her,\nwhich was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must endure...\nwhat? A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s\nnonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThe slur on my name and honor\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all\napart from myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * I love you.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a\ncriminal,\xe2\x80\x9d came into Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s head, \xe2\x80\x9cand from their point of\nview they were right, as were those too who canonized him and died a\nmartyr\xe2\x80\x99s death for his sake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being\na despot. Who is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are\nalive\xe2\x80\x94live: tomorrow you\xe2\x80\x99ll die as I might have died an hour ago.\nAnd is it worth tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life\nin comparison with eternity?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections,\nshe suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had\nmost strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the\nblood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break\nand tear whatever came to his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did I tell her that \xe2\x80\x98Je\nvous aime\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he kept repeating to himself. And when he had said it\nfor the tenth time, Moli\xc3\xa8re\xe2\x80\x99s words: \xe2\x80\x9cMais que diable allait-il\nfaire dans cette gal\xc3\xa8re?\xe2\x80\x9d * occurred to him, and he began to laugh at\nhimself.\n\n      * \xe2\x80\x9cBut what the devil was he doing in that galley?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIn the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to\nPetersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He\nresolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his\nintention to part from her forever.\n\nNext morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, Pierre\nwas lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.\n\nHe woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression,\nunable to realize where he was.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at\nhome,\xe2\x80\x9d said the valet.\n\nBut before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess\nherself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with\nsimply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like\na coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was\na wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow. With her\nimperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet.\nShe knew of the duel and had come to speak about it. She waited till the\nvalet had set down the coffee things and left the room. Pierre looked\nat her timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds\nwho lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her\nenemies, he tried to continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless\nand impossible, he again glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down\nbut looked at him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to\ngo.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s this now? What have you been up to now, I should like\nto know?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked sternly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? What have I...?\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it seems you\xe2\x80\x99re a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about?\nWhat is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but\ncould not reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t answer, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you...\xe2\x80\x9d H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nbelieve everything you\xe2\x80\x99re told. You were told...\xe2\x80\x9d H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne laughed,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat D\xc3\xb3lokhov was my lover,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in French with her coarse\nplainness of speech, uttering the word amant as casually as any other\nword, \xe2\x80\x9cand you believed it! Well, what have you proved? What does this\nduel prove? That you\xe2\x80\x99re a fool, que vous \xc3\xaates un sot, but everybody\nknew that. What will be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of\nall Moscow, that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing what\nyou were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne raised her voice and became more and more excited, \xe2\x80\x9cA man\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s a better man than you in every way...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm... Hm...!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and\nnot moving a muscle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like\nhis company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer\nyours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me... I beg you,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Pierre hoarsely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you\nplainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who\nwould not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid she.\n\nPierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange\nexpression she did not understand, and lay down again. He was suffering\nphysically at that moment, there was a weight on his chest and he could\nnot breathe. He knew that he must do something to put an end to this\nsuffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had better separate,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered in a broken voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeparate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne. \xe2\x80\x9cSeparate! That\xe2\x80\x99s a thing to frighten me with!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll kill you!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table\nwith a strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her\nbrandishing the slab.\n\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. His\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s nature showed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and\ndelight of frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping\ndown on her with outstretched hands shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cGet out!\xe2\x80\x9d in such a\nterrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror. God knows what\nhe would have done at that moment had H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne not fled from the room.\n\n\nA week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates\nin Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property, and left\nfor Petersburg alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTwo months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and\nthe loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite of the\nletters sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his body had\nnot been found nor was he on the list of prisoners. What was worst of\nall for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of\nhis having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the\nplace and that he might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among\nstrangers and unable to send news of himself. The gazettes from which\nthe old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual\nvery briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians\nhad had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The\nold prince understood from this official report that our army had been\ndefeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz\ncame a letter from Kut\xc3\xbazov informing the prince of the fate that had\nbefallen his son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour son,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Kut\xc3\xbazov, \xe2\x80\x9cfell before my eyes, a standard in\nhis hand and at the head of a regiment\xe2\x80\x94he fell as a hero, worthy of\nhis father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the\nwhole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort\nmyself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise\nhe would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of\nbattle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his\nstudy, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he\nwas silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though\nhe looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.\n\nWhen Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his\nlathe and, as usual, did not look round at her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Princess Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly in an unnatural voice,\nthrowing down his chisel. (The wheel continued to revolve by its own\nimpetus, and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that\nwheel, which merged in her memory with what followed.)\n\nShe approached him, saw his face, and something gave way within her. Her\neyes grew dim. By the expression of her father\xe2\x80\x99s face, not sad, not\ncrushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging over\nher and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the worst\nin life, one she had not yet experienced, irreparable and\nincomprehensible\xe2\x80\x94the death of one she loved.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather! Andrew!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such\nan indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father\ncould not bear her look but turned away with a sob.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad news! He\xe2\x80\x99s not among the prisoners nor among the killed!\nKut\xc3\xbazov writes...\xe2\x80\x9d and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to\ndrive the princess away by that scream... \xe2\x80\x9cKilled!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess did not fall down or faint. She was already pale, but on\nhearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her\nbeautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joy\xe2\x80\x94a supreme joy apart from the\njoys and sorrows of this world\xe2\x80\x94overflowed the great grief within her.\nShe forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and\ndrawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not turn away from me, let us weep\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cScoundrels! Blackguards!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked the old man, turning his face\naway from her. \xe2\x80\x9cDestroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go,\ngo and tell Lise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and\nwept. She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took\nleave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw him tender\nand amused as he was when he put on the little icon. \xe2\x80\x9cDid he believe?\nHad he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms\nof eternal peace and blessedness?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, tell me how it happened,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked through her tears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and\nRussia\xe2\x80\x99s glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell\nLise. I will follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat\nworking and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm\npeculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see\nPrincess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at something\njoyful and mysterious taking place within her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying\nback, \xe2\x80\x9cgive me your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d She took her sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s hand and\nheld it below her waist.\n\nHer eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained\nlifted in childlike happiness.\n\nPrincess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her\nsister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know,\nMary, I am going to love him very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lise, looking with\nbright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law.\n\nPrincess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Mary?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, wiping\naway her tears on her sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s knee.\n\nSeveral times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to\nprepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as\nwas the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not\nunderstand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as\nif in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was\nalways afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign\nexpression and went out again without saying a word. She looked at\nPrincess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of\nattention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women,\nand suddenly began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas anything come from Andrew?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you know it\xe2\x80\x99s too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I\nfeel afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant\neyes at her sister-in-law.\n\nShe had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the\nterrible news from her till after her confinement, which was expected\nwithin a few days. Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid\ntheir grief in their own way. The old prince would not cherish any hope:\nhe made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed, and though he\nsent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son, he ordered a\nmonument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his\nmemory, and he told everybody that his son had been killed. He tried not\nto change his former way of life, but his strength failed him. He walked\nless, ate less, slept less, and became weaker every day. Princess Mary\nhoped. She prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news\nof his return.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little princess after breakfast on the morning\nof the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip rose from old habit,\nbut as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of every word, and\neven every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come, so\nnow the smile of the little princess\xe2\x80\x94influenced by the general mood\nthough without knowing its cause\xe2\x80\x94was such as to remind one still more\nof the general sorrow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid this morning\xe2\x80\x99s fruschtique *\xe2\x80\x94as F\xc3\xb3ka the\ncook calls it\xe2\x80\x94has disagreed with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * Fr\xc3\xbchst\xc3\xbcck: breakfast.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you, my darling? You look pale. Oh, you\nare very pale!\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft,\nponderous steps up to her sister-in-law.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency, should not Mary Bogd\xc3\xa1novna be sent for?\xe2\x80\x9d said one\nof the maids who was present. (Mary Bogd\xc3\xa1novna was a midwife from the\nneighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Princess Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\nCourage, my angel.\xe2\x80\x9d She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d And besides the pallor and the physical suffering\non the little princess\xe2\x80\x99 face, an expression of childish fear of\ninevitable pain showed itself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s only indigestion?... Say it\xe2\x80\x99s only indigestion, say so,\nMary! Say...\xe2\x80\x9d And the little princess began to cry capriciously like\na suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some\naffectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary\nBogd\xc3\xa1novna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d she heard as she left the room.\n\nThe midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump\nwhite hands with an air of calm importance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary Bogd\xc3\xa1novna, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s beginning!\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary\nlooking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the Lord be thanked, Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Bogd\xc3\xa1novna, not\nhastening her steps. \xe2\x80\x9cYou young ladies should not know anything about\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nprincess. (In accordance with Lise\xe2\x80\x99s and Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s wishes they\nhad sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at\nany moment.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter, Princess, don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Bogd\xc3\xa1novna.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll manage very well without a doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFive minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy\nbeing carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the\nlarge leather sofa from Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s study into the bedroom. On\ntheir faces was a quiet and solemn look.\n\nPrincess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the\nhouse, now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching\nwhat was going on in the passage. Some women passing with quiet steps in\nand out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away. She did\nnot venture to ask any questions, and shut the door again, now sitting\ndown in her easy chair, now taking her prayer book, now kneeling before\nthe icon stand. To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers\ndid not calm her excitement. Suddenly her door opened softly and her old\nnurse, Prask\xc3\xb3vya S\xc3\xa1vishna, who hardly ever came to that room as the\nold prince had forbidden it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl\nround her head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come to sit with you a bit, M\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nhere I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought the prince\xe2\x80\x99s wedding candles to light before his\nsaint, my angel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a sigh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nurse, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod is merciful, birdie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door\nwith her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began reading. Only\nwhen footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another, the\nprincess anxious and inquiring, the nurse encouraging. Everyone in the\nhouse was dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced\nas she sat in her room. But owing to the superstition that the fewer\nthe people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone\ntried to pretend not to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the\nordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the prince\xe2\x80\x99s\nhousehold, a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a\nconsciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished\nat that moment made itself felt.\n\nThere was no laughter in the maids\xe2\x80\x99 large hall. In the men servants\xe2\x80\x99\nhall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfs\xe2\x80\x99\nquarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old\nprince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent\nT\xc3\xadkhon to ask Mary Bogd\xc3\xa1novna what news.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSay only that \xe2\x80\x98the\nprince told me to ask,\xe2\x80\x99 and come and tell me her answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInform the prince that labor has begun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Bogd\xc3\xa1novna,\ngiving the messenger a significant look.\n\nT\xc3\xadkhon went and told the prince.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good!\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince closing the door behind him, and\nT\xc3\xadkhon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.\n\nAfter a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and, seeing\nthe prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his perturbed\nface, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the\nshoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he\nhad entered. The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course.\nEvening passed, night came, and the feeling of suspense and softening of\nheart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased.\nNo one slept.\n\nIt was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its\nsway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A relay\nof horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from\nMoscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback with lanterns\nwere sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its\nhollows and snow-covered pools of water.\n\nPrincess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her\nluminous eyes fixed on her nurse\xe2\x80\x99s wrinkled face (every line of which\nshe knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the\nkerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.\n\nNurse S\xc3\xa1vishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely\nhearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds of\ntimes before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess Mary\nin Kishen\xc3\xabv with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a\nmidwife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod is merciful, doctors are never needed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nSuddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the\nwindow, from which the double frame had been removed (by order of the\nprince, one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks\nreturned), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the damask\ncurtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill, snowy draft.\nPrincess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the stocking she was\nknitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open\ncasement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose\nlocks of gray hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess, my dear, there\xe2\x80\x99s someone driving up the avenue!\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid, holding the casement and not closing it. \xe2\x80\x9cWith lanterns. Most\nlikely the doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God! thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go and meet\nhim, he does not know Russian.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer.\nAs she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage\nwith lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. On\na banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On\nthe landing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding\nanother candle. Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one\ncould hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that\nseemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Father?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the voice of Demy\xc3\xa1n the house steward, who\nwas downstairs.\n\nThen the voice said something more, Demy\xc3\xa1n replied, and the steps in\nthe felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Andrew!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cNo it can\xe2\x80\x99t be, that\nwould be too extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d and at the very moment she thought this,\nthe face and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of\nwhich covered with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman\nstood with the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and\nstrangely softened but agitated expression on his face. He came up the\nstairs and embraced his sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not get my letter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, and not waiting for a\nreply\xe2\x80\x94which he would not have received, for the princess was unable to\nspeak\xe2\x80\x94he turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the\ndoctor who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last post\nstation), and again embraced his sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange fate, M\xc3\xa1sha darling!\xe2\x80\x9d And having taken off his\ncloak and felt boots, he went to the little princess\xe2\x80\x99 apartment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her\nhead (the pains had just left her). Strands of her black hair lay round\nher inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy mouth with its\ndowny lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrew entered\nand paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying.\nHer glittering eyes, filled with childlike fear and excitement, rested\non him without changing their expression. \xe2\x80\x9cI love you all and have\ndone no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!\xe2\x80\x9d her look\nseemed to say. She saw her husband, but did not realize the significance\nof his appearance before her now. Prince Andrew went round the sofa and\nkissed her forehead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling!\xe2\x80\x9d he said\xe2\x80\x94a word he had never used to her before.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod is merciful....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expected help from you and I get none, none from you either!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid her eyes. She was not surprised at his having come; she did\nnot realize that he had come. His coming had nothing to do with\nher sufferings or with their relief. The pangs began again and Mary\nBogd\xc3\xa1novna advised Prince Andrew to leave the room.\n\nThe doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess Mary,\nagain joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their talk broke\noff at every moment. They waited and listened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary.\n\nPrince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next\nto hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became\nconfused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with his hands\nand remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless, animal moans came\nthrough the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to the door, and tried to\nopen it. Someone was holding it shut.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t come in! You can\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said a terrified voice from\nwithin.\n\nHe began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few more seconds\nwent by. Then suddenly a terrible shriek\xe2\x80\x94it could not be hers, she\ncould not scream like that\xe2\x80\x94came from the bedroom. Prince Andrew ran to\nthe door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have they taken a baby in there for?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew in\nthe first second. \xe2\x80\x9cA baby? What baby...? Why is there a baby there? Or\nis the baby born?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail; tears\nchoked him, and leaning his elbows on the window sill he began to cry,\nsobbing like a child. The door opened. The doctor with his shirt sleeves\ntucked up, without a coat, pale and with a trembling jaw, came out\nof the room. Prince Andrew turned to him, but the doctor gave him a\nbewildered look and passed by without a word. A woman rushed out and\nseeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating on the threshold. He went into\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s room. She was lying dead, in the same position he had seen\nher in five minutes before and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of\nthe cheeks, the same expression was on her charming childlike face with\nits upper lip covered with tiny black hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you all, and have done no harm to anyone; and what have you\ndone to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said her charming, pathetic, dead face.\n\nIn a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed\nin Mary Bogd\xc3\xa1novna\xe2\x80\x99s trembling white hands.\n\n\nTwo hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his father\xe2\x80\x99s\nroom. The old man already knew everything. He was standing close to\nthe door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise\nround his son\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and without a word he began to sob like a child.\n\n\nThree days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew went\nup the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her the farewell kiss.\nAnd there in the coffin was the same face, though with closed eyes.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what have you done to me?\xe2\x80\x9d it still seemed to say, and Prince\nAndrew felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty\nof a sin he could neither remedy nor forget. He could not weep. The\nold man too came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly\ncrossed one on the other on her breast, and to him, too, her face seemed\nto say: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, what have you done to me, and why?\xe2\x80\x9d And at the sight\nthe old man turned angrily away.\n\n\nAnother five days passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas Andr\xc3\xa9evich\nwas baptized. The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin, while\nthe priest with a goose feather anointed the boy\xe2\x80\x99s little red and\nwrinkled soles and palms.\n\nHis grandfather, who was his godfather, trembling and afraid of dropping\nhim, carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over\nto the godmother, Princess Mary. Prince Andrew sat in another room,\nfaint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font, and awaited\nthe termination of the ceremony. He looked up joyfully at the baby when\nthe nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that\nthe wax with the baby\xe2\x80\x99s hair had not sunk in the font but had floated.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s share in D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s duel with Bez\xc3\xbakhov was hushed up by\nthe efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks\nas he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of\nMoscow. As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the\nfamily, but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties. D\xc3\xb3lokhov\nrecovered, and Rost\xc3\xb3v became very friendly with him during his\nconvalescence. D\xc3\xb3lokhov lay ill at his mother\xe2\x80\x99s who loved him\npassionately and tenderly, and old Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna, who had grown fond of\nRost\xc3\xb3v for his friendship to her F\xc3\xa9dya, often talked to him about her\nson.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, \xe2\x80\x9che is too noble and pure-souled for\nour present, depraved world. No one now loves virtue; it seems like\na reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, was it right, was it\nhonorable, of Bez\xc3\xbakhov? And F\xc3\xa9dya, with his noble spirit, loved him\nand even now never says a word against him. Those pranks in Petersburg\nwhen they played some tricks on a policeman, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they do it\ntogether? And there! Bez\xc3\xbakhov got off scotfree, while F\xc3\xa9dya had to\nbear the whole burden on his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go through!\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s true he has been reinstated, but how could they fail to do that?\nI think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out\nthere as he. And now\xe2\x80\x94this duel! Have these people no feeling, or\nhonor? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so\nstraight! It\xe2\x80\x99s well God had mercy on us. And what was it for? Who\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t have intrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I see\nthings he should have shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for months.\nAnd then to call him out, reckoning on F\xc3\xa9dya not fighting because he\nowed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you understand\nF\xc3\xa9dya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I am so fond of you. Few\npeople do understand him. He is such a lofty, heavenly soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to Rost\xc3\xb3v in a way no\none would have expected of him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know people consider me a bad man!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them! I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t care a straw about anyone but those I love; but those I love,\nI love so that I would give my life for them, and the others I\xe2\x80\x99d\nthrottle if they stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother,\nand two or three friends\xe2\x80\x94you among them\xe2\x80\x94and as for the rest I only\ncare about them in so far as they are harmful or useful. And most of\nthem are harmful, especially the women. Yes, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have met loving, noble, high-minded men, but I have not yet met\nany women\xe2\x80\x94countesses or cooks\xe2\x80\x94who were not venal. I have not yet met\nthat divine purity and devotion I look for in women. If I found such a\none I\xe2\x80\x99d give my life for her! But those!...\xe2\x80\x9d and he made a gesture\nof contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd believe me, if I still value my life it is\nonly because I still hope to meet such a divine creature, who will\nregenerate, purify, and elevate me. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I quite understand,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rost\xc3\xb3v, who was under his\nnew friend\xe2\x80\x99s influence.\n\nIn the autumn the Rost\xc3\xb3vs returned to Moscow. Early in the winter\nDen\xc3\xadsov also came back and stayed with them. The first half of the\nwinter of 1806, which Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v spent in Moscow, was one of the\nhappiest, merriest times for him and the whole family. Nicholas brought\nmany young men to his parents\xe2\x80\x99 house. V\xc3\xa9ra was a handsome girl\nof twenty; S\xc3\xb3nya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening\nflower; Nat\xc3\xa1sha, half grown up and half child, was now childishly\namusing, now girlishly enchanting.\n\nAt that time in the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 house there prevailed an amorous\natmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very\ncharming girls. Every young man who came to the house\xe2\x80\x94seeing those\nimpressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own\nhappiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful\nbursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of\nyoung girls ready for anything and full of hope\xe2\x80\x94experienced the same\nfeeling; sharing with the young folk of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 household a\nreadiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness.\n\nAmong the young men introduced by Rost\xc3\xb3v one of the first was\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, whom everyone in the house liked except Nat\xc3\xa1sha. She almost\nquarreled with her brother about him. She insisted that he was a bad\nman, and that in the duel with Bez\xc3\xbakhov, Pierre was right and D\xc3\xb3lokhov\nwrong, and further that he was disagreeable and unnatural.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for me to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out with\nresolute self-will, \xe2\x80\x9che is wicked and heartless. There now, I like\nyour Den\xc3\xadsov though he is a rake and all that, still I like him; so\nyou see I do understand. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to put it... with this one\neverything is calculated, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that. But Den\xc3\xadsov...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Den\xc3\xadsov is quite different,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nicholas, implying that\neven Den\xc3\xadsov was nothing compared to D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou must understand\nwhat a soul there is in D\xc3\xb3lokhov, you should see him with his mother.\nWhat a heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And\ndo you know he has fallen in love with S\xc3\xb3nya?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m certain of it; you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s prediction proved true. D\xc3\xb3lokhov, who did not usually care\nfor the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the\nquestion for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon\nsettled. He came because of S\xc3\xb3nya. And S\xc3\xb3nya, though she would never\nhave dared to say so, knew it and blushed scarlet every time D\xc3\xb3lokhov\nappeared.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov often dined at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99, never missed a performance at\nwhich they were present, and went to Iogel\xe2\x80\x99s balls for young people\nwhich the Rost\xc3\xb3vs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to S\xc3\xb3nya\nand looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his\nglances without coloring, but even the old countess and Nat\xc3\xa1sha blushed\nwhen they saw his looks.\n\nIt was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irresistible\ninfluence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v noticed something new in D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s relations with S\xc3\xb3nya,\nbut he did not explain to himself what these new relations were.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re always in love with someone,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought of S\xc3\xb3nya and\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. But he was not as much at ease with S\xc3\xb3nya and D\xc3\xb3lokhov as\nbefore and was less frequently at home.\n\nIn the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with\nNapoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. Orders were\ngiven to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the regular army,\nand besides this, nine men in every thousand for the militia. Everywhere\nBonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war\nwas talked of. For the Rost\xc3\xb3v family the whole interest of these\npreparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of\nremaining in Moscow, and only awaited the termination of Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s\nfurlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment. His\napproaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself, but rather\ngave zest to his pleasures. He spent the greater part of his time away\nfrom home, at dinners, parties, and balls.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOn the third day after Christmas Nicholas dined at home, a thing he had\nrarely done of late. It was a grand farewell dinner, as he and Den\xc3\xadsov\nwere leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany. About twenty people\nwere present, including D\xc3\xb3lokhov and Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\nNever had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous\natmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 house as at\nthis holiday time. \xe2\x80\x9cSeize the moments of happiness, love and be loved!\nThat is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one\nthing we are interested in here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the spirit of the place.\n\nNicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without\nvisiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited,\nreturned home just before dinner. As soon as he entered he noticed and\nfelt the tension of the amorous air in the house, and also noticed a\ncurious embarrassment among some of those present. S\xc3\xb3nya, D\xc3\xb3lokhov,\nand the old countess were especially disturbed, and to a lesser degree\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. Nicholas understood that something must have happened between\nS\xc3\xb3nya and D\xc3\xb3lokhov before dinner, and with the kindly sensitiveness\nnatural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner. On\nthat same evening there was to be one of the balls that Iogel (the\ndancing master) gave for his pupils during the holidays.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas, will you come to Iogel\xe2\x80\x99s? Please do!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked you, and Vas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich * is also going.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere would I not go at the countess\xe2\x80\x99 command!\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov,\nwho at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 had jocularly assumed the role of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\nknight. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m even weady to dance the pas de ch\xc3\xa2le.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have time,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I promised the\nArkh\xc3\xa1rovs; they have a party.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked D\xc3\xb3lokhov, but as soon as he had asked the\nquestion he noticed that it should not have been put.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d coldly and angrily replied D\xc3\xb3lokhov, glancing at S\xc3\xb3nya,\nand, scowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre\nat the club dinner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something up,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas, and he was further\nconfirmed in this conclusion by the fact that D\xc3\xb3lokhov left immediately\nafter dinner. He called Nat\xc3\xa1sha and asked her what was the matter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was looking for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha running out to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\ntold you, but you would not believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said triumphantly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\nhas proposed to S\xc3\xb3nya!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLittle as Nicholas had occupied himself with S\xc3\xb3nya of late, something\nseemed to give way within him at this news. D\xc3\xb3lokhov was a suitable and\nin some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless, orphan girl. From\nthe point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the\nquestion for her to refuse him. And therefore Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 first feeling\non hearing the news was one of anger with S\xc3\xb3nya.... He tried to say,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s capital; of course she\xe2\x80\x99ll forget her childish promises\nand accept the offer,\xe2\x80\x9d but before he had time to say it Nat\xc3\xa1sha began\nagain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd fancy! she refused him quite definitely!\xe2\x80\x9d adding, after a\npause, \xe2\x80\x9cshe told him she loved another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my S\xc3\xb3nya could not have done otherwise!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she won\xe2\x80\x99t change\nonce she has said...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mamma pressed her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas reproachfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Nicholas\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t be\nangry\xe2\x80\x94but I know you will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but\nI know for certain that you won\xe2\x80\x99t marry her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that at all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must\ntalk to her. What a darling S\xc3\xb3nya is!\xe2\x80\x9d he added with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she is indeed a darling! I\xe2\x80\x99ll send her to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Nat\xc3\xa1sha kissed her brother and ran away.\n\nA minute later S\xc3\xb3nya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared\nlook. Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand. This was the first\ntime since his return that they had talked alone and about their love.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSophie,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, timidly at first and then more and more\nboldly, \xe2\x80\x9cif you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and\nadvantageous match but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already refused,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hurriedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya again interrupted. She gave him an imploring, frightened look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to say\nit. If you refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole truth. I\nlove you, and I think I love you more than anyone else....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is enough for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya, blushing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in\nlove again, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship,\nconfidence, and love as I have for you. Then I am young. Mamma does\nnot wish it. In a word, I make no promise. And I beg you to consider\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s offer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, articulating his friend\xe2\x80\x99s name with\ndifficulty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that to me! I want nothing. I love you as a brother and\nalways shall, and I want nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an angel: I am not worthy of you, but I am afraid of\nmisleading you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Nicholas again kissed her hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIogel\xe2\x80\x99s were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow. So said the mothers\nas they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps,\nand so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they\nwere ready to drop, and so said the grown-up young men and women who\ncame to these balls with an air of condescension and found them most\nenjoyable. That year two marriages had come of these balls. The two\npretty young Princesses Gorchak\xc3\xb3v met suitors there and were married\nand so further increased the fame of these dances. What distinguished\nthem from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of\nthe good-natured Iogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according\nto the rules of his art, as he collected the tickets from all his\nvisitors. There was the fact that only those came who wished to dance\nand amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are\nwearing long dresses for the first time. With scarcely any exceptions\nthey all were, or seemed to be, pretty\xe2\x80\x94so rapturous were their smiles\nand so sparkling their eyes. Sometimes the best of the pupils, of whom\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, who was exceptionally graceful, was first, even danced the pas\nde ch\xc3\xa2le, but at this last ball only the \xc3\xa9cossaise, the anglaise, and\nthe mazurka, which was just coming into fashion, were danced. Iogel had\ntaken a ballroom in Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s house, and the ball, as everyone said,\nwas a great success. There were many pretty girls and the Rost\xc3\xb3v girls\nwere among the prettiest. They were both particularly happy and gay.\nThat evening, proud of D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, her refusal, and her\nexplanation with Nicholas, S\xc3\xb3nya twirled about before she left home\nso that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited, and she was\ntransparently radiant with impulsive joy.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real\nball was even happier. They were both dressed in white muslin with pink\nribbons.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom. She\nwas not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. Whatever\nperson she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how delightful it is!\xe2\x80\x9d she kept saying, running up to S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\nNicholas and Den\xc3\xadsov were walking up and down, looking with kindly\npatronage at the dancers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow sweet she is\xe2\x80\x94she will be a weal beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCountess Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how she dances! What gwace!\xe2\x80\x9d he said again after a pause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout your sister,\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Den\xc3\xadsov testily.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear count, you were one of my best pupils\xe2\x80\x94you must dance,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cLook how many charming young\nladies\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He turned with the same request to Den\xc3\xadsov who was also a\nformer pupil of his.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a wallflower,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were only\ninattentive, but you had talent\xe2\x80\x94oh yes, you had talent!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not\nrefuse Iogel and asked S\xc3\xb3nya to dance. Den\xc3\xadsov sat down by the old\nladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot, told\nthem something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the young\npeople dancing, Iogel with Nat\xc3\xa1sha, his pride and his best pupil, were\nthe first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his little\nfeet in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who,\nthough shy, went on carefully executing her steps. Den\xc3\xadsov did not\ntake his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly\nindicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not\nbecause he could not. In the middle of a figure he beckoned to Rost\xc3\xb3v\nwho was passing:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not at all the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of Polish\nmazuwka is this? But she does dance splendidly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKnowing that Den\xc3\xadsov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly\nway in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to Nat\xc3\xa1sha:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and choose Den\xc3\xadsov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nWhen it came to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s turn to choose a partner, she rose and,\ntripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran\ntimidly to the corner where Den\xc3\xadsov sat. She saw that everybody was\nlooking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that Den\xc3\xadsov was refusing\nthough he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Vas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cdo come!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, let me off, Countess,\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, V\xc3\xa1ska,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey coax me as if I were V\xc3\xa1ska the cat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov jokingly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sing for you a whole evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov, and\nhe unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his\npartner\xe2\x80\x99s hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot,\nwaiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow\nhe felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways\nat his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with\none foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room\ntaking his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half across\nthe room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at\nthem, when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs,\nhe stopped short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot\nclanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round, and, striking his left heel\nagainst his right, flew round again in a circle. Nat\xc3\xa1sha guessed what\nhe meant to do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly\nknowing how. First he spun her round, holding her now with his left, now\nwith his right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round him,\nand again jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if\nhe would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath,\nand then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected\nsteps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her\nchair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, Nat\xc3\xa1sha\ndid not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement,\nsmiling as if she did not recognize him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she brought out.\n\nAlthough Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka, everyone\nwas delighted with Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s skill, he was asked again and again as\na partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the\ngood old days. Den\xc3\xadsov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself\nwith his handkerchief, sat down by Nat\xc3\xa1sha and did not leave her for\nthe rest of the evening.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nFor two days after that Rost\xc3\xb3v did not see D\xc3\xb3lokhov at his own or at\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s home: on the third day he received a note from him:\n\nAs I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know\nof, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell supper\ntonight to my friends\xe2\x80\x94come to the English Hotel.\n\nAbout ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock Rost\xc3\xb3v went to the English Hotel straight from the\ntheater, where he had been with his family and Den\xc3\xadsov. He was at once\nshown to the best room, which D\xc3\xb3lokhov had taken for that evening. Some\ntwenty men were gathered round a table at which D\xc3\xb3lokhov sat between\ntwo candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper money, and he\nwas keeping the bank. Rost\xc3\xb3v had not seen him since his proposal and\nS\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they\nwould meet.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s clear, cold glance met Rost\xc3\xb3v as soon as he entered the\ndoor, as though he had long expected him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long time since we met,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks for coming.\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll just finish dealing, and then Ily\xc3\xbashka will come with his\nchorus.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI called once or twice at your house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, reddening.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov made no reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may punt,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had\nwith D\xc3\xb3lokhov. \xe2\x80\x9cNone but fools trust to luck in play,\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov\nhad then said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr are you afraid to play with me?\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov now asked as if\nguessing Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s thought.\n\nBeneath his smile Rost\xc3\xb3v saw in him the mood he had shown at the club\ndinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he had felt\na need to escape from it by some strange, and usually cruel, action.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke with\nwhich to reply to D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s words. But before he had thought of\nanything, D\xc3\xb3lokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and\ndeliberately so that everyone could hear:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember we had a talk about cards... \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a fool who\ntrusts to luck, one should make certain,\xe2\x80\x99 and I want to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo try his luck or the certainty?\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v asked himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99d better not play,\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov added, and springing a\nnew pack of cards said: \xe2\x80\x9cBank, gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMoving the money forward he prepared to deal. Rost\xc3\xb3v sat down by his\nside and at first did not play. D\xc3\xb3lokhov kept glancing at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you play?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nAnd strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a\ncard, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no money with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll trust you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and again\nlost. D\xc3\xb3lokhov \xe2\x80\x9ckilled,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, beat, ten cards of Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s\nrunning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov after he had dealt for some time.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the\nreckoning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I\nask you to put the money on your cards,\xe2\x80\x9d replied D\xc3\xb3lokhov. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\nstint yourself, we\xe2\x80\x99ll settle afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to\nRost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nThe game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.\n\nAll Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored\nup against him. He wrote \xe2\x80\x9c800 rubles\xe2\x80\x9d on a card, but while the\nwaiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual\nstake of twenty rubles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov, though he did not seem to be even\nlooking at Rost\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll win it back all the sooner. I lose to\nthe others but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked again.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven\nof hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He\nwell remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts,\non which with a broken bit of chalk he had written \xe2\x80\x9c800 rubles\xe2\x80\x9d in\nclear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was\nhanded him, smiled at D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s words, and with a sinking heart,\nwaiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s hands which held\nthe pack. Much depended on Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s winning or losing on that seven\nof hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had given his son\ntwo thousand rubles, and though he always disliked speaking of money\ndifficulties had told Nicholas that this was all he could let him have\ntill May, and asked him to be more economical this time. Nicholas had\nreplied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his\nword of honor not to take anything more till the spring. Now only twelve\nhundred rubles was left of that money, so that this seven of hearts\nmeant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the\nnecessity of going back on his word. With a sinking heart he watched\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s hands and thought, \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, make haste and let me have\nthis card and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my cap and drive home to supper with Den\xc3\xadsov,\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, and S\xc3\xb3nya, and will certainly never touch a card again.\xe2\x80\x9d At\nthat moment his home life, jokes with P\xc3\xa9tya, talks with S\xc3\xb3nya, duets\nwith Nat\xc3\xa1sha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable bed\nin the house on the Povarsk\xc3\xa1ya rose before him with such vividness,\nclearness, and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and\nunappreciated bliss, long past. He could not conceive that a stupid\nchance, letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left,\nmight deprive him of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly\nillumined, and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined\nmisery. That could not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the\nmovement of D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy\nwrists visible from under the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took\nup a glass and a pipe that were handed him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are not afraid to play with me?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated D\xc3\xb3lokhov, and as\nif about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his\nchair, and began deliberately with a smile:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, gentlemen, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told there\xe2\x80\x99s a rumor going about Moscow\nthat I\xe2\x80\x99m a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, deal!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, those Moscow gossips!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov, and he took up the cards\nwith a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAah!\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The\nseven he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had\nlost more than he could pay.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, don\xe2\x80\x99t ruin yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov with a side glance at\nRost\xc3\xb3v as he continued to deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAn hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested\nin their own play.\n\nThe whole interest was concentrated on Rost\xc3\xb3v. Instead of sixteen\nhundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him,\nwhich he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely\nsupposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already\nexceeded twenty thousand rubles. D\xc3\xb3lokhov was no longer listening to\nstories or telling them, but followed every movement of Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s\nhands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him. He had\ndecided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand. He\nhad fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of his and\nS\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s joint ages. Rost\xc3\xb3v, leaning his head on both hands, sat at\nthe table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with spilled wine,\nand littered with cards. One tormenting impression did not leave him:\nthat those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from\nunder the shirt sleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, held him\nin their power.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it back\xe2\x80\x99s\nimpossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or\nquits... it can\xe2\x80\x99t be!... And why is he doing this to me?\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v\npondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but D\xc3\xb3lokhov refused to\naccept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and at\none moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge\nover the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand\nfrom the crumpled heap under the table would save him, now counted the\ncords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the\ntotal of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the other\nplayers, or peered at the now cold face of D\xc3\xb3lokhov and tried to read\nwhat was passing in his mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows of course what this loss means to me. He can\xe2\x80\x99t want my\nruin. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he my friend? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I fond of him? But it\xe2\x80\x99s not his\nfault. What\xe2\x80\x99s he to do if he has such luck?... And it\xe2\x80\x99s not my fault\neither,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI have done nothing wrong. Have I\nkilled anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible\nmisfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to\nthis table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that\ncasket for Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s name day and then going home. I was so happy, so\nfree, so lighthearted! And I did not realize how happy I was! When did\nthat end and when did this new, terrible state of things begin? What\nmarked the change? I sat all the time in this same place at this table,\nchose and placed cards, and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the\nsame way. When did it happen and what has happened? I am well and strong\nand still the same and in the same place. No, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be! Surely it\nwill all end in nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot.\nHis face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless\nefforts to seem calm.\n\nThe score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand.\nRost\xc3\xb3v had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he\nmeant to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began\nrapidly adding up the total of Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s debt, breaking the chalk as\nhe marked the figures in his clear, bold hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupper, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for supper! And here are the gypsies!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSome swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside\nand saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas understood that it\nwas all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, won\xe2\x80\x99t you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,\xe2\x80\x9d as if it\nwere the fun of the game which interested him most.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all up! I\xe2\x80\x99m lost!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cNow a bullet through my\nbrain\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all that\xe2\x80\x99s left me!\xe2\x80\x9d And at the same time he said\nin a cheerful voice:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, just this one more little card!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov, having finished the addition. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\nright! Twenty-one rubles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one\nby which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and\ntaking up a pack he prepared to deal. Rost\xc3\xb3v submissively unbent the\ncorner of his card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended,\ncarefully wrote twenty-one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI only want to see whether\nyou will let me win this ten, or beat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how Rost\xc3\xb3v detested at that\nmoment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists,\nwhich held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou owe forty-three thousand, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov, and\nstretching himself he rose from the table. \xe2\x80\x9cOne does get tired sitting\nso long,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m tired too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for him to\njest.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen am I to receive the money, Count?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, flushing, drew D\xc3\xb3lokhov into the next room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Rost\xc3\xb3v,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov clearly, smiling and looking\nNicholas straight in the eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know the saying, \xe2\x80\x98Lucky in love,\nunlucky at cards.\xe2\x80\x99 Your cousin is in love with you, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s terrible to feel oneself so in this man\xe2\x80\x99s power,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought Rost\xc3\xb3v. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and\nmother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to\nescape it all, and felt that D\xc3\xb3lokhov knew that he could save him from\nall this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does\nwith a mouse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cousin...\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy cousin has nothing to do with this and it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary to\nmention her!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed fiercely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen when am I to have it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rost\xc3\xb3v and left the room.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTo say \xe2\x80\x9ctomorrow\xe2\x80\x9d and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult,\nbut to go home alone, see his sisters, brother, mother, and father,\nconfess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of\nhonor, was terrible.\n\nAt home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after returning\nfrom the theater, had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord.\nAs soon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere\nof love which pervaded the Rost\xc3\xb3v household that winter and, now after\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s proposal and Iogel\xe2\x80\x99s ball, seemed to have grown thicker\nround S\xc3\xb3nya and Nat\xc3\xa1sha as the air does before a thunderstorm. S\xc3\xb3nya\nand Nat\xc3\xa1sha, in the light-blue dresses they had worn at the theater,\nlooking pretty and conscious of it, were standing by the clavichord,\nhappy and smiling. V\xc3\xa9ra was playing chess with Shinsh\xc3\xadn in the drawing\nroom. The old countess, waiting for the return of her husband and son,\nsat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house.\nDen\xc3\xadsov, with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord\nstriking chords with his short fingers, his legs thrown back and his\neyes rolling as he sang, with his small, husky, but true voice, some\nverses called \xe2\x80\x9cEnchantress,\xe2\x80\x9d which he had composed, and to which he\nwas trying to fit music:\n\n   Enchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre\n   What magic power is this recalls me still?\n   What spark has set my inmost soul on fire,\n   What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?\n\nHe was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his sparkling\nblack-agate eyes at the frightened and happy Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid! Excellent!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother verse,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid, without noticing Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s still the same with them,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas,\nglancing into the drawing room, where he saw V\xc3\xa9ra and his mother with\nthe old lady.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, and here\xe2\x80\x99s Nicholas!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha, running up to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Papa at home?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve come!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, without answering him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are enjoying ourselves! Vas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich is staying a day longer\nfor my sake! Did you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Papa is not back yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas, have you come? Come here, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d called the old countess\nfrom the drawing room.\n\nNicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently at her\ntable began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From the dancing\nroom, they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade\nNat\xc3\xa1sha to sing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll wight! All wight!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Den\xc3\xadsov. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good making\nexcuses now! It\xe2\x80\x99s your turn to sing the ba\xe2\x80\x99cawolla\xe2\x80\x94I entweat\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe countess glanced at her silent son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as if weary of being continually asked the\nsame question. \xe2\x80\x9cWill Papa be back soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s the same with them. They know nothing about it! Where\nam I to go?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas, and went again into the dancing room\nwhere the clavichord stood.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s favorite barcarolle. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was preparing to sing.\nDen\xc3\xadsov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.\n\nNicholas began pacing up and down the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? There\xe2\x80\x99s\nnothing to be happy about!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya struck the first chord of the prelude.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God, I\xe2\x80\x99m a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my brain\nis the only thing left me\xe2\x80\x94not singing!\xe2\x80\x9d his thoughts ran on. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\naway? But where to? It\xe2\x80\x99s one\xe2\x80\x94let them sing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at Den\xc3\xadsov and the\ngirls and avoiding their eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNik\xc3\xb3lenka, what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fixed on him\nseemed to ask. She noticed at once that something had happened to him.\n\nNicholas turned away from her. Nat\xc3\xa1sha too, with her quick instinct,\nhad instantly noticed her brother\xe2\x80\x99s condition. But, though she noticed\nit, she was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from\nsorrow, sadness, or self-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself\nas young people often do. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am too happy now to spoil my\nenjoyment by sympathy with anyone\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she felt, and she said\nto herself: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I must be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as\nI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, S\xc3\xb3nya!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going to the very middle of the room, where\nshe considered the resonance was best.\n\nHaving lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as ballet\ndancers do, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, rising energetically from her heels to her toes,\nstepped to the middle of the room and stood still.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s me!\xe2\x80\x9d she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with\nwhich Den\xc3\xadsov followed her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is she so pleased about?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas, looking at his\nsister. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy isn\xe2\x80\x99t she dull and ashamed?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose,\nher eyes became serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her\nsurroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may\nproduce at the same intervals and hold for the same time, but which\nleave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill\nyou and make you weep.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously,\nmainly because Den\xc3\xadsov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang\nas a child, there was no longer in her singing that comical, childish,\npainstaking effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing\nwell, as all the connoisseurs who heard her said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not trained,\nbut it is a beautiful voice that must be trained.\xe2\x80\x9d Only they generally\nsaid this some time after she had finished singing. While that untrained\nvoice, with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was\nsounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted in\nit and wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a virginal\nfreshness, an unconsciousness of her own powers, and an as yet untrained\nvelvety softness, which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that\nit seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling\nit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely\nopened eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened to her? How she is singing today!\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the\nnext note, the next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into\nthree beats: \xe2\x80\x9cOh mio crudele affetto.\xe2\x80\x9d... One, two, three... one,\ntwo, three... One... \xe2\x80\x9cOh mio crudele affetto.\xe2\x80\x9d... One, two, three...\nOne. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, this senseless life of ours!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\nthis misery, and money, and D\xc3\xb3lokhov, and anger, and honor\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s all\nnonsense... but this is real.... Now then, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, now then, dearest!\nNow then, darling! How will she take that si? She\xe2\x80\x99s taken it! Thank\nGod!\xe2\x80\x9d And without noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si\nhe sung a second, a third below the high note. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, God! How fine! Did\nI really take it? How fortunate!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\nOh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was finest\nin Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s soul! And this something was apart from everything else\nin the world and above everything in the world. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat were losses, and\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, and words of honor?... All nonsense! One might kill and rob\nand yet be happy....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nIt was long since Rost\xc3\xb3v had felt such enjoyment from music as he\ndid that day. But no sooner had Nat\xc3\xa1sha finished her barcarolle than\nreality again presented itself. He got up without saying a word and went\ndownstairs to his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old count\ncame in from his club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing him\ndrive up, went to meet him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94had a good time?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old count, smiling gaily and\nproudly at his son.\n\nNicholas tried to say \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d but could not: and he nearly burst into\nsobs. The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son\xe2\x80\x99s\ncondition.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be avoided!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas, for the first and\nlast time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel\nashamed of himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him\nhave the carriage to drive to town:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting. I\nneed some money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said his father, who was in a specially good humor. \xe2\x80\x9cI\ntold you it would not be enough. How much?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless\nsmile, for which he was long unable to forgive himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI have lost a\nlittle, I mean a good deal, a great deal\xe2\x80\x94forty three thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! To whom?... Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the count, suddenly reddening\nwith an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promised to pay tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!...\xe2\x80\x9d said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking\nhelplessly on the sofa.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped! It happens to everyone!\xe2\x80\x9d said the son, with\na bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a\nworthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He\nlonged to kiss his father\xe2\x80\x99s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness,\nbut said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to\neveryone!\n\nThe old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son\xe2\x80\x99s words and began\nbustlingly searching for something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be difficult, I fear, difficult\nto raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd with a furtive glance at his son\xe2\x80\x99s face, the count went out of the\nroom.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all\nexpected this.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! Pa-pa!\xe2\x80\x9d he called after him, sobbing, \xe2\x80\x9cforgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d And\nseizing his father\xe2\x80\x99s hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into\ntears.\n\nWhile father and son were having their explanation, the mother and\ndaughter were having one not less important. Nat\xc3\xa1sha came running to\nher mother, quite excited.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMade what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMade, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\n\nThe countess did not believe her ears. Den\xc3\xadsov had proposed. To whom?\nTo this chit of a girl, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who not so long ago was playing with\ndolls and who was still having lessons.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Nat\xc3\xa1sha! What nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, hoping it was a joke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nindignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI come to ask you what to do, and you call it\n\xe2\x80\x98nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe countess shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is true that Monsieur Den\xc3\xadsov has made you a proposal, tell\nhim he is a fool, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s not a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nat\xc3\xa1sha indignantly and seriously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, what do you want? You\xe2\x80\x99re all in love nowadays. Well,\nif you are in love, marry him!\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, with a laugh of\nannoyance. \xe2\x80\x9cGood luck to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mamma, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in love with him, I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m not in love\nwith him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, tell him so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, are you cross? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be cross, dear! Is it my fault?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and tell him?\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the countess smiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very\nwell for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, with a responsive smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should\nhave seen how he said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came\nout accidently.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all the same, you must refuse him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t. I am so sorry for him! He\xe2\x80\x99s so nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, accept his offer. It\xe2\x80\x99s high time for you to be\nmarried,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mamma, but I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry for him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\xe2\x80\x99m to\nsay it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for you to say. I shall speak to him myself,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the countess, indignant that they should have dared to treat this\nlittle Nat\xc3\xa1sha as grown up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll listen\nat the door,\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat\xc3\xa1sha ran across the drawing room to the dancing\nhall, where Den\xc3\xadsov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord\nwith his face in his hands.\n\nHe jumped up at the sound of her light step.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNataly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, \xe2\x80\x9cdecide my\nfate. It is in your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry for you!... No, but you are so\nnice... but it won\xe2\x80\x99t do...not that... but as a friend, I shall always\nlove you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not\nunderstand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this instant, they\nheard the quick rustle of the countess\xe2\x80\x99 dress. She came up to them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich, I thank you for the honor,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with an\nembarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut my\ndaughter is so young, and I thought that, as my son\xe2\x80\x99s friend, you\nwould have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would not\nhave obliged me to give this refusal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCountess...\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face.\nHe tried to say more, but faltered.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She began\nto sob aloud.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCountess, I have done w\xe2\x80\x99ong,\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov went on in an unsteady\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family\nthat I would give my life twice over...\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at the countess,\nand seeing her severe face said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by, Countess,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nkissing her hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without\nlooking at Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\nNext day Rost\xc3\xb3v saw Den\xc3\xadsov off. He did not wish to stay another\nday in Moscow. All Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s Moscow friends gave him a farewell\nentertainment at the gypsies\xe2\x80\x99, with the result that he had no\nrecollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three\nstages of his journey.\n\nAfter Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s departure, Rost\xc3\xb3v spent another fortnight in Moscow,\nwithout going out of the house, waiting for the money his father could\nnot at once raise, and he spent most of his time in the girls\xe2\x80\x99 room.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya was more tender and devoted to him than ever. It was as if she\nwanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her\nlove him all the more, but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of\nher.\n\nHe filled the girls\xe2\x80\x99 albums with verses and music, and having at last\nsent D\xc3\xb3lokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and received his\nreceipt, he left at the end of November, without taking leave of any of\nhis acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE: 1806 - 07\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nAfter his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the\nTorzh\xc3\xb3k post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster\nwould not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing,\nhe lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big\nfeet in their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready, and\ntea?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his valet.\n\nPierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had\nbegun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same\nquestion\xe2\x80\x94one so important that he took no notice of what went\non around him. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to\nPetersburg earlier or later, or whether he secured accommodation at this\nstation, but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a\nmatter of indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for\nthe rest of his life.\n\nThe postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling\nTorzh\xc3\xb3k embroidery came into the room offering their services.\nWithout changing his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his\nspectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could go on\nliving without having solved the problems that so absorbed him. He had\nbeen engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from\nSok\xc3\xb3lniki after the duel and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless\nnight. But now, in the solitude of the journey, they seized him with\nspecial force. No matter what he thought about, he always returned to\nthese same questions which he could not solve and yet could not cease to\nask himself. It was as if the thread of the chief screw which held his\nlife together were stripped, so that the screw could not get in or out,\nbut went on turning uselessly in the same place.\n\nThe postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to\nwait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let his excellency\nhave the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying and only wanted\nto get more money from the traveler.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this good or bad?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre asked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is good for me,\nbad for another traveler, and for himself it\xe2\x80\x99s unavoidable, because\nhe needs money for food; the man said an officer had once given him a\nthrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses.\nBut the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as\npossible. And I,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cshot D\xc3\xb3lokhov because I\nconsidered myself injured, and Louis XVI was executed because they\nconsidered him a criminal, and a year later they executed those who\nexecuted him\xe2\x80\x94also for some reason. What is bad? What is good? What\nshould one love and what hate? What does one live for? And what am I?\nWhat is life, and what is death? What power governs all?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and that\nnot a logical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer was:\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll die and all will end. You\xe2\x80\x99ll die and know all, or cease\nasking.\xe2\x80\x9d But dying was also dreadful.\n\nThe Torzh\xc3\xb3k peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering her\nwares, especially a pair of goatskin slippers. \xe2\x80\x9cI have hundreds of\nrubles I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered\ncloak looking timidly at me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does she\nwant the money for? As if that money could add a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth to\nhappiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me\nless a prey to evil and death?\xe2\x80\x94death which ends all and must come\ntoday or tomorrow\xe2\x80\x94at any rate, in an instant as compared with\neternity.\xe2\x80\x9d And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread,\nand again it turned uselessly in the same place.\n\nHis servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by\nMadame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous\nstruggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why did she resist\nher seducer when she loved him?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cGod could not have put\ninto her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wife\xe2\x80\x94as she\nonce was\xe2\x80\x94did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been\nfound out, nothing discovered,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre again said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\nwe can know is that we know nothing. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the height of human\nwisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEverything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and\nrepellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre\nfound a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this\ngentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the postmaster, entering the room followed by another\ntraveler, also detained for lack of horses.\n\nThe newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old\nman, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite\ngrayish color.\n\nPierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that\nhad been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the newcomer, who,\nwith a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off his wraps with the\naid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt boots\non his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, nankeen-covered, sheepskin\ncoat, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned back his big head with\nits broad temples and close-cropped hair, and looked at Bez\xc3\xbakhov. The\nstern, shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He\nfelt a wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his\nmind to ask him a question about the roads, the traveler had closed his\neyes. His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of\nthem Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a\ndeath\xe2\x80\x99s head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as\nit seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant\nwas also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache,\nevidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown.\nThis active old servant was unpacking the traveler\xe2\x80\x99s canteen and\npreparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything was\nready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a\ntumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom\nhe passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the\nneed, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with this\nstranger.\n\nThe servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down, * with an\nunfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be\nwanted.\n\n    * To indicate he did not want more tea.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Give me the book,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger.\n\nThe servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work,\nand the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him. All at\nonce the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and again,\nleaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his former\nposition with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time\nto turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady and\nsevere gaze straight on Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\nPierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright old\neyes attracted him irresistibly.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the pleasure of addressing Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov, if I am not\nmistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice.\n\nPierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of you, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nof your misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to\nsay\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYes, misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what\nhappened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI regret it very\nmuch, my dear sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent\nforward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but for\ngreater reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa by way\nof inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant\nto enter into conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him\ninvoluntarily, came up and sat down beside him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are unhappy, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger continued. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nare young and I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my\npower.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, with a forced smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very grateful\nto you. Where are you traveling from?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but\nin spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were\nirresistibly attractive to Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if for any reason you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel inclined to talk to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the old man, \xe2\x80\x9csay so, my dear sir.\xe2\x80\x9d And he suddenly smiled, in\nan unexpected and tenderly paternal way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your\nacquaintance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. And again, glancing at the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s\nhands, he looked more closely at the ring, with its skull\xe2\x80\x94a Masonic\nsign.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9care you a Mason?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nstranger, looking deeper and deeper into Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in\ntheir name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the\nconfidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own\nhabit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I am very far\nfrom understanding\xe2\x80\x94how am I to put it?\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid my way of looking\nat the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your outlook,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mason, \xe2\x80\x9cand the view of life you\nmention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts,\nis the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit\nof pride, indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I\nhad not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of life is a\nregrettable delusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as I may suppose you to be deluded,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, with a faint\nsmile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should never dare to say that I know the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mason,\nwhose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying stone on stone\nwith the cooperation of all, by the millions of generations from our\nforefather Adam to our own times, is that temple reared which is to be\na worthy dwelling place of the Great God,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, and closed his\neyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not believe in\nGod,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it\nessential to speak the whole truth.\n\nThe Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with\nmillions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he, poor\nman, had not the five rubles that would make him happy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you do not know Him, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mason. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\ncannot know Him. You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I am unhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what am I to\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very unhappy. You do\nnot know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He is in\nthee, and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!\xe2\x80\x9d\npronounced the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.\n\nHe paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf He were not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and I would not be\nspeaking of Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom\nhast thou denied?\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and\nauthority in his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWho invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence\ncame thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being?\ndidst thou, and why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the\nexistence of such an incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful,\neternal, and infinite in all His attributes?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe stopped and remained silent for a long time.\n\nPierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe exists, but to understand Him is hard,\xe2\x80\x9d the Mason began again,\nlooking not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the leaves\nof his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep\nstill. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could\nbring him to thee, could take him by the hand and show him to thee. But\nhow can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity,\nand all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may\nnot see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness\nand sinfulness?\xe2\x80\x9d He paused again. \xe2\x80\x9cWho art thou? Thou dreamest that\nthou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nwent on, with a somber and scornful smile. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou art more foolish\nand unreasonable than a little child, who, playing with the parts of a\nskillfully made watch, dares to say that, as he does not understand\nits use, he does not believe in the master who made it. To know Him is\nhard.... For ages, from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to\nattain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim; but\nin our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His\ngreatness....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Mason\xe2\x80\x99s face with\nshining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but believing with\nhis whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he accepted the wise\nreasoning contained in the Mason\xe2\x80\x99s words, or believed as a child\nbelieves, in the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s tone of conviction and earnestness, or\nthe tremor of the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s voice\xe2\x80\x94which sometimes almost broke\xe2\x80\x94or\nthose brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction, or the calm\nfirmness and certainty of his vocation, which radiated from his whole\nbeing (and which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own\ndejection and hopelessness)\xe2\x80\x94at any rate, Pierre longed with his whole\nsoul to believe and he did believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfort,\nregeneration, and return to life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nMason.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, feeling with dismay doubts\nreawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, in\nthe Mason\xe2\x80\x99s arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chow it is that the mind of man\ncannot attain the knowledge of which you speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish\nto imbibe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I receive that pure liquid into an impure\nvessel and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself\ncan I retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, that is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre joyfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those\nworldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into\nwhich intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one.\nThe highest wisdom has but one science\xe2\x80\x94the science of the whole\xe2\x80\x94the\nscience explaining the whole creation and man\xe2\x80\x99s place in it. To\nreceive that science it is necessary to purify and renew one\xe2\x80\x99s inner\nself, and so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to\nperfect one\xe2\x80\x99s self. And to attain this end, we have the light called\nconscience that God has implanted in our souls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, and ask\nthyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou attained\nrelying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich, you\nare clever, you are well educated. And what have you done with all these\ngood gifts? Are you content with yourself and with your life?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I hate my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre muttered, wincing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself; and as thou art\npurified, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir.\nHow have you spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving\neverything from society and giving nothing in return. You have become\nthe possessor of wealth. How have you used it? What have you done\nfor your neighbor? Have you ever thought of your tens of thousands\nof slaves? Have you helped them physically and morally? No! You have\nprofited by their toil to lead a profligate life. That is what you have\ndone. Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your\nneighbor? No! You have spent your life in idleness. Then you married, my\ndear sir\xe2\x80\x94took on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young\nwoman; and what have you done? You have not helped her to find the way\nof truth, my dear sir, but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and\nmisery. A man offended you and you shot him, and you say you do not\nknow God and hate your life. There is nothing strange in that, my dear\nsir!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse, again\nleaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre\nlooked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face and moved\nhis lips without uttering a sound. He wished to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, a vile,\nidle, vicious life!\xe2\x80\x9d but dared not break the silence.\n\nThe Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called his\nservant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about the horses?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, without looking at Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe exchange horses have just come,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the servant. \xe2\x80\x9cWill\nyou not rest here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, tell them to harness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me\nall, and without promising to help me?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, rising with\ndowncast head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at\nthe Mason. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I never thought of it, but I have led a contemptible\nand profligate life, though I did not like it and did not want to,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this man knows the truth and, if he wished to,\ncould disclose it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The\ntraveler, having packed his things with his practiced hands, began\nfastening his coat. When he had finished, he turned to Bez\xc3\xbakhov, and\nsaid in a tone of indifferent politeness:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to now, my dear sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?... I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Petersburg,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pierre, in a childlike,\nhesitating voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you. I agree with all you have said. But\ndo not suppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul I wish to be what you\nwould have me be, but I have never had help from anyone.... But it is\nI, above all, who am to blame for everything. Help me, teach me, and\nperhaps I may...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.\n\nThe Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp comes from God alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut such measure of help as\nour Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to\nPetersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski\xe2\x80\x9d (he took out his notebook\nand wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four).\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to give you a piece of advice. When you reach the capital,\nfirst of all devote some time to solitude and self-examination and do\nnot resume your former way of life. And now I wish you a good journey,\nmy dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, seeing that his servant had entered... \xe2\x80\x9cand\nsuccess.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe traveler was Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich Bazd\xc3\xa9ev, as Pierre saw from the\npostmaster\xe2\x80\x99s book. Bazd\xc3\xa9ev had been one of the best-known Freemasons\nand Martinists, even in Nov\xc3\xadkov\xe2\x80\x99s time. For a long while after he had\ngone, Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down\nthe room, pondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous sense\nof beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful, irreproachable,\nvirtuous future that seemed to him so easy. It seemed to him that he had\nbeen vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to\nbe virtuous. Not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul. He\nfirmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in\nthe aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue, and that is how\nFreemasonry presented itself to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nOn reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival,\nhe went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas \xc3\xa0 Kempis, whose\nbook had been sent him by someone unknown. One thing he continually\nrealized as he read that book: the joy, hitherto unknown to him,\nof believing in the possibility of attaining perfection, and in the\npossibility of active brotherly love among men, which Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich\nhad revealed to him. A week after his arrival, the young Polish count,\nWillarski, whom Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society, came\ninto his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in\nwhich D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s second had called on him, and, having closed the\ndoor behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the\nroom, addressed Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to you with a message and an offer, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid without sitting down. \xe2\x80\x9cA person of very high standing in our\nBrotherhood has made application for you to be received into our Order\nbefore the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor. I\nconsider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person\xe2\x80\x99s wishes. Do you wish\nto enter the Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always before met\nat balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women,\nsurprised Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nWillarski bowed his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more question, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I beg you to answer\nin all sincerity\xe2\x80\x94not as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you\nrenounced your former convictions\xe2\x80\x94do you believe in God?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre considered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... yes, I believe in God,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case...\xe2\x80\x9d began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do believe in God,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case we can go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Willarski. \xe2\x80\x9cMy carriage is at your\nservice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWillarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries as\nto what he must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied that\nbrothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to\ntell the truth.\n\nHaving entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its\nheadquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a small\nwell-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of\na servant. From there they passed into another room. A man in strange\nattire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him, said\nsomething to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small\nwardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen\nbefore. Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski bound\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind, catching some\nhairs painfully in the knot. Then he drew his face down, kissed him, and\ntaking him by the hand led him forward. The hairs tied in the knot hurt\nPierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile.\nHis huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a puckered, though\nsmiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.\n\nHaving led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever happens to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must bear it all manfully\nif you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood.\xe2\x80\x9d (Pierre nodded\naffirmatively.) \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover\nyour eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d added Willarski. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you courage and success,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand, pressing Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s hand, he went out.\n\nLeft alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or twice\nhe shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if\nwishing to take it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent\nwith his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb,\nhis legs almost gave way, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He\nexperienced a variety of most complex sensations. He felt afraid of what\nwould happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear. He felt\ncurious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to\nhim; but most of all, he felt joyful that the moment had come when he\nwould at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively\nvirtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met Joseph\nAlex\xc3\xa9evich. Loud knocks were heard at the door. Pierre took the bandage\noff his eyes and glanced around him. The room was in black darkness,\nonly a small lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre went nearer\nand saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book.\nThe book was the Gospel, and the white thing with the lamp inside was a\nhuman skull with its cavities and teeth. After reading the first words\nof the Gospel: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the beginning was the Word and the Word was with\nGod,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled\nwith something. It was a coffin with bones inside. He was not at all\nsurprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite\nunlike the old one, he expected everything to be unusual, even more\nunusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a coffin, the Gospel\xe2\x80\x94it\nseemed to him that he had expected all this and even more. Trying\nto stimulate his emotions he looked around. \xe2\x80\x9cGod, death, love, the\nbrotherhood of man,\xe2\x80\x9d he kept saying to himself, associating these\nwords with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened and someone came in.\n\nBy the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed, he\nsaw a rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the\ndarkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the\ntable and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands.\n\nThis short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and\npart of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high\nwhite ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from\nbelow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what have you come hither?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the newcomer, turning in\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have\nyou, who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not\nseen the light, come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue,\nenlightenment?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a\nsense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at\nconfession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete\nstranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated\nbreath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the\nbrother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was\nknown). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew,\nSmolyan\xc3\xadnov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an\nacquaintance\xe2\x80\x94he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor.\nFor a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor had to\nrepeat his question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... I... I... desire regeneration,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre uttered with\ndifficulty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smolyan\xc3\xadnov, and went on at once: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you any\nidea of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your\naim?\xe2\x80\x9d said he quietly and quickly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre,\nwith a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his\nexcitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in\nRussian.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your conception of Freemasonry?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who\nhave virtuous aims,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy\nof his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nimagine...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with\nthis answer. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you sought for means of attaining your aim in\nreligion?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre,\nso softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was\nsaying. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been an atheist,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,\ntherefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nRhetor, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Pierre.\n\nThe Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast,\nand began to speak.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood\nwith profit. The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation on\nwhich it rests and which no human power can destroy, is the preservation\nand handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery... which\nhas come down to us from the remotest ages, even from the first man\xe2\x80\x94a\nmystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this\nmystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be\nprepared by long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope\nto attain it quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing\nour members as much as possible to reform their hearts, to purify and\nenlighten their minds, by means handed on to us by tradition from those\nwho have striven to attain this mystery, and thereby to render them\ncapable of receiving it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to improve\nthe whole human race, offering it in our members an example of piety\nand virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which\nsways the world. Think this over and I will come to you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo combat the evil which sways the world...\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre repeated, and a\nmental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind.\nHe imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and he\naddressed an edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself\nvicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed,\nimagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the three\nobjects mentioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind,\nespecially appealed to Pierre. The important mystery mentioned by the\nRhetor, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem to him essential,\nand the second aim, that of purifying and regenerating himself, did not\nmuch interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he\nwas already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all\nthat was good.\n\nHalf an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the\nseven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon\xe2\x80\x99s temple,\nwhich every Freemason should cultivate in himself. These virtues were:\n1. Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order. 2. Obedience to\nthose of higher ranks in the Order. 3. Morality. 4. Love of mankind. 5.\nCourage. 6. Generosity. 7. The love of death.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death,\xe2\x80\x9d the\nRhetor said, \xe2\x80\x9cto bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but\nas a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue\nfrom this distressful life, and leads it to its place of recompense and\npeace.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that must be so,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, when after these words the\nRhetor went away, leaving him to solitary meditation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be so,\nbut I am still so weak that I love my life, the meaning of which is only\nnow gradually opening before me.\xe2\x80\x9d But five of the other virtues which\nPierre recalled, counting them on his fingers, he felt already in his\nsoul: courage, generosity, morality, love of mankind, and especially\nobedience\xe2\x80\x94which did not even seem to him a virtue, but a joy. (He now\nfelt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will\nto those who knew the indubitable truth.) He forgot what the seventh\nvirtue was and could not recall it.\n\nThe third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre\nwhether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to\nall that would be required of him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready for everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must also inform you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rhetor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our Order\ndelivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means, which\nmay perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom\nand virtue than mere words. This chamber with what you see therein\nshould already have suggested to your heart, if it is sincere, more than\nwords could do. You will perhaps also see in your further initiation a\nlike method of enlightenment. Our Order imitates the ancient societies\nthat explained their teaching by hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe Rhetor, \xe2\x80\x9cis an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses\nbut which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He\nlistened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his\nordeal was about to begin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are resolved, I must begin your initiation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rhetor\ncoming closer to Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cIn token of generosity I ask you to give me\nall your valuables.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have nothing here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre, supposing that he was\nasked to give up all he possessed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you have with you: watch, money, rings....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage for\nsome time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that had been\ndone, the Rhetor said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn token of obedience, I ask you to undress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to the\nRhetor\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nleft breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers\nto above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also\nand was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the\ntrouble, but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him\na slipper for his left foot. With a childlike smile of embarrassment,\ndoubt, and self-derision, which appeared on his face against his will,\nPierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart, before his\nbrother Rhetor, and awaited his further commands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief\npassion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy passion! I have had so many,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the\npath of virtue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Mason.\n\nPierre paused, seeking a reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to give\nthe pre-eminence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.\n\nThe Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this\nanswer. At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that lay\non the table, again bound his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the last time I say to you\xe2\x80\x94turn all your attention upon\nyourself, put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in\npassion but in your own heart. The source of blessedness is not without\nus but within....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source\nof blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nSoon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre, not\nthe Rhetor but Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his\nvoice. To fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution Pierre\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I agree,\xe2\x80\x9d and with a beaming, childlike smile,\nhis fat chest uncovered, stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered\nand one booted foot, he advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his\nbare chest. He was conducted from that room along passages that turned\nbackwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the\nLodge. Willarski coughed, he was answered by the Masonic knock with\nmallets, the doors opened before them. A bass voice (Pierre was still\nblindfolded) questioned him as to who he was, when and where he was\nborn, and so on. Then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded,\nand as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his\npilgrimage, of holy friendship, of the Eternal Architect of the\nuniverse, and of the courage with which he should endure toils and\ndangers. During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he was spoken\nof now as the \xe2\x80\x9cSeeker,\xe2\x80\x9d now as the \xe2\x80\x9cSufferer,\xe2\x80\x9d and now as the\n\xe2\x80\x9cPostulant,\xe2\x80\x9d to the accompaniment of various knockings with\nmallets and swords. As he was being led up to some object he noticed a\nhesitation and uncertainty among his conductors. He heard those around\nhim disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should be\nled along a certain carpet. After that they took his right hand, placed\nit on something, and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left\nbreast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud\nan oath of fidelity to the laws of the Order. The candles were then\nextinguished and some spirit lighted, as Pierre knew by the smell, and\nhe was told that he would now see the lesser light. The bandage was\ntaken off his eyes and, by the faint light of the burning spirit,\nPierre, as in a dream, saw several men standing before him, wearing\naprons like the Rhetor\xe2\x80\x99s and holding swords in their hands pointed at\nhis breast. Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with\nblood. On seeing this, Pierre moved forward with his breast toward the\nswords, meaning them to pierce it. But the swords were drawn back from\nhim and he was at once blindfolded again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow thou hast seen the lesser light,\xe2\x80\x9d uttered a voice. Then the\ncandles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the\nbandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together: \xe2\x80\x9cSic\ntransit gloria mundi.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room\nand at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some\ntwelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them\nPierre had met in Petersburg society. In the President\xe2\x80\x99s chair sat a\nyoung man he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from his\nneck. On his right sat the Italian abb\xc3\xa9 whom Pierre had met at\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s two years before. There were also present a very\ndistinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the\nKur\xc3\xa1gins\xe2\x80\x99. All maintained a solemn silence, listening to the words\nof the President, who held a mallet in his hand. Let into the wall was\na star-shaped light. At one side of the table was a small carpet with\nvarious figures worked upon it, at the other was something resembling an\naltar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round it stood seven large\ncandlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the brothers led Pierre\nup to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and bade him lie down,\nsaying that he must prostrate himself at the Gates of the Temple.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must first receive the trowel,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered one of the brothers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hush, please!\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\n\nPierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without\nobeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I? What am\nI doing? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they laughing at me? Shan\xe2\x80\x99t I be ashamed to remember\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at\nthe serious faces of those around, remembered all he had already gone\nthrough, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast\nat his hesitation and, trying to arouse his former devotional feeling,\nprostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really, the\nfeeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before. When\nhe had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white leather\napron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he was given a trowel\nand three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master addressed him. He\ntold him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that\napron, which symbolized strength and purity; then of the unexplained\ntrowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice,\nand indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor. As to the\nfirst pair of gloves, a man\xe2\x80\x99s, he said that Pierre could not know\ntheir meaning but must keep them. The second pair of man\xe2\x80\x99s gloves\nhe was to wear at the meetings, and finally of the third, a pair of\nwomen\xe2\x80\x99s gloves, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cDear brother, these woman\xe2\x80\x99s gloves are\nintended for you too. Give them to the woman whom you shall honor most\nof all. This gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom\nyou select to be your worthy helpmeet in Masonry.\xe2\x80\x9d And after a pause,\nhe added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut beware, dear brother, that these gloves do not deck\nhands that are unclean.\xe2\x80\x9d While the Grand Master said these last words\nit seemed to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. Pierre himself grew still\nmore confused, blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes, began\nlooking about him uneasily, and an awkward pause followed.\n\nThis silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to the\nrug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of\nall the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a\ntrowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and\nso on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs of\nthe Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit down.\nThe Grand Master began reading the statutes. They were very long, and\nPierre, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to\nunderstand what was being read. He managed to follow only the last words\nof the statutes and these remained in his mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn our temples we recognize no other distinctions,\xe2\x80\x9d read the Grand\nMaster, \xe2\x80\x9cbut those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any\ndistinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brother\xe2\x80\x99s aid\nwhoever he may be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that falleth,\nnever bear malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and courteous.\nKindle in all hearts the flame of virtue. Share thy happiness with thy\nneighbor, and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy\nenemy, do not avenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus fulfilling\nthe highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which\nthou hast lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with tears\nof joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to answer the\ncongratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all\nsides. He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only\nbrothers, and burned with impatience to set to work with them.\n\nThe Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat down in\ntheir places, and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of\nhumility.\n\nThe Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed,\nand the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of \xe2\x80\x9cCollector\nof Alms\xe2\x80\x9d went round to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked\nto subscribe all he had, but fearing that it might look like pride\nsubscribed the same amount as the others.\n\nThe meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had\nreturned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had\nbecome completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits\nand way of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was sitting at\nhome reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square,\none side of which symbolized God, another moral things, a third\nphysical things, and the fourth a combination of these. Now and then\nhis attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in\nimagination a new plan of life. On the previous evening at the Lodge, he\nhad heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it\nwould be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. Pierre proposed going to his\nestates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs.\nHe was joyfully planning this new life, when Prince Vas\xc3\xadli suddenly\nentered the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you\nquarreled with H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, mon cher? You are under a delusion,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli, as he entered. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all about it, and I can tell\nyou positively that H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne is as innocent before you as Christ was\nbefore the Jews.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre was about to reply, but Prince Vas\xc3\xadli interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I\nknow all about it and understand it all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou behaved as\nbecomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t\ngo into that. But consider the position in which you are placing her and\nme in the eyes of society, and even of the court,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, lowering\nhis voice. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is living in Moscow and you are here. Remember,\ndear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d and he drew Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s arm downwards, \xe2\x80\x9cit is simply a\nmisunderstanding. I expect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her\na letter at once, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll come here and all will be explained, or\nelse, my dear boy, let me tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s quite likely you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to\nsuffer for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli gave Pierre a significant look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a\nkeen interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\ndid not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to\nspeak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had\nfirmly resolved to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words of the\nMasonic statutes, \xe2\x80\x9cbe kindly and courteous,\xe2\x80\x9d recurred to him. He\nblinked, went red, got up and sat down again, struggling with himself\nto do what was for him the most difficult thing in life\xe2\x80\x94to say an\nunpleasant thing to a man\xe2\x80\x99s face, to say what the other, whoever\nhe might be, did not expect. He was so used to submitting to Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he would be\nunable to withstand it now, but he also felt that on what he said now\nhis future depended\xe2\x80\x94whether he would follow the same old road, or that\nnew path so attractively shown him by the Masons, on which he firmly\nbelieved he would be reborn to a new life.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Vas\xc3\xadli playfully, \xe2\x80\x9csay \xe2\x80\x98yes,\xe2\x80\x99\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to her myself, and we will kill the fatted calf.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut before Prince Vas\xc3\xadli had finished his playful speech, Pierre,\nwithout looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his\nfather, muttered in a whisper:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!\xe2\x80\x9d And he jumped up\nand opened the door for him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of\nconfusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you? Are you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vas\xc3\xadli had to go\nwithout receiving any explanation.\n\nA week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons,\nand leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his\nestates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons\nand promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe duel between Pierre and D\xc3\xb3lokhov was hushed up and, in spite of\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s severity regarding duels at that time, neither the\nprincipals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel,\nconfirmed by Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s rupture with his wife, was the talk of society.\nPierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was\nan illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best\nmatch in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his\nmarriage\xe2\x80\x94when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing\nto hope from him\xe2\x80\x94especially as he did not know how, and did not\nwish, to court society\xe2\x80\x99s favor. Now he alone was blamed for what had\nhappened, he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his\nfather to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\ndeparture H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne returned to Petersburg, she was received by all her\nacquaintances not only cordially, but even with a shade of deference\ndue to her misfortune. When conversation turned on her husband H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\nassumed a dignified expression, which with characteristic tact she had\nacquired though she did not understand its significance. This expression\nsuggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly\nand that her husband was a cross laid upon her by God. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\nexpressed his opinion more openly. He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre\nwas mentioned and, pointing to his forehead, remarked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bit touched\xe2\x80\x94I always said so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said from the first,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna referring to\nPierre, \xe2\x80\x9cI said at the time and before anyone else\xe2\x80\x9d (she insisted\non her priority) \xe2\x80\x9cthat that senseless young man was spoiled by the\ndepraved ideas of these days. I said so even at the time when everybody\nwas in raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and\nwhen, if you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees.\nAnd how has it ended? I was against this marriage even then and foretold\nall that has happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of\nsoirees as before\xe2\x80\x94such as she alone had the gift of arranging\xe2\x80\x94at\nwhich was to be found \xe2\x80\x9cthe cream of really good society, the bloom\nof the intellectual essence of Petersburg,\xe2\x80\x9d as she herself put it.\nBesides this refined selection of society Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s receptions\nwere also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new\nand interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the\nstate of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court\nsociety so dearly and distinctly indicated.\n\nToward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\ndestruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerst\xc3\xa4dt and the\nsurrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our\ntroops had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon\nwas beginning, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna gave one of her soirees. The \xe2\x80\x9ccream of\nreally good society\xe2\x80\x9d consisted of the fascinating H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, forsaken\nby her husband, Mortemart, the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had\njust returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a young man\nreferred to in that drawing room as \xe2\x80\x9ca man of great merit\xe2\x80\x9d (un homme\nde beaucoup de m\xc3\xa9rite), a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother,\nand several other less noteworthy persons.\n\nThe novelty Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna was setting before her guests that evening\nwas Bor\xc3\xads Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y, who had just arrived as a special messenger from\nthe Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.\n\nThe temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that\nevening was this:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to\ncountenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyance and\nmortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not cease\nto express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say to the\nKing of Prussia and others: \xe2\x80\x98So much the worse for you. Tu l\xe2\x80\x99as\nvoulu, George Dandin,\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s all we have to say about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Bor\xc3\xads, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the drawing\nroom, almost all the company had assembled, and the conversation, guided\nby Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and\nthe hope of an alliance with her.\n\nBor\xc3\xads, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and self-possessed,\nentered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an\naide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and\nthen brought back to the general circle.\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to\nseveral persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered description\nof each.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince Hippolyte Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x94charming young fellow; M.\nKronq,\xe2\x80\x94charg\xc3\xa9 d\xe2\x80\x99affaires from Copenhagen\xe2\x80\x94a profound intellect,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand simply, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sh\xc3\xadtov\xe2\x80\x94a man of great merit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this of the man\nusually so described.\n\nThanks to Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, his own tastes, and the\npeculiarities of his reserved nature, Bor\xc3\xads had managed during his\nservice to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a\nvery important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to\nPrussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had\nbecome thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had\nbeen so pleased at Olm\xc3\xbctz and according to which an ensign might rank\nincomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was\nneeded for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or\nperseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can\ngrant rewards, and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his\nsuccess and at the inability of others to understand these things.\nIn consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all\nhis relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were\ncompletely altered. He was not rich, but would spend his last groat to\nbe better dressed than others, and would rather deprive himself of many\npleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear\nin the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform. He made friends with\nand sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and\nwho could therefore be of use to him. He liked Petersburg and despised\nMoscow. The remembrance of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 house and of his childish\nlove for Nat\xc3\xa1sha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see\nthe Rost\xc3\xb3vs since the day of his departure for the army. To be in Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s drawing room he considered an important step up in the\nservice, and he at once understood his role, letting his hostess make\nuse of whatever interest he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned\neach face, appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with\neach of those present, and the advantages that might accrue. He took\nthe seat indicated to him beside the fair H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne and listened to the\ngeneral conversation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable\nthat not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure\nthem, and she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the\nactual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Danish charg\xc3\xa9\nd\xe2\x80\x99affaires.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doubt is flattering,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cthe man of profound intellect,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwith a subtle smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of\nAustria,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mortemart. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor of Austria can never have\nthought of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear vicomte,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x99Urope\xe2\x80\x9d (for\nsome reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined\nFrench pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with\na Frenchman), \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x99Urope ne sera jamais notre alli\xc3\xa9e sinc\xc3\xa8re.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cEurope will never be our sincere ally.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAfter that Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King\nof Prussia, in order to draw Bor\xc3\xads into the conversation.\n\nBor\xc3\xads listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his turn,\nbut managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor, the\nbeautiful H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, whose eyes several times met those of the handsome\nyoung aide-de-camp with a smile.\n\nSpeaking of the position of Prussia, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna very naturally asked\nBor\xc3\xads to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he\nfound the Prussian army. Bor\xc3\xads, speaking with deliberation, told them\nin pure, correct French many interesting details about the armies and\nthe court, carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his\nown about the facts he was recounting. For some time he engrossed the\ngeneral attention, and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna felt that the novelty she had\nserved up was received with pleasure by all her visitors. The greatest\nattention of all to Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 narrative was shown by H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne. She asked\nhim several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in\nthe state of the Prussian army. As soon as he had finished she turned to\nhim with her usual smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou absolutely must come and see me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a tone that\nimplied that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was\nabsolutely necessary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a\nconversation with her, when Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna called him away on the\npretext that her aunt wished to hear him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know her husband, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, closing her\neyes and indicating H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne with a sorrowful gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, she is\nsuch an unfortunate and charming woman! Don\xe2\x80\x99t mention him before\nher\xe2\x80\x94please don\xe2\x80\x99t! It is too painful for her!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nWhen Bor\xc3\xads and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte\nhad the ear of the company.\n\nBending forward in his armchair he said: \xe2\x80\x9cLe Roi de Prusse!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nhaving said this laughed. Everyone turned toward him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLe Roi de Prusse?\xe2\x80\x9d Hippolyte said interrogatively, again laughing,\nand then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\nwaited for him to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to say no more\nshe began to tell of how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the\nsword of Frederick the Great.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the sword of Frederick the Great which I...\xe2\x80\x9d she began, but\nHippolyte interrupted her with the words: \xe2\x80\x9cLe Roi de Prusse...\xe2\x80\x9d and\nagain, as soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and said no\nmore.\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippolyte\xe2\x80\x99s friend, addressed him\nfirmly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, what about your Roi de Prusse?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. I only wished to say...\xe2\x80\x9d (he wanted to repeat\na joke he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that\nevening to get in) \xe2\x80\x9cI only wished to say that we are wrong to fight\npour le Roi de Prusse!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical\nor appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody\nlaughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour joke is too bad, it\xe2\x80\x99s witty but unjust,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna, shaking her little shriveled finger at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse, but for right principles.\nOh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nThe conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the\npolitical news. It became particularly animated toward the end of the\nevening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know N\xe2\x80\x94 N\xe2\x80\x94 received a snuffbox with the portrait last\nyear?\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cthe man of profound intellect.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nS\xe2\x80\x94 S\xe2\x80\x94 get the same distinction?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s portrait is a reward but\nnot a distinction,\xe2\x80\x9d said the diplomatist\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca gift, rather.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d replied another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen everybody rose to go, H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne who had spoken very little all\nthe evening again turned to Bor\xc3\xads, asking him in a tone of caressing\nsignificant command to come to her on Tuesday.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is of great importance to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning with a smile\ntoward Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, with the same sad smile with\nwhich she spoke of her exalted patroness, supported H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s wish.\n\nIt seemed as if from some words Bor\xc3\xads had spoken that evening about the\nPrussian army, H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne had suddenly found it necessary to see him.\nShe seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on\nTuesday.\n\nBut on Tuesday evening, having come to H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s splendid salon,\nBor\xc3\xads received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for\nhim to come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to\nhim, and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly\nand in a whisper, with a strangely unsmiling face: \xe2\x80\x9cCome to dinner\ntomorrow... in the evening. You must come.... Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDuring that stay in Petersburg, Bor\xc3\xads became an intimate in the\ncountess\xe2\x80\x99 house.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier. Everywhere one\nheard curses on Bonaparte, \xe2\x80\x9cthe enemy of mankind.\xe2\x80\x9d Militiamen and\nrecruits were being enrolled in the villages, and from the seat of\nwar came contradictory news, false as usual and therefore variously\ninterpreted. The life of old Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, Prince Andrew, and\nPrincess Mary had greatly changed since 1805.\n\nIn 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief\nthen appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia.\nDespite the weakness of age, which had become particularly noticeable\nsince the time when he thought his son had been killed, he did not think\nit right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor\nhimself, and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy\nand strength. He was continually traveling through the three provinces\nentrusted to him, was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties, severe\nto cruel with his subordinates, and went into everything down to the\nminutest details himself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in\nmathematics from her father, and when the old prince was at home went\nto his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his\ngrandfather called him). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet\nnurse and nurse S\xc3\xa1vishna in the late princess\xe2\x80\x99 rooms and Princess\nMary spent most of the day in the nursery, taking a mother\xe2\x80\x99s place to\nher little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed\npassionately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself\nto give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel\xe2\x80\x94as she\ncalled her nephew\xe2\x80\x94and playing with him.\n\nNear the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the\ntomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument\nbrought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to\nfly upwards. The angel\xe2\x80\x99s upper lip was slightly raised as though\nabout to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and\nPrincess Mary admitted to one another that the angel\xe2\x80\x99s face reminded\nthem strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger,\nthough of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the\nexpression the sculptor had happened to give the angel\xe2\x80\x99s face, Prince\nAndrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead\nwife: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, why have you done this to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSoon after Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s return the old prince made over to him a\nlarge estate, Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills.\nPartly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills,\npartly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude,\nPrince Andrew made use of Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, began building and spent most of\nhis time there.\n\nAfter the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not\nto continue his military service, and when the war recommenced\nand everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the\nrecruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son\nseemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man,\nroused by activity, expected the best results from the new campaign,\nwhile Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the war and\nsecretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.\n\nOn February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits.\nPrince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father\xe2\x80\x99s\nabsence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who\nhad driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters\nfor Prince Andrew.\n\nNot finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the\nletters to Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s apartments, but did not find him there. He\nwas told that the prince had gone to the nursery.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, your excellency, P\xc3\xa9trusha has brought some papers,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he\npoured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said crossly, and, his hand shaking\nunintentionally, he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the\nmixture onto the floor and asked for some more water. The maid brought\nit.\n\nThere were in the room a child\xe2\x80\x99s cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a\ntable, a child\xe2\x80\x99s table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew\nwas sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a single candle was burning on\nthe table, screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall\non the cot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside\nthe cot where she was standing, \xe2\x80\x9cbetter wait a bit... later...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things\noff\xe2\x80\x94and this is what comes of it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew in an\nexasperated whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, really... it\xe2\x80\x99s better not to wake him... he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the princess in a tone of entreaty.\n\nPrince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass\nin hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we\xe2\x80\x99d really better not wake him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said hesitating.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please... really... I think so... but as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrincess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion\nhad prevailed. She drew her brother\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the maid who was\ncalling him in a whisper.\n\nIt was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the boy\nwho was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their household\ndoctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they had\nbeen trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by sleeplessness\nand anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and\nreproached and disputed with each other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cP\xc3\xa9trusha has come with papers from your father,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the\nmaid.\n\nPrince Andrew went out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil take them!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, and after listening to the verbal\ninstructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s letter, he returned to the nursery.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill the same. Wait, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Karl Iv\xc3\xa1nich always says\nthat sleep is more important than anything,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Princess Mary\nwith a sigh.\n\nPrince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound you and your Karl Iv\xc3\xa1nich!\xe2\x80\x9d He took the glass with the\ndrops and again went up to the cot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary.\n\nBut he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes,\nand stooped glass in hand over the infant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you\xe2\x80\x94give it him!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively\nand calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed\nhoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and sat\ndown on a sofa in the next room.\n\nHe still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them mechanically he\nbegan reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote\nin his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:\n\nHave just this moment received by special messenger very joyful\nnews\xe2\x80\x94if it\xe2\x80\x99s not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete\nvictory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing,\nand the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a\nGerman\xe2\x80\x94I congratulate him! I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out what the commander at\nK\xc3\xb3rchevo\xe2\x80\x94a certain Khandrik\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x94is up to; till now the additional\nmen and provisions have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and\nsay I\xe2\x80\x99ll have his head off if everything is not here in a week.\nHave received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle\nfrom P\xc3\xa9tenka\xe2\x80\x94he took part in it\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s all true. When\nmischief-makers don\xe2\x80\x99t meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He is\nsaid to be fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to K\xc3\xb3rchevo\nwithout delay and carry out instructions!\n\nPrince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It was\na closely written letter of two sheets from Bil\xc3\xadbin. He folded it up\nwithout reading it and reread his father\xe2\x80\x99s letter, ending with the\nwords: \xe2\x80\x9cGallop off to K\xc3\xb3rchevo and carry out instructions!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, pardon me, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go now till the child is better,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nhe, going to the door and looking into the nursery.\n\nPrincess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes, and what else did he say that\xe2\x80\x99s unpleasant?\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nPrince Andrew, recalling his father\xe2\x80\x99s letter. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we have gained\na victory over Bonaparte, just when I\xe2\x80\x99m not serving. Yes, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s\nalways poking fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!\xe2\x80\x9d And he began reading\nBil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s letter which was written in French. He read without\nunderstanding half of it, read only to forget, if but for a moment, what\nhe had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all\nelse.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and\nthough he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms,\nhe described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and\nself-derision genuinely Russian. Bil\xc3\xadbin wrote that the obligation of\ndiplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince\nAndrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he\nhad accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army.\nThe letter was old, having been written before the battle at\nPreussisch-Eylau.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote\nBil\xc3\xadbin, \xe2\x80\x9cas you know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I\nhave certainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for me;\nwhat I have seen during these last three months is incredible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin ab ovo. \xe2\x80\x98The enemy of the human race,\xe2\x80\x99 as you know,\nattacks the Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have\nonly betrayed us three times in three years. We take up their cause, but\nit turns out that \xe2\x80\x98the enemy of the human race\xe2\x80\x99 pays no heed to\nour fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the\nPrussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun,\nand in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs\nhimself in the palace at Potsdam.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I most ardently desire,\xe2\x80\x99 writes the King of Prussia to\nBonaparte, \xe2\x80\x98that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my\npalace in a manner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances\nallowed, I have hastened to take all steps to that end. May I have\nsucceeded!\xe2\x80\x99 The Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to\nthe French and lay down their arms at the first demand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the\nKing of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All\nthis is absolutely true.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude,\nit turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more,\nin war on our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have\neverything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely,\na commander in chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success\nmight have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so\nyoung, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of Prozor\xc3\xb3vski\nand K\xc3\xa1menski the latter was preferred. The general comes to us,\nSuv\xc3\xb3rov-like, in a kib\xc3\xadtka, and is received with acclamations of joy\nand triumph.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails\nare taken to the field marshal\xe2\x80\x99s room, for he likes to do everything\nhimself. I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant\nfor us. The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed\nto him. We search, but none are to be found. The field marshal grows\nimpatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor\nto Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts into one of his wild\nfuries and rages at everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens\nthem, and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! So\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way they treat me! No confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep\nan eye on me! Very well then! Get along with you!\xe2\x80\x99 So he writes the\nfamous order of the day to General Bennigsen:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the\narmy. You have brought your army corps to Pult\xc3\xbask, routed: here it is\nexposed, and without fuel or forage, so something must be done, and, as\nyou yourself reported to Count Buxh\xc3\xb6wden yesterday, you must think of\nretreating to our frontier\xe2\x80\x94which do today.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98From all my riding,\xe2\x80\x99 he writes to the Emperor, \xe2\x80\x98I have got a\nsaddle sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents\nmy riding and commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the\ncommand to the general next in seniority, Count Buxh\xc3\xb6wden, having sent\nhim my whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising him if there is\na lack of bread, to move farther into the interior of Prussia, for only\none day\xe2\x80\x99s ration of bread remains, and in some regiments none at all,\nas reported by the division commanders, Ostermann and Sedmor\xc3\xa9tzki, and\nall that the peasants had has been eaten up. I myself will remain in\nhospital at Ostrolenka till I recover. In regard to which I humbly\nsubmit my report, with the information that if the army remains in its\npresent bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left\nin it by spring.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is\nalready in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and\nglorious task for which he was chosen. I shall await your most gracious\npermission here in hospital, that I may not have to play the part of a\nsecretary rather than commander in the army. My removal from the army\ndoes not produce the slightest stir\xe2\x80\x94a blind man has left it. There are\nthousands such as I in Russia.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all,\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it logical?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly\ninteresting and entertaining. After the field marshal\xe2\x80\x99s departure\nit appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle.\nBuxh\xc3\xb6wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen\ndoes not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who\nare within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity\nto fight a battle \xe2\x80\x98on his own hand\xe2\x80\x99 as the Germans say. He does so.\nThis is the battle of Pult\xc3\xbask, which is considered a great victory but\nin my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have\na very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who\nretreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to\nthat it is we who lost the battle of Pult\xc3\xbask. In short, we retreat\nafter the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a\nvictory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the\npost of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up\nthe command of the army to General Buxh\xc3\xb6wden. During this interregnum\nwe begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is\nno longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to\navoid General Buxh\xc3\xb6wden who by right of seniority should be our chief.\nSo energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable\nriver we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who at\nthe moment is not Bonaparte but Buxh\xc3\xb6wden. General Buxh\xc3\xb6wden was all\nbut attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one\nof these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him. Buxh\xc3\xb6wden pursues\nus\xe2\x80\x94we scuttle. He hardly crosses the river to our side before we\nrecross to the other. At last our enemy, Buxh\xc3\xb6wden, catches us and\nattacks. Both generals are angry, and the result is a challenge on\nBuxh\xc3\xb6wden\xe2\x80\x99s part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsen\xe2\x80\x99s. But at the\ncritical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at\nPult\xc3\xbask to Petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in\nchief, and our first foe, Buxh\xc3\xb6wden, is vanquished; we can now turn\nour thoughts to the second, Bonaparte. But as it turns out, just at\nthat moment a third enemy rises before us\xe2\x80\x94namely the Orthodox Russian\nsoldiers, loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot!\nThe stores are empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox begin looting,\nand in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea. Half the\nregiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything\nto fire and sword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the hospitals\noverflow with sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice the marauders even\nattack our headquarters, and the commander in chief has to ask for a\nbattalion to disperse them. During one of these attacks they carried off\nmy empty portmanteau and my dressing gown. The Emperor proposes to give\nall commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much\nfear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while,\nin spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust\nBil\xc3\xadbin), what he had read began to interest him more and more. When he\nhad read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away. It was\nnot what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life out\nthere in which he had now no part could perturb him. He shut his eyes,\nrubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he\nhad read, and listened to what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly he\nthought he heard a strange noise through the door. He was seized with\nalarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was\nreading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it.\n\nJust as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him\nwith a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind\nhim.\n\nAs often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was\nseized by an unreasoning panic\xe2\x80\x94it occurred to him that the child was\ndead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll is over,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his\nforehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it\nempty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the\ncurtain aside and for some time his frightened, restless eyes could not\nfind the baby. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he\nlay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow, and was smacking\nhis lips in his sleep and breathing evenly.\n\nPrince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had\nalready lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught him,\ntried with his lips whether the child was still feverish. The soft\nforehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand; even\nthe hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspired. He was not dead,\nbut evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent. Prince Andrew\nlonged to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart, this helpless\nlittle creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him, gazing at his\nhead and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket. He\nheard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of\nthe cot. He did not look round, but still gazing at the infant\xe2\x80\x99s face\nlistened to his regular breathing. The dark shadow was Princess Mary,\nwho had come up to the cot with noiseless steps, lifted the curtain,\nand dropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her without\nlooking and held out his hand to her. She pressed it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has perspired,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming to tell you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead\nagainst the pillow.\n\nPrince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain her\nluminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that\nwere in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him, slightly\ncatching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a warning gesture\nand stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing\nto leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the\nworld. Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair\nagainst the muslin of the curtain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, this is the one thing left me now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a sigh.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nSoon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went to the\nKiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking with\nhim full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to\nwhat he should do on his estates.\n\nWhen he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office\nand explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them that steps\nwould be taken immediately to free his serfs\xe2\x80\x94and that till then they\nwere not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies\nwere not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs,\npunishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals,\nasylums, and schools were to be established on all the estates. Some of\nthe stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with\nalarm, supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased\nwith their management and embezzlement of money, some after their first\nfright were amused by Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s lisp and the new words they had not\nheard before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked, while\nthe cleverest among them, including the chief steward, understood from\nthis speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends.\n\nThe chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s intentions,\nbut remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into\nthe general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.\n\nDespite Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s enormous wealth, since he had come into an\nincome which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year,\nPierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him\nan allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the\nfollowing budget:\n\nAbout 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about\n30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town house,\nand the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in\npensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to\nthe countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building of a\nnew church, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last\ntwo years, and he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was\nspent, and almost every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the\nchief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests,\nor of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first\ntask Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or\ninclination\xe2\x80\x94practical business.\n\nHe discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But\nhe felt that this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these\nconsultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with\nthem or make them move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the state\nof things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the necessity of\npaying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor,\nto which Pierre did not agree. On the other hand, Pierre demanded that\nsteps should be taken to liberate the serfs, which the steward met by\nshowing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank,\nand the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation.\n\nThe steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested selling\nthe forests in the province of Kostrom\xc3\xa1, the land lower down the river,\nand the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all of which\noperations according to him were connected with such complicated\nmeasures\xe2\x80\x94the removal of injunctions, petitions, permits, and so\non\xe2\x80\x94that Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him\nto attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried\nto pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The steward\nfor his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these\nconsultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to\nhimself.\n\nIn Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened to make\nhis acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, the\nlargest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s greatest\nweakness\xe2\x80\x94the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the\nLodge\xe2\x80\x94were so strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days,\nweeks, and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much\noccupied with evening parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him\nno time for reflection, as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life he had\nhoped to lead he still lived the old life, only in new surroundings.\n\nOf the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not\nfulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral\nlife, and that of the seven virtues he lacked two\xe2\x80\x94morality and the\nlove of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled\nanother of the precepts\xe2\x80\x94that of reforming the human race\xe2\x80\x94and had\nother virtues\xe2\x80\x94love of his neighbor, and especially generosity.\n\nIn the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way he\nintended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders\nhad been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had\nentrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.\n\nThe chief steward, who considered the young count\xe2\x80\x99s attempts almost\ninsane\xe2\x80\x94unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the serfs\xe2\x80\x94made\nsome concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs\nas impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large\nbuildings\xe2\x80\x94schools, hospitals, and asylums\xe2\x80\x94on all the estates\nbefore the master arrived. Everywhere preparations were made not for\nceremonious welcomes (which he knew Pierre would not like), but for just\nsuch gratefully religious ones, with offerings of icons and the bread\nand salt of hospitality, as, according to his understanding of his\nmaster, would touch and delude him.\n\nThe southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna\ncarriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on\nPierre. The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque\nthan the other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly\ngrateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere were receptions,\nwhich though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the\ndepth of his heart. In one place the peasants presented him with bread\nand salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, asking permission,\nas a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them,\nto build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor\nof Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In another place the women with\ninfants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard\nwork. On a third estate the priest, bearing a cross, came to meet\nhim surrounded by children whom, by the count\xe2\x80\x99s generosity, he was\ninstructing in reading, writing, and religion. On all his estates Pierre\nsaw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection,\nall on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon\nto be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewards\xe2\x80\x99 accounts, according to\nwhich the serfs\xe2\x80\x99 manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the\ntouching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue\ncoats.\n\nWhat Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him\nwith bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and\nPaul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s day,\nand that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had begun\nthe chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in that\nvillages were in a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know that\nsince the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land, they\ndid still harder work on their own land. He did not know that the priest\nwho met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and\nthat the pupils\xe2\x80\x99 parents wept at having to let him take their children\nand secured their release by heavy payments. He did not know that the\nbrick buildings, built to plan, were being built by serfs whose manorial\nlabor was thus increased, though lessened on paper. He did not know\nthat where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs\xe2\x80\x99\npayments had been diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial work\nhad been increased by a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit\nto his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which\nhe had left Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his\n\xe2\x80\x9cbrother-instructor\xe2\x80\x9d as he called the Grand Master.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cand how little attention we pay to it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at\nreceiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do\nfor these simple, kindly people.\n\nThe chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly\nthrough the na\xc3\xafve and intelligent count and played with him as with\na toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre,\npressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all\nthe uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.\n\nPierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be\ndifficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would\nhappen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though reluctantly,\non what he thought right. The steward promised to do all in his power to\ncarry out the count\xe2\x80\x99s wishes, seeing clearly that not only would the\ncount never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for\nthe sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank,\nbut would probably never even inquire and would never know that the\nnewly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued\nto give in money and work all that other people\xe2\x80\x99s serfs gave\xe2\x80\x94that is\nto say, all that could be got out of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nReturning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state\nof mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his\nfriend Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, whom he had not seen for two years.\n\nBoguch\xc3\xa1rovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among\nfields and forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut down. The\nhouse lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and\nwith banks still bare of grass. It was at the end of a village that\nstretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were\na few fir trees.\n\nThe homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables, a\nbathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular fa\xc3\xa7ade\nstill in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid\nout. The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a\nwater cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight,\nthe bridges were strong and had handrails. Everything bore an impress of\ntidiness and good management. Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply\nto inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a small newly\nbuilt lodge close to the pond. Ant\xc3\xb3n, a man who had looked after Prince\nAndrew in his boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the\nprince was at home, and showed him into a clean little anteroom.\n\nPierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after\nthe brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in\nPetersburg.\n\nHe quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered\nwooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone farther, but Ant\xc3\xb3n\nran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d came a sharp, unpleasant voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA visitor,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ant\xc3\xb3n.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk him to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed\nback.\n\nPierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to\nface with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre\nembraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek\nand looked at him closely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I did not expect you, I am very glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\nPierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise. He\nwas struck by the change in him. His words were kindly and there was a\nsmile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in\nspite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous\nand glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more\nmanly-looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used\nto it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged\nconcentration on some one thought.\n\nAs is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation,\nit was long before their conversation could settle on anything. They\nput questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to\nbe talked over at length. At last the conversation gradually settled on\nsome of the topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans\nfor the future, Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s journeys and occupations, the war, and so\non. The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile\nwith which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful\nanimation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would\nhave liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not.\nThe latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his\nenthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince\nAndrew\xe2\x80\x99s presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views,\nwhich had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour.\nHe checked himself, fearing to seem na\xc3\xafve, yet he felt an irresistible\ndesire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite\ndifferent, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly\nknow myself again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we have altered much, very much, since then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince\nAndrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and you? What are your plans?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlans!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Prince Andrew ironically. \xe2\x80\x9cMy plans?\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\nas if astonished at the word. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, I\xe2\x80\x99m building. I mean\nto settle here altogether next year....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s face,\nwhich had grown much older.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I meant to ask...\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels\nand all you have been doing on your estates.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far\nas possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been\nmade. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s story of what he\nhad been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened\nnot only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was\ntelling him.\n\nPierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend\xe2\x80\x99s company\nand at last became silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, who\nevidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\nonly bivouacking here and have just come to look round. I am going back\nto my sister today. I will introduce you to her. But of course you know\nher already,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, evidently trying to entertain a visitor with\nwhom he now found nothing in common. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will go after dinner. And\nwould you now like to look round my place?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the political\nnews and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other\nintimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of\nthe new homestead he was constructing and its buildings, but even here,\nwhile on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the future\narrangements of the house, he interrupted himself:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and then\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll set off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt dinner, conversation turned on Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was very much surprised when I heard of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\nPierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said\nhurriedly: \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you some time how it all happened. But you\nknow it is all over, and forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForever?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\xe2\x80\x99s forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know how it all ended, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? You heard of the duel?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you had to go through that too!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cTo kill a vicious dog is a very\ngood thing really.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, to kill a man is bad\xe2\x80\x94wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d urged Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not given to man\nto know what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will\nerr, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does harm to another is wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, feeling with\npleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was\nroused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to\nhis present state.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who has told you what is bad for another man?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad! Bad!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all know what is bad for\nourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is\nsomething I cannot inflict on others,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, growing\nmore and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook\nto Pierre. He spoke in French. \xe2\x80\x9cI only know two very real evils in\nlife: remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of those evils.\nTo live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd love of one\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor, and self-sacrifice?\xe2\x80\x9d began Pierre.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and\nnot to have to repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for\nmyself and ruined my life. And only now when I am living, or at least\ntrying\xe2\x80\x9d (Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s modesty made him correct himself) \xe2\x80\x9cto live for\nothers, only now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I\nshall not agree with you, and you do not really believe what you are\nsaying.\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see my sister, Princess Mary, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get on with her,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are right for yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after\na short pause, \xe2\x80\x9cbut everyone lives in his own way. You lived for\nyourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness\nwhen you began living for others. I experienced just the reverse. I\nlived for glory.\xe2\x80\x94And after all what is glory? The same love of others,\na desire to do something for them, a desire for their approval.\xe2\x80\x94So I\nlived for others, and not almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have\nbecome calmer since I began to live only for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you mean by living only for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre,\ngrowing excited. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about your son, your sister, and your\nfather?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s just the same as myself\xe2\x80\x94they are not others,\xe2\x80\x9d\nexplained Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cThe others, one\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors, le prochain,\nas you and Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and\nevil. Le prochain\xe2\x80\x94your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He\nevidently wished to draw him on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are joking,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre, growing more and more excited.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even\ndoing a little\xe2\x80\x94though I did very little and did it very badly? What\nevil can there be in it if unfortunate people, our serfs, people like\nourselves, were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth\nbeyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in\na comforting belief in future life, retribution, recompense, and\nconsolation? What evil and error are there in it, if people were dying\nof disease without help while material assistance could so easily be\nrendered, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum\nfor the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a\npeasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give\nthem rest and leisure?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nI have done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done\nsomething toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good\naction, and more than that, you can\xe2\x80\x99t make me believe that you do not\nthink so yourself. And the main thing is,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\nknow, and know for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is the\nonly sure happiness in life.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you put it like that it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a different matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cI build a house and lay out a garden, and you build\nhospitals. The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But what\xe2\x80\x99s\nright and what\xe2\x80\x99s good must be judged by one who knows all, but not by\nus. Well, you want an argument,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9ccome on then.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served\nas a veranda.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, let\xe2\x80\x99s argue then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk of\nschools,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, crooking a finger, \xe2\x80\x9ceducation and so forth;\nthat is, you want to raise him\xe2\x80\x9d (pointing to a peasant who passed by\nthem taking off his cap) \xe2\x80\x9cfrom his animal condition and awaken in him\nspiritual needs, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only\nhappiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him of.\nI envy him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him my\nmeans. Then you say, \xe2\x80\x98lighten his toil.\xe2\x80\x99 But as I see it, physical\nlabor is as essential to him, as much a condition of his existence, as\nmental activity is to you or me. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking. I go to bed\nafter two in the morning, thoughts come and I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep but toss\nabout till dawn, because I think and can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking, just as\nhe can\xe2\x80\x99t help plowing and mowing; if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, he would go to the\ndrink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical\nlabor but should die of it in a week, so he could not stand my physical\nidleness, but would grow fat and die. The third thing\xe2\x80\x94what else was\nit you talked about?\xe2\x80\x9d and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger. \xe2\x80\x9cAh,\nyes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you come and\nbleed him and patch him up. He will drag about as a cripple, a burden to\neverybody, for another ten years. It would be far easier and simpler for\nhim to die. Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is.\nIt would be different if you grudged losing a laborer\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s how I\nregard him\xe2\x80\x94but you want to cure him from love of him. And he does not\nwant that. And besides, what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone!\nKilled them, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, frowning angrily and turning away from\nPierre.\n\nPrince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was\nevident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he spoke\nreadily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time. His\nglance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is dreadful, dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand how one can live with such ideas. I had such moments\nmyself not long ago, in Moscow and when traveling, but at such times I\ncollapsed so that I don\xe2\x80\x99t live at all\xe2\x80\x94everything seems hateful to\nme... myself most of all. Then I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat, don\xe2\x80\x99t wash... and how is\nit with you?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not wash? That is not cleanly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew; \xe2\x80\x9con the\ncontrary one must try to make one\xe2\x80\x99s life as pleasant as possible.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m alive, that is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best I\ncan without hurting others.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with such ideas what motive have you for living? One would sit\nwithout moving, undertaking nothing....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do\nnothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the\nhonor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get\nout of it. They could not understand that I have not the necessary\nqualifications for it\xe2\x80\x94the kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness\nnecessary for the position. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s this house, which must be\nbuilt in order to have a nook of one\xe2\x80\x99s own in which to be quiet. And\nnow there\xe2\x80\x99s this recruiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy aren\xe2\x80\x99t you serving in the army?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter Austerlitz!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you\nvery much! I have promised myself not to serve again in the active\nRussian army. And I won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94not even if Bonaparte were here at\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk threatening Bald Hills\xe2\x80\x94even then I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t serve in the\nRussian army! Well, as I was saying,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, recovering his\ncomposure, \xe2\x80\x9cnow there\xe2\x80\x99s this recruiting. My father is chief in\ncommand of the Third District, and my only way of avoiding active\nservice is to serve under him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are serving?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe paused a little while.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why do you serve?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of\nhis time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too\nenergetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is\nterrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of\nthe recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had been two hours late\na fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster\xe2\x80\x99s clerk at Y\xc3\xbakhnovna\nhanged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I am serving because\nI alone have any influence with my father, and now and then can save him\nfrom actions which would torment him afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there you see!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it is not as you imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI\ndid not, and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk\nwho had stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been\nvery glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my father\xe2\x80\x94that again\nis for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered feverishly\nwhile he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no\ndesire to do good to his neighbor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, you wish to liberate your serfs,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\nis a very good thing, but not for you\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose you ever had\nanyone flogged or sent to Siberia\xe2\x80\x94and still less for your serfs. If\nthey are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose they are\nany the worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the\nstripes on their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it is\na good thing for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon\nthemselves, stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being\nable to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people I\npity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You\nmay not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those\ntraditions of unlimited power, in time when they grow more irritable,\nbecome cruel and harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain\nthemselves and grow more and more miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking\nthat these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s case.\n\nHe did not reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for\xe2\x80\x94human dignity, peace of mind,\npurity, and not the serfs\xe2\x80\x99 backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave\nas you may, always remain the same backs and foreheads.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPierre.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIn the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to\nBald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and\nthen with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.\n\nPointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in\nhis husbandry.\n\nPierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and\napparently immersed in his own thoughts.\n\nHe was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did not\nsee the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, enlighten, and\nraise him. But as soon as he thought of what he should say, he felt that\nPrince Andrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teaching,\nand he shrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule\nwhat to him was precious and sacred.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but why do you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre suddenly began, lowering his\nhead and looking like a bull about to charge, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you think so?\nYou should not think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink? What about?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prince Andrew with surprise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout life, about man\xe2\x80\x99s destiny. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be so. I myself thought\nlike that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don\xe2\x80\x99t\nsmile. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought\nit was: Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal,\naspects of humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince\nAndrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed\nfrom the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood,\nand love.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest\nis a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand, my dear fellow, that outside\nthis union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you\nthat nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out\nhis life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our\nfundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up\nto us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I\nhave felt myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of\nwhich is hidden in heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s words. More than once, when the noise of the wheels prevented\nhis catching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it, and by the\npeculiar glow that came into Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and by his silence,\nPierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would\nnot interrupt him or laugh at what he said.\n\nThey reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to\ncross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed on it,\nthey also stepped on the raft.\n\nPrince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at\nthe flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you think about it?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you\nsilent?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I think about it? I am listening to you. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very\nwell.... You say: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of\nlife, the destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who\nare we? Men. How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see what\nyou see? You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nsee it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe in a future life?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA future life?\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no\ntime to reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as he\nknew Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s former atheistic convictions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say you can\xe2\x80\x99t see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor\ncould I, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end\nof everything. On earth, here on this earth\xe2\x80\x9d (Pierre pointed to\nthe fields), \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the\nuniverse, in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we who\nare now the children of earth are\xe2\x80\x94eternally\xe2\x80\x94children of the\nwhole universe. Don\xe2\x80\x99t I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast\nharmonious whole? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I feel that I form one link, one step, between\nthe lower and higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of\nbeings in whom the Deity\xe2\x80\x94the Supreme Power if you prefer the term\xe2\x80\x94is\nmanifest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man,\nwhy should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and\nfarther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this\nworld, but that I shall always exist and always have existed. I feel\nthat beyond me and above me there are spirits, and that in this world\nthere is truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is Herder\xe2\x80\x99s theory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is\nnot that which can convince me, dear friend\xe2\x80\x94life and death are what\nconvince. What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound\nup with one\xe2\x80\x99s own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped to\nmake it right\xe2\x80\x9d (Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled and he turned away),\n\xe2\x80\x9cand suddenly that being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to\nexist.... Why? It cannot be that there is no answer. And I believe there\nis.... That\xe2\x80\x99s what convinces, that is what has convinced me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t that what I\xe2\x80\x99m\nsaying?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the\nnecessity of a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with\nsomeone and all at once that person vanishes there, into nowhere, and\nyou yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have looked\nin....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s it then! You know that there is a there and there is a\nSomeone? There is the future life. The Someone is\xe2\x80\x94God.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long since been\ntaken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun had sunk half\nbelow the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near\nthe ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of the footmen,\ncoachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on the raft and talked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and\nman\xe2\x80\x99s highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must\nlive, we must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on\nthis scrap of earth, but have lived and shall live forever, there, in\nthe Whole,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.\n\nPrince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to\nPierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the\nsun gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness. Pierre\nbecame silent. The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the\ncurrent beat softly against it below. Prince Andrew felt as if the sound\nof the waves kept up a refrain to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s words, whispering:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true, believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike, tender look at\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his superior\nfriend.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if it only were so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, it is\ntime to get on,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up\nat the sky to which Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since\nAusterlitz saw that high, everlasting sky he had seen while lying on\nthat battlefield; and something that had long been slumbering, something\nthat was best within him, suddenly awoke, joyful and youthful, in his\nsoul. It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions\nof his life, but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to\ndevelop existed within him. His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s life. Though outwardly he continued to live in the\nsame old way, inwardly he began a new life.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIt was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front\nentrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached the house,\nPrince Andrew with a smile drew Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s attention to a commotion\ngoing on at the back porch. A woman, bent with age, with a wallet on her\nback, and a short, long-haired, young man in a black garment had rushed\nback to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up. Two women ran out\nafter them, and all four, looking round at the carriage, ran in dismay\nup the steps of the back porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are Mary\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98God\xe2\x80\x99s folk,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\nhave mistaken us for my father. This is the one matter in which she\ndisobeys him. He orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she\nreceives them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are \xe2\x80\x98God\xe2\x80\x99s folk\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet them,\nand he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back\nsoon.\n\nThe old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute.\n\nPrince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept\nin perfect order and readiness for him in his father\xe2\x80\x99s house; he\nhimself went to the nursery.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and see my sister,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Pierre when he returned.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her\n\xe2\x80\x98God\xe2\x80\x99s folk.\xe2\x80\x99 It will serve her right, she will be confused, but\nyou will see her \xe2\x80\x98God\xe2\x80\x99s folk.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s really very curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are \xe2\x80\x98God\xe2\x80\x99s folk\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face\nwhen they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon\nstand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monk\xe2\x80\x99s\ncassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near them, in an\narmchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek expression on\nher childlike face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you warn me?\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess, with mild\nreproach, as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her\nchickens.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharm\xc3\xa9e de vous voir. Je suis tr\xc3\xa8s contente de vous voir,\xe2\x80\x9d * she\nsaid to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child, and\nnow his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above\nall his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him. She\nlooked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI\nlike you very much, but please don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at my people.\xe2\x80\x9d After\nexchanging the first greetings, they sat down.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cDelighted to see you. I am very glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, and Iv\xc3\xa1nushka is here too!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, glancing with\na smile at the young pilgrim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew!\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary, imploringly. \xe2\x80\x9cIl faut que vous\nsachiez que c\xe2\x80\x99est une femme,\xe2\x80\x9d * said Prince Andrew to Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew, au nom de Dieu!\xe2\x80\x9d *(2) Princess Mary repeated.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cYou must know that this is a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * (2) \xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nIt was evident that Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s ironical tone toward the pilgrims\nand Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s helpless attempts to protect them were their\ncustomary long-established relations on the matter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais, ma bonne amie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cvous devriez au\ncontraire m\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre reconnaissante de ce que j\xe2\x80\x99explique \xc3\xa0 Pierre\nvotre intimit\xc3\xa9 avec ce jeune homme.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful to\n     me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young\n     man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and\nseriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him) into\nIv\xc3\xa1nushka\xe2\x80\x99s face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, looked\nround at them all with crafty eyes.\n\nPrincess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassment on her people\xe2\x80\x99s account was quite\nunnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman, lowering\nher eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had turned her cup\nupside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and sat\nquietly in her armchair, though hoping to be offered another cup of tea.\nIv\xc3\xa1nushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked with sly womanish eyes\nfrom under her brows at the young men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been? To Kiev?\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew asked the old woman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, good sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered garrulously. \xe2\x80\x9cJust at\nChristmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly\nsacrament at the shrine of the saint. And now I\xe2\x80\x99m from Koly\xc3\xa1zin,\nmaster, where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was Iv\xc3\xa1nushka with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI go by myself, benefactor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Iv\xc3\xa1nushka, trying to speak in a\nbass voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI only came across Pelag\xc3\xa9ya in Y\xc3\xbakhnovo....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPelag\xc3\xa9ya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell what\nshe had seen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Koly\xc3\xa1zin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Some new relics?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew, do leave off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell him,\nPelag\xc3\xa9ya.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo... why not, my dear, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I? I like him. He is kind,\nhe is one of God\xe2\x80\x99s chosen, he\xe2\x80\x99s a benefactor, he once gave me ten\nrubles, I remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me (he\xe2\x80\x99s\none of God\xe2\x80\x99s own and goes barefoot summer and winter), he says,\n\xe2\x80\x98Why are you not going to the right place? Go to Koly\xc3\xa1zin where a\nwonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.\xe2\x80\x99 On\nhearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones,\ndrawing in her breath.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I come, master, and the people say to me: \xe2\x80\x98A great blessing has\nbeen revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother,\nthe Holy Virgin Mother of God.\xe2\x80\x99...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right, you can tell us afterwards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess\nMary, flushing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me ask her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you see it yourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d he\ninquired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the face\nlike the light of heaven, and from the blessed Mother\xe2\x80\x99s cheek it drops\nand drops....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, dear me, that must be a fraud!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, na\xc3\xafvely, who had\nlistened attentively to the pilgrim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, master, what are you saying?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the horrified\nPelag\xc3\xa9ya, turning to Princess Mary for support.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey impose on the people,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Jesus Christ!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak so, master! There was a general who did not\nbelieve, and said, \xe2\x80\x98The monks cheat,\xe2\x80\x99 and as soon as he\xe2\x80\x99d said it\nhe went blind. And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev\ncatacombs came to him and said, \xe2\x80\x98Believe in me and I will make you\nwhole.\xe2\x80\x99 So he begged: \xe2\x80\x98Take me to her, take me to her.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s the\nreal truth I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, I saw it myself. So he was brought, quite\nblind, straight to her, and he goes up to her and falls down and says,\n\xe2\x80\x98Make me whole,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give thee what the Tsar\nbestowed on me.\xe2\x80\x99 I saw it myself, master, the star is fixed into the\nicon. Well, and what do you think? He received his sight! It\xe2\x80\x99s a sin\nto speak so. God will punish you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said admonishingly, turning to\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did the star get into the icon?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Andrew, with a smile.\n\nPelag\xc3\xa9ya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!\xe2\x80\x9d she began,\nher pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. \xe2\x80\x9cMaster, what have you\nsaid? God forgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d And she crossed herself. \xe2\x80\x9cLord forgive him!\nMy dear, what does it mean?...\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, turning to Princess\nMary. She got up and, almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She\nevidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a\nhouse where such things could be said, and was at the same time sorry to\nhave now to forgo the charity of this house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, why need you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you come\nto me?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Pelag\xc3\xa9ya, I was joking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincesse, ma\nparole, je n\xe2\x80\x99ai pas voulu l\xe2\x80\x99offenser. * I did not mean anything,\nI was only joking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his\noffense. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all my fault, and Andrew was only joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nPelag\xc3\xa9ya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s face there was such a\nlook of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at\nher and now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nThe pilgrim woman was appeased and, being encouraged to talk, gave a\nlong account of Father Amphilochus, who led so holy a life that his\nhands smelled of incense, and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks\nshe knew let her have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, taking\nsome dried bread with her, had spent two days in the catacombs with\nthe saints. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to\nanother. I\xe2\x80\x99d sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics, and\nthere was such peace all around, such blessedness, that one don\xe2\x80\x99t want\nto come out, even into the light of heaven again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went out\nof the room, and then, leaving \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s folk\xe2\x80\x9d to finish their tea,\nPrincess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings. I understand them so\nwell and have the greatest respect for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a\nbrother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you find Andrew?\xe2\x80\x9d she added hurriedly,\nnot giving him time to reply to her affectionate words. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very\nanxious about him. His health was better in the winter, but last spring\nhis wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a\ncure. And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually. He has not a\ncharacter like us women who, when we suffer, can weep away our sorrows.\nHe keeps it all within him. Today he is cheerful and in good spirits,\nbut that is the effect of your visit\xe2\x80\x94he is not often like that. If\nyou could persuade him to go abroad. He needs activity, and this quiet\nregular life is very bad for him. Others don\xe2\x80\x99t notice it, but I see\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nToward ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the men servants rushed to the front door, hearing\nthe bells of the old prince\xe2\x80\x99s carriage approaching. Prince Andrew and\nPierre also went out into the porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out\nof the carriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Very glad! Kiss me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, having learned who the young\nstranger was.\n\nThe old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.\n\nBefore supper, Prince Andrew, coming back to his father\xe2\x80\x99s study, found\nhim disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining that a time\nwould come when there would be no more wars. The old prince disputed it\nchaffingly, but without getting angry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrain the blood from men\xe2\x80\x99s veins and put in water instead, then\nthere will be no more war! Old women\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense\xe2\x80\x94old women\xe2\x80\x99s\nnonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately\non the shoulder, and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew,\nevidently not wishing to join in the conversation, was looking over the\npapers his father had brought from town. The old prince went up to him\nand began to talk business.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe marshal, a Count Rost\xc3\xb3v, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sent half his contingent. He\ncame to town and wanted to invite me to dinner\xe2\x80\x94I gave him a pretty\ndinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d the old prince\nwent on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nfine fellow\xe2\x80\x94your friend\xe2\x80\x94I like him! He stirs me up. Another says\nclever things and one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care to listen, but this one talks\nrubbish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll\ncome and sit with you at supper. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have another dispute. Make\nfriends with my little fool, Princess Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted after Pierre,\nthrough the door.\n\nOnly now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the\nstrength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm was\nnot expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family\nand with the household. With the stern old prince and the gentle, timid\nPrincess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre at once felt\nlike an old friend. They were all fond of him already. Not only Princess\nMary, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her\nmost radiant looks, but even the one-year-old \xe2\x80\x9cPrince Nicholas\xe2\x80\x9d (as\nhis grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken\nin his arms, and Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at\nhim with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.\n\nThe old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\naccount. And during the two days of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s visit he was\nextremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.\n\nWhen Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they\nbegan to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new\nacquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anything but\nwhat was good of him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nWhen returning from his leave, Rost\xc3\xb3v felt, for the first time, how\nclose was the bond that united him to Den\xc3\xadsov and the whole regiment.\n\nOn approaching it, Rost\xc3\xb3v felt as he had done when approaching his home\nin Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform\nof his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Dem\xc3\xa9ntyev and saw the\npicket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavr\xc3\xbashka gleefully shouted to\nhis master, \xe2\x80\x9cThe count has come!\xe2\x80\x9d and Den\xc3\xadsov, who had been asleep\non his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him,\nand the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, Rost\xc3\xb3v\nexperienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his\nsister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could\nnot speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and\nprecious as his parents\xe2\x80\x99 house.\n\nWhen he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had\nbeen reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone\nout foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests\nof the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one\nnarrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of\nmoral support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own\nplace, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here was none of\nall that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not know his right\nplace and took mistaken decisions; here was no S\xc3\xb3nya with whom he\nought, or ought not, to have an explanation; here was no possibility of\ngoing there or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours\nin the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was not\nthat innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or\nfarther from him than another; there were none of those uncertain and\nundefined money relations with his father, and nothing to recall that\nterrible loss to D\xc3\xb3lokhov. Here, in the regiment, all was clear and\nsimple. The whole world was divided into two unequal parts: one, our\nP\xc3\xa1vlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. And the rest was no\nconcern of his. In the regiment, everything was definite: who was\nlieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and most\nof all, who was a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, one\xe2\x80\x99s\npay came every four months, there was nothing to think out or decide,\nyou had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the P\xc3\xa1vlograd\nregiment and, when given an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly,\nand definitely ordered\xe2\x80\x94and all would be well.\n\nHaving once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental\nlife, Rost\xc3\xb3v felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to\nrest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter\nfor him, because, after his loss to D\xc3\xb3lokhov (for which, in spite\nof all his family\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to console him, he could not forgive\nhimself), he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving,\nnot as he had done before, but really well, and by being a perfectly\nfirst-rate comrade and officer\xe2\x80\x94in a word, a splendid man altogether, a\nthing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the\nregiment.\n\nAfter his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents\nin five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved\nto take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his\nparents.\n\nOur army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at Pult\xc3\xbask\nand Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s arrival and the beginning of a new campaign.\n\nThe P\xc3\xa1vlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had\nserved in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in\nRussia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the\ncampaign. It had been neither at Pult\xc3\xbask nor at Preussisch-Eylau and,\nwhen it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign,\nwas attached to Pl\xc3\xa1tov\xe2\x80\x99s division.\n\nPl\xc3\xa1tov\xe2\x80\x99s division was acting independently of the main army. Several\ntimes parts of the P\xc3\xa1vlograd regiment had exchanged shots with\nthe enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal\nOudinot\xe2\x80\x99s carriages. In April the P\xc3\xa1vlograds were stationed immovably\nfor some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village.\n\nA thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke,\nand the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the\nmen nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could\narrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages,\nsearching for potatoes, but found few even of these.\n\nEverything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled\xe2\x80\x94if any\nremained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken\nfrom them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead of taking\nanything from them, often gave them the last of their rations.\n\nThe P\xc3\xa1vlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but had\nlost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the hospitals,\ndeath was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling\nthat came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able\nto drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals.\nWhen spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the\nground that looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s sweet root.\xe2\x80\x9d It was very bitter, but they wandered\nabout the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it,\nthough they were ordered not to do so, as it was a noxious plant. That\nspring a new disease broke out among the soldiers, a swelling of the\narms, legs, and face, which the doctors attributed to eating this root.\nBut in spite of all this, the soldiers of Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s squadron fed\nchiefly on \xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1shka\xe2\x80\x99s sweet root,\xe2\x80\x9d because it was the second week\nthat the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a\npound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.\n\nThe horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched\nroofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with tufts of\nfelty winter hair.\n\nDespite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living just\nas usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms, the\nhussars formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed their\nhorses, polished their arms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs in\nplace of fodder, and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which\nthey rose up hungry, joking about their nasty food and their hunger. As\nusual, in their spare time, they lit bonfires, steamed themselves before\nthem naked; smoked, picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes, told\nand listened to stories of Pot\xc3\xabmkin\xe2\x80\x99s and Suv\xc3\xb3rov\xe2\x80\x99s campaigns, or\nto legends of Al\xc3\xabsha the Sly, or the priest\xe2\x80\x99s laborer Mik\xc3\xb3lka.\n\nThe officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless,\nhalf-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and,\nin general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as\nbefore, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though there was\nno food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles.\nThe general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because\nnothing certain was known about it, partly because there was a vague\nfeeling that in the main it was going badly.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v lived, as before, with Den\xc3\xadsov, and since their furlough they\nhad become more friendly than ever. Den\xc3\xadsov never spoke of Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s\nfamily, but by the tender friendship his commander showed him, Rost\xc3\xb3v\nfelt that the elder hussar\xe2\x80\x99s luckless love for Nat\xc3\xa1sha played a part\nin strengthening their friendship. Den\xc3\xadsov evidently tried to expose\nRost\xc3\xb3v to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his\nsafe return with evident joy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in\na deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of\nprovisions, Rost\xc3\xb3v found a family consisting of an old Pole and his\ndaughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad, hungry, too weak\nto get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance. Rost\xc3\xb3v\nbrought them to his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and\nkept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering. One of his\ncomrades, talking of women, began chaffing Rost\xc3\xb3v, saying that he was\nmore wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he\nintroduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved. Rost\xc3\xb3v took\nthe joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant things to the\nofficer that it was all Den\xc3\xadsov could do to prevent a duel. When\nthe officer had gone away, Den\xc3\xadsov, who did not himself know what\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s relations with the Polish girl might be, began to upbraid\nhim for his quickness of temper, and Rost\xc3\xb3v replied:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell\nyou how it offended me... because... well, for that reason....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room\nwithout looking at Rost\xc3\xb3v, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what a mad bweed you Wost\xc3\xb3vs are!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, and Rost\xc3\xb3v\nnoticed tears in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nIn April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s arrival,\nbut Rost\xc3\xb3v had no chance of being present at the review he held at\nBartenstein, as the P\xc3\xa1vlograds were at the outposts far beyond that\nplace.\n\nThey were bivouacking. Den\xc3\xadsov and Rost\xc3\xb3v were living in an earth hut,\ndug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf. The\nhut was made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue. A\ntrench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight inches deep,\nand eight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were cut out and\nthese formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room,\nin which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board,\nlying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On\neach side of the trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two\nand a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads and couches. The roof\nwas so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench\nand could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table.\nDen\xc3\xadsov, who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his\nsquadron liked him, had also a board in the roof at the farther end,\nwith a piece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a window. When it\nwas very cold, embers from the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 campfire were placed on\na bent sheet of iron on the steps in the \xe2\x80\x9creception room\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as\nDen\xc3\xadsov called that part of the hut\xe2\x80\x94and it was then so warm that the\nofficers, of whom there were always some with Den\xc3\xadsov and Rost\xc3\xb3v, sat\nin their shirt sleeves.\n\nIn April, Rost\xc3\xb3v was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and\neight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed\nhis rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm,\nthen tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner, and,\nhis face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his\nshirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under his head. He was\npleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days\nfor his last reconnoitering expedition, and was awaiting Den\xc3\xadsov, who\nhad gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk.\n\nSuddenly he heard Den\xc3\xadsov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut,\nevidently much excited. Rost\xc3\xb3v moved to the window to see whom he was\nspeaking to, and saw the quartermaster, Topch\xc3\xa9enko.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ordered you not to let them eat that M\xc3\xa1shka woot stuff!\xe2\x80\x9d\nDen\xc3\xadsov was shouting. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I saw with my own eyes how Lazarch\xc3\xbak\nbwought some fwom the fields.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have given the order again and again, your honor, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t\nobey,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the quartermaster.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: \xe2\x80\x9cLet\nhim fuss and bustle now, my job\xe2\x80\x99s done and I\xe2\x80\x99m lying\ndown\xe2\x80\x94capitally!\xe2\x80\x9d He could hear that Lavr\xc3\xbashka\xe2\x80\x94that sly, bold\norderly of Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94was talking, as well as the quartermaster.\nLavr\xc3\xbashka was saying something about loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen\nhe had seen when he had gone out for provisions.\n\nThen Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard shouting farther and farther away.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaddle! Second platoon!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they off to now?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nFive minutes later, Den\xc3\xadsov came into the hut, climbed with muddy boots\non the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things about, took\nhis leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. In answer to\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly\nthat he had some business.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov\ngoing out, and Rost\xc3\xb3v heard the hoofs of several horses splashing\nthrough the mud. He did not even trouble to find out where Den\xc3\xadsov had\ngone. Having got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not leave\nthe hut till toward evening. Den\xc3\xadsov had not yet returned. The weather\nhad cleared up, and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were\nplaying sv\xc3\xa1yka, laughing as they threw their missiles which buried\nthemselves in the soft mud. Rost\xc3\xb3v joined them. In the middle of the\ngame, the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on\ntheir skinny horses behind them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew\nup to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Den\xc3\xadsov has been worrying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cand here\nare the provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they are!\xe2\x80\x9d said the officers. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t the soldiers be\nglad!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA little behind the hussars came Den\xc3\xadsov, accompanied by two infantry\nofficers with whom he was talking.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v went to meet them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warn you, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the officers, a short thin man,\nevidently very angry, was saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I told you I won\xe2\x80\x99t give them up?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will answer for it, Captain. It is mutiny\xe2\x80\x94seizing the transport\nof one\xe2\x80\x99s own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two days.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mine have had nothing for two weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is robbery! You\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the infantry\nofficer, raising his voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what are you pestewing me for?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Den\xc3\xadsov, suddenly\nlosing his temper. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall answer for it and not you, and you\xe2\x80\x99d\nbetter not buzz about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted\nat the officers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the little officer, undaunted and not\nriding away. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are determined to rob, I\xe2\x80\x99ll...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the devil! quick ma\xe2\x80\x99ch, while you\xe2\x80\x99re safe and sound!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nDen\xc3\xadsov turned his horse on the officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, very well!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the officer, threateningly, and\nturning his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nDen\xc3\xadsov after him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can\naddress to a mounted infantryman) and riding up to Rost\xc3\xb3v, he burst out\nlaughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve taken twansports from the infantwy by force!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, can\xe2\x80\x99t let our men starve.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an\ninfantry regiment, but learning from Lavr\xc3\xbashka that the transport\nwas unescorted, Den\xc3\xadsov with his hussars had seized it by force. The\nsoldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared\nthem with the other squadrons.\n\nThe next day the regimental commander sent for Den\xc3\xadsov, and holding his\nfingers spread out before his eyes said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff\nand settle the business there in the commissariat department and if\npossible sign a receipt for such and such stores received. If not, as\nthe demand was booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a row\nand the affair may end badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFrom the regimental commander\xe2\x80\x99s, Den\xc3\xadsov rode straight to the staff\nwith a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he came\nback to his dugout in a state such as Rost\xc3\xb3v had never yet seen him in.\nDen\xc3\xadsov could not speak and gasped for breath. When Rost\xc3\xb3v asked what\nwas the matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a\nhoarse, feeble voice.\n\nAlarmed at Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s condition, Rost\xc3\xb3v suggested that he should\nundress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll always thwash scoundwels... and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the Empewo\xe2\x80\x99...\nIce...\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\n\nThe regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely necessary\nto bleed Den\xc3\xadsov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy\narm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI get there,\xe2\x80\x9d began Den\xc3\xadsov. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Now then, where\xe2\x80\x99s your\nchief\xe2\x80\x99s quarters?\xe2\x80\x99 They were pointed out. \xe2\x80\x98Please to wait.\xe2\x80\x99\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time\nto wait. Announce me.\xe2\x80\x99 Vewy well, so out comes their head\nchief\xe2\x80\x94also took it into his head to lecture me: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s\nwobbewy!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Wobbewy,\xe2\x80\x99 I say, \xe2\x80\x98is not done by man who seizes\npwovisions to feed his soldiers, but by him who takes them to fill his\nown pockets!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Will you please be silent?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Vewy good!\xe2\x80\x99 Then\nhe says: \xe2\x80\x98Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner, but your affair\nwill be passed on to headquarters.\xe2\x80\x99 I go to the commissioner. I enter,\nand at the table... who do you think? No, but wait a bit!... Who is it\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s starving us?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Den\xc3\xadsov, hitting the table with the\nfist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down\nand the tumblers on it jumped about. \xe2\x80\x9cTely\xc3\xa1nin! \xe2\x80\x98What? So it\xe2\x80\x99s\nyou who\xe2\x80\x99s starving us to death! Is it? Take this and this!\xe2\x80\x99 and I\nhit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... \xe2\x80\x98Ah, what a... what a...!\xe2\x80\x99\nand I sta\xe2\x80\x99ted fwashing him... Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a bit of fun I can tell\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Den\xc3\xadsov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing\nunder his black mustache. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have killed him if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\ntaken him away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are you shouting for? Calm yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve set your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke calm and\ncheerful.\n\nBut at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s and\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed\nthem a paper addressed to Major Den\xc3\xadsov from the regimental commander\nin which inquiries were made about yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s occurrence. The\nadjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad\nturn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the\nseverity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded,\ndegradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.\n\nThe case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after\nseizing the transports, Major Den\xc3\xadsov, being drunk, went to the chief\nquartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief, threatened\nto strike him, and on being led out had rushed into the office and given\ntwo officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm of one of them.\n\nIn answer to Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s renewed questions, Den\xc3\xadsov said, laughing,\nthat he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up\nin it, but that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the\nleast fear any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack\nhim he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but Rost\xc3\xb3v knew him\ntoo well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart\nhe feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was\nevidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices\nfrom the court arrived, and on the first of May, Den\xc3\xadsov was ordered\nto hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before\nthe staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat\noffice. On the previous day Pl\xc3\xa1tov reconnoitered with two Cossack\nregiments and two squadrons of hussars. Den\xc3\xadsov, as was his wont, rode\nout in front of the outposts, parading his courage. A bullet fired by\na French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at\nanother time Den\xc3\xadsov would not have left the regiment for so slight a\nwound, but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing\nat the staff and went into hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nIn June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the P\xc3\xa1vlograds did\nnot take part, and after that an armistice was proclaimed. Rost\xc3\xb3v, who\nfelt his friend\xe2\x80\x99s absence very much, having no news of him since he\nleft and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his\naffairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Den\xc3\xadsov\nin hospital.\n\nThe hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated\nby Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when it is so\nbeautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a particularly\ndismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets,\ntattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about.\n\nThe hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and\npanes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence\nthat had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged soldiers, with pale\nswollen faces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the\nyard.\n\nDirectly Rost\xc3\xb3v entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of\nputrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army\ndoctor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tear myself to pieces,\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to\nMak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich in the evening. I shall be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe assistant asked some further questions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do the best you can! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it all the same?\xe2\x80\x9d The doctor\nnoticed Rost\xc3\xb3v coming upstairs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\nThe bullets having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a\npesthouse, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTyphus, sir. It\xe2\x80\x99s death to go in. Only we two, Mak\xc3\xa9ev and I\xe2\x80\x9d (he\npointed to the assistant), \xe2\x80\x9ckeep on here. Some five of us doctors have\ndied in this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the doctor with evident satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cPrussian doctors have been\ninvited here, but our allies don\xe2\x80\x99t like it at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v explained that he wanted to see Major Den\xc3\xadsov of the hussars,\nwho was wounded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, sir. Only think! I am alone in\ncharge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! It\xe2\x80\x99s\nwell that the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee\nand some lint each month or we should be lost!\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cFour\nhundred, sir, and they\xe2\x80\x99re always sending me fresh ones. There are four\nhundred? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, turning to the assistant.\n\nThe assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and impatient\nfor the talkative doctor to go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor Den\xc3\xadsov,\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v said again. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was wounded at\nMolliten.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead, I fancy. Eh, Mak\xc3\xa9ev?\xe2\x80\x9d queried the doctor, in a tone of\nindifference.\n\nThe assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he tall and with reddish hair?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the doctor.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v described Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was one like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, as if pleased. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\none is dead, I fancy. However, I\xe2\x80\x99ll look up our list. We had a list.\nHave you got it, Mak\xc3\xa9ev?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich has the list,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the assistant. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll step into the officers\xe2\x80\x99 wards you\xe2\x80\x99ll see for yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added, turning to Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99d better not go, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cor you may\nhave to stay here yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Rost\xc3\xb3v bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant\nto show him the way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me!\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor shouted up after him.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The smell was so\nstrong there that Rost\xc3\xb3v held his nose and had to pause and collect\nhis strength before he could go on. A door opened to the right, and an\nemaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in underclothing, limped\nout and, leaning against the doorpost, looked with glittering envious\neyes at those who were passing. Glancing in at the door, Rost\xc3\xb3v\nsaw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and\novercoats.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I go in and look?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there to see?\xe2\x80\x9d said the assistant.\n\nBut, just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in,\nRost\xc3\xb3v entered the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 ward. The foul air, to which he had\nalready begun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It\nwas a little different, more pungent, and one felt that this was where\nit originated.\n\nIn the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows,\nthe sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, and\nleaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were unconscious and\npaid no attention to the newcomers. Those who were conscious raised\nthemselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all looked intently at\nRost\xc3\xb3v with the same expression of hope, of relief, reproach, and\nenvy of another\xe2\x80\x99s health. Rost\xc3\xb3v went to the middle of the room and\nlooking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same\nthing there. He stood still, looking silently around. He had not at all\nexpected such a sight. Just before him, almost across the middle of the\npassage on the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge\nby the cut of his hair. The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs\noutstretched. His face was purple, his eyes were rolled back so that\nonly the whites were seen, and on his bare legs and arms which were\nstill red, the veins stood out like cords. He was knocking the back of\nhis head against the floor, hoarsely uttering some word which he kept\nrepeating. Rost\xc3\xb3v listened and made out the word. It was \xe2\x80\x9cdrink,\ndrink, a drink!\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v glanced round, looking for someone who would\nput this man back in his place and bring him water.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho looks after the sick here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the assistant.\n\nJust then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from the\nnext room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, your honor!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, rolling his eyes at Rost\xc3\xb3v and\nevidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet him to his place and give him some water,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v,\npointing to the Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your honor,\xe2\x80\x9d the soldier replied complacently, and rolling\nhis eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not\nmove.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to do anything here,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nlowering his eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense\nlook fixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close to the corner, on\nan overcoat, sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a\nskeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rost\xc3\xb3v.\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor on one side whispered something to him, pointing\nat Rost\xc3\xb3v, who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him. He drew\nnearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him, the\nother had been amputated above the knee. His neighbor on the other side,\nwho lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back, was\na young soldier with a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled\nand his eyes were rolled back. Rost\xc3\xb3v looked at the young soldier and a\ncold chill ran down his back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this one seems...\xe2\x80\x9d he began, turning to the assistant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how we\xe2\x80\x99ve been begging, your honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old soldier,\nhis jaw quivering. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been dead since morning. After all we\xe2\x80\x99re\nmen, not dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll send someone at once. He shall be taken away\xe2\x80\x94taken away at\nonce,\xe2\x80\x9d said the assistant hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go, your honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, let us go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v hastily, and lowering his\neyes and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of\nreproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the\nroom.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nGoing along the corridor, the assistant led Rost\xc3\xb3v to the officers\xe2\x80\x99\nwards, consisting of three rooms, the doors of which stood open. There\nwere beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or\nsitting on them. Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing\ngowns. The first person Rost\xc3\xb3v met in the officers\xe2\x80\x99 ward was a thin\nlittle man with one arm, who was walking about the first room in a\nnightcap and hospital dressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth.\nRost\xc3\xb3v looked at him, trying to remember where he had seen him before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee where we\xe2\x80\x99ve met again!\xe2\x80\x9d said the little man. \xe2\x80\x9cT\xc3\xbashin,\nT\xc3\xbashin, don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember, who gave you a lift at Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern?\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a bit cut off, you see...\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with a smile,\npointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown. \xe2\x80\x9cLooking for\nVas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich Den\xc3\xadsov? My neighbor,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, when he heard\nwho Rost\xc3\xb3v wanted. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, here,\xe2\x80\x9d and T\xc3\xbashin led him into the next\nroom, from whence came sounds of several laughing voices.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can they laugh, or even live at all here?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nstill aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong\nin the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those\nenvious looks which had followed him out from both sides, and the face\nof that young soldier with eyes rolled back.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket, though\nit was nearly noon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Wost\xc3\xb3v? How are you, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he called out, still in the\nsame voice as in the regiment, but Rost\xc3\xb3v noticed sadly that under this\nhabitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed\nitself in the expression of Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s face and the intonations of his\nvoice.\n\nHis wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six weeks\nafter he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces\nof the other hospital patients, but it was not this that struck Rost\xc3\xb3v.\nWhat struck him was that Den\xc3\xadsov did not seem glad to see him, and\nsmiled at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the regiment, nor about\nthe general state of affairs, and when Rost\xc3\xb3v spoke of these matters\ndid not listen.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v even noticed that Den\xc3\xadsov did not like to be reminded of the\nregiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on\noutside the hospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and\nwas only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers. On\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from\nunder his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the\nrough draft of his answer to it. He became animated when he began\nreading his paper and specially drew Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the\nstinging rejoinders he made to his enemies. His hospital companions,\nwho had gathered round Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x94a fresh arrival from the world\noutside\xe2\x80\x94gradually began to disperse as soon as Den\xc3\xadsov began reading\nhis answer. Rost\xc3\xb3v noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had\nalready heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the\nman who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed,\ngloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed T\xc3\xbashin still\nlistened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading,\nthe Uhlan interrupted Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what I say is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to Rost\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be\nbest simply to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards\nwill now be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe petition the Empewo\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Den\xc3\xadsov, in a voice to which\nhe tried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like\nan expression of irritable impotence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for? If I were a wobber I\nwould ask mercy, but I\xe2\x80\x99m being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers\nto book. Let them twy me, I\xe2\x80\x99m not afwaid of anyone. I\xe2\x80\x99ve served\nthe Tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen! And am I to be\ndegwaded?... Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m w\xe2\x80\x99iting to them stwaight. This is what I\nsay: \xe2\x80\x98If I had wobbed the Tweasuwy...\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s certainly well written,\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xbashin, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s not\nthe point, Vas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich,\xe2\x80\x9d and he also turned to Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\nhas to submit, and Vas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. You know the\nauditor told you it was a bad business.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let it be bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe auditor wrote out a petition for you,\xe2\x80\x9d continued T\xc3\xbashin,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt\nhe\xe2\x80\x9d (indicating Rost\xc3\xb3v) \xe2\x80\x9chas connections on the staff. You won\xe2\x80\x99t\nfind a better opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I said I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to gwovel?\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov interrupted\nhim, went on reading his paper.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v had not the courage to persuade Den\xc3\xadsov, though he\ninstinctively felt that the way advised by T\xc3\xbashin and the other\nofficers was the safest, and though he would have been glad to be of\nservice to Den\xc3\xadsov. He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty\ntemper.\n\nWhen the reading of Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s virulent reply, which took more than an\nhour, was over, Rost\xc3\xb3v said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day\nin a most dejected state of mind amid Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s hospital comrades,\nwho had gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to\ntheir stories. Den\xc3\xadsov was moodily silent all the evening.\n\nLate in the evening, when Rost\xc3\xb3v was about to leave, he asked Den\xc3\xadsov\nwhether he had no commission for him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, wait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov, glancing round at the officers,\nand taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where\nhe had an inkpot, and sat down to write.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems it\xe2\x80\x99s no use knocking one\xe2\x80\x99s head against a wall!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, coming from the window and giving Rost\xc3\xb3v a large envelope. In\nit was the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in\nwhich Den\xc3\xadsov, without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat\nofficials, simply asked for pardon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHand it in. It seems...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nHaving returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, Rost\xc3\xb3v rode to Tilsit with the letter to the\nEmperor.\n\nOn the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in\nTilsit. Bor\xc3\xads Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y had asked the important personage on whom he\nwas in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at\nTilsit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see the great man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, alluding to Napoleon,\nwhom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are speaking of Buonaparte?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the general, smiling.\n\nBor\xc3\xads looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was\nbeing tested.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. The\ngeneral patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will go far,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.\n\nBor\xc3\xads was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two\nEmperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon\npass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw the\npensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern\non the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, saw both\nEmperors get into boats, and saw how Napoleon\xe2\x80\x94reaching the raft\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94stepped quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand\nto him, and how they both retired into the pavilion. Since he had begun\nto move in the highest circles Bor\xc3\xads had made it his habit to watch\nattentively all that went on around him and to note it down. At the time\nof the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with\nNapoleon and about the uniforms they wore, and listened attentively to\nwords spoken by important personages. At the moment the Emperors went\ninto the pavilion he looked at his watch, and did not forget to look at\nit again when Alexander came out. The interview had lasted an hour and\nfifty-three minutes. He noted this down that same evening, among other\nfacts he felt to be of historic importance. As the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s suite\nwas a very small one, it was a matter of great importance, for a man who\nvalued his success in the service, to be at Tilsit on the occasion of\nthis interview between the two Emperors, and having succeeded in this,\nBor\xc3\xads felt that henceforth his position was fully assured. He had not\nonly become known, but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted\nhim. Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself, so\nthat the latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from\ncold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer,\nwould now have been surprised had he been absent.\n\nBor\xc3\xads lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhil\xc3\xadnski.\nZhil\xc3\xadnski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately\nfond of the French, and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French\nofficers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and\nlunching with him and Bor\xc3\xads.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhil\xc3\xadnski arranged a\nsupper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s, there were also several French officers of the Guard,\nand a page of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s, a young lad of an old aristocratic French\nfamily. That same day, Rost\xc3\xb3v, profiting by the darkness to avoid being\nrecognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging\noccupied by Bor\xc3\xads and Zhil\xc3\xadnski.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far\nfrom having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the\nFrench\xe2\x80\x94who from being foes had suddenly become friends\xe2\x80\x94that had\ntaken place at headquarters and in Bor\xc3\xads. In the army, Bonaparte and\nthe French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt,\nand fear. Only recently, talking with one of Pl\xc3\xa1tov\xe2\x80\x99s Cossack\nofficers, Rost\xc3\xb3v had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he\nwould be treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal. Quite lately,\nhappening to meet a wounded French colonel on the road, Rost\xc3\xb3v had\nmaintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate\nsovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. Rost\xc3\xb3v was therefore unpleasantly\nstruck by the presence of French officers in Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 lodging, dressed\nin uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point\nof view from the outposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed a French\nofficer, who thrust his head out of the door, that warlike feeling of\nhostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly\nseized him. He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether\nDrubetsk\xc3\xb3y lived there. Bor\xc3\xads, hearing a strange voice in the\nanteroom, came out to meet him. An expression of annoyance showed itself\nfor a moment on his face on first recognizing Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you? Very glad, very glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, however,\ncoming toward him with a smile. But Rost\xc3\xb3v had noticed his first\nimpulse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have\nbusiness,\xe2\x80\x9d he said coldly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment.\nDans un moment je suis \xc3\xa0 vous,\xe2\x80\x9d * he said, answering someone who\ncalled him.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cIn a minute I shall be at your disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see I\xe2\x80\x99m intruding,\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v repeated.\n\nThe look of annoyance had already disappeared from Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 face:\nhaving evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly took\nboth Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s hands and led him into the next room. His eyes, looking\nserenely and steadily at Rost\xc3\xb3v, seemed to be veiled by something,\nas if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it seemed to\nRost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads,\nand he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and\nintroduced him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but\nan hussar officer, and an old friend of his.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount Zhil\xc3\xadnski\xe2\x80\x94le Comte N. N.\xe2\x80\x94le Capitaine S. S.,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\nnaming his guests. Rost\xc3\xb3v looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed\nreluctantly, and remained silent.\n\nZhil\xc3\xadnski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very\nwillingly into his circle and did not speak to Rost\xc3\xb3v. Bor\xc3\xads did not\nappear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the same\npleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which\nhe had met Rost\xc3\xb3v, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the\nFrenchmen, with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen,\naddressed the obstinately taciturn Rost\xc3\xb3v, saying that the latter had\nprobably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I came on business,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rost\xc3\xb3v, briefly.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of\ndissatisfaction on Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 face, and as always happens to those in a\nbad humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion\nand that he was in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s way. He really was in their way, for he\nalone took no part in the conversation which again became general. The\nlooks the visitors cast on him seemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is he sitting\nhere for?\xe2\x80\x9d He rose and went up to Bor\xc3\xads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, I\xe2\x80\x99m in your way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a low tone. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and talk\nover my business and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you are tired, come and\nlie down in my room and have a rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, really...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey went into the little room where Bor\xc3\xads slept. Rost\xc3\xb3v, without\nsitting down, began at once, irritably (as if Bor\xc3\xads were to blame in\nsome way) telling him about Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s affair, asking him whether,\nthrough his general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor on\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s behalf and get Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s petition handed in. When he\nand Bor\xc3\xads were alone, Rost\xc3\xb3v felt for the first time that he could not\nlook Bor\xc3\xads in the face without a sense of awkwardness. Bor\xc3\xads, with one\nleg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender\nfingers of his right, listened to Rost\xc3\xb3v as a general listens to the\nreport of a subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing straight into\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this happened\nRost\xc3\xb3v felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe\nin such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the\nEmperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in general,\nI think...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do anything? Well then, say so!\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v\nalmost shouted, not looking Bor\xc3\xads in the face.\n\nBor\xc3\xads smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that moment Zhil\xc3\xadnski\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard calling Bor\xc3\xads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, go, go, go...\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, and refusing supper and\nremaining alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long\ntime, hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition\non Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. He could not himself go to the general in\nattendance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission\nto do so, and Bor\xc3\xads, even had he wished to, could not have done so on\nthe following day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were\nsigned. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the Cross\nof the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the\nFirst Degree, and a dinner had been arranged for the evening, given by\na battalion of the French Guards to the Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk battalion. The\nEmperors were to be present at that banquet.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Bor\xc3\xads that, when the\nlatter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and early next\nmorning went away, avoiding Bor\xc3\xads. In his civilian clothes and a\nround hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the French and their\nuniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French\nEmperors were staying. In a square he saw tables being set up and\npreparations made for the dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors\ndraped from side to side of the streets, with huge monograms A and N. In\nthe windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBor\xc3\xads doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to help me and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to ask him.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s settled,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cAll is over between us, but\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t leave here without having done all I can for Den\xc3\xadsov and\ncertainly not without getting his letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!...\nHe is here!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v, who had unconsciously returned to the\nhouse where Alexander lodged.\n\nSaddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were\nassembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may see him at any moment,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only I were\nto hand the letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really\narrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand on\nwhose side justice lies. He understands everything, knows everything.\nWho can be more just, more magnanimous than he? And even if they did\narrest me for being here, what would it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, looking\nat an officer who was entering the house the Emperor occupied. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter\nall, people do go in.... It\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go in and hand\nthe letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y who\ndrives me to it!\xe2\x80\x9d And suddenly with a determination he himself did not\nexpect, Rost\xc3\xb3v felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to\nthe house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe thought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious of\nthe blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI will fall at\nhis feet and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even\nthank me. \xe2\x80\x98I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is\nthe greatest happiness,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v fancied the sovereign saying. And\npassing people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch\nof the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n\nA broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right he\nsaw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading to the\nlower floor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d someone inquired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas,\nwith a tremor in his voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA petition? This way, to the officer on duty\xe2\x80\x9d (he was shown the\ndoor leading downstairs), \xe2\x80\x9conly it won\xe2\x80\x99t be accepted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn hearing this indifferent voice, Rost\xc3\xb3v grew frightened at what\nhe was doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so\nfascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away,\nbut the official who had questioned him opened the door, and Rost\xc3\xb3v\nentered.\n\nA short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots and\na batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing in that\nroom, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a\nnew pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason,\nattracted Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s attention. This man was speaking to someone in the\nadjoining room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good figure and in her first bloom,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying, but on seeing\nRost\xc3\xb3v, he stopped short and frowned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? A petition?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the person in the other room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother petitioner,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the man with the braces.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him to come later. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be coming out directly, we must\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLater... later! Tomorrow. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom have you come from? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come from Major Den\xc3\xadsov,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you an officer?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant Count Rost\xc3\xb3v.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with\nyou... go,\xe2\x80\x9d and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed\nhim.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were\nmany officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to pass.\n\nCursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding\nhimself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to\nshame and arrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety\nof his conduct and repenting of it, Rost\xc3\xb3v, with downcast eyes, was\nmaking his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a\nfamiliar voice called him and a hand detained him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a deep\nvoice.\n\nIt was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s special favor\nduring this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the division in\nwhich Rost\xc3\xb3v was serving.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the kindly,\njocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an excited voice\ntold him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for Den\xc3\xadsov, whom\nthe general knew. Having heard Rost\xc3\xb3v to the end, the general shook his\nhead gravely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHardly had Rost\xc3\xb3v handed him the letter and finished explaining\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard\non the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The\ngentlemen of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s suite ran down the stairs and went to their\nhorses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s horse, and the faint creak of a footstep Rost\xc3\xb3v knew at\nonce was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the danger of being recognized,\nRost\xc3\xb3v went close to the porch, together with some inquisitive\ncivilians, and again, after two years, saw those features he adored:\nthat same face and same look and step, and the same union of majesty and\nmildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign\nrose again in Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s soul in all its old force. In the uniform of\nthe Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk regiment\xe2\x80\x94white chamois-leather breeches and high\nboots\xe2\x80\x94and wearing a star Rost\xc3\xb3v did not know (it was that of the\nL\xc3\xa9gion d\xe2\x80\x99honneur), the monarch came out into the porch, putting on\nhis gloves and carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and looked\nabout him, brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few\nwords to some of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander of\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s division, smiled and beckoned to him.\n\nAll the suite drew back and Rost\xc3\xb3v saw the general talking for some\ntime to the Emperor.\n\nThe Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse.\nAgain the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers (among whom\nwas Rost\xc3\xb3v) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse,\nwith his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general\nand said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than\nI,\xe2\x80\x9d and he raised his foot to the stirrup.\n\nThe general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and\nrode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm,\nRost\xc3\xb3v ran after him with the crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nThe Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion\nof the Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the\nFrench Guards in their bearskin caps on the left.\n\nAs the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented\narms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and\nat the head of them Rost\xc3\xb3v recognized Napoleon. It could be no one\nelse. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over\na white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding\na very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered\nsaddlecloth. On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did\nso, Rost\xc3\xb3v, with his cavalryman\xe2\x80\x99s eye, could not help noticing\nthat Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions\nshouted \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cVive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!\xe2\x80\x9d Napoleon said\nsomething to Alexander, and both Emperors dismounted and took each\nother\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s face wore an unpleasant and artificial\nsmile. Alexander was saying something affable to him.\n\nIn spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes\xe2\x80\x99 horses, which\nwere pushing back the crowd, Rost\xc3\xb3v kept his eyes on every movement\nof Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander\ntreated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with\nthe Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter\nto him.\n\nAlexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites, approached\nthe right flank of the Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk battalion and came straight up to\nthe crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close\nto the Emperors that Rost\xc3\xb3v, standing in the front row, was afraid he\nmight be recognized.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the\nbravest of your soldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d said a sharp, precise voice, articulating\nevery letter.\n\nThis was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into\nAlexander\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to\nhim and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,\xe2\x80\x9d added\nNapoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance\nexasperating to Rost\xc3\xb3v, he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn\nup before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their\nEmperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d said Alexander\nand took a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozl\xc3\xb3vski, the commander of\nthe battalion.\n\nBonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand,\ntore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him\nrushed forward and picked it up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom shall it be given?\xe2\x80\x9d the Emperor Alexander asked Kozl\xc3\xb3vski,\nin Russian in a low voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whomever Your Majesty commands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back,\nremarked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we must give him an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKozl\xc3\xb3vski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rost\xc3\xb3v in his\nscrutiny.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be me?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cL\xc3\xa1zarev!\xe2\x80\x9d the colonel called, with a frown, and L\xc3\xa1zarev, the\nfirst soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you off to? Stop here!\xe2\x80\x9d voices whispered to L\xc3\xa1zarev who\ndid not know where to go. L\xc3\xa1zarev stopped, casting a sidelong look at\nhis colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to soldiers\ncalled before the ranks.\n\nNapoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out\nbehind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing\nat once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed\nsomething from one to another, and a page\xe2\x80\x94the same one Rost\xc3\xb3v\nhad seen the previous evening at Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94ran forward and, bowing\nrespectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a\nmoment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without looking,\npressed two fingers together and the badge was between them. Then he\napproached L\xc3\xa1zarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his\nown monarch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what\nhe was now doing was done for the sake of his ally, and the small white\nhand holding the Order touched one of L\xc3\xa1zarev\xe2\x80\x99s buttons. It was as if\nNapoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch\nthat soldier\xe2\x80\x99s breast for the soldier to be forever happy, rewarded,\nand distinguished from everyone else in the world. Napoleon merely laid\nthe cross on L\xc3\xa1zarev\xe2\x80\x99s breast and, dropping his hand, turned toward\nAlexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there. And it\nreally did.\n\nOfficious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross and\nfastened it to the uniform. L\xc3\xa1zarev glanced morosely at the little\nman with white hands who was doing something to him and, still standing\nmotionless presenting arms, looked again straight into Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s\neyes, as if asking whether he should stand there, or go away, or do\nsomething else. But receiving no orders, he remained for some time in\nthat rigid position.\n\nThe Emperors remounted and rode away. The Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk battalion,\nbreaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables\nprepared for them.\n\nL\xc3\xa1zarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers embraced\nhim, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of officers and\ncivilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of Russian and French\nvoices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square.\nTwo officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by\nRost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat d\xe2\x80\x99you think of the treat? All on silver plate,\xe2\x80\x9d one of them\nwas saying. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen L\xc3\xa1zarev?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nskis will give them a dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but what luck for L\xc3\xa1zarev! Twelve hundred francs\xe2\x80\x99 pension for\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a cap, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk soldier, donning a\nshaggy French cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fine thing! First-rate!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard the password?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one Guards\xe2\x80\x99 officer of\nanother. \xe2\x80\x9cThe day before yesterday it was \xe2\x80\x98Napol\xc3\xa9on, France,\nbravoure\xe2\x80\x99; yesterday, \xe2\x80\x98Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.\xe2\x80\x99 One day our\nEmperor gives it and next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send\na St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Cross to the bravest of the French Guards. It has to be\ndone. He must respond in kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads, too, with his friend Zhil\xc3\xadnski, came to see the Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk\nbanquet. On his way back, he noticed Rost\xc3\xb3v standing by the corner of a\nhouse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRost\xc3\xb3v! How d\xe2\x80\x99you do? We missed one another,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and could\nnot refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and\ntroubled was Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll call round?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from a\ndistance. In his mind, a painful process was going on which he could\nnot bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in his soul. Now he\nremembered Den\xc3\xadsov with his changed expression, his submission, and the\nwhole hospital, with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease. So\nvividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he\nlooked round to see where the smell came from. Next he thought of that\nself-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an\nEmperor, liked and respected by Alexander. Then why those severed\narms and legs and those dead men?... Then again he thought of L\xc3\xa1zarev\nrewarded and Den\xc3\xadsov punished and unpardoned. He caught himself\nharboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.\n\nThe smell of the food the Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nskis were eating and a sense of\nhunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to\neat before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning.\nThere he found so many people, among them officers who, like himself,\nhad come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a\ndinner. Two officers of his own division joined him. The conversation\nnaturally turned on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of\nthe army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of\nFriedland. They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would\nhave been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition.\nNicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a\ncouple of bottles of wine by himself. The process in his mind went on\ntormenting him without reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to\nhis thoughts, yet could not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the\nofficers\xe2\x80\x99 saying that it was humiliating to look at the French,\nRost\xc3\xb3v began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to\nthe surprise of the officers:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you judge what\xe2\x80\x99s best?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, the blood suddenly\nrushing to his face. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you judge the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s actions? What\nright have we to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s aims\nor his actions!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I never said a word about the Emperor!\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer,\njustifying himself, and unable to understand Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s outburst,\nexcept on the supposition that he was drunk.\n\nBut Rost\xc3\xb3v did not listen to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we are ordered to die, we must die. If we\xe2\x80\x99re\npunished, it means that we have deserved it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to judge.\nIf the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude\nan alliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If\nonce we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred\nwill be left! That way we shall be saying there is no God\xe2\x80\x94nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\nshouted Nicholas, banging the table\xe2\x80\x94very little to the point as it\nseemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own\nthoughts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That\xe2\x80\x99s\nall....\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to drink,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and to drink,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo there! Another\nbottle!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\nIn 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with\nthe Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was\nmuch talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nIn 1809 the intimacy between \xe2\x80\x9cthe world\xe2\x80\x99s two arbiters,\xe2\x80\x9d as\nNapoleon and Alexander were called, was such that when Napoleon declared\nwar on Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with\nour old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria, and\nin court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one\nof Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s sisters was spoken of. But besides considerations of\nforeign policy, the attention of Russian society was at that time keenly\ndirected on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the\ndepartments of government.\n\nLife meanwhile\xe2\x80\x94real life, with its essential interests of health and\nsickness, toil and rest, and its intellectual interests in thought,\nscience, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, and passions\xe2\x80\x94went on\nas usual, independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity\nwith Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIX: 1808 - 10\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nPrince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country.\n\nAll the plans Pierre had attempted on his estates\xe2\x80\x94and constantly\nchanging from one thing to another had never accomplished\xe2\x80\x94were carried\nout by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty.\n\nHe had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked,\nand without fuss or strain on his part this set things going.\n\nOn one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became\nfree agricultural laborers\xe2\x80\x94this being one of the first examples of\nthe kind in Russia. On other estates the serfs\xe2\x80\x99 compulsory labor was\ncommuted for a quitrent. A trained midwife was engaged for Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo\nat his expense, and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to\nthe children of the peasants and household serfs.\n\nPrince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his\nson, who was still in the care of nurses. The other half he spent in\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoguch\xc3\xa1rovo Cloister,\xe2\x80\x9d as his father called Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\nestate. Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had\nexpressed to Pierre, he diligently followed all that went on, received\nmany books, and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had\nvisitors from Petersburg, the very vortex of life, these people lagged\nbehind himself\xe2\x80\x94who never left the country\xe2\x80\x94in knowledge of what was\nhappening in home and foreign affairs.\n\nBesides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of\nbooks, Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of\nour last two unfortunate campaigns, and with drawing up a proposal for a\nreform of the army rules and regulations.\n\nIn the spring of 1809 he went to visit the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n estates which had\nbeen inherited by his son, whose guardian he was.\n\nWarmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the cal\xc3\xa8che looking at the new\ngrass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first puffs of white\nspring clouds floating across the clear blue sky. He was not thinking of\nanything, but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side.\n\nThey crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before.\nThey went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and green\nfields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge,\nuphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past strips of\nstubble land and bushes touched with green here and there, and into a\nbirch forest growing on both sides of the road. In the forest it was\nalmost hot, no wind could be felt. The birches with their sticky green\nleaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades\nof green grass were pushing up and lifting last year\xe2\x80\x99s leaves. The\ncoarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there\namong the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter. On entering the\nforest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly.\n\nPeter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter assented.\nBut apparently the coachman\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy was not enough for Peter, and\nhe turned on the box toward his master.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow pleasant it is, your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a respectful\nsmile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant, your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, the\nspring, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought as he turned round. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, really\neverything is green already.... How early! The birches and cherry and\nalders too are coming out.... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here is\none oak!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of the\nbirches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and twice as\ntall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as great as a\nman could embrace, and evidently long ago some of its branches had been\nbroken off and its bark scarred. With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling\nunsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged,\nstern, and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the\ndead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak,\nrefused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or\nthe sunshine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpring, love, happiness!\xe2\x80\x9d this oak seemed to say. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you not\nweary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the\nsame and always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness! Look\nat those cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too, sticking out\nmy broken and barked fingers just where they have grown, whether from my\nback or my sides: as they have grown so I stand, and I do not believe in\nyour hopes and your lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to\nlook at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak,\ntoo, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid,\nmisshapen, and grim as ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the oak is right, a thousand times right,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince\nAndrew. \xe2\x80\x9cLet others\xe2\x80\x94the young\xe2\x80\x94yield afresh to that fraud, but we\nknow life, our life is finished!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully pleasant, rose\nin his soul in connection with that tree. During this journey he, as\nit were, considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion,\nrestful in its hopelessness: that it was not for him to begin anything\nanew\xe2\x80\x94but that he must live out his life, content to do no harm, and\nnot disturbing himself or desiring anything.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nPrince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the district\nin connection with the affairs of the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n estate of which he was\ntrustee. This Marshal was Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v, and in the middle of May\nPrince Andrew went to visit him.\n\nIt was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already clothed in\ngreen. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to\nbathe.\n\nPrince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about which\nhe had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the grounds\nof the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 house at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe. He heard merry girlish cries\nbehind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross\nthe path of his cal\xc3\xa8che. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a\ndark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, with\na white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair\nescaped. The girl was shouting something but, seeing that he was a\nstranger, ran back laughing without looking at him.\n\nSuddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was so beautiful,\nthe sun so bright, everything around so gay, but that slim pretty girl\ndid not know, or wish to know, of his existence and was contented and\ncheerful in her own separate\xe2\x80\x94probably foolish\xe2\x80\x94but bright and happy\nlife. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is she so glad about? What is she thinking of? Not of\nthe military regulations or of the arrangement of the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n serfs\xe2\x80\x99\nquitrents. Of what is she thinking? Why is she so happy?\xe2\x80\x9d Prince\nAndrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity.\n\nIn 1809 Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v was living at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe just as he had done\nin former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province with\nhunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad to see Prince\nAndrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his staying\nthe night.\n\nDuring the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by\nhis elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old\ncount\xe2\x80\x99s house was crowded on account of an approaching name day),\nPrince Andrew repeatedly glanced at Nat\xc3\xa1sha, gay and laughing among the\nyounger members of the company, and asked himself each time, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\nshe thinking about? Why is she so glad?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to sleep. He\nread awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It was hot in the\nroom, the inside shutters of which were closed. He was cross with the\nstupid old man (as he called Rost\xc3\xb3v), who had made him stay by assuring\nhim that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he\nwas vexed with himself for having stayed.\n\nHe got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened the\nshutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst\ninto the room. He opened the casement. The night was fresh, bright, and\nvery still. Just before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking\nblack on one side and with a silvery light on the other. Beneath the\ntrees grew some kind of lush, wet, bushy vegetation with silver-lit\nleaves and stems here and there. Farther back beyond the dark trees a\nroof glittered with dew, to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly\nwhite trunk and branches, and above it shone the moon, nearly at its\nfull, in a pale, almost starless, spring sky. Prince Andrew leaned his\nelbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky.\n\nHis room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms above were also\nawake. He heard female voices overhead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust once more,\xe2\x80\x9d said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew\nrecognized at once.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when are you coming to bed?\xe2\x80\x9d replied another voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, what\xe2\x80\x99s the use? Come now for the last\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwo girlish voices sang a musical passage\xe2\x80\x94the end of some song.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go to sleep, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first voice, coming\nnearer to the window. She was evidently leaning right out, for the\nrustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard. Everything\nwas stone-still, like the moon and its light and the shadows. Prince\nAndrew, too, dared not stir, for fear of betraying his unintentional\npresence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya! S\xc3\xb3nya!\xe2\x80\x9d he again heard the first speaker. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how can\nyou sleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake up,\nS\xc3\xb3nya!\xe2\x80\x9d she said almost with tears in her voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThere never,\nnever was such a lovely night before!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya made some reluctant reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! Come here....\nDarling, sweetheart, come here! There, you see? I feel like sitting down\non my heels, putting my arms round my knees like this, straining tight,\nas tight as possible, and flying away! Like this....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, you\xe2\x80\x99ll fall out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe heard the sound of a scuffle and S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s disapproving voice:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s past one o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting\nthere. From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God, O God! What does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cTo bed\nthen, if it must be!\xe2\x80\x9d and she slammed the casement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor her I might as well not exist!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew while he\nlistened to her voice, for some reason expecting yet fearing that she\nmight say something about him. \xe2\x80\x9cThere she is again! As if it were on\npurpose,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\nIn his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful\nthoughts and hopes, contrary to the whole tenor of his life, that unable\nto explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nNext morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not\nwaiting for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off for home.\n\nIt was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove\ninto the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and\nmemorable an impression on him. In the forest the harness bells sounded\nyet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was\nthick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest\ndid not jar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood\naround, were delicately green with fluffy young shoots.\n\nThe whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only\na small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road\nand the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in the shade,\nthe right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and scarcely\nswayed by the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the nightingales\ntrilled, and their voices reverberated now near, now far away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nPrince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cBut where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he again wondered, gazing at\nthe left side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with\nadmiration at the very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured,\nspreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and\nslightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled\nfingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in\nevidence now. Through the hard century-old bark, even where there were\nno twigs, leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old\nveteran could have produced.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is the same oak,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he\nwas seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal. All\nthe best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory. Austerlitz\nwith the lofty heavens, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s dead reproachful face, Pierre at\nthe ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night, and that night\nitself and the moon, and... all this rushed suddenly to his mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, life is not over at thirty-one!\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew suddenly decided\nfinally and decisively. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not enough for me to know what I have\nin me\xe2\x80\x94everyone must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted to\nfly away into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may not be\nlived for myself alone while others live so apart from it, but so that\nit may be reflected in them all, and they and I may live in harmony!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nOn reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn\nand found all sorts of reasons for this decision. A whole series of\nsensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him\nto go to Petersburg, and even to re-enter the service, kept springing\nup in his mind. He could not now understand how he could ever even have\ndoubted the necessity of taking an active share in life, just as a month\nbefore he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country\ncould ever enter his head. It now seemed clear to him that all his\nexperience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to\nsome kind of work and again played an active part in life. He did not\neven remember how formerly, on the strength of similar wretched logical\narguments, it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if\nhe now, after the lessons he had had in life, allowed himself to believe\nin the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness\nor love. Now reason suggested quite the opposite. After that journey\nto Ryaz\xc3\xa1n he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer\ninterested him, and often when sitting alone in his study he got up,\nwent to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face. Then he would\nturn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who with hair curled \xc3\xa0 la\ngrecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame. She\ndid not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked simply,\nmerrily, and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing his\narms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling, as\nhe reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a\ncrime, which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre, with\nfame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and woman\xe2\x80\x99s beauty\nand love. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was\nparticularly cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say,\n\xe2\x80\x9clittle Nicholas can\xe2\x80\x99t go out today, it\xe2\x80\x99s very cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were hot,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly\nto his sister, \xe2\x80\x9che could go out in his smock, but as it is cold he\nmust wear warm clothes, which were designed for that purpose. That is\nwhat follows from the fact that it is cold; and not that a child who\nneeds fresh air should remain at home,\xe2\x80\x9d he would add with extreme\nlogic, as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that\nstirred within him.\n\nAt such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries\nmen up.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nPrince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809. It was the time\nwhen the youthful Sper\xc3\xa1nski was at the zenith of his fame and his\nreforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy. That same\nAugust the Emperor was thrown from his cal\xc3\xa8che, injured his leg, and\nremained three weeks at Peterhof, receiving Sper\xc3\xa1nski every day and no\none else. At that time the two famous decrees were being prepared\nthat so agitated society\xe2\x80\x94abolishing court ranks and introducing\nexaminations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor and\nState Councilor\xe2\x80\x94and not merely these but a whole state constitution,\nintended to change the existing order of government in Russia: legal,\nadministrative, and financial, from the Council of State down to the\ndistrict tribunals. Now those vague liberal dreams with which the\nEmperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which he had tried to put\ninto effect with the aid of his associates, Czartor\xc3\xbdski, Novos\xc3\xadltsev,\nKochub\xc3\xa9y, and Str\xc3\xb3gonov\xe2\x80\x94whom he himself in jest had called his\nComit\xc3\xa9 de salut public\xe2\x80\x94were taking shape and being realized.\n\nNow all these men were replaced by Sper\xc3\xa1nski on the civil side, and\nArakch\xc3\xa9ev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew, as a\ngentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court and at a levee. The\nEmperor, though he met him twice, did not favor him with a single word.\nIt had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic\nto the Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality\ngenerally, and in the cold, repellent glance the Emperor gave him, he\nnow found further confirmation of this surmise. The courtiers explained\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s neglect of him by His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure at\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s not having served since 1805.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know myself that one cannot help one\xe2\x80\x99s sympathies and\nantipathies,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cso it will not do to present\nmy proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor\npersonally, but the project will speak for itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, a friend\nof his father\xe2\x80\x99s. The field marshal made an appointment to see him,\nreceived him graciously, and promised to inform the Emperor. A few\ndays later Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the\nMinister of War, Count Arakch\xc3\xa9ev.\n\n\nOn the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakch\xc3\xa9ev\xe2\x80\x99s waiting\nroom at nine in the morning.\n\nHe did not know Arakch\xc3\xa9ev personally, had never seen him, and all he\nhad heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, and I need not\nconcern myself about his personal qualities: he has been commissioned to\nconsider my project, so he alone can get it adopted,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince\nAndrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people\nin Count Arakch\xc3\xa9ev\xe2\x80\x99s waiting room.\n\nDuring his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen the\nanterooms of many important men, and the different types of such rooms\nwere well known to him. Count Arakch\xc3\xa9ev\xe2\x80\x99s anteroom had quite a\nspecial character. The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their\nturn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility; the faces of\nthose of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness, covered\nby a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves, their situation, and\nthe person for whom they were waiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and\ndown, others whispered and laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xadla Andr\xc3\xa9evich\xe2\x80\x9d and the words, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle will give it to us\nhot,\xe2\x80\x9d in reference to Count Arakch\xc3\xa9ev. One general (an important\npersonage), evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long, sat\ncrossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.\n\nBut the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all\nfaces\xe2\x80\x94that of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time asked the\nadjutant on duty to take in his name, but received an ironical look and\nwas told that his turn would come in due course. After some others had\nbeen shown in and out of the minister\xe2\x80\x99s room by the adjutant on duty,\nan officer who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and frightened air\nwas admitted at that terrible door. This officer\xe2\x80\x99s audience lasted a\nlong time. Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard\nfrom the other side of the door, and the officer\xe2\x80\x94with pale face and\ntrembling lips\xe2\x80\x94came out and passed through the waiting room, clutching\nhis head.\n\nAfter this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on\nduty said in a whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cTo the right, at the window.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of\nforty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrinkles,\nscowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red\nnose. Arakch\xc3\xa9ev turned his head toward him without looking at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your petition?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arakch\xc3\xa9ev.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not petitioning, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Prince Andrew\nquietly.\n\nArakch\xc3\xa9ev\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned toward him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cPrince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not petitioning about anything. His Majesty the Emperor has\ndeigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my dear sir, I have read your project,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted\nArakch\xc3\xa9ev, uttering only the first words amiably and then\xe2\x80\x94again\nwithout looking at Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x94relapsing gradually into a tone of\ngrumbling contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are proposing new military laws? There are\nmany laws but no one to carry out the old ones. Nowadays everybody\ndesigns laws, it is easier writing than doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came at His Majesty the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s wish to learn from your\nexcellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have\npresented,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew politely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the\ncommittee. I do not approve of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, rising and taking\na paper from his writing table. \xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d and he handed it to Prince\nAndrew.\n\nAcross the paper was scrawled in pencil, without capital letters,\nmisspelled, and without punctuation: \xe2\x80\x9cUnsoundly constructed because\nresembles an imitation of the French military code and from the Articles\nof War needlessly deviating.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what committee has the memorandum been referred?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\nPrince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have recommended that\nyour honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA member without salary,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Arakch\xc3\xa9ev. \xe2\x80\x9cI have the\nhonor... Eh! Call the next one! Who else is there?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, bowing\nto Prince Andrew.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWhile waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee\nPrince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances, particularly those he\nknew to be in power and whose aid he might need. In Petersburg he now\nexperienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle, when\ntroubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling\ncircles where the future, on which the fate of millions depended, was\nbeing shaped. From the irritation of the older men, the curiosity of the\nuninitiated, the reserve of the initiated, the hurry and preoccupation\nof everyone, and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose\nexistence he learned every day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in\nPetersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation, the commander in\nchief of which was a mysterious person he did not know, but who was\nsupposed to be a man of genius\xe2\x80\x94Sper\xc3\xa1nski. And this movement of\nreconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea, and Sper\xc3\xa1nski\nits chief promoter, began to interest him so keenly that the question\nof the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his\nconsciousness.\n\nPrince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the\nhighest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The reforming\nparty cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because\nhe was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly because by\nliberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal.\nThe party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations,\nturned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the\nreforms, simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine\nsociety world welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a\ngood match, and almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account\nof his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this\nthe general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had\ngreatly improved during these last five years, having softened and grown\nmore manly, lost his former affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony,\nand acquired the serenity that comes with years. People talked about\nhim, were interested in him, and wanted to meet him.\n\nThe day after his interview with Count Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, Prince Andrew spent\nthe evening at Count Kochub\xc3\xa9y\xe2\x80\x99s. He told the count of his interview\nwith S\xc3\xadla Andr\xc3\xa9evich (Kochub\xc3\xa9y spoke of Arakch\xc3\xa9ev by that nickname\nwith the same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the Minister of\nWar\xe2\x80\x99s anteroom).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon cher, even in this case you can\xe2\x80\x99t do without Michael\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovich Sper\xc3\xa1nski. He manages everything. I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to him. He\nhas promised to come this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has Sper\xc3\xa1nski to do with the army regulations?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prince\nAndrew.\n\nKochub\xc3\xa9y shook his head smilingly, as if surprised at Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s\nsimplicity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were talking to him about you a few days ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Kochub\xc3\xa9y\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cand about your freed plowmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your serfs?\xe2\x80\x9d said an old man\nof Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s day, turning contemptuously toward Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a small estate that brought in no profit,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince\nAndrew, trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man\nuselessly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid of being late...\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, looking at Kochub\xc3\xa9y.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\nwill plow the land if they are set free? It is easy to write laws, but\ndifficult to rule.... Just the same as now\xe2\x80\x94I ask you, Count\xe2\x80\x94who will\nbe heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who pass the examinations, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Kochub\xc3\xa9y,\ncrossing his legs and glancing round.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have Pry\xc3\xa1nichnikov serving under me, a splendid man, a\npriceless man, but he\xe2\x80\x99s sixty. Is he to go up for examination?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s a difficulty, as education is not at all general,\nbut...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCount Kochub\xc3\xa9y did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrew by the arm,\nand went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a large open\nforehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness, who was\njust entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a\ncross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast. It was\nSper\xc3\xa1nski. Prince Andrew recognized him at once, and felt a throb\nwithin him, as happens at critical moments of life. Whether it was from\nrespect, envy, or anticipation, he did not know. Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s whole\nfigure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable. In\nthe society in which Prince Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who\ntogether with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and\nself-assurance; he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression\nas that in those half-closed, rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that\nexpressed nothing; nor had he heard such a refined, smooth, soft\nvoice; above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or\nhands\xe2\x80\x94hands which were broad, but very plump, soft, and white. Such\nwhiteness and softness Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of\nsoldiers who had been long in hospital. This was Sper\xc3\xa1nski, Secretary\nof State, reporter to the Emperor and his companion at Erfurt, where he\nhad more than once met and talked with Napoleon.\n\nSper\xc3\xa1nski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people\ninvoluntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to\nspeak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and\nhe looked only at the person with whom he was conversing.\n\nPrince Andrew followed Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s every word and movement with\nparticular attention. As happens to some people, especially to men\nwho judge those near to them severely, he always on meeting\nanyone new\xe2\x80\x94especially anyone whom, like Sper\xc3\xa1nski, he knew by\nreputation\xe2\x80\x94expected to discover in him the perfection of human\nqualities.\n\nSper\xc3\xa1nski told Kochub\xc3\xa9y he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner\nas he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that the Emperor\nhad kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of modesty.\nWhen Kochub\xc3\xa9y introduced Prince Andrew, Sper\xc3\xa1nski slowly turned\nhis eyes to Bolk\xc3\xb3nski with his customary smile and looked at him in\nsilence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard of you, as\neveryone has,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after a pause.\n\nKochub\xc3\xa9y said a few words about the reception Arakch\xc3\xa9ev had given\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski. Sper\xc3\xa1nski smiled more markedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend\nMonsieur Magn\xc3\xadtski,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, fully articulating every word and\nsyllable, \xe2\x80\x9cand if you like I can put you in touch with him.\xe2\x80\x9d He\npaused at the full stop. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will find him sympathetic and\nready to co-operate in promoting all that is reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA circle soon formed round Sper\xc3\xa1nski, and the old man who had talked\nabout his subordinate Pry\xc3\xa1nichnikov addressed a question to him.\n\nPrince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement\nof Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s: this man, not long since an insignificant divinity\nstudent, who now, Bolk\xc3\xb3nski thought, held in his hands\xe2\x80\x94those plump\nwhite hands\xe2\x80\x94the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the\nextraordinarily disdainful composure with which Sper\xc3\xa1nski answered\nthe old man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from\nan immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud,\nSper\xc3\xa1nski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or\ndisadvantage of what pleased the sovereign.\n\nHaving talked for a little while in the general circle, Sper\xc3\xa1nski rose\nand coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the\nroom. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated\nconversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\nwith a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he\nand Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom\nhe had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cI have known\nof you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your\nserfs, a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should\nbe more imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen\nof the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new\ndecree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so\nmuch gossip and tittle-tattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cmy father did not wish me to take\nadvantage of the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father, a man of the last century, evidently stands above our\ncontemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely re-establishes\nnatural justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, however, that these condemnations have some ground,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreturned Prince Andrew, trying to resist Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s influence, of\nwhich he began to be conscious. He did not like to agree with him in\neverything and felt a wish to contradict. Though he usually spoke easily\nand well, he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking\nwith Sper\xc3\xa1nski. He was too much absorbed in observing the famous\nman\xe2\x80\x99s personality.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrounds of personal ambition maybe,\xe2\x80\x9d Sper\xc3\xa1nski put in quietly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of state interest to some extent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sper\xc3\xa1nski quietly, lowering his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am an admirer of Montesquieu,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nhis idea that le principe des monarchies est l\xe2\x80\x99honneur me para\xc3\xaet\nincontestable. Certains droits et privil\xc3\xa8ges de la noblesse me\nparaissent \xc3\xaatre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cThe principle of monarchies is honor seems to me\n     incontestable. Certain rights and privileges for the\n     aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that\n     sentiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe smile vanished from Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s white face, which was much\nimproved by the change. Probably Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s thought interested\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSi vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue,\xe2\x80\x9d * he began,\npronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower\nthan in Russian but quite calmly.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cIf you regard the question from that point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nSper\xc3\xa1nski went on to say that honor, l\xe2\x80\x99honneur, cannot be upheld by\nprivileges harmful to the service; that honor, l\xe2\x80\x99honneur, is either a\nnegative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of\nemulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, which recognize it.\nHis arguments were concise, simple, and clear.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one\nsimilar to the L\xc3\xa9gion d\xe2\x80\x99honneur of the great Emperor Napoleon, not\nharmful but helpful to the success of the service, but not a class or\ncourt privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court privileges\nhave attained the same end,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery courtier\nconsiders himself bound to maintain his position worthily.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Sper\xc3\xa1nski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably\nan argument which was embarrassing for his companion. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you will\ndo me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI will,\nafter talking with Magn\xc3\xadtski, let you know what may interest you, and\nshall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nClosing his eyes, he bowed \xc3\xa0 la fran\xc3\xa7aise, without taking leave, and\ntrying to attract as little attention as possible, he left the room.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nDuring the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the\nwhole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite\novershadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city.\n\nOn returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four\nor five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours. The mechanism\nof life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere,\nabsorbed the greater part of his vital energy. He did nothing, did\nnot even think or find time to think, but only talked, and talked\nsuccessfully, of what he had thought while in the country.\n\nHe sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same\nremark on the same day in different circles. But he was so busy for\nwhole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking\nof nothing.\n\nAs he had done on their first meeting at Kochub\xc3\xa9y\xe2\x80\x99s, Sper\xc3\xa1nski\nproduced a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when he\nreceived him t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate at his own house and talked to him long and\nconfidentially.\n\nTo Bolk\xc3\xb3nski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant\ncreatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that\nperfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that in\nSper\xc3\xa1nski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous\nman. Had Sper\xc3\xa1nski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed\nthe same breeding and traditions, Bolk\xc3\xb3nski would soon have discovered\nhis weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s strange\nand logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because\nhe did not quite understand him. Moreover, Sper\xc3\xa1nski, either because he\nappreciated the other\xe2\x80\x99s capacity or because he considered it necessary\nto win him to his side, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness\nbefore Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which\ngoes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption\nthat one\xe2\x80\x99s companion is the only man besides oneself capable of\nunderstanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness\nand profundity of one\xe2\x80\x99s own ideas.\n\nDuring their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Sper\xc3\xa1nski more\nthan once remarked: \xe2\x80\x9cWe regard everything that is above the common\nlevel of rooted custom...\xe2\x80\x9d or, with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cBut we want the wolves\nto be fed and the sheep to be safe...\xe2\x80\x9d or: \xe2\x80\x9cThey cannot understand\nthis...\xe2\x80\x9d and all in a way that seemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cWe, you and I,\nunderstand what they are and who we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis first long conversation with Sper\xc3\xa1nski only strengthened in Prince\nAndrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting.\nHe saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by\nhis energy and persistence had attained power, which he was using solely\nfor the welfare of Russia. In Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s eyes Sper\xc3\xa1nski was the\nman he would himself have wished to be\xe2\x80\x94one who explained all the facts\nof life reasonably, considered important only what was rational, and\nwas capable of applying the standard of reason to everything. Everything\nseemed so simple and clear in Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s exposition that Prince\nAndrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything. If he replied and\nargued, it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and\nnot submit to Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s opinions entirely. Everything was right\nand everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince\nAndrew. This was Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s cold, mirrorlike look, which did not\nallow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands, which\nPrince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of\nthose who possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands\nirritated Prince Andrew, he knew not why. He was unpleasantly\nstruck, too, by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in\nSper\xc3\xa1nski, and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to\nsupport his opinions. He made use of every kind of mental device, except\nanalogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince Andrew, from one\nto another. Now he would take up the position of a practical man and\ncondemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and laugh ironically at his\nopponents; now grow severely logical, or suddenly rise to the realm of\nmetaphysics. (This last resource was one he very frequently employed.)\nHe would transfer a question to metaphysical heights, pass on to\ndefinitions of space, time, and thought, and, having deduced the\nrefutation he needed, would again descend to the level of the original\ndiscussion.\n\nIn general the trait of Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s mentality which struck Prince\nAndrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and\nauthority of reason. It was evident that the thought could never occur\nto him which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is\nafter all impossible to express all one thinks; and that he had never\nfelt the doubt, \xe2\x80\x9cIs not all I think and believe nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d And\nit was just this peculiarity of Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s mind that particularly\nattracted Prince Andrew.\n\nDuring the first period of their acquaintance Bolk\xc3\xb3nski felt a\npassionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for\nBonaparte. The fact that Sper\xc3\xa1nski was the son of a village priest,\nand that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his\nhumble origin (as in fact many did), caused Prince Andrew to cherish his\nsentiment for him the more, and unconsciously to strengthen it.\n\nOn that first evening Bolk\xc3\xb3nski spent with him, having mentioned the\nCommission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, Sper\xc3\xa1nski told him\nsarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty\nyears, had cost millions, and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf\nhad stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is all the state has for the millions it has spent,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have no\nlaws. That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to serve in\nthese times!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was\nneeded which he did not possess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious\ncircle from which we must break a way out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army\nRegulations and\xe2\x80\x94what he had not at all expected\xe2\x80\x94was chairman of a\nsection of the committee for the revision of the laws. At Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s\nrequest he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up\nand, with the aid of the Code Napol\xc3\xa9on and the Institutes of Justinian,\nhe worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nNearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to Petersburg\nafter visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading\nposition among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral\nlodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various\nlodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection\nof temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms,\nin regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular.\nHe supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in\nPetersburg.\n\nHis life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations and\ndissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he considered\nit immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the\nbachelor circles in which he moved.\n\nAmid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at\nthe end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest\nupon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him.\nAt the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the\ncloser bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had joined\nthe Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently\nsteps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his foot down it\nsank in. To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground, he put\nhis other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in it, and\ninvoluntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.\n\nJoseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich was not in Petersburg\xe2\x80\x94he had of late stood aside\nfrom the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost entirely in\nMoscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary\nlife, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in\nFreemasonry and not as Prince B. or Iv\xc3\xa1n Vas\xc3\xadlevich D., whom he knew\nin society mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under the Masonic\naprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they\naimed in ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and reckoning up\ntwenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a\ndozen members, of whom half were as well able to pay as himself, Pierre\nremembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote\nall his belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on which he tried not to\ndwell arose in his soul.\n\nHe divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first he\nput those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges\nor in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the mystical\nscience of the order: with questions of the threefold designation of\nGod, the three primordial elements\xe2\x80\x94sulphur, mercury, and salt\xe2\x80\x94or\nthe meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of\nSolomon. Pierre respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones\nchiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought, Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich himself,\nbut he did not share their interests. His heart was not in the mystical\naspect of Freemasonry.\n\nIn the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him,\nseeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight\nand comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.\n\nIn the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw\nnothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized\nthe strict performance of these forms without troubling about their\npurport or significance. Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master\nof the principal lodge.\n\nFinally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged,\nparticularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nobservations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for\nanything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy\nyoung Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank,\nand of whom there were very many in the lodge.\n\nPierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry,\nat any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely\non externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but\nsuspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated\nfrom its original principles. And so toward the end of the year he went\nabroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order.\n\nIn the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our Freemasons knew\nfrom correspondence with those abroad that Bez\xc3\xbakhov had obtained the\nconfidence of many highly placed persons, had been initiated into many\nmysteries, had been raised to a higher grade, and was bringing back with\nhim much that might conduce to the advantage of the Masonic cause\nin Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons all came to see him, tried to\ningratiate themselves with him, and it seemed to them all that he was\npreparing something for them and concealing it.\n\nA solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened, at\nwhich Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers what\nhe had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order. The\nmeeting was a full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began\nhis address.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Brothers,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, blushing and stammering, with a written\nspeech in his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in\nthe seclusion of our lodge\xe2\x80\x94we must act\xe2\x80\x94act! We are drowsing, but we\nmust act.\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of\nvirtue,\xe2\x80\x9d he read, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse\nprinciples in harmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the\neducation of the young, unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the\nwisest men, boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity, and\nfolly, and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity\nof purpose and possessed of authority and power.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice\nand must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this world,\nreceive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great endeavors we\nare gravely hampered by the political institutions of today. What is\nto be done in these circumstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow\neverything, repel force by force?... No! We are very far from that.\nEvery violent reform deserves censure, for it quite fails to remedy\nevil while men remain what they are, and also because wisdom needs no\nviolence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of\npreparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of\nconviction\xe2\x80\x94aiming at the punishment of vice and folly, and patronizing\ntalent and virtue: raising worthy men from the dust and attaching\nthem to our Brotherhood. Only then will our order have the power\nunobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to\ncontrol them without their being aware of it. In a word, we must found a\nform of government holding universal sway, which should be diffused over\nthe whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship, and beside\nwhich all other governments can continue in their customary course and\ndo everything except what impedes the great aim of our order, which\nis to obtain for virtue the victory over vice. This aim was that of\nChristianity itself. It taught men to be wise and good and for their\nown benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest\nmen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching\nalone was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her with\nspecial strength, but now we need much more powerful methods. It is\nnow necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in virtue\na charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate the\npassions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it is\ntherefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions\nwithin the limits of virtue. Our order should provide means to that end.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state,\neach of them again training two others and all being closely united,\neverything will be possible for our order, which has already in secret\naccomplished much for the welfare of mankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis speech not only made a strong impression, but created excitement in\nthe lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it dangerous designs\nof Illuminism, * met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre. The Grand\nMaster began answering him, and Pierre began developing his views with\nmore and more warmth. It was long since there had been so stormy a\nmeeting. Parties were formed, some accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others\nsupporting him. At that meeting he was struck for the first time by\nthe endless variety of men\xe2\x80\x99s minds, which prevents a truth from ever\npresenting itself identically to two persons. Even those members\nwho seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with\nlimitations and alterations he could not agree to, as what he always\nwanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself\nunderstood it.\n\n     * The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for\n     monarchical institutions.\n\nAt the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will\nreproved Bez\xc3\xbakhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue\nalone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute.\nPierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would\nbe accepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for the\nusual formalities he left the lodge and went home.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nAgain Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. For three\ndays after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at\nhome receiving no one and going nowhere.\n\nIt was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who implored\nhim to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and how she\nwished to devote her whole life to him.\n\nAt the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would\nreturn to Petersburg from abroad.\n\nFollowing this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected\nless than the others forced his way in to see him and, turning the\nconversation upon Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s matrimonial affairs, by way of fraternal\nadvice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong\nand that he was neglecting one of the first rules of Freemasonry by not\nforgiving the penitent.\n\nAt the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s wife, sent to\nhim imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most\nimportant matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and\nthat they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then\nwas, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him.\nNothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the\ninfluence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his\nliberty nor his resolution to punish his wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to\nblame,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\nIf he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it\nwas only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take\nany step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away.\nCompared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference\nwhether he lived with his wife or not?\n\nWithout replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre late\none night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph\nAlex\xc3\xa9evich. This is what he noted in his diary:\n\nMoscow, 17th November\n\nI have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I\nhave experienced. Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich is living poorly and has for three\nyears been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has\never heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till\nlate at night, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working\nat science. He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed\non which he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of\nJerusalem, and he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild\nsmile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges.\nI told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed\nto our Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of\nmy rupture with the Brothers. Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich, having remained silent\nand thoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which\nat once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow.\nHe surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of\nthe order: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The\npurification and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The\nimprovement of the human race by striving for such purification. Which\nis the principal aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and\nself-purification. Only to this aim can we always strive independently\nof circumstances. But at the same time just this aim demands the\ngreatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of\nthis aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our\nimpurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of\nthe human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and\nprofligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is\nattracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground\nJoseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the\ndepth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said\nto me, \xe2\x80\x9cthe chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in\nperfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the difficulties\nof our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on the contrary,\nmy dear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain\nour three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledge\xe2\x80\x94for man can only know himself\nby comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by\nconflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtue\xe2\x80\x94love of death.\nOnly the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our\ninnate love of death or of rebirth to a new life.\xe2\x80\x9d These words are all\nthe more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings,\nJoseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich is never weary of life though he loves death, for\nwhich\xe2\x80\x94in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man\xe2\x80\x94he does\nnot yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained\nto me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out\nto me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He\nadvised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but\nto take up only second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while\ndiverting the Brothers from pride, to turn them toward the true path\nself-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for\nmyself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end\nhe gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in and in which I will\nin future note down all my actions.\n\nPetersburg, 23rd November\n\nI am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears and\nsaid that H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne was here and that she implored me to hear her; that\nshe was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I knew\nthat if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on\nrefusing what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and\nadvice to seek. Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what\nto do. I went to my room and reread Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich\xe2\x80\x99s letters and\nrecalled my conversations with him, and deduced from it all that I\nought not to refuse a supplicant, and ought to reach a helping hand to\neveryone\xe2\x80\x94especially to one so closely bound to me\xe2\x80\x94and that I must\nbear my cross. But if I forgive her for the sake of doing right, then\nlet union with her have only a spiritual aim. That is what I decided,\nand what I wrote to Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich. I told my wife that I begged her\nto forget the past, to forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her,\nand that I had nothing to forgive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She\nneed not know how hard it was for me to see her again. I have settled on\nthe upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of\nregeneration.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nAt that time, as always happens, the highest society that met at court\nand at the grand balls was divided into several circles, each with its\nown particular tone. The largest of these was the French circle of the\nNapoleonic alliance, the circle of Count Rumy\xc3\xa1ntsev and Caulaincourt.\nIn this group H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, as soon as she had settled in Petersburg with\nher husband, took a very prominent place. She was visited by the members\nof the French embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for\ntheir intellect and polished manners.\n\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the Emperors\nand had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic\nnotabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant. Napoleon himself\nhad noticed her in the theater and said of her: \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est un superbe\nanimal.\xe2\x80\x9d * Her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not\nsurprise Pierre, for she had become even handsomer than before. What did\nsurprise him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded\nin gaining the reputation \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x99 une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle\nque belle.\xe2\x80\x9d *(2) The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her\neight-page letters. Bil\xc3\xadbin saved up his epigrams to produce them\nin Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova\xe2\x80\x99s presence. To be received in the Countess\nBez\xc3\xbakhova\xe2\x80\x99s salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect. Young men\nread books before attending H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s evenings, to have something to\nsay in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy, and even ambassadors,\nconfided diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a way H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne was a\npower. Pierre, who knew she was very stupid, sometimes attended, with a\nstrange feeling of perplexity and fear, her evenings and dinner parties,\nwhere politics, poetry, and philosophy were discussed. At these parties\nhis feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick\nto be found out at any moment. But whether because stupidity was just\nwhat was needed to run such a salon, or because those who were deceived\nfound pleasure in the deception, at any rate it remained unexposed and\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne Bez\xc3\xbakhova\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a lovely and clever woman became\nso firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest\nthings and everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers\nand look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no\nconception.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a superb animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * (2) \xe2\x80\x9cOf a charming woman, as witty as she is lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nPierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He was\nthat absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no one\xe2\x80\x99s\nway, and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the\ndrawing room, he served, by the contrast he presented to her, as an\nadvantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife. Pierre during\nthe last two years, as a result of his continual absorption in abstract\ninterests and his sincere contempt for all else, had acquired in his\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s circle, which did not interest him, that air of unconcern,\nindifference, and benevolence toward all, which cannot be acquired\nartificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect. He entered\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s drawing room as one enters a theater, was acquainted with\neverybody, equally pleased to see everyone, and equally indifferent to\nthem all. Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him\nand, regardless of whether any \xe2\x80\x9cgentlemen of the embassy\xe2\x80\x9d were\npresent or not, lispingly expressed his views, which were sometimes not\nat all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment. But the general\nopinion concerning the queer husband of \xe2\x80\x9cthe most distinguished woman\nin Petersburg\xe2\x80\x9d was so well established that no one took his freaks\nseriously.\n\nAmong the many young men who frequented her house every day, Bor\xc3\xads\nDrubetsk\xc3\xb3y, who had already achieved great success in the service, was\nthe most intimate friend of the Bez\xc3\xbakhov household since H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s\nreturn from Erfurt. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne spoke of him as \xe2\x80\x9cmon page\xe2\x80\x9d and treated\nhim like a child. Her smile for him was the same as for everybody,\nbut sometimes that smile made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him Bor\xc3\xads\nbehaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference. This shade\nof deference also disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three\nyears before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him\nthat he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition, first\nby not being a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing himself\nto suspect.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced\nher former infatuations,\xe2\x80\x9d he told himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has never been\nan instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the\nheart\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a statement which, though gathered from an unknown source,\nhe believed implicitly. Yet strange to say Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 presence in his\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s drawing room (and he was almost always there) had a physical\neffect upon Pierre; it constricted his limbs and destroyed the\nunconsciousness and freedom of his movements.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a strange antipathy,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cyet I used to like\nhim very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather blind\nand absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who did\nnothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured fellow. But\na complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place\nall this time in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s soul, revealing much to him and causing him\nmany spiritual doubts and joys.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nPierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during\nthat time:\n\n\n24th November\n\nGot up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. (By Joseph\nAlex\xc3\xa9evich\xe2\x80\x99s advice Pierre had entered the service of the state and\nserved on one of the committees.) Returned home for dinner and dined\nalone\xe2\x80\x94the countess had many visitors I do not like. I ate and drank\nmoderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers.\nIn the evening I went down to the countess and told a funny story about\nB., and only remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody\nlaughed loudly at it.\n\nI am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me to\nwalk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation,\n(2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion, (3) to withdraw\nfrom worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the state, (b) family\nduties, (c) relations with my friends, and the management of my affairs.\n\n\n27th November\n\nI got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God,\nhelp and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures,\nbut without proper feeling. Brother Ur\xc3\xbasov came and we talked about\nworldly vanities. He told me of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s new projects. I began\nto criticize them, but remembered my rules and my benefactor\xe2\x80\x99s\nwords\xe2\x80\x94that a true Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state\nwhen his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to\nassist. My tongue is my enemy. Brothers G. V. and O. visited me and we\nhad a preliminary talk about the reception of a new Brother. They laid\non me the duty of Rhetor. I feel myself weak and unworthy. Then our\ntalk turned to the interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the\nTemple, the seven sciences, the seven virtues, the seven vices, and the\nseven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Brother O. was very eloquent. In the\nevening the admission took place. The new decoration of the Premises\ncontributed much to the magnificence of the spectacle. It was Bor\xc3\xads\nDrubetsk\xc3\xb3y who was admitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A\nstrange feeling agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the\ndark chamber. I caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him\nwhich I vainly tried to overcome. That is why I should really like\nto save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth, but evil\nthoughts of him did not leave me. It seemed to me that his object in\nentering the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with\nmembers of our lodge. Apart from the fact that he had asked me several\ntimes whether N. and S. were members of our lodge (a question to which I\ncould not reply) and that according to my observation he is incapable of\nfeeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied\nwith the outer man to desire spiritual improvement, I had no cause to\ndoubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all the time I stood\nalone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling\ncontemptuously at my words, and I wished really to stab his bare breast\nwith the sword I held to it. I could not be eloquent, nor could I\nfrankly mention my doubts to the Brothers and to the Grand Master. Great\nArchitect of Nature, help me to find the true path out of the labyrinth\nof lies!\n\n\nAfter this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then the\nfollowing was written:\n\n\nI have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V., who\nadvised me to hold fast by Brother A. Though I am unworthy, much was\nrevealed to me. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. Elohim\nis the name of the ruler of all. The third name is the name unutterable\nwhich means the All. Talks with Brother V. strengthen, refresh, and\nsupport me in the path of virtue. In his presence doubt has no place.\nThe distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our\nsacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me. Human sciences dissect\neverything to comprehend it, and kill everything to examine it. In the\nholy science of our order all is one, all is known in its entirety and\nlife. The Trinity\xe2\x80\x94the three elements of matter\xe2\x80\x94are sulphur, mercury,\nand salt. Sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature; in combination with\nsalt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means\nof which it attracts mercury, seizes it, holds it, and in combination\nproduces other bodies. Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence.\nChrist, the Holy Spirit, Him!...\n\n\n3rd December\n\nAwoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went and\npaced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but instead my\nimagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago, when D\xc3\xb3lokhov,\nmeeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying\nperfect peace of mind in spite of my wife\xe2\x80\x99s absence. At the time I\ngave him no answer. Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in\nmy mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies. I recollected\nmyself and drove away that thought only when I found myself glowing with\nanger, but I did not sufficiently repent. Afterwards Bor\xc3\xads Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y\ncame and began relating various adventures. His coming vexed me from the\nfirst, and I said something disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared\nup and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him. He became\nsilent, and I recollected myself only when it was too late. My God, I\ncannot get on with him at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set\nmyself above him and so become much worse than he, for he is lenient\nto my rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him. O God,\ngrant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness, and behave\nso that he too may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as I was\ndrowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, \xe2\x80\x9cThy\nday!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by\ndogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left\nthigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it with\nmy hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger one, began\nbiting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the bigger and\nheavier it grew. And suddenly Brother A. came and, taking my arm, led\nme to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank.\nI stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a\nfence which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After much effort I\ndragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on\nthe other. I looked round and saw Brother A. standing on the fence and\npointing me to a broad avenue and garden, and in the garden was a large\nand beautiful building. I woke up. O Lord, great Architect of Nature,\nhelp me to tear from myself these dogs\xe2\x80\x94my passions especially the\nlast, which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones, and\naid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in\nmy dream.\n\n\n7th December\n\nI dreamed that Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich was sitting in my house, and that I\nwas very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered\nincessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could\nnot please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace him. But\nas soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young,\nand he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order,\nbut so softly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we all left\nthe room and something strange happened. We were sitting or lying on\nthe floor. He was telling me something, and I wished to show him my\nsensibility, and not listening to what he was saying I began picturing\nto myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying\nme. And tears came into my eyes, and I was glad he noticed this. But he\nlooked at me with vexation and jumped up, breaking off his remarks. I\nfelt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern\nme; but he did not reply, gave me a kind look, and then we suddenly\nfound ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed. He lay down\non the edge of it and I burned with longing to caress him and lie down\ntoo. And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me frankly what is your chief temptation? Do\nyou know it? I think you know it already.\xe2\x80\x9d Abashed by this question,\nI replied that sloth was my chief temptation. He shook his head\nincredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I was living\nwith my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband. To\nthis he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one\xe2\x80\x99s embraces\nand gave me to understand that that was my duty. But I replied that\nI should be ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I\nawoke and found in my mind the text from the Gospel: \xe2\x80\x9cThe life was\nthe light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness\ncomprehended it not.\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich\xe2\x80\x99s face had looked young\nand bright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he\nwrote about \xe2\x80\x9cconjugal duties.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n9th December\n\nI had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I saw that\nI was in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, and Joseph\nAlex\xc3\xa9evich came in from the drawing room. I seemed to know at once that\nthe process of regeneration had already taken place in him, and I rushed\nto meet him. I embraced him and kissed his hands, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHast\nthou noticed that my face is different?\xe2\x80\x9d I looked at him, still\nholding him in my arms, and saw that his face was young, but that he\nhad no hair on his head and his features were quite changed. And I said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have known you had I met you by chance,\xe2\x80\x9d and I thought to\nmyself, \xe2\x80\x9cAm I telling the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d And suddenly I saw him lying like\na dead body; then he gradually recovered and went with me into my study\ncarrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper; I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI drew\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d and he answered by bowing his head. I opened the book, and on\nall the pages there were excellent drawings. And in my dream I knew\nthat these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its\nbeloved. And on its pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden\nin transparent garments and with a transparent body, flying up to the\nclouds. And I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a\nrepresentation of the Song of Songs. And looking at those drawings I\ndreamed I felt that I was doing wrong, but could not tear myself away\nfrom them. Lord, help me! My God, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy\nwill be done; but if I am myself the cause, teach me what I should do! I\nshall perish of my debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me!\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 monetary affairs had not improved during the two years\nthey had spent in the country.\n\nThough Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v had kept firmly to his resolution and was still\nserving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little,\nthe way of life at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe\xe2\x80\x94M\xc3\xadtenka\xe2\x80\x99s management of affairs, in\nparticular\xe2\x80\x94was such that the debts inevitably increased every year.\nThe only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to\napply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one\nand also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last\ntime.\n\nSoon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to V\xc3\xa9ra and was\naccepted.\n\nThough in Moscow the Rost\xc3\xb3vs belonged to the best society without\nthemselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of\nacquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were\nprovincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without\ninquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.\n\nThe Rost\xc3\xb3vs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in\nMoscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country\nneighbors from Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters,\nPer\xc3\xb3nskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bez\xc3\xbakhov, and the son of their\ndistrict postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the\nmen who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 house in\nPetersburg were Bor\xc3\xads, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and\ndragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99\nand paid the eldest daughter, Countess V\xc3\xa9ra, the attentions a young man\npays when he intends to propose.\n\nNot in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at\nAusterlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He\nnarrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that\neveryone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had\nobtained two decorations for Austerlitz.\n\nIn the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had picked\nup the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near\nthe commander in chief and had taken it to his commander. Just as he had\ndone after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and\nso insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do\nthis, and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also. In\n1809 he was a captain in the Guards, wore medals, and held some special\nlucrative posts in Petersburg.\n\nThough some skeptics smiled when told of Berg\xe2\x80\x99s merits, it could not\nbe denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent\nterms with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant career\nbefore him and an assured position in society.\n\nFour years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow\ntheater, Berg had pointed out V\xc3\xa9ra Rost\xc3\xb3va to him and had said in\nGerman, \xe2\x80\x9cdas soll mein Weib werden,\xe2\x80\x9d * and from that moment had\nmade up his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 position and his own, he decided that the time had come to\npropose.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cThat girl shall be my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nBerg\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not\nflattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure\nLivonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va; but\nBerg\xe2\x80\x99s chief characteristic was such a na\xc3\xafve and good natured egotism\nthat the Rost\xc3\xb3vs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing,\nsince he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good, indeed\nexcellent. Moreover, the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 affairs were seriously embarrassed,\nas the suitor could not but know; and above all, V\xc3\xa9ra was twenty-four,\nhad been taken out everywhere, and though she was certainly good-looking\nand sensible, no one up to now had proposed to her. So they gave their\nconsent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg to his comrade, whom he called \xe2\x80\x9cfriend\xe2\x80\x9d\nonly because he knew that everyone has friends, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see, I have\nconsidered it all, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out\nor if it were in any way unsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and\nmamma are now provided for\xe2\x80\x94I have arranged that rent for them in the\nBaltic Provinces\xe2\x80\x94and I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with\nher fortune and my good management we can get along nicely. I am not\nmarrying for money\xe2\x80\x94I consider that dishonorable\xe2\x80\x94but a wife should\nbring her share and a husband his. I have my position in the service,\nshe has connections and some means. In our times that is worth\nsomething, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But above all, she is a handsome, estimable girl,\nand she loves me....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBerg blushed and smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I love her, because her character is sensible and very good.\nNow the other sister, though they are the same family, is quite\ndifferent\xe2\x80\x94an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence.\nShe is so... you know?... Unpleasant... But my fianc\xc3\xa9e!... Well, you\nwill be coming,\xe2\x80\x9d he was going to say, \xe2\x80\x9cto dine,\xe2\x80\x9d but changed his\nmind and said \xe2\x80\x9cto take tea with us,\xe2\x80\x9d and quickly doubling up his\ntongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke, perfectly embodying\nhis dream of happiness.\n\nAfter the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Berg\xe2\x80\x99s\nproposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took\npossession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and insincere.\nIn the family\xe2\x80\x99s feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness\nand constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved\nV\xc3\xa9ra sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands. The\nold count felt this most. He would probably have been unable to state\nthe cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from the state of his\naffairs. He did not know at all how much he had, what his debts amounted\nto, or what dowry he could give V\xc3\xa9ra. When his daughters were born\nhe had assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an estate with three\nhundred serfs; but one of these estates had already been sold, and the\nother was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would\nhave to be sold, so that it was impossible to give it to V\xc3\xa9ra. Nor had\nhe any money.\n\nBerg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained before\nthe wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the\nquestion of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At one time the\ncount thought of giving her the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n estate or of selling a forest,\nat another time of borrowing money on a note of hand. A few days before\nthe wedding Berg entered the count\xe2\x80\x99s study early one morning and, with\na pleasant smile, respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let\nhim know what V\xc3\xa9ra\xe2\x80\x99s dowry would be. The count was so disconcerted by\nthis long-foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first\nreply that came into his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI like your being businesslike about\nit.... I like it. You shall be satisfied....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the\nconversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not\nknow for certain how much V\xc3\xa9ra would have and did not receive at least\npart of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, consider, Count\xe2\x80\x94if I allowed myself to marry now\nwithout having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be acting\nbadly....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and to\navoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand\nfor eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on the\nshoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was impossible\nfor him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in\nready money. \xe2\x80\x9cOr at least twenty thousand, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nthen a note of hand for only sixty thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly excuse me,\nmy dear fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for\neighty thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year to which\nshe had counted on her fingers with Bor\xc3\xads after they had kissed four\nyears ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before S\xc3\xb3nya and her\nmother, if Bor\xc3\xads happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of\nthat episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not\nworth mentioning. But in the secret depths of her soul the question\nwhether her engagement to Bor\xc3\xads was a jest or an important, binding\npromise tormented her.\n\nSince Bor\xc3\xads left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed near\nOtr\xc3\xa1dnoe, but had never been to see them.\n\nSometimes it occurred to Nat\xc3\xa1sha that he did not wish to see her, and\nthis conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke\nof him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowadays old friends are not remembered,\xe2\x80\x9d the countess would say\nwhen Bor\xc3\xads was mentioned.\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, seemed\nto hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke rapturously\nand gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on\nwhich he had entered. When the Rost\xc3\xb3vs came to Petersburg Bor\xc3\xads called\non them.\n\nHe drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of Nat\xc3\xa1sha was\nhis most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of\nletting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between\nhimself and Nat\xc3\xa1sha could not be binding either on her or on him. He\nhad a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess\nBez\xc3\xbakhova, a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage\nof an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and he\nwas beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in\nPetersburg, plans which might very easily be realized. When he entered\nthe Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 drawing room Nat\xc3\xa1sha was in her own room. When she\nheard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room, flushed and\nbeaming with a more than cordial smile.\n\nBor\xc3\xads remembered Nat\xc3\xa1sha in a short dress, with dark eyes shining from\nunder her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, as he had known her\nfour years before; and so he was taken aback when quite a different\nNat\xc3\xa1sha entered, and his face expressed rapturous astonishment. This\nexpression on his face pleased Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\ncountess.\n\nBor\xc3\xads kissed Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s hand and said that he was astonished at the\nchange in her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow handsome you have grown!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s laughing eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is Papa older?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha sat down and, without joining in Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 conversation with\nthe countess, silently and minutely studied her childhood\xe2\x80\x99s suitor. He\nfelt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced\nat her occasionally.\n\nBor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were all\ncomme il faut and in the latest fashion. This Nat\xc3\xa1sha noticed at once.\nHe sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess, arranging\nwith his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand\nlike a skin, and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his\nlips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg society, recalling\nwith mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow acquaintances. It was\nnot accidentally, Nat\xc3\xa1sha felt, that he alluded, when speaking of the\nhighest aristocracy, to an ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s ball he had attended, and to\ninvitations he had received from N.N. and S.S.\n\nAll this time Nat\xc3\xa1sha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her\nbrows. This gaze disturbed and confused Bor\xc3\xads more and more. He looked\nround more frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying.\nHe did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave. The\nsame inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still looked\nat him. After his first visit Bor\xc3\xads said to himself that Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nattracted him just as much as ever, but that he must not yield to that\nfeeling, because to marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would\nmean ruin to his career, while to renew their former relations without\nintending to marry her would be dishonorable. Bor\xc3\xads made up his mind\nto avoid meeting Nat\xc3\xa1sha, but despite that resolution he called again\na few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99. It seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten, that in\nspite of everything... she could not be his wife, that he had no means,\nand they would never let her marry him. But he failed to do so and felt\nawkward about entering on such an explanation. From day to day he\nbecame more and more entangled. It seemed to her mother and S\xc3\xb3nya that\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was in love with Bor\xc3\xads as of old. She sang him his favorite\nsongs, showed him her album, making him write in it, did not allow him\nto allude to the past, letting it be understood how delightful was the\npresent; and every day he went away in a fog, without having said what\nhe meant to, and not knowing what he was doing or why he came, or how\nit would all end. He left off visiting H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne and received reproachful\nnotes from her every day, and yet he continued to spend whole days with\nthe Rost\xc3\xb3vs.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nOne night when the old countess, in nightcap and dressing jacket,\nwithout her false curls, and with her poor little knob of hair showing\nunder her white cotton cap, knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and\nbowing to the ground in prayer, her door creaked and Nat\xc3\xa1sha, also in\na dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in\ncurlpapers, ran in. The countess\xe2\x80\x94her prayerful mood dispelled\xe2\x80\x94looked\nround and frowned. She was finishing her last prayer: \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be that\nthis couch will be my grave?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha, flushed and eager, seeing\nher mother in prayer, suddenly checked her rush, half sat down, and\nunconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing that\nher mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and, rapidly\nslipping one little foot against the other, pushed off her slippers and\njumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave. This\ncouch was high, with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than\nthe one below. Nat\xc3\xa1sha jumped on it, sank into the feather bed, rolled\nover to the wall, and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled\ndown, raising her knees to her chin, kicking out and laughing almost\ninaudibly, now covering herself up head and all, and now peeping at her\nmother. The countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a\nstern face, but seeing that Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s head was covered, she smiled\nin her kind, weak way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, now then!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, can we have a talk? Yes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, just one on\nyour throat and another... that\xe2\x80\x99ll do!\xe2\x80\x9d And seizing her mother round\nthe neck, she kissed her on the throat. In her behavior to her mother\nNat\xc3\xa1sha seemed rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that however\nshe clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her\nor making her feel uncomfortable or displeased.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it tonight?\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, having arranged her\npillows and waited until Nat\xc3\xa1sha, after turning over a couple of times,\nhad settled down beside her under the quilt, spread out her arms, and\nassumed a serious expression.\n\nThese visits of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s at night before the count returned from his\nclub were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother, and daughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it tonight?\xe2\x80\x94But I have to tell you...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha put her hand on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Bor\xc3\xads... I know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said seriously; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\nhave come about. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x94I know. No, do tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d and she\nremoved her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Mamma! He\xe2\x80\x99s nice?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, you are sixteen. At your age I was married. You say Bor\xc3\xads\nis nice. He is very nice, and I love him like a son. But what then?...\nWhat are you thinking about? You have quite turned his head, I can see\nthat....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs she said this the countess looked round at her daughter. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nwas lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany\nsphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the countess\nonly saw her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s face in profile. That face struck her by its\npeculiarly serious and concentrated expression.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was listening and considering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him? You\nknow you can\xe2\x80\x99t marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, without changing her position.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he is young, because he is poor, because he is a relation...\nand because you yourself don\xe2\x80\x99t love him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know. It is not right, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I want to...\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave off talking nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I want to...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, I am in earnest...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not let her finish. She drew the countess\xe2\x80\x99 large hand to\nher, kissed it on the back and then on the palm, then again turned it\nover and began kissing first one knuckle, then the space between the\nknuckles, then the next knuckle, whispering, \xe2\x80\x9cJanuary, February,\nMarch, April, May. Speak, Mamma, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you say anything? Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid she, turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her daughter\nand in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to\nsay.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t do, my love! Not everyone will understand this friendship\ndating from your childish days, and to see him so intimate with you may\ninjure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us, and above all\nit torments him for nothing. He may already have found a suitable and\nwealthy match, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s half crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrazy?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you some things about myself. I had a cousin...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know! Cyril Matv\xc3\xa9ich... but he is old.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was not always old. But this is what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nhave a talk with Bor\xc3\xads. He need not come so often....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, if he likes to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I know it will end in nothing....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you know? No, Mamma, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to him! What nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Nat\xc3\xa1sha in the tone of one being deprived of her property.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha smiled and looked at her mother. \xe2\x80\x9cNot to marry, but\njust so,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so, my pet?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need for me to marry him. But... just so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so, just so,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the countess, and shaking all over, she\nwent off into a good humored, unexpected, elderly laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re shaking the whole\nbed! You\xe2\x80\x99re awfully like me, just such another giggler.... Wait...\xe2\x80\x9d\nand she seized the countess\xe2\x80\x99 hands and kissed a knuckle of the little\nfinger, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cJune,\xe2\x80\x9d and continued, kissing, \xe2\x80\x9cJuly, August,\xe2\x80\x9d\non the other hand. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mamma, is he very much in love? What do you\nthink? Was anybody ever so much in love with you? And he\xe2\x80\x99s very nice,\nvery, very nice. Only not quite my taste\xe2\x80\x94he is so narrow, like the\ndining-room clock.... Don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand? Narrow, you know\xe2\x80\x94gray,\nlight gray...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat rubbish you\xe2\x80\x99re talking!\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha continued: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you really understand? Nicholas would\nunderstand.... Bez\xc3\xbakhov, now, is blue, dark-blue and red, and he is\nsquare.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou flirt with him too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he is a Freemason, I have found out. He is fine, dark-blue and\nred.... How can I explain it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle countess!\xe2\x80\x9d the count\xe2\x80\x99s voice called from behind the door.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha jumped up, snatched up her slippers,\nand ran barefoot to her own room.\n\nIt was a long time before she could sleep. She kept thinking that no one\ncould understand all that she understood and all there was in her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little\nkitten with her enormous plait of hair. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, how could she? She\xe2\x80\x99s\nvirtuous. She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know\nanything more. Even Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how\nclever I am and how... charming she is,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, speaking\nof herself in the third person, and imagining it was some very wise\nman\xe2\x80\x94the wisest and best of men\xe2\x80\x94who was saying it of her. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\nis everything, everything in her,\xe2\x80\x9d continued this man. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\nunusually intelligent, charming... and then she is pretty, uncommonly\npretty, and agile\xe2\x80\x94she swims and rides splendidly... and her voice! One\ncan really say it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful voice!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini, threw herself\non her bed, laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately\nfall asleep, called Duny\xc3\xa1sha the maid to put out the candle, and before\nDuny\xc3\xa1sha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier\nworld of dreams, where everything was as light and beautiful as in\nreality, and even more so because it was different.\n\nNext day the countess called Bor\xc3\xads aside and had a talk with him, after\nwhich he ceased coming to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nOn the thirty-first of December, New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, 1809 - 10 an old\ngrandee of Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s day was giving a ball and midnight supper. The\ndiplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present.\n\nThe grandee\xe2\x80\x99s well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered with\ninnumerable lights. Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance\nwhich was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but dozens of\npolice officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch.\nCarriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving, with red-liveried\nfootmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the carriages emerged men\nwearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while ladies in satin and ermine\ncautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them\nwith a clatter, and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize\nat the entrance.\n\nAlmost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the\ncrowd and caps were doffed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor?... No, a minister... prince... ambassador. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\nsee the plumes?...\xe2\x80\x9d was whispered among the crowd.\n\nOne person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone and\nmentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.\n\nA third of the visitors had already arrived, but the Rost\xc3\xb3vs, who were\nto be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.\n\nThere had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the\nRost\xc3\xb3v family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive, that\nthe dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be arranged\nas it should be.\n\nM\xc3\xa1rya Ign\xc3\xa1tevna Per\xc3\xb3nskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at\nthe court of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation of the\ncountess and piloted the provincial Rost\xc3\xb3vs in Petersburg high society,\nwas to accompany them to the ball.\n\nThey were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were\nnot yet dressed.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight that\nmorning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day. All\nher powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they\nall\xe2\x80\x94she herself, Mamma, and S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x94should be as well dressed as\npossible. S\xc3\xb3nya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands.\nThe countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and the two\ngirls white gauze over pink silk slips, with roses on their bodices and\ntheir hair dressed \xc3\xa0 la grecque.\n\nEverything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, and\nears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork\nsilk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the\nhairdressing was almost done. S\xc3\xb3nya was finishing dressing and so was\nthe countess, but Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who had bustled about helping them all, was\nbehindhand. She was still sitting before a looking-glass with a dressing\njacket thrown over her slender shoulders. S\xc3\xb3nya stood ready dressed in\nthe middle of the room and, pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her\ndainty finger, was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went\nthrough it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the way, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the way, S\xc3\xb3nya!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nturning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the\nmaid who was dressing it had not time to release. \xe2\x80\x9cThat bow is not\nright. Come here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya sat down and Nat\xc3\xa1sha pinned the ribbon on differently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me, Miss! I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maid who was\nholding Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear! Well then, wait. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, S\xc3\xb3nya.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you ready? It is nearly ten,\xe2\x80\x9d came the countess\xe2\x80\x99 voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirectly! Directly! And you, Mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only my cap to pin on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do it without me!\xe2\x80\x9d called Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t do it\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s already ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey had decided to be at the ball by half-past ten, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha had\nstill to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.\n\nWhen her hair was done, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, in her short petticoat from under\nwhich her dancing shoes showed, and in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s dressing jacket,\nran up to S\xc3\xb3nya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her mother. Turning\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s head this way and that, she fastened on the cap and,\nhurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were turning\nup the hem of her skirt.\n\nThe cause of the delay was Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s skirt, which was too long.\nTwo maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of\nthread. A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the\ncountess and S\xc3\xb3nya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment\nup high on one uplifted hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1vra, quicker, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me my thimble, Miss, from there...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever will you be ready?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the count coming to the door.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is some scent. Per\xc3\xb3nskaya must be tired of waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ready, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maid, holding up the shortened gauze\ndress with two fingers, and blowing and shaking something off it, as if\nby this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what\nshe held.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha began putting on the dress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a minute! In a minute! Don\xe2\x80\x99t come in, Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried to her\nfather as he opened the door\xe2\x80\x94speaking from under the filmy skirt which\nstill covered her whole face.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count in. He was\nwearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and was perfumed\nand his hair pomaded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha, as she\nstood in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Miss! allow me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maid, who on her knees was\npulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her\nmouth to the other with her tongue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay what you like,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed S\xc3\xb3nya, in a despairing voice as she\nlooked at Nat\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9csay what you like, it\xe2\x80\x99s still too long.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. The dress\nwas too long.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, madam, it is not at all too long,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1vra, crawling on\nher knees after her young lady.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if it\xe2\x80\x99s too long we\xe2\x80\x99ll tack it up... we\xe2\x80\x99ll tack it up\nin one minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the resolute Duny\xc3\xa1sha taking a needle that was\nstuck on the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor,\nset to work once more.\n\nAt that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in her cap\nand velvet gown.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOo-oo, my beauty!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the count, \xe2\x80\x9cshe looks better than\nany of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside fearing to\nbe rumpled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, your cap, more to this side,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\narrange it,\xe2\x80\x9d and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking\nup her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn\noff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my fault!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, I\xe2\x80\x99ll run it up, it won\xe2\x80\x99t show,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duny\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beauty\xe2\x80\x94a very queen!\xe2\x80\x9d said the nurse as she came to the\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd S\xc3\xb3nya! They are lovely!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started.\nBut they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.\n\nPer\xc3\xb3nskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness she\nhad gone through the same process as the Rost\xc3\xb3vs, but with less\nflurry\xe2\x80\x94for to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was\nwashed, perfumed, and powdered in just the same way. She had washed\nbehind her ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing\nroom in her yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her old\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99\nservants had been.\n\nShe praised the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 toilets. They praised her taste and toilet,\nand at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, careful of their coiffures and dresses, they\nsettled themselves in their carriages and drove off.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once\nhad time to think of what lay before her.\n\nIn the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage, she\nfor the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at\nthe ball, in those brightly lighted rooms\xe2\x80\x94with music, flowers, dances,\nthe Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg. The\nprospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true,\nso out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the\ncarriage. She understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping\nover the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off her\nfur cloak, and, beside S\xc3\xb3nya and in front of her mother, mounted the\nbrightly illuminated stairs between the flowers. Only then did she\nremember how she must behave at a ball, and tried to assume the majestic\nair she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion. But,\nfortunately for her, she felt her eyes growing misty, she saw nothing\nclearly, her pulse beat a hundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed\nat her heart. She could not assume that pose, which would have made her\nridiculous, and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying\nwith all her might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that\nbecame her best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering,\nalso talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the\nlanding reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with\ndiamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection\nfrom the others. All was blended into one brilliant procession.\nOn entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices, footsteps, and\ngreetings deafened Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still\nmore. The host and hostess, who had already been standing at the door\nfor half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals,\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharm\xc3\xa9 de vous voir,\xe2\x80\x9d * greeted the Rost\xc3\xb3vs and Per\xc3\xb3nskaya in\nthe same manner.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cDelighted to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her\nblack hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess\xe2\x80\x99 eye\ninvoluntarily rested longer on the slim Nat\xc3\xa1sha. She looked at her\nand gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as\nhostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden, irrecoverable\ndays of her own girlhood and her own first ball. The host also followed\nNat\xc3\xa1sha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.\n\nIn the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting\nthe Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front rows\nof that crowd. Nat\xc3\xa1sha heard and felt that several people were asking\nabout her and looking at her. She realized that those noticing her liked\nher, and this observation helped to calm her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some like ourselves and some worse,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\n\nPer\xc3\xb3nskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people\nat the ball.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly\nhair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Per\xc3\xb3nskaya, indicating H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne who had just entered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\nlovely! She is quite equal to M\xc3\xa1rya Ant\xc3\xb3novna. See how the men, young\nand old, pay court to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 is quite mad about her. But see, those two, though not\ngood-looking, are even more run after.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain\ndaughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a splendid match, a millionairess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Per\xc3\xb3nskaya. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nlook, here come her suitors.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Bez\xc3\xbakhova\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\nindicating a handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them\nwith head erect, looking at something over the heads of the ladies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s handsome, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he? I hear they will marry him to that rich\ngirl. But your cousin, Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y, is also very attentive to her. They\nsay she has millions. Oh yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the French ambassador himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe replied to the countess\xe2\x80\x99 inquiry about Caulaincourt. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks as\nif he were a king! All the same, the French are charming, very charming.\nNo one more charming in society. Ah, here she is! Yes, she is still the\nmost beautiful of them all, our M\xc3\xa1rya Ant\xc3\xb3novna! And how simply she\nis dressed! Lovely! And that stout one in spectacles is the universal\nFreemason,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, indicating Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cPut him beside his wife\nand he looks a regular buffoon!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the crowd\nand nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly as if he\nwere passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through, evidently\nlooking for someone.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nbuffoon,\xe2\x80\x9d as Per\xc3\xb3nskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for\nthem, and for her in particular. He had promised to be at the ball and\nintroduce partners to her.\n\nBut before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, dark\nman of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a window\ntalking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. Nat\xc3\xa1sha at once\nrecognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it was\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski, who seemed to her to have grown much younger, happier, and\nbetter-looking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s someone else we know\xe2\x80\x94Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, do you see, Mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Nat\xc3\xa1sha, pointing out Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember, he stayed a\nnight with us at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Per\xc3\xb3nskaya. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear him. Il fait\n\xc3\xa0 pr\xc3\xa9sent la pluie et le beau temps. * He\xe2\x80\x99s too proud for anything.\nTakes after his father. And he\xe2\x80\x99s hand in glove with Sper\xc3\xa1nski,\nwriting some project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies!\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s one talking to him and he has turned away,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\npointing at him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give it to him if he treated me as he does\nthose ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cHe is all the rage just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nSuddenly everybody stirred, began talking, and pressed forward and then\nback, and between the two rows, which separated, the Emperor entered to\nthe sounds of music that had immediately struck up. Behind him walked\nhis host and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bowing to right and left\nas if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over. The band\nplayed the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that\nhad been set to it, beginning: \xe2\x80\x9cAlexander, Elisaveta, all our hearts\nyou ravish quite...\xe2\x80\x9d The Emperor passed on to the drawing room, the\ncrowd made a rush for the doors, and several persons with excited faces\nhurried there and back again. Then the crowd hastily retired from\nthe drawing room door, at which the Emperor reappeared talking to the\nhostess. A young man, looking distraught, pounced down on the ladies,\nasking them to move aside. Some ladies, with faces betraying complete\nforgetfulness of all the rules of decorum, pushed forward to the\ndetriment of their toilets. The men began to choose partners and take\ntheir places for the polonaise.\n\nEveryone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing\nroom leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the\nmusic. The host followed with M\xc3\xa1rya Ant\xc3\xb3novna Nar\xc3\xbdshkina; then\ncame ambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom Per\xc3\xb3nskaya\ndiligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners\nand were taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the\npolonaise. Nat\xc3\xa1sha felt that she would be left with her mother and\nS\xc3\xb3nya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, not having\nbeen invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms hanging down,\nher scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly, and with\nbated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight before\nher, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. She was\nnot concerned about the Emperor or any of those great people whom\nPer\xc3\xb3nskaya was pointing out\xe2\x80\x94she had but one thought: \xe2\x80\x9cIs it\npossible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among the first to\ndance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me?\nThey do not even seem to see me, or if they do they look as if they\nwere saying, \xe2\x80\x98Ah, she\xe2\x80\x99s not the one I\xe2\x80\x99m after, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth\nlooking at her!\xe2\x80\x99 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThey must\nknow how I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would\nenjoy dancing with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable\ntime, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s ears.\nShe wanted to cry. Per\xc3\xb3nskaya had left them. The count was at the\nother end of the room. She and the countess and S\xc3\xb3nya were standing by\nthemselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers,\nwith no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone. Prince Andrew\nwith a lady passed by, evidently not recognizing them. The handsome\nAnatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at\nNat\xc3\xa1sha as one looks at a wall. Bor\xc3\xads passed them twice and each time\nturned away. Berg and his wife, who were not dancing, came up to them.\n\nThis family gathering seemed humiliating to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x94as if there were\nnowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did not\nlisten to or look at V\xc3\xa9ra, who was telling her something about her own\ngreen dress.\n\nAt last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced\nwith three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they\nwere already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the\ndistinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The Emperor\nlooked smilingly down the room. A minute passed but no one had yet begun\ndancing. An aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went up to Countess\nBez\xc3\xbakhova and asked her to dance. She smilingly raised her hand and\nlaid it on his shoulder without looking at him. The aide-de-camp, an\nadept in his art, grasping his partner firmly round her waist, with\nconfident deliberation started smoothly, gliding first round the edge of\nthe circle, then at the corner of the room he caught H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s\nleft hand and turned her, the only sound audible, apart from the\never-quickening music, being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his\nrapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his partner\xe2\x80\x99s velvet\ndress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\ngazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was\ndancing that first turn of the waltz.\n\nPrince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing\nstockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in the\nfront row of the circle not far from the Rost\xc3\xb3vs. Baron Firhoff was\ntalking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State to be\nheld next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely connected with Sper\xc3\xa1nski\nand participating in the work of the legislative commission, could give\nreliable information about that sitting, concerning which various rumors\nwere current. But not listening to what Firhoff was saying, he was\ngazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who\nhad not yet gathered courage to enter the circle.\n\nPrince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\npresence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to\ndance.\n\nPierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always dance. I have a prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e, the young Rost\xc3\xb3va, here. Ask\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning\nto the baron, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will finish this conversation elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94at a ball\none must dance.\xe2\x80\x9d He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated.\nThe despairing, dejected expression of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face caught his eye.\nHe recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her d\xc3\xa9but,\nremembered her conversation at the window, and with an expression of\npleasure on his face approached Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to introduce you to my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, with\nheightened color.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess\nremembers me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite\nbelying Per\xc3\xb3nskaya\xe2\x80\x99s remarks about his rudeness, and approaching\nNat\xc3\xa1sha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed\nhis invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly\nbrightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have long been waiting for you,\xe2\x80\x9d that frightened happy little\ngirl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as\nshe raised her hand to Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. They were the second\ncouple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of\nhis day and Nat\xc3\xa1sha danced exquisitely. Her little feet in their white\nsatin dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly, and independently\nof herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness. Her slender\nbare arms and neck were not beautiful\xe2\x80\x94compared to H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s her\nshoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne seemed, as\nit were, hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had\nscanned her person, while Nat\xc3\xa1sha was like a girl exposed for the first\ntime, who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured\nthat this was absolutely necessary.\n\nPrince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly as\npossible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed\nto him, wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked,\ncaused by the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s presence, he danced, and had chosen Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nbecause Pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first\npretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely had he embraced that\nslender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling\nso near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head, and he\nfelt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood\nbreathing deeply and watching the other dancers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAfter Prince Andrew, Bor\xc3\xads came up to ask Nat\xc3\xa1sha for a dance, and\nthen the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball, and several other young\nmen, so that, flushed and happy, and passing on her superfluous partners\nto S\xc3\xb3nya, she did not cease dancing all the evening. She noticed and\nsaw nothing of what occupied everyone else. Not only did she fail to\nnotice that the Emperor talked a long time with the French ambassador,\nand how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or that Prince\nSo-and-so and So-and-so did and said this and that, and that H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\nhad great success and was honored by the special attention of So-and-so,\nbut she did not even see the Emperor, and only noticed that he had gone\nbecause the ball became livelier after his departure. For one of the\nmerry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again her partner. He\nreminded her of their first encounter in the Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe avenue, and how\nshe had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, and told her how he\nhad involuntarily overheard her. Nat\xc3\xa1sha blushed at that recollection\nand tried to excuse herself, as if there had been something to be\nashamed of in what Prince Andrew had overheard.\n\nLike all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked meeting\nsomeone there not of the conventional society stamp. And such was\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and even her\nmistakes in speaking French. With her he behaved with special care and\ntenderness, sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most\nunimportant matters; he admired her shy grace. In the middle of the\ncotillion, having completed one of the figures, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, still out of\nbreath, was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her. She was\ntired and panting and evidently thought of declining, but immediately\nput her hand gaily on the man\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, smiling at Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to sit beside you and rest: I\xe2\x80\x99m tired; but you see\nhow they keep asking me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of it, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy and I love\neverybody, and you and I understand it all,\xe2\x80\x9d and much, much more was\nsaid in her smile. When her partner left her Nat\xc3\xa1sha ran across the\nroom to choose two ladies for the figure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she will be\nmy wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise, as\nhe watched her. She did go first to her cousin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat rubbish sometimes enters one\xe2\x80\x99s head!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew,\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original,\nthat she won\xe2\x80\x99t be dancing here a month before she will be married....\nSuch as she are rare here,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, as Nat\xc3\xa1sha, readjusting a\nrose that was slipping on her bodice, settled herself beside him.\n\nWhen the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to\nthe dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and asked\nhis daughter whether she was enjoying herself. Nat\xc3\xa1sha did not answer\nat once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\ncan you ask such a question?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never enjoyed myself so much before!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and Prince\nAndrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her\nfather and instantly dropped again. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was happier than she had\never been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one becomes\ncompletely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of\nevil, unhappiness, or sorrow.\n\nAt that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position\nhis wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and absent-minded. A\ndeep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing by a window he stared\nover his spectacles seeing no one.\n\nOn her way to supper Nat\xc3\xa1sha passed him.\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of him.\nShe wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of her own\nhappiness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow delightful it is, Count!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am very glad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can people be dissatisfied with anything?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially such a capital fellow as Bez\xc3\xbakhov!\xe2\x80\x9d In Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\neyes all the people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid\npeople, loving one another; none of them capable of injuring\nanother\xe2\x80\x94and so they ought all to be happy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nNext day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not dwell\non it long. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was a very brilliant ball,\xe2\x80\x9d and then... \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nthat little Rost\xc3\xb3va is very charming. There\xe2\x80\x99s something fresh,\noriginal, un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.\xe2\x80\x9d That\nwas all he thought about yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s ball, and after his morning tea\nhe set to work.\n\nBut either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for work\nand could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own work, as he\noften did, and was glad when he heard someone coming.\n\nThe visitor was B\xc3\xadtski, who served on various committees, frequented\nall the societies in Petersburg, and was a passionate devotee of the new\nideas and of Sper\xc3\xa1nski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger\xe2\x80\x94one of\nthose men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to\nthe fashion, but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest\npartisans. Hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince\nAndrew\xe2\x80\x99s room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking. He\nhad just heard particulars of that morning\xe2\x80\x99s sitting of the Council\nof State opened by the Emperor, and he spoke of it enthusiastically. The\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s speech had been extraordinary. It had been a speech such as\nonly constitutional monarchs deliver. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sovereign plainly said\nthat the Council and Senate are estates of the realm, he said that the\ngovernment must rest not on authority but on secure bases. The Emperor\nsaid that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts\npublished,\xe2\x80\x9d recounted B\xc3\xadtski, emphasizing certain words and opening\nhis eyes significantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes! Today\xe2\x80\x99s events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our\nhistory,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\n\nPrince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of\nState, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached\nsuch importance, and was surprised that this event, now that it had\ntaken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite insignificant. He\nlistened with quiet irony to B\xc3\xadtski\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiastic account of it. A\nvery simple thought occurred to him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter to me or to\nB\xc3\xadtski what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that\nmake me any happier or better?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince\nAndrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to dine that\nevening at Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cwith only a few friends,\xe2\x80\x9d as the host\nhad said when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the intimate\nhome circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince\nAndrew, especially as he had not yet seen Sper\xc3\xa1nski in his domestic\nsurroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go to it.\n\nAt the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house Sper\xc3\xa1nski\nowned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room of this small\nhouse, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting that of a\nmonastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the friendly\ngathering of Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s intimate acquaintances already assembled\nat five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. There were no ladies present except Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s\nlittle daughter (long-faced like her father) and her governess. The\nother guests were Gervais, Magn\xc3\xadtski, and Stol\xc3\xbdpin. While still in\nthe anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato\nlaugh\xe2\x80\x94a laugh such as one hears on the stage. Someone\xe2\x80\x94it sounded\nlike Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x94was distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew\nhad never before heard Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s famous laugh, and this ringing,\nhigh-pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him.\n\nHe entered the dining room. The whole company were standing between two\nwindows at a small table laid with hors-d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvres. Sper\xc3\xa1nski, wearing\na gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still\nthe same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of\nthe Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance. His\nguests surrounded him. Magn\xc3\xadtski, addressing himself to Sper\xc3\xa1nski,\nwas relating an anecdote, and Sper\xc3\xa1nski was laughing in advance at\nwhat Magn\xc3\xadtski was going to say. When Prince Andrew entered the room\nMagn\xc3\xadtski\xe2\x80\x99s words were again crowned by laughter. Stol\xc3\xbdpin gave\na deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais\nlaughed softly with a hissing chuckle, and Sper\xc3\xa1nski in a high-pitched\nstaccato manner.\n\nStill laughing, Sper\xc3\xa1nski held out his soft white hand to Prince\nAndrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery pleased to see you, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne moment...\xe2\x80\x9d he\nwent on, turning to Magn\xc3\xadtski and interrupting his story. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have\nagreed that this is a dinner for recreation, with not a word about\nbusiness!\xe2\x80\x9d and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh.\n\nPrince Andrew looked at the laughing Sper\xc3\xa1nski with astonishment,\nregret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not\nSper\xc3\xa1nski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared\nmysterious and fascinating in Sper\xc3\xa1nski suddenly became plain and\nunattractive.\n\nAt dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to\nconsist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before Magn\xc3\xadtski\nhad finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something\nstill funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state\nservice, related to people in the service. It seemed that in this\ncompany the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted\nthat the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored\nridicule. Sper\xc3\xa1nski related how at the Council that morning a deaf\ndignitary, when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so too.\nGervais gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable for the\nstupidity of everybody concerned. Stol\xc3\xbdpin, stuttering, broke into\nthe conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed\nunder the former order of things\xe2\x80\x94threatening to give a serious turn\nto the conversation. Magn\xc3\xadtski starting quizzing Stol\xc3\xbdpin about his\nvehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its\nformer lively tone.\n\nEvidently Sper\xc3\xa1nski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement\nin a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his wish, tried\nto enliven him and amuse themselves. But their gaiety seemed to Prince\nAndrew mirthless and tiresome. Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s high-pitched voice struck\nhim unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false\nnote. Prince Andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper\non the spirits of the company, but no one took any notice of his being\nout of harmony with the general mood. They all seemed very gay.\n\nHe tried several times to join in the conversation, but his remarks were\ntossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could\nnot jest with them.\n\nThere was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was witty and\nmight have been funny, but it lacked just that something which is the\nsalt of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a thing existed.\n\nAfter dinner Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x99s daughter and her governess rose. He patted\nthe little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that gesture,\ntoo, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.\n\nThe men remained at table over their port\xe2\x80\x94English fashion. In the\nmidst of a conversation that was started about Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s Spanish\naffairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to\nexpress a contrary opinion. Sper\xc3\xa1nski smiled and, with an evident wish\nto prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a\nstory that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few\nmoments all were silent.\n\nHaving sat some time at table, Sper\xc3\xa1nski corked a bottle of wine and,\nremarking, \xe2\x80\x9cNowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,\xe2\x80\x9d passed\nit to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly\nwent into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed\nto Sper\xc3\xa1nski and he took them to his study. As soon as he had left\nthe room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse\nsensibly and quietly with one another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for the recitation!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sper\xc3\xa1nski on returning from\nhis study. \xe2\x80\x9cA wonderful talent!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Prince Andrew, and\nMagn\xc3\xadtski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous\nverses in French which he had composed about various well-known\nPetersburg people. He was interrupted several times by applause. When\nthe verses were finished Prince Andrew went up to Sper\xc3\xa1nski and took\nhis leave.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you off to so early?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sper\xc3\xa1nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promised to go to a reception.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike,\nimpenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have\nexpected anything from Sper\xc3\xa1nski and from any of his own activities\nconnected with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what\nSper\xc3\xa1nski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang in Prince\nAndrew\xe2\x80\x99s ears long after he had left the house.\n\nWhen he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in\nPetersburg during those last four months as if it were something new. He\nrecalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of his project\nof army reform, which had been accepted for consideration and which they\nwere trying to pass over in silence simply because another, a very poor\none, had already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor. He thought\nof the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member. He remembered\nhow carefully and at what length everything relating to form and\nprocedure was discussed at those meetings, and how sedulously and\npromptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded. He\nrecalled his labors on the Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had\ntranslated the articles of the Roman and French codes into Russian,\nand he felt ashamed of himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself\nBoguch\xc3\xa1rovo, his occupations in the country, his journey to Ryaz\xc3\xa1n;\nhe remembered the peasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally\napplying to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he\nfelt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless\nwork.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nNext day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before,\nand among them at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 with whom he had renewed acquaintance\nat the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the\ncall, he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left such a\npleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a dark-blue\nhouse dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in\nher ball dress. She and all the Rost\xc3\xb3v family welcomed him as an old\nfriend, simply and cordially. The whole family, whom he had formerly\njudged severely, now seemed to him to consist of excellent, simple,\nand kindly people. The old count\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality and good nature, which\nstruck one especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise, were such\nthat Prince Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are capital people, who of course have not the\nslightest idea what a treasure they possess in Nat\xc3\xa1sha; but they are\nkindly folk and form the best possible setting for this strikingly\npoetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn Nat\xc3\xa1sha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely\nalien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world,\nthat in the Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night\nhad already begun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no\nlonger and was no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered it\nfound in it a new enjoyment.\n\nAfter dinner Nat\xc3\xa1sha, at Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s request, went to the\nclavichord and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window talking\nto the ladies and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he ceased\nspeaking and suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had thought\nimpossible for him. He looked at Nat\xc3\xa1sha as she sang, and something new\nand joyful stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the same time sad.\nHe had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep. What\nabout? His former love? The little princess? His disillusionments?...\nHis hopes for the future?... Yes and no. The chief reason was a sudden,\nvivid sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great\nand illimitable within him and that limited and material something that\nhe, and even she, was. This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him\nwhile she sang.\n\nAs soon as Nat\xc3\xa1sha had finished she went up to him and asked how he\nliked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling that\nshe ought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and said he\nliked her singing as he liked everything she did.\n\nPrince Andrew left the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 late in the evening. He went to bed\nfrom habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having lit his\ncandle he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay down again not at all\ntroubled by his sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he\nhad stepped out of a stuffy room into God\xe2\x80\x99s own fresh air. It did not\nenter his head that he was in love with Nat\xc3\xa1sha; he was not thinking\nabout her, but only picturing her to himself, and in consequence all\nlife appeared in a new light. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do I strive, why do I toil in this\nnarrow, confined frame, when life, all life with all its joys, is open\nto me?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself. And for the first time for a very long\nwhile he began making happy plans for the future. He decided that he\nmust attend to his son\xe2\x80\x99s education by finding a tutor and putting\nthe boy in his charge, then he ought to retire from the service and go\nabroad, and see England, Switzerland and Italy. \xe2\x80\x9cI must use my freedom\nwhile I feel so much strength and youth in me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPierre was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of\nhappiness in order to be happy, and now I do believe in it. Let the dead\nbury their dead, but while one has life one must live and be happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought he.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nOne morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in\nMoscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an immaculate\nbrand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his\ntemples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately she\ncould not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more fortunate\nwith you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count\xe2\x80\x9d (Berg said\nthis with perfect conviction that this information could not but be\nagreeable), \xe2\x80\x9cand so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own\nand my wife\xe2\x80\x99s friends.\xe2\x80\x9d (He smiled still more pleasantly.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea\nand to supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOnly Countess H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, considering the society of such people as the\nBergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation.\nBerg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small\nbut select company, and why this would give him pleasure, and why though\nhe grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful, he was prepared\nto run into some expense for the sake of good society\xe2\x80\x94that Pierre\ncould not refuse, and promised to come.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten\nminutes to eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is\ncoming. He is very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you will\ndo me the favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nContrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the\nBergs\xe2\x80\x99 house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.\n\nHaving prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were ready\nfor their guests\xe2\x80\x99 arrival.\n\nIn their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and pictures\nand new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely buttoned up in\nhis new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always\ncould and should be acquainted with people above one, because only then\ndoes one get satisfaction from acquaintances.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I\nmanaged from my first promotion.\xe2\x80\x9d (Berg measured his life not by years\nbut by promotions.) \xe2\x80\x9cMy comrades are still nobodies, while I am only\nwaiting for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to\nbe your husband.\xe2\x80\x9d (He rose and kissed V\xc3\xa9ra\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and on the way\nto her straightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nhow have I obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my\naquaintances. It goes without saying that one must be conscientious and\nmethodical.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBerg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and\npaused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak\nwoman who could not understand all that constitutes a man\xe2\x80\x99s dignity,\nwhat it was ein Mann zu sein. * V\xc3\xa9ra at the same time smiling with a\nsense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the\nsame understood life wrongly, as according to V\xc3\xa9ra all men did. Berg,\njudging by his wife, thought all women weak and foolish. V\xc3\xa9ra, judging\nonly by her husband and generalizing from that observation, supposed\nthat all men, though they understand nothing and are conceited and\nselfish, ascribe common sense to themselves alone.\n\n    * To be a man.\n\nBerg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her lace\nfichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on the\nlips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing is, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t have children too soon,\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncontinued, following an unconscious sequence of ideas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered V\xc3\xa9ra, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t at all want that. We must live\nfor society.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Yus\xc3\xbapova wore one exactly like this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg, pointing\nto the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.\n\nJust then Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced at one\nanother, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally claiming\nthe honor of this visit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nBerg. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut please don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid V\xc3\xa9ra, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I know what interests each of them and what to\nsay to different people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBerg smiled again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped: men must sometimes have masculine\nconversation,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nThey received Pierre in their small, new drawing room, where it was\nimpossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry,\nneatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that\nBerg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair\nor of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently painfully\nundecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor to settle\nthe question of selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a\nchair for himself, and Berg and V\xc3\xa9ra immediately began their evening\nparty, interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their\nguest.\n\nV\xc3\xa9ra, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be\nentertained with conversation about the French embassy, at once began\naccordingly. Berg, having decided that masculine conversation was\nrequired, interrupted his wife\xe2\x80\x99s remarks and touched on the question\nof the war with Austria, and unconsciously jumped from the general\nsubject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take\npart in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them.\nThough the conversation was very incoherent and V\xc3\xa9ra was angry at the\nintrusion of the masculine element, both husband and wife felt with\nsatisfaction that, even if only one guest was present, their evening had\nbegun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party\nwith its talk, tea, and lighted candles.\n\nBefore long Bor\xc3\xads, Berg\xe2\x80\x99s old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of\ncondescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and V\xc3\xa9ra. After\nBor\xc3\xads came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other\nevening parties. Berg and V\xc3\xa9ra could not repress their smiles of\nsatisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room,\nat the sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling of dresses, and the\nbowing and scraping. Everything was just as everybody always has it,\nespecially so the general, who admired the apartment, patted Berg on the\nshoulder, and with parental authority superintended the setting out of\nthe table for boston. The general sat down by Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v, who\nwas next to himself the most important guest. The old people sat with\nthe old, the young with the young, and the hostess at the tea table, on\nwhich stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as\nthe Panins had at their party. Everything was just as it was everywhere\nelse.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nPierre, as one of the principal guests, had to sit down to boston\nwith Count Rost\xc3\xb3v, the general, and the colonel. At the card table he\nhappened to be directly facing Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and was struck by a curious\nchange that had come over her since the ball. She was silent, and not\nonly less pretty than at the ball, but only redeemed from plainness by\nher look of gentle indifference to everything around.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with her?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, glancing at her.\nShe was sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without\nlooking at him, made some reply to Bor\xc3\xads who sat down beside her. After\nplaying out a whole suit and to his partner\xe2\x80\x99s delight taking five\ntricks, Pierre, hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had\nentered the room while he was picking up his tricks, glanced again at\nNat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened to her?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself with still greater\nsurprise.\n\nPrince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her with a\nlook of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was looking up\nat him, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing. And\nthe bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again\nalight in her. She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had\nagain become what she had been at the ball.\n\nPrince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and\nyouthful expression in his friend\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\nPierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now with\nhis back to Nat\xc3\xa1sha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six\nrubbers he watched her and his friend.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething very important is happening between them,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nPierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and\nmade him neglect the game.\n\nAfter six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing\nlike that, and Pierre was released. Nat\xc3\xa1sha on one side was talking\nwith S\xc3\xb3nya and Bor\xc3\xads, and V\xc3\xa9ra with a subtle smile was saying\nsomething to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking\nwhether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them. V\xc3\xa9ra, having\nnoticed Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s attentions to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, decided that at a\nparty, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were\nabsolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone,\nbegan a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her\nsister. With so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to\nbe, she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact.\n\nWhen Pierre went up to them he noticed that V\xc3\xa9ra was being carried away\nby her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a\nthing that rarely happened with him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d V\xc3\xa9ra was saying with an arch smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\nso discerning, Prince, and understand people\xe2\x80\x99s characters so well at\na glance. What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her\nattachments? Could she, like other women\xe2\x80\x9d (V\xc3\xa9ra meant herself),\n\xe2\x80\x9clove a man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is what\nI consider true love. What do you think, Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your sister too little,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew, with a\nsarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, \xe2\x80\x9cto\nbe able to solve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed that\nthe less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added, and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is true, Prince. In our days,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\nV\xc3\xa9ra\xe2\x80\x94mentioning \xe2\x80\x9cour days\xe2\x80\x9d as people of limited intelligence are\nfond of doing, imagining that they have discovered and appraised the\npeculiarities of \xe2\x80\x9cour days\xe2\x80\x9d and that human characteristics change\nwith the times\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cin our days a girl has so much freedom that the\npleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in her. And it must\nbe confessed that Natalie is very susceptible.\xe2\x80\x9d This return to\nthe subject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew to knit his brows with\ndiscomfort: he was about to rise, but V\xc3\xa9ra continued with a still more\nsubtle smile:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think no one has been more courted than she,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\ntill quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you know,\nCount,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9ceven our dear cousin Bor\xc3\xads, who,\nbetween ourselves, was very far gone in the land of tenderness...\xe2\x80\x9d\n(alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time).\n\nPrince Andrew frowned and remained silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are friendly with Bor\xc3\xads, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked V\xc3\xa9ra.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know him....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect he has told you of his childish love for Nat\xc3\xa1sha?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there was childish love?\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly asked Prince Andrew,\nblushing unexpectedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love. Le\ncousinage est un dangereux voisinage. * Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cCousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, undoubtedly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural\nliveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful\nwith his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these\njesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre, seeing his friend\xe2\x80\x99s strange animation with\nsurprise, and noticing the glance he turned on Nat\xc3\xa1sha as he rose.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must... I must have a talk with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nknow that pair of women\xe2\x80\x99s gloves?\xe2\x80\x9d (He referred to the Masonic\ngloves given to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he\nloved.) \xe2\x80\x9cI... but no, I will talk to you later on,\xe2\x80\x9d and with a\nstrange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements, Prince\nAndrew approached Nat\xc3\xa1sha and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how\nPrince Andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied.\n\nBut at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he\nshould take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on\nthe affairs in Spain.\n\nBerg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never left his face.\nThe party was very successful and quite like other parties he had\nseen. Everything was similar: the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 subtle talk, the cards, the\ngeneral raising his voice at the card table, and the samovar and the tea\ncakes; only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening\nparties he wished to imitate. They had not yet had a loud conversation\namong the men and a dispute about something important and clever. Now\nthe general had begun such a discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nNext day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew dined with the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs and spent the rest of the day there.\n\nEveryone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came, and\nwithout concealing it he tried to be with Nat\xc3\xa1sha all day. Not only in\nthe soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Nat\xc3\xa1sha, but in the\nwhole house, there was a feeling of awe at something important that was\nbound to happen. The countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes\nat Prince Andrew when he talked to Nat\xc3\xa1sha and timidly started some\nartificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way.\nS\xc3\xb3nya was afraid to leave Nat\xc3\xa1sha and afraid of being in the way when\nshe was with them. Nat\xc3\xa1sha grew pale, in a panic of expectation, when\nshe remained alone with him for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by\nhis timidity. She felt that he wanted to say something to her but could\nnot bring himself to do so.\n\nIn the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! For heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me anything now! One can\xe2\x80\x99t\ntalk about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nBut all the same that night Nat\xc3\xa1sha, now agitated and now frightened,\nlay a long time in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s bed gazing straight before her. She\ntold her how he had complimented her, how he told her he was going\nabroad, asked her where they were going to spend the summer, and then\nhow he had asked her about Bor\xc3\xads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut such a... such a... never happened to me before!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly I feel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when I\xe2\x80\x99m\nwith him. What does that mean? Does it mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s the real thing?\nYes? Mamma, are you asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my love; I am frightened myself,\xe2\x80\x9d answered her mother. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\ngo!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same I shan\xe2\x80\x99t sleep. What silliness, to sleep! Mummy!\nMummy! such a thing never happened to me before,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, surprised\nand alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd could we\never have thought!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt seemed to Nat\xc3\xa1sha that even at the time she first saw Prince Andrew\nat Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she feared\nthis strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had\nthen chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding\nhim, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg\nwhile we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that\nball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this!\nAlready then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew\nhad written in Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s album.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Nat\xc3\xa1sha! Pray to God. \xe2\x80\x98Marriages are made in\nheaven,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\nshedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.\n\nAt that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him\nof his love for Nat\xc3\xa1sha and his firm resolve to make her his wife.\n\nThat day Countess H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne had a reception at her house. The French\nambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of\nlate become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies and\ngentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the rooms and\nstruck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and morose air.\n\nSince the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression\nand had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the intimacy of\nhis wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly been made a\ngentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he had begun to feel\noppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark thoughts of the vanity\nof all things human came to him oftener than before. At the same time\nthe feeling he had noticed between his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Prince\nAndrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position\nand his friend\xe2\x80\x99s. He tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife,\nand about Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Prince Andrew; and again everything seemed to him\ninsignificant in comparison with eternity; again the question: for what?\npresented itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at Masonic\nlabors, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward\nmidnight, after he had left the countess\xe2\x80\x99 apartments, he was sitting\nupstairs in a shabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction\nof the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy\nwith tobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, you see, am hard at it.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to his manuscript book\nwith that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy\npeople look at their work.\n\nPrince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life on\nhis face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look,\nsmiled at him with the egotism of joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to tell you about it\nyesterday and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything\nlike it before. I am in love, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on\nthe sofa beside Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Nat\xc3\xa1sha Rost\xc3\xb3va, yes?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it,\nbut the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and\nsuffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in\nthe world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\nlive without her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I? What did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre suddenly, rising and\nbeginning to pace up and down the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI always thought it.... That\ngirl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend,\nI entreat you, don\xe2\x80\x99t philosophize, don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt, marry, marry,\nmarry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier man than you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe loves you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk rubbish...\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking\ninto Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe does, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre cried fiercely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do listen,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the\narm. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to\nsomeone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on, go on. I am very glad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, and his face\nreally changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince\nAndrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a different, quite\na new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for life, his\ndisillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind\nto speak openly; and to him he told all that was in his soul. Now he\nboldly and lightly made plans for an extended future, said he could not\nsacrifice his own happiness to his father\xe2\x80\x99s caprice, and spoke of how\nhe would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her,\nor would do without his consent; then he marveled at the feeling that\nhad mastered him as at something strange, apart from and independent of\nhimself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of\nsuch love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not at all the same feeling\nthat I knew in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into two\nhalves: one half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the\nother half is everything where she is not, and there is all gloom and\ndarkness....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarkness and gloom,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Pierre: \xe2\x80\x9cyes, yes, I understand\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very\nhappy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched\nand sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s lot\nappeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nPrince Andrew needed his father\xe2\x80\x99s consent to his marriage, and to\nobtain this he started for the country next day.\n\nHis father received his son\xe2\x80\x99s communication with external composure,\nbut inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to\nalter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life\nwas already ending. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only they would let me end my days as I want\nto,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cthen they might do as they please.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWith his son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for\nimportant occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole\nmatter.\n\nIn the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards\nbirth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young\nas he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special stress\non this), while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son whom it would\nbe a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl. \xe2\x80\x9cFourthly and finally,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe father said, looking ironically at his son, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you to put it\noff for a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as you wanted to for\na German tutor for Prince Nicholas. Then if your love or passion or\nobstinacy\xe2\x80\x94as you please\xe2\x80\x94is still as great, marry! And that\xe2\x80\x99s my\nlast word on it. Mind, the last...\xe2\x80\x9d concluded the prince, in a tone\nwhich showed that nothing would make him alter his decision.\n\nPrince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings, or\nhis fianc\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x99s, would not stand a year\xe2\x80\x99s test, or that he (the old\nprince himself) would die before then, and he decided to conform to his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s wish\xe2\x80\x94to propose, and postpone the wedding for a year.\n\nThree weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rost\xc3\xb3vs,\nPrince Andrew returned to Petersburg.\n\n\nNext day after her talk with her mother Nat\xc3\xa1sha expected Bolk\xc3\xb3nski all\nday, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the same.\nPierre did not come either and Nat\xc3\xa1sha, not knowing that Prince Andrew\nhad gone to see his father, could not explain his absence to herself.\n\nThree weeks passed in this way. Nat\xc3\xa1sha had no desire to go out\nanywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and\nlistless; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the\nevenings. She blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed to her\nthat everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and\npitying her. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound to her vanity\nintensified her misery.\n\nOnce she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly began\nto cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why\nit is being punished.\n\nThe countess began to soothe Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who after first listening to her\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s words, suddenly interrupted her:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave off, Mamma! I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to think about\nit! He just came and then left off, left off....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went\non quietly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I\nhave now become quite calm, quite calm.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe day after this conversation Nat\xc3\xa1sha put on the old dress which\nshe knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the\nmornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had\nabandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went to\nthe ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud resonance, and\nbegan singing her solfeggio. When she had finished her first exercise\nshe stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that\nparticularly pleased her. She listened joyfully (as though she had not\nexpected it) to the charm of the notes reverberating, filling the\nwhole empty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and all at once she felt\ncheerful. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of making so much of it? Things are nice\nas it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, and she began walking up and down the\nroom, not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with\neach step from the heel to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair\nof shoes) and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of\nthe toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice. Passing a\nmirror she glanced into it. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99s me!\xe2\x80\x9d the expression of\nher face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and very\nnice too! I need nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she\nwould not let him, and having closed the door behind him continued her\nwalk. That morning she had returned to her favorite mood\xe2\x80\x94love of,\nand delight in, herself. \xe2\x80\x9cHow charming that Nat\xc3\xa1sha is!\xe2\x80\x9d she said\nagain, speaking as some third, collective, male person. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty,\na good voice, young, and in nobody\xe2\x80\x99s way if only they leave her in\npeace.\xe2\x80\x9d But however much they left her in peace she could not now be\nat peace, and immediately felt this.\n\nIn the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAt home?\xe2\x80\x9d and\nthen footsteps were heard. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was looking at the mirror, but did\nnot see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When she saw\nherself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for certain, though\nshe hardly heard his voice through the closed doors.\n\nPale and agitated, Nat\xc3\xa1sha ran into the drawing room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! Bolk\xc3\xb3nski has come!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMamma, it is awful, it is\nunbearable! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want... to be tormented? What am I to do?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBefore the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room with\nan agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw Nat\xc3\xa1sha his face\nbrightened. He kissed the countess\xe2\x80\x99 hand and Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s, and sat\ndown beside the sofa.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is long since we had the pleasure...\xe2\x80\x9d began the countess,\nbut Prince Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question,\nobviously in haste to say what he had to.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I only\ngot back last night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said glancing at Nat\xc3\xa1sha; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to have\na talk with you, Countess,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause.\n\nThe countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at your disposal,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so:\nsomething gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared\nstraight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt once? This instant!... No, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\n\nAgain he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she was not\nmistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be decided.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, Nat\xc3\xa1sha! I will call you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess in a whisper.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at\nher mother and went out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come, Countess, to ask for your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Andrew.\n\nThe countess\xe2\x80\x99 face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour offer...\xe2\x80\x9d she began at last sedately. He remained silent,\nlooking into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYour offer...\xe2\x80\x9d (she grew confused) \xe2\x80\x9cis\nagreeable to us, and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband... I\nhope... but it will depend on her....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it to\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and with\na mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his\nforehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him as a\nson, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nam sure my husband will consent,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, \xe2\x80\x9cbut your\nfather...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express\ncondition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a\nyear. And I wished to tell you of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that Nat\xc3\xa1sha is still young, but\xe2\x80\x94so long as that?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unavoidable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew with a sigh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will send her to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, and left the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord have mercy upon us!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated while seeking her daughter.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya said that Nat\xc3\xa1sha was in her bedroom. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was sitting on\nthe bed, pale and dry-eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering\nsomething as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped\nup and flew to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mamma?... Well?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, go to him. He is asking for your hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess,\ncoldly it seemed to Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cGo... go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mother, sadly and\nreproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When she\ncame in and saw him she paused. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that this stranger\nhas now become everything to me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked herself, and immediately\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than\neverything in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast\neyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of\nher face. Her face said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know?\nWhy speak, when words cannot express what one feels?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed\nloudly and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am so happy!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, smiled through her tears, bent\nover closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether\nshe might, and then kissed him.\n\nPrince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find\nin his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly\nchanged; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of\ndesire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear\nat her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of\nthe duty that now bound him to her forever. The present feeling, though\nnot so bright and poetic as the former, was stronger and more serious.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nPrince Andrew, still looking into her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that I\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x98chit of a girl,\xe2\x80\x99 as everybody called\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis it possible that I am now to be the\nwife and the equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father\nlooks up to? Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no\nmore playing with life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies\na responsibility for my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he ask\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, but she had not understood his question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you are so young, and I have already\nbeen through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to\ntake in the meaning of his words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHard as this year which delays my happiness will be,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\nPrince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cit will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask\nyou to make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall\nremain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or should\nyou come to love...\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha interrupted him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that\nfrom the very day you first came to Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe I have loved you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\ncried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a year you will learn to know yourself....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA whole year!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that\nthe marriage was to be postponed for a year. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why a year? Why a\nyear?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not hear him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can\xe2\x80\x99t it be helped?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply,\nbut his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awful! Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s awful! awful!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha suddenly cried,\nand again burst into sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall die, waiting a year: it\xe2\x80\x99s\nimpossible, it\xe2\x80\x99s awful!\xe2\x80\x9d She looked into her lover\xe2\x80\x99s face and saw\nin it a look of commiseration and perplexity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly checking her tears.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple\ntheir blessing.\n\nFrom that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 as\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s affianced lover.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nNo betrothal ceremony took place and Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s engagement to\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said\nthat as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole\nburden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself forever, but\nthat he did not wish to bind Nat\xc3\xa1sha and gave her perfect freedom. If\nafter six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full\nright to reject him. Naturally neither Nat\xc3\xa1sha nor her parents wished\nto hear of this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He came every day to the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99, but did not behave to Nat\xc3\xa1sha as an affianced lover: he\ndid not use the familiar thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her\nhand. After their engagement, quite different, intimate, and natural\nrelations sprang up between them. It was as if they had not known each\nother till now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other\nwhen as yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves\nnow quite different beings: then they were artificial, now natural and\nsincere. At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with\nPrince Andrew; he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time\nNat\xc3\xa1sha trained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them\nall that he only appeared to be different, but was really just like all\nof them, and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be.\nAfter a few days they grew accustomed to him, and without restraint in\nhis presence pursued their usual way of life, in which he took his part.\nHe could talk about rural economy with the count, fashions with the\ncountess and Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and about albums and fancywork with S\xc3\xb3nya.\nSometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence\nexpressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the evident\nomens there had been of it: Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s coming to Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe and\ntheir coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Prince\nAndrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\nencounter with Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents betokening\nthat it had to be.\n\nIn the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always\naccompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting\ntogether everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and\ngo away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely\nspoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to\nspeak of it. Nat\xc3\xa1sha shared this as she did all his feelings, which she\nconstantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his son. Prince\nAndrew blushed, as he often did now\xe2\x80\x94Nat\xc3\xa1sha particularly liked it in\nhim\xe2\x80\x94and said that his son would not live with them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha in a frightened tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow I should have loved him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, immediately guessing\nhis thought; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding\nfault with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask\nhis advice about P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s education or Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 service. The\nold countess sighed as she looked at them; S\xc3\xb3nya was always getting\nfrightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for\nleaving them alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew\nspoke (he could tell a story very well), Nat\xc3\xa1sha listened to him\nwith pride; when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed\nattentively and scrutinizingly at her. She asked herself in perplexity:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he look for in me? He is trying to discover something by\nlooking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not there?\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes\nshe fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic of her, and\nthen she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew laughed.\nHe seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his\nlaughter, and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nwould have been completely happy if the thought of the separation\nawaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her, just as the mere\nthought of it made him turn pale and cold.\n\nOn the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with\nhim Pierre, who had not been to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 once since the ball.\nPierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the\ncountess, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha sat down beside a little chess table with S\xc3\xb3nya,\nthereby inviting Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have known Bez\xc3\xbakhov a long time?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you like\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s a dear, but very absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of his\nabsent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known him\nfrom childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince\nAndrew said with sudden seriousness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am going away and heaven\nknows what may happen. You may cease to... all right, I know I am not\nto say that. Only this, then: whatever may happen to you when I am not\nhere...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever trouble may come,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg\nyou, Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for\nadvice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but he\nhas a heart of gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNeither her father, nor her mother, nor S\xc3\xb3nya, nor Prince Andrew\nhimself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act\non Nat\xc3\xa1sha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day,\ndry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding\nwhat awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking leave, he kissed\nher hand for the last time. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go!\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a tone\nthat made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he\nremembered long afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone; but\nfor several days she sat in her room dry-eyed, taking no interest in\nanything and only saying now and then, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, why did he go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around\nher, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became\nher old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a\nchild gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nDuring that year after his son\xe2\x80\x99s departure, Prince Nicholas\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s health and temper became much worse. He grew still more\nirritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his\nfrequent fits of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out\nher tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible.\nPrincess Mary had two passions and consequently two joys\xe2\x80\x94her nephew,\nlittle Nicholas, and religion\xe2\x80\x94and these were the favorite subjects\nof the prince\xe2\x80\x99s attacks and ridicule. Whatever was spoken of he would\nbring round to the superstitiousness of old maids, or the petting\nand spoiling of children. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to make him\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94little\nNicholas\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cinto an old maid like yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew\nwants a son and not an old maid,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say. Or, turning to\nMademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s presence\nhow she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them.\n\nHe continually hurt Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s feelings and tormented her, but it\ncost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame toward her, or\ncould her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of it all, be unjust?\nAnd what is justice? The princess never thought of that proud word\n\xe2\x80\x9cjustice.\xe2\x80\x9d All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear\nand simple law\xe2\x80\x94the law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who\nlovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God. What had she to\ndo with the justice or injustice of other people? She had to endure and\nlove, and that she did.\n\nDuring the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay,\ngentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a\nlong time past. She felt that something had happened to him, but he said\nnothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a long talk with\nhis father about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his\ndeparture they were dissatisfied with one another.\n\nSoon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend\nJulie Kar\xc3\xa1gina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream)\nof marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in mourning for her\nown brother, killed in Turkey.\n\nSorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.\n\nYour loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a\nspecial providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your\nexcellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, can\xe2\x80\x94I\nwill not say comfort us\xe2\x80\x94but save us from despair. Religion alone can\nexplain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what\ncause, kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life\xe2\x80\x94not merely\nharming no one but necessary to the happiness of others\xe2\x80\x94are called\naway to God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a\nburden to themselves and to others, are left living. The first death I\nsaw, and one I shall never forget\xe2\x80\x94that of my dear sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x94left\nthat impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother\nhad to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged\nanyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to\ndie. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since\nthen, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly\nwhy she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression\nof the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though\ngenerally incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite\nlove for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically\ninnocent to have the strength to perform all a mother\xe2\x80\x99s duties. As a\nyoung wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so\nas a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince\nAndrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will\nthere receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of\nher alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent\ninfluence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at\nthe moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should\nthen have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and\ncertain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you\nof the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not\na single hair of our heads will fall without His will. And His will is\ngoverned only by infinite love for us, and so whatever befalls us is for\nour good.\n\nYou ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my\nwish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You will\nbe surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte! The case is\nthis: my father\xe2\x80\x99s health is growing noticeably worse, he cannot stand\nany contradiction and is becoming irritable. This irritability is, as\nyou know, chiefly directed to political questions. He cannot endure\nthe notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the\nsovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own, the grandson of the\nGreat Catherine! As you know, I am quite indifferent to politics, but\nfrom my father\xe2\x80\x99s remarks and his talks with Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich I know\nall that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred\non Buonaparte, who only at Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is\nnot accepted as a great man, still less as Emperor of France. And my\nfather cannot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of\nhis political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to\nMoscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way\nof expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might\nderive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the\ndisputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will\nbe decided very shortly.\n\nOur family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\nabsence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much of late. After\nhis sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits. He has again\nbecome as I used to know him when a child: kind, affectionate, with that\nheart of gold to which I know no equal. He has realized, it seems to me,\nthat life is not over for him. But together with this mental change\nhe has grown physically much weaker. He has become thinner and more\nnervous. I am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad\nwhich the doctors recommended long ago. I hope it will cure him. You\nwrite that in Petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active,\ncultivated, and capable of the young men. Forgive my vanity as a\nrelation, but I never doubted it. The good he has done to everybody\nhere, from his peasants up to the gentry, is incalculable. On his\narrival in Petersburg he received only his due. I always wonder at the\nway rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow, especially such false ones as\nthat you write about\xe2\x80\x94I mean the report of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s betrothal to\nthe little Rost\xc3\xb3va. I do not think my brother will ever marry again,\nand certainly not her; and this is why: first, I know that though he\nrarely speaks about the wife he has lost, the grief of that loss\nhas gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a\nsuccessor and our little angel a stepmother. Secondly because, as far\nas I know, that girl is not the kind of girl who could please Prince\nAndrew. I do not think he would choose her for a wife, and frankly I do\nnot wish it. But I am running on too long and am at the end of my second\nsheet. Good-by, my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and mighty\ncare. My dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.\n\nMARY\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nIn the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter\nfrom Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her strange and\nsurprising news. He informed her of his engagement to Nat\xc3\xa1sha Rost\xc3\xb3va.\nThe whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender\nand confiding affection for his sister. He wrote that he had never loved\nas he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life\nwas. He asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his\nresolve when he had last visited Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it\nto his father. He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her\nfather to give his consent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt\nof his displeasure without attaining her object. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nwrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now.\nMy father then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months,\nhalf of that period, have passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever.\nIf the doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in\nRussia, but as it is I have to postpone my return for three months. You\nknow me and my relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have\nbeen and always shall be independent; but to go against his will and\narouse his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short\ntime, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him about\nthe same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the\nletter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether\nthere is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the\nletter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her quietly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won\xe2\x80\x99t be\nlong\xe2\x80\x94I shall soon set him free.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak\nand, raising his voice more and more, cried:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich,\neh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell him\nthat he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99\nstepmother and I\xe2\x80\x99ll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be\nwithout a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more women are wanted\nin my house\xe2\x80\x94let him marry and live by himself. Perhaps you will go\nand live with him too?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cGo in\nheaven\xe2\x80\x99s name! Go out into the frost... the frost... the frost!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter.\nBut repressed vexation at his son\xe2\x80\x99s poor-spirited behavior found\nexpression in his treatment of his daughter. To his former pretexts\nfor irony a fresh one was now added\xe2\x80\x94allusions to stepmothers and\namiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked his daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll\nmake a splendid princess!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary\nnoticed that her father was really associating more and more with the\nFrenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his\nletter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the\nidea.\n\nLittle Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and religion\nwere Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s joys and consolations; but besides that, since\neveryone must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest\ndepths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief\nconsolation of her life. This comforting dream and hope were given her\nby God\xe2\x80\x99s folk\xe2\x80\x94the half-witted and other pilgrims who visited\nher without the prince\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. The longer she lived, the more\nexperience and observation she had of life, the greater was her wonder\nat the short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here\non earth: toiling, suffering, struggling, and harming one another, to\nobtain that impossible, visionary, sinful happiness. Prince Andrew had\nloved his wife, she died, but that was not enough: he wanted to bind\nhis happiness to another woman. Her father objected to this because he\nwanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew. And they\nall struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their\nsouls, their eternal souls, for the attainment of benefits which endure\nbut for an instant. Not only do we know this ourselves, but Christ, the\nSon of God, came down to earth and told us that this life is but for\na moment and is a probation; yet we cling to it and think to find\nhappiness in it. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it that no one realizes this?\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nPrincess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one except these despised God\xe2\x80\x99s folk who, wallet\non back, come to me by the back door, afraid of being seen by the\nprince, not for fear of ill-usage by him but for fear of causing him\nto sin. To leave family, home, and all the cares of worldly welfare, in\norder without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place\nto place under an assumed name, doing no one any harm but praying for\nall\xe2\x80\x94for those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one:\nhigher than that life and truth there is no life or truth!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called\nTheodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn\nheavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her. Once, when in\na room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of\nher life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of\nlife suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to\nbecome a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary\nthought about this for a long time, and at last made up her mind that,\nstrange as it might seem, she must go on a pilgrimage. She disclosed\nthis thought to no one but to her confessor, Father Ak\xc3\xadnfi, the monk,\nand he approved of her intention. Under guise of a present for the\npilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s complete costume for\nherself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a black kerchief.\nOften, approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure,\nPrincess Mary paused, uncertain whether the time had not already come to\nput her project into execution.\n\nOften, listening to the pilgrims\xe2\x80\x99 tales, she was so stimulated by\ntheir simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep\nmeaning, that several times she was on the point of abandoning\neverything and running away from home. In imagination she already\npictured herself by Theodosia\xe2\x80\x99s side, dressed in coarse rags, walking\nwith a staff, a wallet on her back, along the dusty road, directing her\nwanderings from one saint\xe2\x80\x99s shrine to another, free from envy, earthly\nlove, or desire, and reaching at last the place where there is no more\nsorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and bliss.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to get\nused to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on till\nmy legs fail, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at last\nreach that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow nor\nsighing...\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary.\n\nBut afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko\n(Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that she\nwas a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN: 1810 - 11\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nThe Bible legend tells us that the absence of labor\xe2\x80\x94idleness\xe2\x80\x94was a\ncondition of the first man\xe2\x80\x99s blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man\nhas retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not\nonly because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but\nbecause our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at\nease. An inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If man\ncould find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling\nhis duty, he would have found one of the conditions of man\xe2\x80\x99s primitive\nblessedness. And such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness\nis the lot of a whole class\xe2\x80\x94the military. The chief attraction of\nmilitary service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and\nirreproachable idleness.\n\nNicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v experienced this blissful condition to the full when,\nafter 1807, he continued to serve in the P\xc3\xa1vlograd regiment, in which\nhe already commanded the squadron he had taken over from Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow\nacquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked\nand respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was well\ncontented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters from home\nmore frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling\ninto greater and greater disorder, and that it was time for him to come\nback to gladden and comfort his old parents.\n\nReading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to\ntake him away from surroundings in which, protected from all the\nentanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt that\nsooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with\nits embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its accounts\nwith stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society, and with\nS\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully difficult\nand complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold, formal letters\nin French, beginning: \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d and ending: \xe2\x80\x9cYour obedient\nson,\xe2\x80\x9d which said nothing of when he would return. In 1810 he received\nletters from his parents, in which they told him of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\nengagement to Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, and that the wedding would be in a year\xe2\x80\x99s\ntime because the old prince made difficulties. This letter grieved and\nmortified Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that Nat\xc3\xa1sha, for\nwhom he cared more than for anyone else in the family, should be lost to\nthe home; and secondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted not\nto have been there to show that fellow Bolk\xc3\xb3nski that connection with\nhim was no such great honor after all, and that if he loved Nat\xc3\xa1sha he\nmight dispense with permission from his dotard father. For a moment he\nhesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nbefore she was married, but then came the maneuvers, and considerations\nabout S\xc3\xb3nya and about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas\nagain put it off. But in the spring of that year, he received a letter\nfrom his mother, written without his father\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, and that\nletter persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and\ntake matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and\nthey would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and trusted\nM\xc3\xadtenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage\nof him and things were going from bad to worse. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, I\nimplore you, come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole\nfamily wretched,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the countess.\n\nThis letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a\nmatter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.\n\nThe right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate\nto go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his\nafter-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious\ngray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when\nhe returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavr\xc3\xbashka\n(Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who\nturned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going\nhome. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would\ngo away without having heard from the staff\xe2\x80\x94and this interested him\nextremely\xe2\x80\x94whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the\nOrder of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think\nthat he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish\nCount Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rost\xc3\xb3v had betted\nhe would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it\nseemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish\nMademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had given\none in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would take place\nwithout him\xe2\x80\x94he knew he must go away from this good, bright world to\nsomewhere where everything was stupid and confused. A week later he\nobtained his leave. His hussar comrades\xe2\x80\x94not only those of his own\nregiment, but the whole brigade\xe2\x80\x94gave Rost\xc3\xb3v a dinner to which the\nsubscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which there were two\nbands and two choirs of singers. Rost\xc3\xb3v danced the Trep\xc3\xa1k with Major\nB\xc3\xa1sov; the tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped Rost\xc3\xb3v; the\nsoldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted \xe2\x80\x9churrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\nand then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first\npost station.\n\nDuring the first half of the journey\xe2\x80\x94from Kremench\xc3\xbag to Kiev\xe2\x80\x94all\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with\nthe squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget\nhis three roans and Dozhoyv\xc3\xa9yko, his quartermaster, and to wonder\nanxiously how things would be at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe and what he would find\nthere. Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it\xe2\x80\x94far\nstronger, as though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which\nthe force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the\ndistance. At the last post station before Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe he gave the driver a\nthree-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, up the\nsteps of his home.\n\nAfter the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied\nexpectation\xe2\x80\x94the feeling that \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is just the same, so why\ndid I hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Nicholas began to settle down in his old home world.\nHis father and mother were much the same, only a little older. What was\nnew in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, which there\nused not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the\nbad state of their affairs. S\xc3\xb3nya was nearly twenty; she had stopped\ngrowing prettier and promised nothing more than she was already, but\nthat was enough. She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas\nreturned, and the faithful, unalterable love of this girl had a\ngladdening effect on him. P\xc3\xa9tya and Nat\xc3\xa1sha surprised Nicholas\nmost. P\xc3\xa9tya was a big handsome boy of thirteen, merry, witty, and\nmischievous, with a voice that was already breaking. As for Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\nfor a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked at\nher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not the same at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? Am I uglier?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to\nher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha, joyfully.\n\nShe told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit to\nOtr\xc3\xa1dnoe and showed him his last letter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you glad?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so tranquil and happy\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery glad,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is an excellent fellow.... And\nare you very much in love?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow shall I put it?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cI was in love with\nBor\xc3\xads, with my teacher, and with Den\xc3\xadsov, but this is quite different.\nI feel at peace and settled. I know that no better man than he exists,\nand I am calm and contented now. Not at all as before.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage\nfor a year; but Nat\xc3\xa1sha attacked her brother with exasperation, proving\nto him that it could not be otherwise, and that it would be a bad thing\nto enter a family against the father\xe2\x80\x99s will, and that she herself\nwished it so.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t at all understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nNicholas was silent and agreed with her.\n\nHer brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem at\nall like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband. She was\neven-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This amazed\nNicholas and even made him regard Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s courtship skeptically.\nHe could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially as he had\nnot seen her with Prince Andrew. It always seemed to him that there was\nsomething not quite right about this intended marriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy this delay? Why no betrothal?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. Once, when he had\ntouched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his surprise\nand somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her soul she too\nhad doubts about this marriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see he writes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, showing her son a letter of Prince\nAndrew\xe2\x80\x99s, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s future married happiness, \xe2\x80\x9che writes that he won\xe2\x80\x99t come\nbefore December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His health\nis very delicate. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell Nat\xc3\xa1sha. And don\xe2\x80\x99t attach importance\nto her being so bright: that\xe2\x80\x99s because she\xe2\x80\x99s living through the last\ndays of her girlhood, but I know what she is like every time we receive\na letter from him! However, God grant that everything turns out well!\xe2\x80\x9d\n(She always ended with these words.) \xe2\x80\x9cHe is an excellent man!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAfter reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull. He was\nworried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business\nmatters for which his mother had called him home. To throw off this\nburden as quickly as possible, on the third day after his arrival he\nwent, angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he\nwas going, to M\xc3\xadtenka\xe2\x80\x99s lodge and demanded an account of everything.\nBut what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew even less\nthan the frightened and bewildered M\xc3\xadtenka. The conversation and the\nexamination of the accounts with M\xc3\xadtenka did not last long. The village\nelder, a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were waiting in\nthe passage, heard with fear and delight first the young count\xe2\x80\x99s voice\nroaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and then words of\nabuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I\xe2\x80\x99ll hack the dog to pieces! I\xe2\x80\x99m\nnot my father!... Robbing us!...\xe2\x80\x9d and so on.\n\nThen with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red in\nthe face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged M\xc3\xadtenka out by the scruff of\nthe neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility\nat convenient moments between the words, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cBe off! Never let\nme see your face here again, you villain!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nM\xc3\xadtenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the\nshrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for culprits\nat Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe. M\xc3\xadtenka himself, returning tipsy from the town, used\nto hide there, and many of the residents at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe, hiding from\nM\xc3\xadtenka, knew of its protective qualities.)\n\nM\xc3\xadtenka\xe2\x80\x99s wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and frightened\nfaces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and\nwhere the steward\xe2\x80\x99s high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt.\n\nThe young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by\nwith resolute strides and went into the house.\n\nThe countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the\nlodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly\nimprove, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this\nexcitement might have on her son. She went several times to his door on\ntiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.\n\nNext day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed\nsmile, said to him:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know, my dear boy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity you got excited! M\xc3\xadtenka\nhas told me all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should never understand\nanything in this crazy world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they\nwere carried forward\xe2\x80\x94and you did not look at the other page.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have\ndone, I have done; but, if you like, I won\xe2\x80\x99t speak to him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear boy\xe2\x80\x9d (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he had\nmismanaged his wife\xe2\x80\x99s property and was to blame toward his children,\nbut he did not know how to remedy it). \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I beg you to attend to the\nbusiness. I am old. I...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I\nunderstand it all less than you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings\nforward from page to page,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to understand what\na \xe2\x80\x98corner\xe2\x80\x99 and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to\nanother page I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself, and\nafter that he did not meddle in business affairs. But once the countess\ncalled her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna for two thousand rubles, and asked him what he thought of\ndoing with it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say it rests with me. Well, I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like Bor\xc3\xads, but they were\nour friends and poor. Well then, this!\xe2\x80\x9d and he tore up the note, and\nby so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy. After that,\nyoung Rost\xc3\xb3v took no further part in any business affairs, but\ndevoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new\npursuit\xe2\x80\x94the chase\xe2\x80\x94for which his father kept a large establishment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed\nan earth saturated by autumn rains. The verdure had thickened and its\nbright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye\ntrodden down by the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stubble of the\nspring buckwheat. The wooded ravines and the copses, which at the end of\nAugust had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble, had\nbecome golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The\nhares had already half changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were\nbeginning to scatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was\nthe best time of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young\nsportsman Rost\xc3\xb3v had not merely reached hard winter condition, but were\nso jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them\na three days\xe2\x80\x99 rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go on\na distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was an\nundisturbed litter of wolf cubs.\n\nAll that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the air was\nsharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw.\nOn the fifteenth, when young Rost\xc3\xb3v, in his dressing gown, looked out\nof the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting: it\nwas as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any\nwind. The only motion in the air was that of the dripping, microscopic\nparticles of drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the garden were hung with\ntransparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves. The earth in\nthe kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed\nand at a short distance merged into the dull, moist veil of mist.\nNicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch. There was a smell of\ndecaying leaves and of dog. M\xc3\xadlka, a black-spotted, broad-haunched\nbitch with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing her master, stretched\nher hind legs, lay down like a hare, and then suddenly jumped up and\nlicked him right on his nose and mustache. Another borzoi, a dog,\ncatching sight of his master from the garden path, arched his back\nand, rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail, began rubbing\nhimself against his legs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO-hoy!\xe2\x80\x9d came at that moment, that inimitable huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s call\nwhich unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round\nthe corner came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray,\nwrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian\nfashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and that look of independence\nand scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his\nCircassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully. This scorn\nwas not offensive to his master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel,\ndisdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them, was all\nthe same his serf and huntsman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaniel!\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the\nweather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away\nby that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all\nhis previous resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his\nmistress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat orders, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d said the huntsman in his deep bass,\ndeep as a proto-deacon\xe2\x80\x99s and hoarse with hallooing\xe2\x80\x94and two flashing\nblack eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who was silent.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you resist it?\xe2\x80\x9d those eyes seemed to be asking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nNicholas, scratching M\xc3\xadlka behind the ears.\n\nDaniel did not answer, but winked instead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent Uv\xc3\xa1rka at dawn to listen,\xe2\x80\x9d his bass boomed out after a\nminute\xe2\x80\x99s pause. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says she\xe2\x80\x99s moved them into the Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe\nenclosure. They were howling there.\xe2\x80\x9d (This meant that the she-wolf,\nabout whom they both knew, had moved with her cubs to the Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe\ncopse, a small place a mile and a half from the house.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to go, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to me\nwith Uv\xc3\xa1rka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen put off feeding them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFive minutes later Daniel and Uv\xc3\xa1rka were standing in Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 big\nstudy. Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was\nlike seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and\nsurroundings of human life. Daniel himself felt this, and as usual stood\njust inside the door, trying to speak softly and not move, for fear of\nbreaking something in the master\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, and he hastened to say\nall that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling, out into\nthe open under the sky once more.\n\nHaving finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion that\nthe hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting), Nicholas\nordered the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was about to\ngo Nat\xc3\xa1sha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her hair or\nfinished dressing and with her old nurse\xe2\x80\x99s big shawl wrapped round\nher. P\xc3\xa9tya ran in at the same time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would! S\xc3\xb3nya said\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help going.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we are going,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as he\nintended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take Nat\xc3\xa1sha and P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it is my greatest pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not\nfair; you are going by yourself, are having the horses saddled and said\nnothing to us about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No barrier bars a Russian\xe2\x80\x99s path\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll go!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\nP\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t. Mamma said you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas to\nNat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. I shall certainly go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha decisively.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaniel, tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my\ndogs,\xe2\x80\x9d she added to the huntsman.\n\nIt seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but to\nhave anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible. He\ncast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business,\ncareful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young\nlady.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe old count, who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment\nbut had now handed it all completely over to his son\xe2\x80\x99s care, being\nin very good spirits on this fifteenth of September, prepared to go out\nwith the others.\n\nIn an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time the whole hunting party was at the porch. Nicholas,\nwith a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for\nattending to trifles, went past Nat\xc3\xa1sha and P\xc3\xa9tya who were trying to\ntell him something. He had a look at all the details of the hunt, sent\na pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry, mounted his\nchestnut Don\xc3\xa9ts, and whistling to his own leash of borzois, set off\nacross the threshing ground to a field leading to the Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe wood.\nThe old count\xe2\x80\x99s horse, a sorrel gelding called Vifly\xc3\xa1nka, was led by\nthe groom in attendance on him, while the count himself was to drive in\na small trap straight to a spot reserved for him.\n\nThey were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and\nwhippers-in. Besides the family, there were eight borzoi kennelmen\nand more than forty borzois, so that, with the borzois on the leash\nbelonging to members of the family, there were about a hundred and\nthirty dogs and twenty horsemen.\n\nEach dog knew its master and its call. Each man in the hunt knew his\nbusiness, his place, what he had to do. As soon as they had passed the\nfence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk,\nalong the road and field leading to the Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe covert.\n\nThe horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet, now and then\nsplashing into puddles as they crossed a road. The misty sky still\nseemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the air\nwas still, warm, and silent. Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman,\nthe snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a straggling\nhound could be heard.\n\nWhen they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders with\ndogs appeared out of the mist, approaching the Rost\xc3\xb3vs. In front rode a\nfresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray mustache.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. Come on!... I was sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d began \xe2\x80\x9cUncle.\xe2\x80\x9d (He\nwas a distant relative of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99, a man of small means, and\ntheir neighbor.) \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to resist it and\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing you\xe2\x80\x99re going. That\xe2\x80\x99s it! Come on!\xe2\x80\x9d (This was\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d favorite expression.) \xe2\x80\x9cTake the covert at once, for my\nG\xc3\xadrchik says the Il\xc3\xa1gins are at Kornik\xc3\xad with their hounds. That\xe2\x80\x99s\nit. Come on!... They\xe2\x80\x99ll take the cubs from under your very nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where I\xe2\x80\x99m going. Shall we join up our packs?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nNicholas.\n\nThe hounds were joined into one pack, and \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d and Nicholas rode\non side by side. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide her\neager face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed by\nP\xc3\xa9tya who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and by a\ngroom appointed to look after her. P\xc3\xa9tya, who was laughing, whipped and\npulled at his horse. Nat\xc3\xa1sha sat easily and confidently on her black\nAr\xc3\xa1bchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d looked round disapprovingly at P\xc3\xa9tya and Nat\xc3\xa1sha. He did\nnot like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Uncle! We are going too!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, good morning! But don\xe2\x80\x99t go overriding the hounds,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d sternly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas, what a fine dog Trun\xc3\xadla is! He knew me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\nreferring to her favorite hound.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, Trun\xc3\xadla is not a \xe2\x80\x98dog,\xe2\x80\x99 but a harrier,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought Nicholas, and looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her\nfeel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nunderstood it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s way, Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go to our places and won\xe2\x80\x99t budge.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good thing too, little countess,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cUncle,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9conly mind\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t fall off your horse,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\ncome on!\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to hold on to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe oasis of the Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off,\nthe huntsmen were already nearing it. Rost\xc3\xb3v, having finally settled\nwith \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d where they should set on the hounds, and having shown\nNat\xc3\xa1sha where she was to stand\xe2\x80\x94a spot where nothing could possibly\nrun out\xe2\x80\x94went round above the ravine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, nephew, you\xe2\x80\x99re going for a big wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cUncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind and don\xe2\x80\x99t let her slip!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s as may happen,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cKar\xc3\xa1y, here!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nshouted, answering \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d remark by this call to his borzoi.\nKar\xc3\xa1y was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having\ntackled a big wolf unaided. They all took up their places.\n\nThe old count, knowing his son\xe2\x80\x99s ardor in the hunt, hurried so as not\nto be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count\nIly\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove up\nwith his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him,\nwhere a wolf might come out. Having straightened his coat and fastened\non his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek, well-fed,\nand comfortable horse, Vifly\xc3\xa1nka, which was turning gray, like himself.\nHis horses and trap were sent home. Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v, though not at\nheart a keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well, and rode to\nthe bushy edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged his reins,\nsettled himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was ready, looked\nabout with a smile.\n\nBeside him was Simon Chekm\xc3\xa1r, his personal attendant, an old horseman\nnow somewhat stiff in the saddle. Chekm\xc3\xa1r held in leash three\nformidable wolfhounds, who had, however, grown fat like their master\nand his horse. Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred paces\nfarther along the edge of the wood stood M\xc3\xadtka, the count\xe2\x80\x99s other\ngroom, a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the hunt, by\nold custom, the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy, taken\na snack, and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux.\n\nHe was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were\nrather moist and glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his saddle,\nwrapped up in his fur coat, he looked like a child taken out for an\nouting.\n\nThe thin, hollow-cheeked Chekm\xc3\xa1r, having got everything ready, kept\nglancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for\nthirty years, and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant\nchat. A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood (it was\nplain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind the count. This\nperson was a gray-bearded old man in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s cloak, with a tall\npeaked cap on his head. He was the buffoon, who went by a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\nname, Nast\xc3\xa1sya Iv\xc3\xa1novna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Nast\xc3\xa1sya Iv\xc3\xa1novna!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the count, winking at him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you scare away the beast, Daniel\xe2\x80\x99ll give it you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know a thing or two myself!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nast\xc3\xa1sya Iv\xc3\xa1novna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the count and turned to Simon. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen\nthe young countess?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith young Count Peter, by the Zh\xc3\xa1rov rank grass,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Simon,\nsmiling. \xe2\x80\x9cThough she\xe2\x80\x99s a lady, she\xe2\x80\x99s very fond of hunting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncount. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s as good as many a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! It\xe2\x80\x99s marvelous. So bold, so easy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Nicholas? Where is he? By the Ly\xc3\xa1dov upland, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. He knows where to stand. He understands the matter so well\nthat Daniel and I are often quite astounded,\xe2\x80\x9d said Simon, well knowing\nwhat would please his master.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the\nZav\xc3\xa1rzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight\nwhen they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand rubles\nand the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search far to\nfind another as smart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo search far...\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not\nsaid more. \xe2\x80\x9cTo search far,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning back the skirt of his\ncoat to get at his snuffbox.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform, Michael\nSid\xc3\xb3rych...\xe2\x80\x9d Simon did not finish, for on the still air he had\ndistinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds\ngiving tongue. He bent down his head and listened, shaking a warning\nfinger at his master. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are on the scent of the cubs...\xe2\x80\x9d he\nwhispered, \xe2\x80\x9cstraight to the Ly\xc3\xa1dov uplands.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked into\nthe distance straight before him, down the narrow open space, holding\nthe snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. After the cry of the hounds\ncame the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s hunting horn; the\npack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry,\nwith that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after\na wolf. The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds, but changed to the\ncry of ulyulyu, and above the others rose Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s voice, now a deep\nbass, now piercingly shrill. His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and\ncarried far beyond out into the open field.\n\nAfter listening a few moments in silence, the count and his attendant\nconvinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs: the\nsound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in\nthe distance, the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and\nit was with this that Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard calling ulyulyu.\nThe sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again, but both were\nbecoming more distant.\n\nSimon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had\nentangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his hand,\nopened it and took a pinch. \xe2\x80\x9cBack!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Simon to a borzoi that\nwas pushing forward out of the wood. The count started and dropped the\nsnuffbox. Nast\xc3\xa1sya Iv\xc3\xa1novna dismounted to pick it up. The count and\nSimon were looking at him.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly\napproached, as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were just\nin front of them.\n\nThe count turned and saw on his right M\xc3\xadtka staring at him with eyes\nstarting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to the\nother side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had long\nfretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he galloped\ntoward the count.\n\nThe count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a\nwolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet\nlope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing.\nThe angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 feet at the wolf.\n\nThe wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly,\nlike a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly swaying\nfrom side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail\ndisappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a cry\nlike a wail, first one hound, then another, and then another, sprang\nhelter-skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across\nthe field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared. The hazel\nbushes parted behind the hounds and Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s chestnut horse appeared,\ndark with sweat. On its long back sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless,\nhis disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUlyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. When he caught sight of the\ncount his eyes flashed lightning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlast you!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the\ncount.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!\xe2\x80\x9d and as if scorning to\nsay more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving\nflanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count\nhad aroused and flew off after the hounds. The count, like a punished\nschoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to win Simon\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy for\nhis plight. But Simon was no longer there. He was galloping round by the\nbushes while the field was coming up on both sides, all trying to head\nthe wolf, but it vanished into the wood before they could do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for the wolf.\nBy the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of the dogs\nwhose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of the huntsmen\napproached, receded, and rose, he realized what was happening at the\ncopse. He knew that young and old wolves were there, that the hounds had\nseparated into two packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and\nthat something had gone wrong. He expected the wolf to come his way any\nmoment. He made thousands of different conjectures as to where and\nfrom what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it. Hope\nalternated with despair. Several times he addressed a prayer to God\nthat the wolf should come his way. He prayed with that passionate and\nshamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement\narising from trivial causes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would it be to Thee to do this for\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to God. \xe2\x80\x9cI know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to\nask this of Thee, but for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake do let the old wolf come my way\nand let Kar\xc3\xa1y spring at it\xe2\x80\x94in sight of \xe2\x80\x98Uncle\xe2\x80\x99 who is watching\nfrom over there\xe2\x80\x94and seize it by the throat in a death grip!\xe2\x80\x9d A\nthousand times during that half-hour Rost\xc3\xb3v cast eager and restless\nglances over the edge of the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising\nabove the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water-worn side and\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d cap just visible above the bush on his right.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t have such luck,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v, \xe2\x80\x9cyet what\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in\nwar, I am always unlucky.\xe2\x80\x9d Memories of Austerlitz and of D\xc3\xb3lokhov\nflashed rapidly and clearly through his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly once in my life\nto get an old wolf, I want only that!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, straining eyes and\nears and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the\nslightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs.\n\nAgain he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across\nthe deserted field. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rost\xc3\xb3v, taking a\ndeep breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for.\nThe height of happiness was reached\xe2\x80\x94and so simply, without warning, or\nnoise, or display, that Rost\xc3\xb3v could not believe his eyes and remained\nin doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over\na gully that lay in her path. She was an old animal with a gray back and\nbig reddish belly. She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that no\none saw her. Rost\xc3\xb3v, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois.\nThey stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation.\nOld Kar\xc3\xa1y had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas,\nbaring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUlyulyulyu!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Rost\xc3\xb3v, pouting his lips. The borzois\njumped up, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears.\nKar\xc3\xa1y finished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got\nup with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I loose them or not?\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholas asked himself as the wolf\napproached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolf\xe2\x80\x99s whole\nphysiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never\nseen before\xe2\x80\x94human eyes fixed upon her\xe2\x80\x94and turning her head a little\ntoward Rost\xc3\xb3v, she paused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...\xe2\x80\x9d the wolf seemed to say\nto herself, and she moved forward without again looking round and with a\nquiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUlyulyu!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own\naccord his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies\nto head off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still.\nNicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor\nsee the borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only the\nwolf, who, increasing her speed, bounded on in the same direction along\nthe hollow. The first to come into view was M\xc3\xadlka, with her black\nmarkings and powerful quarters, gaining upon the wolf. Nearer and\nnearer... now she was ahead of it; but the wolf turned its head to face\nher, and instead of putting on speed as she usually did M\xc3\xadlka suddenly\nraised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUlyulyulyulyu!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Nicholas.\n\nThe reddish Lyub\xc3\xadm rushed forward from behind M\xc3\xadlka, sprang\nimpetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but\nimmediately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her\nteeth, and again rose and bounded forward, followed at the distance of a\ncouple of feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll get away! No, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas, still\nshouting with a hoarse voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKar\xc3\xa1y, ulyulyu!...\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi\nwho was now his only hope. Kar\xc3\xa1y, with all the strength age had left\nhim, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped\nheavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the wolf\xe2\x80\x99s\nlope and the borzoi\xe2\x80\x99s slower pace made it plain that Kar\xc3\xa1y had\nmiscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the\nwood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it. But,\ncoming toward him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost\nstraight at the wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish\nyoung borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, rushed\nimpetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over. But\nthe wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and,\ngnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a piercing\nyelp, fell with its head on the ground, bleeding from a gash in its\nside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKar\xc3\xa1y? Old fellow!...\xe2\x80\x9d wailed Nicholas.\n\nThanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf\xe2\x80\x99s path, the\nold dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five\npaces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her eyes on\nKar\xc3\xa1y, tucked her tail yet further between her legs, and increased\nher speed. But here Nicholas only saw that something happened to\nKar\xc3\xa1y\xe2\x80\x94the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf, and they rolled together\ndown into a gully just in front of them.\n\nThat instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully\nwith the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and\noutstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears\nlaid back (Kar\xc3\xa1y was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest\nmoment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to\ndismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up from\namong that mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge of the\ngully. She clicked her teeth (Kar\xc3\xa1y no longer had her by the throat),\nleaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and having\ndisengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again, went\nforward. Kar\xc3\xa1y, his hair bristling, and probably bruised or wounded,\nclimbed with difficulty out of the gully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh my God! Why?\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholas cried in despair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d huntsman was galloping from the other side across the\nwolf\xe2\x80\x99s path and his borzois once more stopped the animal\xe2\x80\x99s advance.\nShe was again hemmed in.\n\nNicholas and his attendant, with \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d and his huntsman, were all\nriding round the wolf, crying \xe2\x80\x9culyulyu!\xe2\x80\x9d shouting and preparing to\ndismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward\nagain every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she\nwould be safe.\n\nAlready, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the ulyulyuing,\nhad rushed out from the wood. He saw Kar\xc3\xa1y seize the wolf, and checked\nhis horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he saw that the\nhorsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for\nsafety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf but straight\ntoward the wood, just as Kar\xc3\xa1y had run to cut the animal off. As\na result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been\nstopped a second time by \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d borzois.\n\nDaniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and\nthrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if\nit were a flail.\n\nNicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut, breathing\nheavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel\nlying on the wolf\xe2\x80\x99s back among the dogs, trying to seize her by the\nears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself\nthat all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and\ntried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took\na step, and with his whole weight, as if lying down to rest, fell on\nthe wolf, seizing her by the ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but\nDaniel whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t! We\xe2\x80\x99ll gag her!\xe2\x80\x9d and, changing his\nposition, set his foot on the wolf\xe2\x80\x99s neck. A stick was thrust between\nher jaws and she was fastened with a leash, as if bridled, her legs were\nbound together, and Daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to\nside.\n\nWith happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a shying\nand snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, took her\nto the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had killed two of\nthe cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled with their booty\nand their stories, and all came to look at the wolf, which, with her\nbroad-browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws,\ngazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding\nher. When she was touched, she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly\nyet simply at everybody. Old Count Rost\xc3\xb3v also rode up and touched the\nwolf.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a formidable one!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cA formidable one, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nasked Daniel, who was standing near.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.\n\nThe count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with\nDaniel.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count.\n\nFor sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable\nsmile.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe old count went home, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha and P\xc3\xa9tya promised to return very\nsoon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At midday\nthey put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees.\nNicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips.\n\nFacing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone\nin a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been loosed\nbefore Nicholas heard one he knew, Volt\xc3\xb3rn, giving tongue at intervals;\nother hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving tongue. A\nmoment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been\nfound, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along the ravine\ntoward the ryefield and away from Nicholas.\n\nHe saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the\nravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself\nat any moment on the ryefield opposite.\n\nThe huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, and\nNicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard\nacross the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew close\nto the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper\ncurves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed\nin followed by a black one, and everything was in confusion; the borzois\nformed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with\ntails turned away from the center of the group. Two huntsmen galloped up\nto the dogs; one in a red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s that huntsman from?\nHe is not \xe2\x80\x98Uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without strapping\nit to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high saddles, stood\nnear them and there too the dogs were lying. The huntsmen waved their\narms and did something to the fox. Then from that spot came the sound of\na horn, with the signal agreed on in case of a fight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Il\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s huntsman having a row with our Iv\xc3\xa1n,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nNicholas\xe2\x80\x99 groom.\n\nNicholas sent the man to call Nat\xc3\xa1sha and P\xc3\xa9tya to him, and rode at a\nfootpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together.\nSeveral of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on.\n\nNicholas dismounted, and with Nat\xc3\xa1sha and P\xc3\xa9tya, who had ridden up,\nstopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would end. Out of\nthe bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward\nhis young master, with the fox tied to his crupper. While still at a\ndistance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully, but he was\npale and breathless and his face was angry. One of his eyes was black,\nbut he probably was not even aware of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my gray\nbitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the fox! I\ngave him one with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want a taste\nof this?...\xe2\x80\x9d said the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and probably\nimagining himself still speaking to his foe.\n\nNicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and P\xc3\xa9tya\nto wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s, Il\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s,\nhunting party was.\n\nThe victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there,\nsurrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.\n\nThe facts were that Il\xc3\xa1gin, with whom the Rost\xc3\xb3vs had a quarrel and\nwere at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs,\nand had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very woods the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had\nchased.\n\nNicholas, though he had never seen Il\xc3\xa1gin, with his usual absence\nof moderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his\narbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe. He\nrode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully\nprepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his\nenemy.\n\nHardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in\na beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse,\naccompanied by two hunt servants.\n\nInstead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Il\xc3\xa1gin a stately and courteous\ngentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young count\xe2\x80\x99s\nacquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, Il\xc3\xa1gin raised his beaver\ncap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the\nman punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s borzois. He hoped to become better acquainted with the count\nand invited him to draw his covert.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had\nfollowed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly\ngreetings, she rode up to them. Il\xc3\xa1gin lifted his beaver cap still\nhigher to Nat\xc3\xa1sha and said, with a pleasant smile, that the young\ncountess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her\nbeauty, of which he had heard much.\n\nTo expiate his huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s offense, Il\xc3\xa1gin pressed the Rost\xc3\xb3vs to\ncome to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for\nhimself and which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and the\nhunt, now doubled, moved on.\n\nThe way to Iligin\xe2\x80\x99s upland was across the fields. The hunt servants\nfell into line. The masters rode together. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle,\xe2\x80\x9d Rost\xc3\xb3v, and\nIl\xc3\xa1gin kept stealthily glancing at one another\xe2\x80\x99s dogs, trying not\nto be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to\ntheir own borzois.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred,\nred-spotted bitch on Il\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s leash, slender but with muscles like\nsteel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had heard of\nthe swiftness of Il\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s borzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a\nrival to his own M\xc3\xadlka.\n\nIn the middle of a sober conversation begun by Il\xc3\xa1gin about the\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine little bitch, that!\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a careless tone. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she\nswift?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat one? Yes, she\xe2\x80\x99s a good dog, gets what she\xe2\x80\x99s after,\xe2\x80\x9d\nanswered Il\xc3\xa1gin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erz\xc3\xa1, for\nwhich, a year before, he had given a neighbor three families of house\nserfs. \xe2\x80\x9cSo in your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of,\nCount?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And\nconsidering it polite to return the young count\xe2\x80\x99s compliment, Il\xc3\xa1gin\nlooked at his borzois and picked out M\xc3\xadlka who attracted his attention\nby her breadth. \xe2\x80\x9cThat black-spotted one of yours is fine\xe2\x80\x94well\nshaped!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she\xe2\x80\x99s fast enough,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nicholas, and thought: \xe2\x80\x9cIf\nonly a full-grown hare would cross the field now I\xe2\x80\x99d show you what\nsort of borzoi she is,\xe2\x80\x9d and turning to his groom, he said he would\ngive a ruble to anyone who found a hare.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Il\xc3\xa1gin, \xe2\x80\x9chow some sportsmen can\nbe so jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count,\nI enjoy riding in company such as this... what could be better?\xe2\x80\x9d (he\nagain raised his cap to Nat\xc3\xa1sha) \xe2\x80\x9cbut as for counting skins and what\none takes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr being upset because someone else\xe2\x80\x99s borzoi and not mine catches\nsomething. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not so,\nCount? For I consider that...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA-tu!\xe2\x80\x9d came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in,\nwho had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip\naloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, \xe2\x80\x9cA-tu!\xe2\x80\x9d (This call and\nthe uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he has found one, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Il\xc3\xa1gin carelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\nmust ride up.... Shall we both course it?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nicholas, seeing\nin Erz\xc3\xa1 and \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d red Rug\xc3\xa1y two rivals he had never yet had\na chance of pitting against his own borzois. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd suppose they outdo\nmy M\xc3\xadlka at once!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought as he rode with \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d and Il\xc3\xa1gin\ntoward the hare.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA full-grown one?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Il\xc3\xa1gin as he approached the whip who\nhad sighted the hare\xe2\x80\x94and not without agitation he looked round and\nwhistled to Erz\xc3\xa1.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Michael Nikan\xc3\xb3rovich?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing \xe2\x80\x9cUncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I join in? Why, you\xe2\x80\x99ve given a village for each of your\nborzois! That\xe2\x80\x99s it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours\nagainst one another, you two, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll look on!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRug\xc3\xa1y, hey, hey!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cRug\xc3\xa1yushka!\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\ninvoluntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes\nhe placed on this red borzoi. Nat\xc3\xa1sha saw and felt the agitation the\ntwo elderly men and her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself\nexcited by it.\n\nThe huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the\ngentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were far off\non the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but not the\ngentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and sedately.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it pointing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces toward\nthe whip who had sighted the hare.\n\nBut before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming\nnext morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash rushed\ndownhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that\nwere not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt,\nwho had been moving slowly, shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d calling in the hounds,\nwhile the borzoi whips, with a cry of \xe2\x80\x9cA-tu!\xe2\x80\x9d galloped across the\nfield setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil Il\xc3\xa1gin, Nicholas,\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, and \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d flew, reckless of where and how they went,\nseeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even\nfor an instant of the chase. The hare they had started was a strong and\nswift one. When he jumped up he did not run at once, but pricked his\nears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all\nsides at once. He took a dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting the\nborzois gain on him, and, finally having chosen his direction and\nrealized his danger, laid back his ears and rushed off headlong. He had\nbeen lying in the stubble, but in front of him was the autumn sowing\nwhere the ground was soft. The two borzois of the huntsman who had\nsighted him, having been the nearest, were the first to see and pursue\nhim, but they had not gone far before Il\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s red-spotted Erz\xc3\xa1\npassed them, got within a length, flew at the hare with terrible\nswiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had seized him, rolled\nover like a ball. The hare arched his back and bounded off yet more\nswiftly. From behind Erz\xc3\xa1 rushed the broad-haunched, black-spotted\nM\xc3\xadlka and began rapidly gaining on the hare.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMil\xc3\xa1shka, dear!\xe2\x80\x9d rose Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 triumphant cry. It looked as if\nM\xc3\xadlka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and\nflew past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful Erz\xc3\xa1 reached him,\nbut when close to the hare\xe2\x80\x99s scut paused as if measuring the distance,\nso as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cErz\xc3\xa1, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d Il\xc3\xa1gin wailed in a voice unlike his own. Erz\xc3\xa1\ndid not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have\nseized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the\nwinter rye and the stubble. Again Erz\xc3\xa1 and M\xc3\xadlka were abreast, running\nlike a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but\nit was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not\novertake him so quickly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRug\xc3\xa1y, Rug\xc3\xa1yushka! That\xe2\x80\x99s it, come on!\xe2\x80\x9d came a third voice just\nthen, and \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d red borzoi, straining and curving its back,\ncaught up with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless\nof the terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off\nthe balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously,\nsinking to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was\nhow, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of borzois\nsurrounded him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd\nof dogs. Only the delighted \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d dismounted, and cut off a pad,\nshaking the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously glancing round\nwith restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. He spoke without\nhimself knowing whom to or what about. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, come on! That\xe2\x80\x99s\na dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the thousand-ruble as well as\nthe one-ruble borzois. That\xe2\x80\x99s it, come on!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, panting and\nlooking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone, as if they\nwere all his enemies and had insulted him, and only now had he at\nlast succeeded in justifying himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are your thousand-ruble\nones.... That\xe2\x80\x99s it, come on!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRug\xc3\xa1y, here\xe2\x80\x99s a pad for you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, throwing down the\nhare\xe2\x80\x99s muddy pad. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve deserved it, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, come on!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99d tired herself out, she\xe2\x80\x99d run it down three times by\nherself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless\nof whether he were heard or not.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is there in running across it like that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Il\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s\ngroom.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d Il\xc3\xa1gin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop\nand his excitement. At the same moment Nat\xc3\xa1sha, without drawing\nbreath, screamed joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set\neveryone\xe2\x80\x99s ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the others\nexpressed by all talking at once, and it was so strange that she must\nherself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have\nbeen amazed at it at any other time. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d himself twisted up the\nhare, threw it neatly and smartly across his horse\xe2\x80\x99s back as if by\nthat gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, and, with an air of not\nwishing to speak to anyone, mounted his bay and rode off. The others all\nfollowed, dispirited and shamefaced, and only much later were they able\nto regain their former affectation of indifference. For a long time they\ncontinued to look at red Rug\xc3\xa1y who, his arched back spattered with\nmud and clanking the ring of his leash, walked along just behind\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d horse with the serene air of a conqueror.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am like any other dog as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of\ncoursing. But when it is, then look out!\xe2\x80\x9d his appearance seemed to\nNicholas to be saying.\n\nWhen, much later, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d rode up to Nicholas and began talking\nto him, he felt flattered that, after what had happened, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d\ndeigned to speak to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nToward evening Il\xc3\xa1gin took leave of Nicholas, who found that they were\nso far from home that he accepted \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d offer that the hunting\nparty should spend the night in his little village of Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you put up at my house that will be better still. That\xe2\x80\x99s it,\ncome on!\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cUncle.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou see it\xe2\x80\x99s damp weather, and you\ncould rest, and the little countess could be driven home in a trap.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe for\na trap, while Nicholas rode with Nat\xc3\xa1sha and P\xc3\xa9tya to \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d\nhouse.\n\nSome five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front\nporch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as\nwell as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at\nthe hunters who were arriving. The presence of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x94a woman, a\nlady, and on horseback\xe2\x80\x94raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a\ndegree that many of them came up to her, stared her in the face, and\nunabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some\nprodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what\nwas said about her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAr\xc3\xadnka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and her skirt\ndangles.... See, she\xe2\x80\x99s got a little hunting horn!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness gracious! See her knife?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t she a Tartar!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it you didn\xe2\x80\x99t go head over heels?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the boldest of\nall, addressing Nat\xc3\xa1sha directly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which\nstood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his\nretainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take\nthemselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to\nreceive the guests and the visitors.\n\nThe serfs all dispersed. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d lifted Nat\xc3\xa1sha off her horse and\ntaking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch. The\nhouse, with its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overclean\xe2\x80\x94it\ndid not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless\xe2\x80\x94but\nneither was it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of\nfresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung about.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with\na folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round\nbirchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where\nthere was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of Suv\xc3\xb3rov, of\nthe host\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother, and of himself in military uniform. The\nstudy smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d asked his visitors\nto sit down and make themselves at home, and then went out of the room.\nRug\xc3\xa1y, his back still muddy, came into the room and lay down on the\nsofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth. Leading from the study\nwas a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be\nseen. From behind this came women\xe2\x80\x99s laughter and whispers. Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\nNicholas, and P\xc3\xa9tya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa.\nP\xc3\xa9tya, leaning on his elbow, fell asleep at once. Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Nicholas\nwere silent. Their faces glowed, they were hungry and very cheerful.\nThey looked at one another (now that the hunt was over and they were in\nthe house, Nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly\nsuperiority over his sister), Nat\xc3\xa1sha gave him a wink, and neither\nrefrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before\nthey had a pretext ready to account for it.\n\nAfter a while \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and\nsmall top boots. And Nat\xc3\xa1sha felt that this costume, the very one she\nhad regarded with surprise and amusement at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe, was just the\nright thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat.\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s and sister\xe2\x80\x99s laughter (it could never enter his head that\nthey might be laughing at his way of life) he himself joined in the\nmerriment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, young countess, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, come on! I never saw\nanyone like her!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem\nand, with a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another that\nhad been cut short. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s ridden all day like a man, and is as\nfresh as ever!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSoon after \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d reappearance the door was opened, evidently\nfrom the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking\nwoman of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered\ncarrying a large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality in\nher glance and in every motion, she looked at the visitors and, with\na pleasant smile, bowed respectfully. In spite of her exceptional\nstoutness, which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw\nback her head, this woman (who was \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d housekeeper) trod\nvery lightly. She went to the table, set down the tray, and with her\nplump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors\nd\xe2\x80\x99oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table. When she had\nfinished, she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cHere I am. I am she! Now do you understand \xe2\x80\x98Uncle\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d her\nexpression said to Rost\xc3\xb3v. How could one help understanding? Not only\nNicholas, but even Nat\xc3\xa1sha understood the meaning of his puckered brow\nand the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when\nAn\xc3\xadsya F\xc3\xabdorovna entered. On the tray was a bottle of herb wine,\ndifferent kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes made with\nbuttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and sparkling mead, apples,\nnuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey sweets. Afterwards she brought\na freshly roasted chicken, ham, preserves made with honey, and preserves\nmade with sugar.\n\nAll this was the fruit of An\xc3\xadsya F\xc3\xabdorovna\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeping, gathered\nand prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a smack\nof An\xc3\xadsya F\xc3\xabdorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, cleanliness,\nwhiteness, and pleasant smiles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this, little Lady-Countess!\xe2\x80\x9d she kept saying, as she offered\nNat\xc3\xa1sha first one thing and then another.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such\nbuttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets, or such\na chicken anywhere. An\xc3\xadsya F\xc3\xabdorovna left the room.\n\nAfter supper, over their cherry brandy, Rost\xc3\xb3v and \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d talked\nof past and future hunts, of Rug\xc3\xa1y and Il\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s dogs, while Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nsat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. She tried\nseveral times to wake P\xc3\xa9tya that he might eat something, but he\nonly muttered incoherent words without waking up. Nat\xc3\xa1sha felt so\nlighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared\nthe trap would come for her too soon. After a casual pause, such as\noften occurs when receiving friends for the first time in one\xe2\x80\x99s own\nhouse, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle,\xe2\x80\x9d answering a thought that was in his visitors\xe2\x80\x99\nminds, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d face was very significant and even handsome as he said\nthis. Involuntarily Rost\xc3\xb3v recalled all the good he had heard about\nhim from his father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d had the reputation of being the most honorable and\ndisinterested of cranks. They called him in to decide family disputes,\nchose him as executor, confided secrets to him, elected him to be a\njustice and to other posts; but he always persistently refused public\nappointments, passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay\ngelding, sitting at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown garden in\nsummer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you enter the service, Uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That\xe2\x80\x99s it, come\non! I can\xe2\x80\x99t make head or tail of it. That\xe2\x80\x99s for you\xe2\x80\x94I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\nbrains enough. Now, hunting is another matter\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it, come on!\nOpen the door, there!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you shut it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen\xe2\x80\x99s room, as they\ncalled the room for the hunt servants.\n\nThere was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the\ndoor into the huntsmen\xe2\x80\x99s room, from which came the clear sounds of a\nbalal\xc3\xa1yka on which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was\nplaying. Nat\xc3\xa1sha had been listening to those strains for some time and\nnow went out into the passage to hear better.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s M\xc3\xadtka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balal\xc3\xa1yka.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m fond of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cUncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was the custom for M\xc3\xadtka to play the balal\xc3\xa1yka in the huntsmen\xe2\x80\x99s\nroom when \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d returned from the chase. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d was fond of\nsuch music.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow good! Really very good!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas with some unintentional\nsuperciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him\nvery much.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha reproachfully, noticing her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cNot \xe2\x80\x98very good\xe2\x80\x99--it\xe2\x80\x99s simply delicious!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust as \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had\nseemed to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that moment,\nseemed to her the acme of musical delight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore, please, more!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha at the door as soon as the\nbalal\xc3\xa1yka ceased. M\xc3\xadtka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming\nthe balal\xc3\xa1yka to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations.\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d sat listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side.\nThe air was repeated a hundred times. The balal\xc3\xa1yka was retuned several\ntimes and the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did\nnot grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again. An\xc3\xadsya\nF\xc3\xabdorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou like listening?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, with a smile extremely\nlike \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good player of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play that part right!\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly, with\nan energetic gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cHere he ought to burst out\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s it, come\non!\xe2\x80\x94ought to burst out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you play then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d did not answer, but smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xc3\xadsya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t touched it for a long time. That\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94come on! I\xe2\x80\x99ve\ngiven it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAn\xc3\xadsya F\xc3\xabdorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her\nerrand and brought back the guitar.\n\nWithout looking at anyone, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d blew the dust off it and, tapping\nthe case with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself in\nhis armchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard, arching\nhis left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a wink at\nAn\xc3\xadsya F\xc3\xabdorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous, and then\nquietly, smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow time, not\nMy Lady, but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the street. The\ntune, played with precision and in exact time, began to thrill in the\nhearts of Nicholas and Nat\xc3\xa1sha, arousing in them the same kind of\nsober mirth as radiated from An\xc3\xadsya F\xc3\xabdorovna\xe2\x80\x99s whole being. An\xc3\xadsya\nF\xc3\xabdorovna flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing\nout of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d continued to play correctly, carefully,\nwith energetic firmness, looking with a changed and inspired expression\nat the spot where An\xc3\xadsya F\xc3\xabdorovna had just stood. Something seemed to\nbe laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches,\nespecially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when, here\nand there, as he ran his fingers over the strings, something seemed to\nsnap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Nat\xc3\xa1sha as soon as\nhe had finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. \xe2\x80\x9cNicholas,\nNicholas!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nis it moves me so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas too was greatly pleased by \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d playing, and\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d played the piece over again. An\xc3\xadsya F\xc3\xabdorovna\xe2\x80\x99s smiling\nface reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces...\n\n    Fetching water clear and sweet,\n    Stop, dear maiden, I entreat\xe2\x80\x94\n\nplayed \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d once more, running his fingers skillfully over the\nstrings, and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Uncle dear,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha wailed in an imploring tone as if her\nlife depended on it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of\nthem smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow struck\na na\xc3\xafve and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, niece!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, waving to Nat\xc3\xa1sha the hand that\nhad just struck a chord.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to face\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle,\xe2\x80\x9d and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her\nshoulders and struck an attitude.\n\nWhere, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9e\nFrench governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit\nand obtained that manner which the pas de ch\xc3\xa2le * would, one would have\nsupposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the movements were\nthose inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d had\nexpected of her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and smiled\ntriumphantly, proudly, and with sly merriment, the fear that had at\nfirst seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do the right\nthing was at an end, and they were already admiring her.\n\n    * The French shawl dance.\n\nShe did the right thing with such precision, such complete precision,\nthat An\xc3\xadsya F\xc3\xabdorovna, who had at once handed her the handkerchief she\nneeded for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though she laughed as she\nwatched this slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and velvets and so\ndifferent from herself, who yet was able to understand all that was\nin An\xc3\xadsya and in An\xc3\xadsya\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother and aunt, and in every\nRussian man and woman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, little countess; that\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94come on!\xe2\x80\x9d cried \xe2\x80\x9cUncle,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwith a joyous laugh, having finished the dance. \xe2\x80\x9cWell done, niece! Now\na fine young fellow must be found as husband for you. That\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94come\non!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s chosen already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas smiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh?\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d in surprise, looking inquiringly at Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\nwho nodded her head with a happy smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd such a one!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. But as soon as she had said it a new\ntrain of thoughts and feelings arose in her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99\nsmile mean when he said \xe2\x80\x98chosen already\xe2\x80\x99? Is he glad of it or not?\nIt is as if he thought my Bolk\xc3\xb3nski would not approve of or understand\nour gaiety. But he would understand it all. Where is he now?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nthought, and her face suddenly became serious. But this lasted only a\nsecond. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t dare to think about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself,\nand sat down again smilingly beside \xe2\x80\x9cUncle,\xe2\x80\x9d begging him to play\nsomething more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d played another song and a valse; then after a pause he\ncleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:\n\n    As \xe2\x80\x98twas growing dark last night\n    Fell the snow so soft and light...\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d sang as peasants sing, with full and na\xc3\xafve conviction that\nthe whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes\nof itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which exists\nonly to give measure to the words. As a result of this the unconsidered\ntune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily good. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was in\necstasies over \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d singing. She resolved to give up learning\nthe harp and to play only the guitar. She asked \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d for his\nguitar and at once found the chords of the song.\n\nAfter nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock two traps and three mounted men, who had been sent\nto look for them, arrived to fetch Nat\xc3\xa1sha and P\xc3\xa9tya. The count and\ncountess did not know where they were and were very anxious, said one of\nthe men.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two\ntraps. Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Nicholas got into the other. \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d wrapped\nNat\xc3\xa1sha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness. He\naccompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed,\nso that they had to go round by the ford, and he sent huntsmen to ride\nin front with lanterns.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, dear niece,\xe2\x80\x9d his voice called out of the darkness\xe2\x80\x94not\nthe voice Nat\xc3\xa1sha had known previously, but the one that had sung As\n\xe2\x80\x98twas growing dark last night.\n\nIn the village through which they passed there were red lights and a\ncheerful smell of smoke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a darling Uncle is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, when they had come out\nonto the highroad.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not cold?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!\xe2\x80\x9d answered\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained silent a long\nwhile. The night was dark and damp. They could not see the horses, but\nonly heard them splashing through the unseen mud.\n\nWhat was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught\nand assimilated all the diverse impressions of life? How did they all\nfind place in her? But she was very happy. As they were nearing home she\nsuddenly struck up the air of As \xe2\x80\x98twas growing dark last night\xe2\x80\x94the\ntune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last\ncaught.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\nNat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nThey were fond of asking one another that question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas, trying to remember. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, first I\nthought that Rug\xc3\xa1y, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were\na man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then\nfor his manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?...\nWell, and you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving\nalong and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows\nwhere we are really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive and\nsuddenly find that we are not in Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe, but in Fairyland. And then I\nthought... No, nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I expect you thought of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas, smiling as\nNat\xc3\xa1sha knew by the sound of his voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, though she had in reality been thinking about\nPrince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would\nhave liked \xe2\x80\x9cUncle.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I was saying to myself all the way,\n\xe2\x80\x98How well An\xc3\xadsya carried herself, how well!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d And Nicholas heard\nher spontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsuddenly said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that I shall never again be as happy and\ntranquil as I am now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRubbish, nonsense, humbug!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought:\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow charming this Nat\xc3\xa1sha of mine is! I have no other friend like\nher and never shall have. Why should she marry? We might always drive\nabout together!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a darling this Nicholas of mine is!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there are still lights in the drawing room!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing\nto the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety\ndarkness of the night.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nCount Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility\nbecause it involved him in too much expense, but still his affairs\ndid not improve. Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Nicholas often noticed their parents\nconferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of\nselling the fine ancestral Rost\xc3\xb3v house and estate near Moscow. It was\nnot necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal,\nand life at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe was quieter than in former years, but still the\nenormous house and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty\nsat down to table every day. These were all their own people who had\nsettled down in the house almost as members of the family, or persons\nwho were, it seemed, obliged to live in the count\xe2\x80\x99s house. Such were\nDimmler the musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing master and his\nfamily, Bel\xc3\xb3va, an old maiden lady, an inmate of the house, and many\nothers such as P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s tutors, the girls\xe2\x80\x99 former governess, and\nother people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to\nlive in the count\xe2\x80\x99s house than at home. They had not as many visitors\nas before, but the old habits of life without which the count and\ncountess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged. There was\nstill the hunting establishment which Nicholas had even enlarged, the\nsame fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables, the same expensive\npresents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days; there\nwere still the count\xe2\x80\x99s games of whist and boston, at which\xe2\x80\x94spreading\nout his cards so that everybody could see them\xe2\x80\x94he let himself be\nplundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors, who looked\nupon an opportunity to play a rubber with Count Rost\xc3\xb3v as a most\nprofitable source of income.\n\nThe count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not to believe\nthat he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step, and\nfeeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and\npatiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her loving heart, felt\nthat her children were being ruined, that it was not the count\xe2\x80\x99s fault\nfor he could not help being what he was\xe2\x80\x94that (though he tried to\nhide it) he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and\nhis children\xe2\x80\x99s ruin, and she tried to find means of remedying the\nposition. From her feminine point of view she could see only one\nsolution, namely, for Nicholas to marry a rich heiress. She felt this to\nbe their last hope and that if Nicholas refused the match she had found\nfor him, she would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters\nright. This match was with Julie Kar\xc3\xa1gina, the daughter of excellent\nand virtuous parents, a girl the Rost\xc3\xb3vs had known from childhood, and\nwho had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of\nher brothers.\n\nThe countess had written direct to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s mother in Moscow suggesting\na marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer\nfrom her. Kar\xc3\xa1gina had replied that for her part she was agreeable, and\neverything depend on her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s inclination. She invited Nicholas\nto come to Moscow.\n\nSeveral times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son that\nnow both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him\nmarried. She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that\nwere accomplished. Then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl\nand tried to discover what he thought about marriage.\n\nAt other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to\nMoscow during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what his\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations\ninduced her to speak quite frankly. She told him that her only hope\nof getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie\nKar\xc3\xa1gina.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would\nyou expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of\nmoney?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question\nand only wishing to show his noble-mindedness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you have not understood me,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, not knowing how\nto justify herself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not understood me, Nik\xc3\xb3lenka. It is\nyour happiness I wish for,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, feeling that she was telling an\nuntruth and was becoming entangled. She began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and you know I\nwill give my life, anything, to put you at ease,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nwould sacrifice anything for you\xe2\x80\x94even my feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the countess did not want the question put like that: she did not\nwant a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a sacrifice\nfor him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you have not understood me, don\xe2\x80\x99t let us talk about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nreplied, wiping away her tears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I do love a poor girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I to\nsacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could\nspeak so to me. Because S\xc3\xb3nya is poor I must not love her,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cmust not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should\ncertainly be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can\nalways sacrifice my feelings for my family\xe2\x80\x99s welfare,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t coerce my feelings. If I love S\xc3\xb3nya, that\nfeeling is for me stronger and higher than all else.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the\nconversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and sometimes\nwith exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and\nthe portionless S\xc3\xb3nya. Though she blamed herself for it, she could\nnot refrain from grumbling at and worrying S\xc3\xb3nya, often pulling her up\nwithout reason, addressing her stiffly as \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d and using the\nformal \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x9d instead of the intimate \xe2\x80\x9cthou\xe2\x80\x9d in speaking to her.\nThe kindhearted countess was the more vexed with S\xc3\xb3nya because that\npoor, dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind, so devotedly\ngrateful to her benefactors, and so faithfully, unchangingly, and\nunselfishly in love with Nicholas, that there were no grounds for\nfinding fault with her.\n\nNicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth letter had\ncome from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that he would have\nbeen on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly\nreopened in the warm climate, which obliged him to defer his return till\nthe beginning of the new year. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was still as much in love with\nher betrothed, found the same comfort in that love, and was still as\nready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before; but at\nthe end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits\nof depression which she could not master. She felt sorry for herself:\nsorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to\nanyone\xe2\x80\x94while she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved.\n\nThings were not cheerful in the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 home.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nChristmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn and\nwearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, and the\nnew dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities, though\nthe calm frost of twenty degrees R\xc3\xa9aumur, the dazzling sunshine by day,\nand the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special\ncelebration of the season.\n\nOn the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, all the\ninmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest time\nof the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that morning,\nwas asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was resting in his\nstudy. S\xc3\xb3nya sat in the drawing room at the round table, copying a\ndesign for embroidery. The countess was playing patience. Nast\xc3\xa1sya\nIv\xc3\xa1novna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old\nladies. Nat\xc3\xa1sha came into the room, went up to S\xc3\xb3nya, glanced at\nwhat she was doing, and then went up to her mother and stood without\nspeaking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you wandering about like an outcast?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her mother.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\nwith glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.\n\nThe countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look at me, Mamma! Don\xe2\x80\x99t look; I shall cry directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down with me a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned quickly to\nhide them and left the room.\n\nShe passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and then\nwent into the maids\xe2\x80\x99 room. There an old maidservant was grumbling at\na young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold from\nthe serfs\xe2\x80\x99 quarters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop playing\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a time for everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\nwoman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her alone, Kondr\xc3\xa1tevna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cGo, Mavr\xc3\xbashka,\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving released Mavr\xc3\xbashka, Nat\xc3\xa1sha crossed the dancing hall and went\nto the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing\ncards. They broke off and rose as she entered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do with them?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Nik\xc3\xadta, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the\nyard and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some\noats.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a few oats?\xe2\x80\x9d said Misha, cheerfully and readily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, go quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man urged him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn her way past the butler\xe2\x80\x99s pantry she told them to set a samovar,\nthough it was not at all the time for tea.\n\nF\xc3\xb3ka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order and\nasked whether the samovar was really wanted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, what a young lady!\xe2\x80\x9d said F\xc3\xb3ka, pretending to frown at\nNat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nNo one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to send\nthem on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of them would\nget angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no one\xe2\x80\x99s orders\nso readily as they did hers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do, where can I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought she, as she went slowly along the passage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNast\xc3\xa1sya Iv\xc3\xa1novna, what sort of children shall I have?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked\nthe buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s jacket.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the buffoon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, O Lord, it\xe2\x80\x99s always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What\nam I to do with myself?\xe2\x80\x9d And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly\nupstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.\n\nTwo governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which were\nplates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were discussing\nwhether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. Nat\xc3\xa1sha sat down,\nlistened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air, and then got\nup again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe island of Madagascar,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cMa-da-gas-car,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nrepeated, articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to\nMadame Schoss who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the\nroom.\n\nHer brother P\xc3\xa9tya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on him\nhe was preparing fireworks to let off that night.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cP\xc3\xa9tya! P\xc3\xa9tya!\xe2\x80\x9d she called to him. \xe2\x80\x9cCarry me downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her\narms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t... the island of Madagascar!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and jumping off\nhis back she went downstairs.\n\nHaving as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made\nsure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was dull,\nNat\xc3\xa1sha betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar, sat down\nin a dark corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her fingers over\nthe strings in the bass, picking out a passage she recalled from an\nopera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew. What she drew from\nthe guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners, but in her\nimagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds.\nShe sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light\nescaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered. She\nwas in a mood for brooding on the past.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Nat\xc3\xa1sha glanced\nat her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her that\nshe remembered the light falling through that crack once before and\nS\xc3\xb3nya passing with a glass in her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYes it was exactly the\nsame,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, what is this?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, twanging a thick string.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are there!\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya with a start, and came near and\nlistened. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. A storm?\xe2\x80\x9d she ventured timidly, afraid of\nbeing wrong.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! That\xe2\x80\x99s just how she started and just how she came up smiling\ntimidly when all this happened before,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9cand in\njust the same way I thought there was something lacking in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nsang the air of the chorus so that S\xc3\xb3nya should catch it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere were\nyou going?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always find something to do, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where\xe2\x80\x99s Nicholas?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsleep, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, go and wake him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cTell him I want him to\ncome and sing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened\nbefore could be, and without solving this problem, or at all regretting\nnot having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time when she was\nwith him and he was looking at her with a lover\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be!\nAnd, worst of all, I am growing old\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing! There won\xe2\x80\x99t\nthen be in me what there is now. But perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll come today, will\ncome immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing\nroom. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.\xe2\x80\x9d She rose,\nput down the guitar, and went to the drawing room.\n\nAll the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were already\nat the tea table. The servants stood round the table\xe2\x80\x94but Prince Andrew\nwas not there and life was going on as before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here she is!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old count, when he saw Nat\xc3\xa1sha enter.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sit down by me.\xe2\x80\x9d But Nat\xc3\xa1sha stayed by her mother and\nglanced round as if looking for something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma!\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cgive him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,\nquickly!\xe2\x80\x9d and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.\n\nShe sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the\nelders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. \xe2\x80\x9cMy God, my God!\nThe same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in the\nsame way!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha, feeling with horror a sense of repulsion\nrising up in her for the whole household, because they were always the\nsame.\n\nAfter tea, Nicholas, S\xc3\xb3nya, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha went to the sitting room, to\ntheir favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it ever happen to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha to her brother, when\nthey settled down in the sitting room, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes it ever happen to you to\nfeel as if there were nothing more to come\xe2\x80\x94nothing; that everything\ngood is past? And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI have felt like that when\neverything was all right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has come\ninto my mind that I was already tired of it all, and that we must all\ndie. Once in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where there\nwas music... and suddenly I felt so depressed...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I know, I know, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha interrupted him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\nI was quite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when\nI was punished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat\nsobbing in the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and sorry\nfor everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was innocent\xe2\x80\x94that\nwas the chief thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember that I came to you\nafterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt ashamed\nto. We were terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and wanted to give\nit to you. Do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you remember,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha asked with a pensive smile, \xe2\x80\x9chow\nonce, long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us into\nthe study\xe2\x80\x94that was in the old house\xe2\x80\x94and it was dark\xe2\x80\x94we went in and\nsuddenly there stood...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Negro,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\nI remember. Even now I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether there really was a Negro, or\nif we only dreamed it or were told about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and looked\nat us....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I do remember something too,\xe2\x80\x9d S\xc3\xb3nya answered timidly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9cand they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you\nremember!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange it is! It\xe2\x80\x99s as if it were a dream! I like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom,\nand suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was that\nreal or not? Do you remember what fun it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in\nthe porch?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not the sad\nmemories of old age, but poetic, youthful ones\xe2\x80\x94those impressions of\none\xe2\x80\x99s most distant past in which dreams and realities blend\xe2\x80\x94and they\nlaughed with quiet enjoyment.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they shared\nthe same reminiscences.\n\nMuch that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she\nrecalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced. She\nsimply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.\n\nShe only really took part when they recalled S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s first arrival.\nShe told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a\ncorded jacket and her nurse had told her that she, too, would be sewn up\nwith cords.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I remember their telling me that you had been born under a\ncabbage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9cand I remember that I dared not disbelieve\nit then, but knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of\nthe sitting room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have brought the cock, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted, P\xc3\xb3lya. Tell them to take it away,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nNat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nIn the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and\nwent up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its cloth\ncovering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,\xe2\x80\x9d came the\nold countess\xe2\x80\x99 voice from the drawing room.\n\nDimmler struck a chord and, turning to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, Nicholas, and S\xc3\xb3nya,\nremarked: \xe2\x80\x9cHow quiet you young people are!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we\xe2\x80\x99re philosophizing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, glancing round for a\nmoment and then continuing the conversation. They were now discussing\ndreams.\n\nDimmler began to play; Nat\xc3\xa1sha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table,\ntook up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself quietly\nin her former place. It was dark in the room especially where they were\nsitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the silvery light of\nthe full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished the piece but\nstill sat softly running his fingers over the strings, evidently\nuncertain whether to stop or to play something else.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha in a whisper, moving closer to Nicholas\nand S\xc3\xb3nya, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when one goes on and on recalling memories, one at\nlast begins to remember what happened before one was in the world....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is metempsychosis,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya, who had always learned well,\nand remembered everything. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Egyptians believed that our souls have\nlived in animals, and will go back into animals again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we ever were in animals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\nstill in a whisper though the music had ceased. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am certain that\nwe were angels somewhere there, and have been here, and that is why we\nremember....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I join you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat\ndown by them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I\nwas before?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha rejoined with conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cThe soul is\nimmortal\xe2\x80\x94well then, if I shall always live I must have lived before,\nlived for a whole eternity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Dimmler,\nwho had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now\nspoke as quietly and seriously as they.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it hard to imagine eternity?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is now\ntoday, and it will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday, and\nthe day before....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha! Now it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn. Sing me something,\xe2\x80\x9d they heard the\ncountess say. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you sitting there like conspirators?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all want to,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nat\xc3\xa1sha, but all the\nsame she rose.\n\nNone of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break off\ntheir conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but\nNat\xc3\xa1sha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing\nas usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the\nresonance was best, Nat\xc3\xa1sha began to sing her mother\xe2\x80\x99s favorite song.\n\nShe had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had\nsung, and long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The\ncount, from his study where he was talking to M\xc3\xadtenka, heard her and,\nlike a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, blundered in his talk\nwhile giving orders to the steward, and at last stopped, while M\xc3\xadtenka\nstood in front of him also listening and smiling. Nicholas did not take\nhis eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her. S\xc3\xb3nya, as she\nlistened, thought of the immense difference there was between herself\nand her friend, and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as\nbewitching as her cousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad\nsmile and with tears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She\nthought of Nat\xc3\xa1sha and of her own youth, and of how there was something\nunnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Prince\nAndrew.\n\nDimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with\nclosed eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Countess,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a European talent, she\nhas nothing to learn\xe2\x80\x94what softness, tenderness, and strength....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess,\nnot realizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her\nthat Nat\xc3\xa1sha had too much of something, and that because of this\nshe would not be happy. Before Nat\xc3\xa1sha had finished singing,\nfourteen-year-old P\xc3\xa9tya rushed in delightedly, to say that some mummers\nhad arrived.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha stopped abruptly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIdiot!\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair, threw\nherself on it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long\ntime.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, Mamma, really it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing; only P\xc3\xa9tya startled\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs\nstill choked her.\n\nThe mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks,\ninnkeepers, and ladies\xe2\x80\x94frightening and funny\xe2\x80\x94bringing in with\nthem the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first\ntimidly, into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed\ninto the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and more merrily\nand heartily, they started singing, dancing, and playing Christmas\ngames. The countess, when she had identified them and laughed at their\ncostumes, went into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom,\nsmiling radiantly and applauding the players. The young people had\ndisappeared.\n\nHalf an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the\nballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt\xe2\x80\x94this was Nicholas. A Turkish\ngirl was P\xc3\xa9tya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and a\nCircassian was S\xc3\xb3nya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.\n\nAfter the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from those\nwho were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided that their\ncostumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere.\n\nNicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to take\nthem all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them about a\ndozen of the serf mummers and drive to \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, why disturb the old fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\nyou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the\nMelyuk\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMelyuk\xc3\xb3va was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and\ngovernesses, lived three miles from the Rost\xc3\xb3vs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in the old count, thoroughly\naroused. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll dress up at once and go with them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make\nPashette open her eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad leg all\nthese last days. It was decided that the count must not go, but that if\nLouisa Iv\xc3\xa1novna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the young ladies\nmight go to the Melyuk\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99, S\xc3\xb3nya, generally so timid and shy, more\nurgently than anyone begging Louisa Iv\xc3\xa1novna not to refuse.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows were\nextraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very handsome,\nand she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her. Some\ninner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and\nin her male attire she seemed quite a different person. Louisa Iv\xc3\xa1novna\nconsented to go, and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and\nsmall bells, their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow,\ndrove up to the porch.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing\nfrom one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax when they all\ncame out into the frost and got into the sleighs, talking, calling to\none another, laughing, and shouting.\n\nTwo of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the\nold count\xe2\x80\x99s with a trotter from the Orl\xc3\xb3v stud as shaft horse,\nthe fourth was Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 own with a short shaggy black shaft horse.\nNicholas, in his old lady\xe2\x80\x99s dress over which he had belted his hussar\novercoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.\n\nIt was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal\nharness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked round in alarm\nat the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, S\xc3\xb3nya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99\nsleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and P\xc3\xa9tya, into the old count\xe2\x80\x99s, and the\nrest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go ahead, Zakh\xc3\xa1r!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Nicholas to his father\xe2\x80\x99s\ncoachman, wishing for a chance to race past him.\n\nThe old count\xe2\x80\x99s troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward,\nsqueaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its deep-toned\nbell clanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts of the\nmiddle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered like sugar,\nand threw it up.\n\nNicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the others\nmoved noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove at a steady\ntrot along the narrow road. While they drove past the garden the shadows\nof the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant\nmoonlight, but as soon as they were past the fence, the snowy plain\nbathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering\nlike diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows. Bang, bang! went the\nfirst sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road, and each of\nthe other sleighs jolted in the same way, and rudely breaking the\nfrost-bound stillness, the troykas began to speed along the road, one\nafter the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hare\xe2\x80\x99s track, a lot of tracks!\xe2\x80\x9d rang out Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s voice\nthrough the frost-bound air.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow light it is, Nicholas!\xe2\x80\x9d came S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\n\nNicholas glanced round at S\xc3\xb3nya, and bent down to see her face closer.\nQuite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up\nat him from her sable furs\xe2\x80\x94so close and yet so distant\xe2\x80\x94in the\nmoonlight.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat used to be S\xc3\xb3nya,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, and looked at her closer and\nsmiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Nicholas?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said he and turned again to the horses.\n\nWhen they came out onto the beaten highroad\xe2\x80\x94polished by sleigh runners\nand cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were visible in the\nmoonlight\xe2\x80\x94the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and\nincreased their pace. The near side horse, arching his head and breaking\ninto a short canter, tugged at his traces. The shaft horse swayed from\nside to side, moving his ears as if asking: \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it time to begin\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d In front, already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing\nfarther and farther off, the black horses driven by Zakh\xc3\xa1r could be\nclearly seen against the white snow. From that sleigh one could hear the\nshouts, laughter, and voices of the mummers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGee up, my darlings!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one\nside and flourishing the whip.\n\nIt was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the\nside horses who pulled harder\xe2\x80\x94ever increasing their gallop\xe2\x80\x94that\none noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With\nscreams, squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses\nto gallop\xe2\x80\x94the other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily\nbeneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and\nready to put on speed when required.\n\nNicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and\ncoming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the Kos\xc3\xb3y meadow, I suppose.\nBut no\xe2\x80\x94this is something new I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen before. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t\nthe Kos\xc3\xb3y meadow nor the D\xc3\xabmkin hill, and heaven only knows what it\nis! It is something new and enchanted. Well, whatever it may be...\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd shouting to his horses, he began to pass the first sleigh.\n\nZakh\xc3\xa1r held back his horses and turned his face, which was already\ncovered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.\n\nNicholas gave the horses the rein, and Zakh\xc3\xa1r, stretching out his arms,\nclucked his tongue and let his horses go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, look out, master!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\n\nFaster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster moved\nthe feet of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to draw ahead.\nZakh\xc3\xa1r, while still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with the\nreins.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo you won\xe2\x80\x99t, master!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\nNicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakh\xc3\xa1r. The horses\nshowered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh\xe2\x80\x94beside\nthem sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of\nswiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing.\nThe whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls\nshrieking were heard from different sides.\n\nAgain checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were still\nsurrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with\nstars.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cZakh\xc3\xa1r is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the\nleft?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cAre we getting to the Melyuk\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99? Is\nthis Melyuk\xc3\xb3vka? Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows\nwhat is happening to us\xe2\x80\x94but it is very strange and pleasant whatever\nit is.\xe2\x80\x9d And he looked round in the sleigh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the\nstrange, pretty, unfamiliar people\xe2\x80\x94the one with fine eyebrows and\nmustache.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think this used to be Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\nwas Madame Schoss, but perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s not, and this Circassian with the\nmustache I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I love her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you cold?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nThey did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh behind\nshouted something\xe2\x80\x94probably something funny\xe2\x80\x94but they could not make\nout what he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d some voices answered, laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a glitter\nof diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy\nbuildings and the shrill yells of some animals. And if this is really\nMelyuk\xc3\xb3vka, it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and\nhave come to Melyuk\xc3\xb3vka,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas.\n\nIt really was Melyuk\xc3\xb3vka, and maids and footmen with merry faces came\nrunning, out to the porch carrying candles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked someone in the porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mummers from the count\xe2\x80\x99s. I know by the horses,\xe2\x80\x9d replied some\nvoices.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nPelag\xc3\xa9ya Dan\xc3\xadlovna Melyuk\xc3\xb3va, a broadly built, energetic woman\nwearing spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress, surrounded\nby her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull. They\nwere quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows\nthe wax figures would throw on the wall, when they heard the steps and\nvoices of new arrivals in the vestibule.\n\nHussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing their\nthroats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule,\ncame into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The\nclown\xe2\x80\x94Dimmler\xe2\x80\x94and the lady\xe2\x80\x94Nicholas\xe2\x80\x94started a dance. Surrounded\nby the screaming children the mummers, covering their faces and\ndisguising their voices, bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves\nabout the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! there\xe2\x80\x99s no recognizing them! And Nat\xc3\xa1sha! See whom\nshe looks like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr\nDimmler\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t he good! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know him! And how he dances. Dear\nme, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Circassian. Really, how becoming it is to dear S\xc3\xb3nya.\nAnd who is that? Well, you have cheered us up! Nik\xc3\xadta and Vanya\xe2\x80\x94clear\naway the tables! And we were sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha!... The\nhussar, the hussar! Just like a boy! And the legs!... I can\xe2\x80\x99t look at\nhim...\xe2\x80\x9d different voices were saying.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, the young Melyuk\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 favorite, disappeared with them into\nthe back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments\nwere called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from\nbehind the door. Ten minutes later, all the young Melyuk\xc3\xb3vs joined the\nmummers.\n\nPelag\xc3\xa9ya Dan\xc3\xadlovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the\nvisitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs,\nwent about among the mummers without removing her spectacles, peering\ninto their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any\nof them. It was not merely Dimmler and the Rost\xc3\xb3vs she failed to\nrecognize, she did not even recognize her own daughters, or her late\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s, dressing gowns and uniforms, which they had put on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is this?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked her governess, peering into the face of\nher own daughter dressed up as a Kaz\xc3\xa1n-Tartar. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it is one\nof the Rost\xc3\xb3vs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve in?\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe ordered the butler who was handing things round. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not\nforbidden by his law.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the\ndancers, who\xe2\x80\x94having decided once for all that being disguised, no one\nwould recognize them\xe2\x80\x94were not at all shy, Pelag\xc3\xa9ya Dan\xc3\xadlovna hid\nher face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook with\nirrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little S\xc3\xa1sha! Look at S\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nAfter Russian country dances and chorus dances, Pelag\xc3\xa9ya Dan\xc3\xadlovna\nmade the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a string,\nand a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together.\n\nIn an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The corked\neyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring, flushed,\nand merry faces. Pelag\xc3\xa9ya Dan\xc3\xadlovna began to recognize the mummers,\nadmired their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly how they\nsuited the young ladies, and she thanked them all for having entertained\nher so well. The visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room,\nand the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow to tell one\xe2\x80\x99s fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid an old maid who lived with the Melyuk\xc3\xb3vs, during supper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the eldest Melyuk\xc3\xb3v girl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go, it takes courage....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell what happened to the young lady!\xe2\x80\x9d said the second Melyuk\xc3\xb3v\ngirl.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d began the old maid, \xe2\x80\x9ca young lady once went out, took a\ncock, laid the table for two, all properly, and sat down. After sitting\na while, she suddenly hears someone coming... a sleigh drives up with\nharness bells; she hears him coming! He comes in, just in the shape of a\nman, like an officer\xe2\x80\x94comes in and sits down to table with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! ah!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Nat\xc3\xa1sha, rolling her eyes with horror.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes? And how... did he speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began persuading\nher; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow, but she got\nfrightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her hands. Then he\ncaught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just then....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, why frighten them?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pelag\xc3\xa9ya Dan\xc3\xadlovna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, you used to try your fate yourself...\xe2\x80\x9d said her daughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how does one do it in a barn?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on what\nyou hear; hammering and knocking\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s bad; but a sound of shifting\ngrain is good and one sometimes hears that, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPelag\xc3\xa9ya Dan\xc3\xadlovna smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten...\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut none of you would\ngo?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will; Pelag\xc3\xa9ya Dan\xc3\xadlovna, let me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why not, if you\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouisa Iv\xc3\xa1novna, may I?\xe2\x80\x9d asked S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\nWhether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or\ntalking as now, Nicholas did not leave S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s side, and gazed at her\nwith quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today, thanks\nto that burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to know her. And\nreally, that evening, S\xc3\xb3nya was brighter, more animated, and prettier\nthan Nicholas had ever seen her before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what she is like; what a fool I have been!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought\ngazing at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous\nsmile dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I go at once?\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe got up.\n\nThey told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen,\nand they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her head and\nshoulders and glanced at Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a darling that girl is!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have I been\nthinking of till now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went\nhastily to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of people\nreally had made the house stuffy.\n\nOutside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but even\nbrighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow sparkled with\nso many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real\nstars were unnoticed. The sky was black and dreary, while the earth was\ngay.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nNicholas, and running out from the porch he went round the corner of\nthe house and along the path that led to the back porch. He knew S\xc3\xb3nya\nwould pass that way. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood and\nacross and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees\nfell on the snow and on the path. This path led to the barn. The log\nwalls of the barn and its snow-covered roof, that looked as if hewn out\nof some precious stone, sparkled in the moonlight. A tree in the garden\nsnapped with the frost, and then all was again perfectly silent. His\nbosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and\ngladness.\n\nFrom the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the\nbottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard\nthe voice of an old maidservant saying, \xe2\x80\x9cStraight, straight, along the\npath, Miss. Only, don\xe2\x80\x99t look back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d answered S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and along the path\ntoward Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s feet\nin her thin shoes.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of paces\naway when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had\nknown and always slightly feared. He was in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress, with\ntousled hair and a happy smile new to S\xc3\xb3nya. She ran rapidly toward\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite different and yet the same,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas, looking at her\nface all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the cloak\nthat covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her\non the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork. S\xc3\xb3nya\nkissed him full on the lips, and disengaging her little hands pressed\nthem to his cheeks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya!... Nicholas!\xe2\x80\x9d... was all they said. They ran to the barn\nand then back again, re-entering, he by the front and she by the back\nporch.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nWhen they all drove back from Pelag\xc3\xa9ya Dan\xc3\xadlovna\xe2\x80\x99s, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who\nalways saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame Schoss\nshould go back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and S\xc3\xb3nya with Nicholas and\nthe maids.\n\nOn the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and\nkept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s\nface and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and\nhis present S\xc3\xb3nya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again.\nHe looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new S\xc3\xb3nya, and\nbeing reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss,\ninhaled the frosty air with a full breast and, looking at the ground\nflying beneath him and at the sparkling sky, felt himself again in\nfairyland.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, is it well with thee?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked from time to time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd with thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for\na moment to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s sleigh and stood on its wing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered in French, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know I have made up my\nmind about S\xc3\xb3nya?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you told her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha, suddenly beaming all over with\njoy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!...\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x94are you glad?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I did\nnot tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart she\nhas, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy\nwhile S\xc3\xb3nya was not,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I am so glad! Well,\nrun back to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nicholas, peering\ninto her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual, and\nbewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before. \xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s magical, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have done splendidly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad I seen her before as she is now,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nicholas, \xe2\x80\x9cI should\nlong ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me,\nand all would have been well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are glad and I have done right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it.\nMamma said she was angling for you. How could she say such a thing! I\nnearly stormed at Mamma. I will never let anyone say anything bad of\nS\xc3\xb3nya, for there is nothing but good in her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s all right?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas, again scrutinizing the\nexpression of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s face to see if she was in earnest. Then he\njumped down and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his sleigh.\nThe same happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache and beaming eyes\nlooking up from under a sable hood, was still sitting there, and that\nCircassian was S\xc3\xb3nya, and that S\xc3\xb3nya was certainly his future happy\nand loving wife.\n\nWhen they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the\nevening at the Melyuk\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99, the girls went to their bedroom. When they\nhad undressed, but without washing off the cork mustaches, they sat a\nlong time talking of their happiness. They talked of how they would live\nwhen they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how\nhappy they would be. On Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s table stood two looking glasses\nwhich Duny\xc3\xa1sha had prepared beforehand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too\ngood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, rising and going to the looking glasses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Nat\xc3\xa1sha; perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll see him,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking\nglasses, and sat down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see someone with a mustache,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, seeing her own face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duny\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nWith S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s help and the maid\xe2\x80\x99s, Nat\xc3\xa1sha got the glass she held\ninto the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious\nexpression and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking at the\nreceding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting (from\ntales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew, in that\nlast dim, indistinctly outlined square. But ready as she was to take the\nsmallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin, she saw nothing.\nShe began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it others see things and I don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou sit\ndown now, S\xc3\xb3nya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me.... Today I\nfeel so frightened!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, and began\nlooking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Miss S\xc3\xb3nya is sure to see something,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Duny\xc3\xa1sha;\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhile you do nothing but laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya heard this and Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s whisper:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know she will. She saw something last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor about three minutes all were silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course she will!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Nat\xc3\xa1sha, but did not finish...\nsuddenly S\xc3\xb3nya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her\neyes with her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Nat\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see? Did you? What was it?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Nat\xc3\xa1sha, holding up\nthe looking glass.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to get\nup when she heard Nat\xc3\xa1sha say, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course she will!\xe2\x80\x9d She did not\nwish to disappoint either Duny\xc3\xa1sha or Nat\xc3\xa1sha, but it was hard to sit\nstill. She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her\nwhen she covered her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw him?\xe2\x80\x9d urged Nat\xc3\xa1sha, seizing her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Wait a bit... I... saw him,\xe2\x80\x9d S\xc3\xb3nya could not help saying, not\nyet knowing whom Nat\xc3\xa1sha meant by him, Nicholas or Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I say I saw something? Others do see! Besides who\ncan tell whether I saw anything or not?\xe2\x80\x9d flashed through S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s\nmind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? Standing or lying?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew lying? Is he ill?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha, her frightened eyes fixed\non her friend.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he\nturned to me.\xe2\x80\x9d And when saying this she herself fancied she had really\nseen what she described.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and then, S\xc3\xb3nya?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and\nred....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya! When will he come back? When shall I see him! O, God, how\nafraid I am for him and for myself and about everything!...\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nbegan, and without replying to S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s words of comfort she got into\nbed, and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless,\ngazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nSoon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his love\nfor S\xc3\xb3nya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The countess, who\nhad long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this\ndeclaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that he\nmight marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father would\ngive their blessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the first time,\nfelt that his mother was displeased with him and that, despite her love\nfor him, she would not give way. Coldly, without looking at her son,\nshe sent for her husband and, when he came, tried briefly and coldly to\ninform him of the facts, in her son\xe2\x80\x99s presence, but unable to restrain\nherself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room. The old\ncount began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his\npurpose. Nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word, and his\nfather, sighing and evidently disconcerted, very soon became silent and\nwent in to the countess. In all his encounters with his son, the count\nwas always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the\nfamily fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to\nmarry an heiress and choosing the dowerless S\xc3\xb3nya. On this occasion, he\nwas only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not\nbeen in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than S\xc3\xb3nya could have\nbeen wished for, and that no one but himself with his M\xc3\xadtenka and\nhis uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family\nfinances.\n\nThe father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again,\nbut a few days later the countess sent for S\xc3\xb3nya and, with a cruelty\nneither of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to catch\nNicholas and for ingratitude. S\xc3\xb3nya listened silently with downcast\neyes to the countess\xe2\x80\x99 cruel words, without understanding what\nwas required of her. She was ready to sacrifice everything for her\nbenefactors. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case\nshe could not see what she ought to sacrifice, or for whom. She could\nnot help loving the countess and the whole Rost\xc3\xb3v family, but neither\ncould she help loving Nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended\non that love. She was silent and sad and did not reply. Nicholas felt\nthe situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his\nmother. He first implored her to forgive him and S\xc3\xb3nya and consent to\ntheir marriage, then he threatened that if she molested S\xc3\xb3nya he would\nat once marry her secretly.\n\nThe countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her before,\nreplied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying without his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s consent, and he could do the same, but that she would never\nreceive that intriguer as her daughter.\n\nExploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told\nhis mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his\nfeelings, but if that were so, he would say for the last time.... But he\nhad no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face\ncaused his mother to await with terror, and which would perhaps have\nforever remained a cruel memory to them both. He had not time to say it,\nfor Nat\xc3\xa1sha, with a pale and set face, entered the room from the door\nat which she had been listening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I\ntell you!...\xe2\x80\x9d she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma darling, it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all so... my poor, sweet darling,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid to her mother, who conscious that they had been on the brink of\na rupture gazed at her son with terror, but in the obstinacy and\nexcitement of the conflict could not and would not give way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas, I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma darling,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nHer words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which she\nwas aiming.\n\nThe countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s breast,\nwhile Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded\nthat Nicholas received a promise from his mother that S\xc3\xb3nya should not\nbe troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything\nwithout his parents\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge.\n\nFirmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment,\nto retire from the army and return and marry S\xc3\xb3nya, Nicholas, serious,\nsorrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, as it seemed to him,\npassionately in love, left at the beginning of January to rejoin his\nregiment.\n\nAfter Nicholas had gone things in the Rost\xc3\xb3v household were more\ndepressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more so on\naccount of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward\nher. The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his\naffairs, which called for some decisive action. Their town house and\nestate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they had to\ngo to Moscow. But the countess\xe2\x80\x99 health obliged them to delay their\ndeparture from day to day.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, who had borne the first period of separation from her\nbetrothed lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated and\nimpatient every day. The thought that her best days, which she would\nhave employed in loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no advantage\nto anyone, tormented her incessantly. His letters for the most part\nirritated her. It hurt her to think that while she lived only in the\nthought of him, he was living a real life, seeing new places and new\npeople that interested him. The more interesting his letters were\nthe more vexed she felt. Her letters to him, far from giving her any\ncomfort, seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation. She could\nnot write, because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing\nsincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by\nvoice, smile, and glance. She wrote to him formal, monotonous, and dry\nletters, to which she attached no importance herself, and in the rough\ncopies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling.\n\nThere was still no improvement in the countess\xe2\x80\x99 health, but it was\nimpossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\ntrousseau had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince Andrew\nwas expected in Moscow, where old Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski was spending the\nwinter, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha felt sure he had already arrived.\n\nSo the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking S\xc3\xb3nya\nand Nat\xc3\xa1sha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT: 1811 - 12\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nAfter Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s engagement to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, Pierre without any\napparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before.\nFirmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his\nbenefactor, and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man, to\nwhich he had devoted himself with such ardor\xe2\x80\x94all the zest of such a\nlife vanished after the engagement of Andrew and Nat\xc3\xa1sha and the death\nof Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich, the news of which reached him almost at the same\ntime. Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant wife\nwho now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage, acquaintance\nwith all Petersburg, and his court service with its dull formalities.\nAnd this life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome. He\nceased keeping a diary, avoided the company of the Brothers, began going\nto the club again, drank a great deal, and came once more in touch\nwith the bachelor sets, leading such a life that the Countess H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\nthought it necessary to speak severely to him about it. Pierre felt that\nshe was right, and to avoid compromising her went away to Moscow.\n\nIn Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and\nfading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon as,\ndriving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable\ntapers burning before the golden covers of the icons, the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin\nSquare with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh drivers and\nhovels of the S\xc3\xadvtsev Vrazh\xc3\xb3k, those old Moscovites who desired\nnothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending their days leisurely; when he\nsaw those old Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls, and the English Club, he\nfelt himself at home in a quiet haven. In Moscow he felt at peace, at\nhome, warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown.\n\nMoscow society, from the old women down to the children, received Pierre\nlike a long-expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him.\nFor Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, most intellectual,\nmerriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, genial nobleman of\nthe old Russian type. His purse was always empty because it was open to\neveryone.\n\nBenefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent societies,\ngypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees, Freemasons,\nchurches, and books\xe2\x80\x94no one and nothing met with a refusal from him,\nand had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from\nhim and taken him under their protection, he would have given everything\naway. There was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him. As\nsoon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of Margaux\nhe was surrounded, and talking, disputing, and joking began. When there\nwere quarrels, his kindly smile and well-timed jests reconciled the\nantagonists. The Masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not\nthere.\n\nWhen after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile,\nyielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere\nwith them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men.\nAt balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies, married and\nunmarried, liked him because without making love to any of them, he was\nequally amiable to all, especially after supper. \xe2\x80\x9cIl est charmant; il\nn\xe2\x80\x99a pas de sexe,\xe2\x80\x9d * they said of him.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cHe is charming; he has no sex.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nPierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were\nhundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.\n\nHow horrified he would have been seven years before, when he first\narrived from abroad, had he been told that there was no need for him\nto seek or plan anything, that his rut had long been shaped, eternally\npredetermined, and that wriggle as he might, he would be what all in\nhis position were. He could not have believed it! Had he not at one\ntime longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia;\nthen himself to be a Napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then\na strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the\npossibility of, and passionately desired, the regeneration of the sinful\nhuman race, and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection?\nHad he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs?\n\nBut instead of all that\xe2\x80\x94here he was, the wealthy husband of an\nunfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and\ndrinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the government\na bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal favorite in\nMoscow society. For a long time he could not reconcile himself to the\nidea that he was one of those same retired Moscow gentlemen-in-waiting\nhe had so despised seven years before.\n\nSometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living\nthis life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought of how\nmany, like himself, had entered that life and that club temporarily,\nwith all their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single\ntooth or hair remained.\n\nIn moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to\nhim that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired\ngentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were empty, stupid,\ncontented fellows, satisfied with their position, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile I am still\ndiscontented and want to do something for mankind. But perhaps all these\ncomrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new, a\npath in life of their own, and like me were brought by force of\ncircumstances, society, and race\xe2\x80\x94by that elemental force against which\nman is powerless\xe2\x80\x94to the condition I am in,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself in\nmoments of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no longer\ndespised, but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his\ncomrades in destiny, as he pitied himself.\n\nPierre no longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust\nwith life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such\nacute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for? Why? What is going on in the world?\xe2\x80\x9d he would ask himself\nin perplexity several times a day, involuntarily beginning to reflect\nanew on the meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by experience\nthat there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away\nfrom them, and took up a book, or hurried off to the club or to Apoll\xc3\xb3n\nNikol\xc3\xa1evich\xe2\x80\x99s, to exchange the gossip of the town.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, who has never cared for anything but her own body and\nis one of the stupidest women in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cis\nregarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they\npay homage to her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he\nwas great, but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor\nFrancis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The\nSpaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their\nvictory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French,\nalso through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same\nfourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards. My brother Masons swear\nby the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their\nneighbor, but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the\npoor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the Manna Seekers,\nand fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that nobody\nneeds, and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not\nunderstand. We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries\nand love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have built in\nMoscow forty times forty churches\xe2\x80\x94but yesterday a deserter was knouted\nto death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness, a\npriest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution.\xe2\x80\x9d So\nthought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception which everyone\naccepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time as if it\nwere something new. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand the deception and confusion,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cbut how am I to tell them all that I see? I have tried, and\nhave always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand\nit as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears that it must\nbe so! But I\xe2\x80\x94what is to become of me?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. He had the\nunfortunate capacity many men, especially Russians, have of seeing and\nbelieving in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of seeing the\nevil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part\nin it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with evil and\ndeception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and\nfalsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity. Yet he\nhad to live and to find occupation. It was too dreadful to be under\nthe burden of these insoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to\nany distraction in order to forget them. He frequented every kind of\nsociety, drank much, bought pictures, engaged in building, and above\nall\xe2\x80\x94read.\n\nHe read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming home, while\nhis valets were still taking off his things, he picked up a book and\nbegan to read. From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping to\ngossip in drawing rooms of the club, from gossip to carousals and women;\nfrom carousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking became more\nand more a physical and also a moral necessity. Though the doctors\nwarned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him, he\ndrank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when having poured several\nglasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant\nwarmth in his body, an amiability toward all his fellows, and a\nreadiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it\ndeeply. Only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the\nterribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was\nnot as dreadful as he had thought. He was always conscious of some\naspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or\nsupper he chatted or listened to conversation or read. But under the\ninfluence of wine he said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nget it unraveled. I have a solution ready, but have no time now\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\nthink it all out later on!\xe2\x80\x9d But the later on never came.\n\nIn the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions appeared as\ninsoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily picked up a book, and\nif anyone came to see him he was glad.\n\nSometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when\nentrenched under the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fire, if they have nothing to do, try\nhard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To\nPierre all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life:\nsome in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in women,\nsome in toys, some in horses, some in politics, some in sport, some\nin wine, and some in governmental affairs. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing is trivial, and\nnothing is important, it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same\xe2\x80\x94only to save oneself from it\nas best one can,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly not to see it, that dreadful\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAt the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski and his daughter\nmoved to Moscow. At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s\nregime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French tendency prevailed\nthere, and this, together with his past and his intellect and his\noriginality, at once made Prince Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski an object of\nparticular respect to the Moscovites and the center of the Moscow\nopposition to the government.\n\nThe prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of\nsenility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent\nevents, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which\nhe accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of this\nthe old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful\nveneration\xe2\x80\x94especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his\nold-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone, told his\nabrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing\ncriticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned house with\nits gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered footmen, and\nthe stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past century) with his\ngentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted\nto him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle. But the visitors\ndid not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw\ntheir host, there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which the\nprivate and intimate life of the house continued.\n\nLatterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary.\nThere in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures\xe2\x80\x94talks with\nthe pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hills\xe2\x80\x94and\nshe had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life. She did not\ngo out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her\ngo anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going out\nhimself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties. She\nhad quite abandoned the hope of getting married. She saw the coldness\nand malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the\nyoung men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their house. She\nhad no friends: during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in\nthe two who had been nearest to her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom\nshe had never been able to be quite frank, had now become unpleasant to\nher, and for various reasons Princess Mary avoided her. Julie, with whom\nshe had corresponded for the last five years, was in Moscow, but proved\nto be quite alien to her when they met. Just then Julie, who by the\ndeath of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow,\nwas in the full whirl of society pleasures. She was surrounded by young\nmen who, she fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth.\nJulie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels\nthat her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be\ndecided now or never. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a\nmournful smile that she now had no one to write to, since Julie\xe2\x80\x94whose\npresence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like the\nold \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his\nevenings for years, she regretted Julie\xe2\x80\x99s presence and having no one\nto write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one to\nwhom to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell to her lot just then.\nThe time for Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s return and marriage was approaching, but\nhis request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried\nout; in fact, it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless, for at every\nmention of the young Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va the old prince (who apart from\nthat was usually in a bad temper) lost control of himself. Another\nlately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old\nnephew. To her consternation she detected in herself in relation to\nlittle Nicholas some symptoms of her father\xe2\x80\x99s irritability. However\noften she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her\nnephew, almost every time that, pointer in hand, she sat down to show\nhim the French alphabet, she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly\nand easily into the child\xe2\x80\x94who was already afraid that Auntie might at\nany moment get angry\xe2\x80\x94that at his slightest inattention she trembled,\nbecame flustered and heated, raised her voice, and sometimes pulled him\nby the arm and put him in the corner. Having put him in the corner\nshe would herself begin to cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little\nNicholas, following her example, would sob, and without permission would\nleave his corner, come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and\ncomfort her. But what distressed the princess most of all was her\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s irritability, which was always directed against her and had\nof late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to\nthe ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water,\nit would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but\nthis loving despot\xe2\x80\x94the more cruel because he loved her and for that\nreason tormented himself and her\xe2\x80\x94knew how not merely to hurt and\nhumiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame\nfor everything. Of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented\nPrincess Mary more than anything else; this was his ever-increasing\nintimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea that at the first moment\nof receiving the news of his son\xe2\x80\x99s intentions had occurred to him in\njest\xe2\x80\x94that if Andrew got married he himself would marry Bourienne\xe2\x80\x94had\nevidently pleased him, and latterly he had persistently, and as it\nseemed to Princess Mary merely to offend her, shown special endearments\nto the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by\ndemonstrations of love of Bourienne.\n\nOne day in Moscow in Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s presence (she thought her father\ndid it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle\nBourienne\xe2\x80\x99s hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately.\nPrincess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few minutes later\nMademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s room smiling and\nmaking cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess Mary hastily\nwiped away her tears, went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nand evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry\nhaste at the Frenchwoman, her voice breaking: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s horrible, vile,\ninhuman, to take advantage of the weakness...\xe2\x80\x9d She did not finish.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave my room,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, and burst into sobs.\n\nNext day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed\nthat at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be\nserved first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee and from\nhabit began with the princess, the prince suddenly grew furious,\nthrew his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions to have him\nconscripted for the army.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t obey... I said it twice... and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t obey! She\nis the first person in this house; she\xe2\x80\x99s my best friend,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\nthe prince. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you allow yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he screamed in a fury,\naddressing Princess Mary for the first time, \xe2\x80\x9cto forget yourself again\nbefore her as you dared to do yesterday, I will show you who is master\nin this house. Go! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, and also her\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged\nfor her intervention.\n\nAt such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her\nsoul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his\nspectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or\nwould forget something that had just occurred, or take a false step with\nhis failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness,\nor, worst of all, at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him\nwould suddenly fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking\nhead sink over his plate. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought at such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against\nherself.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nIn 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor\xe2\x80\x94M\xc3\xa9tivier\xe2\x80\x94who had\nrapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome, amiable\nas Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an extraordinarily clever\ndoctor. He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but\nas an equal.\n\nPrince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on\nMademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him\nand had grown accustomed to him. M\xc3\xa9tivier came to see the prince about\ntwice a week.\n\nOn December 6\xe2\x80\x94St. Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 Day and the prince\xe2\x80\x99s name day\xe2\x80\x94all\nMoscow came to the prince\xe2\x80\x99s front door but he gave orders to admit no\none and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave\nto Princess Mary.\n\nM\xc3\xa9tivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered\nit proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne, * as he told\nPrincess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on that\nmorning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods. He had\nbeen going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone\nand pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be\nunderstood himself. Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed\nquerulousness, which generally culminated in a burst of rage, and she\nwent about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun\nand awaited the inevitable explosion. Until the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s arrival the\nmorning had passed off safely. After admitting the doctor, Princess Mary\nsat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she\ncould hear all that passed in the study.\n\n    * To force the guard.\n\nAt first she heard only M\xc3\xa9tivier\xe2\x80\x99s voice, then her father\xe2\x80\x99s, then\nboth voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open,\nand on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified\nM\xc3\xa9tivier with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing\ngown and fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes\nrolled downwards.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the prince, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do! French\nspy, slave of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell\nyou...\xe2\x80\x9d and he slammed the door.\n\nM\xc3\xa9tivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne\nwho at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head. Keep\ncalm, I will call again tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa9tivier; and putting his\nfingers to his lips he hastened away.\n\nThrough the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment\xe2\x80\x99s peace in my\nown house!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter M\xc3\xa9tivier\xe2\x80\x99s departure the old prince called his daughter in, and\nthe whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a spy\nhad been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list,\nand not to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was that\nscoundrel admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he said, he\ncould not have a moment\xe2\x80\x99s peace and could not die quietly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! We must part, we must part! Understand that, understand\nit! I cannot endure any more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and left the room. Then, as if\nafraid she might find some means of consolation, he returned and trying\nto appear calm added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I have said this in a\nmoment of anger. I am calm. I have thought it over, and it will be\ncarried out\xe2\x80\x94we must part; so find some place for yourself....\xe2\x80\x9d But\nhe could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one\nwho loves is capable, evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at\nher and screamed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only some fool would marry her!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he slammed the door, sent\nfor Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.\n\nAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.\n\nThese guests\xe2\x80\x94the famous Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn, Prince Lopukh\xc3\xadn with his\nnephew, General Chatr\xc3\xb3v an old war comrade of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s, and\nof the younger generation Pierre and Bor\xc3\xads Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y\xe2\x80\x94awaited the\nprince in the drawing room.\n\nBor\xc3\xads, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been\nanxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, and had contrived\nto ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an\nexception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house.\n\nThe prince\xe2\x80\x99s house did not belong to what is known as fashionable\nsociety, but his little circle\xe2\x80\x94though not much talked about in\ntown\xe2\x80\x94was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other.\nBor\xc3\xads had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in\nhis presence invited Rostopch\xc3\xadn to dinner on St. Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 Day, and\nRostopch\xc3\xadn had replied that he could not come:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince\nNicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the commander in chief. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is he?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old-fashioned\ndrawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of\na court of justice. All were silent or talked in low tones. Prince\nNicholas came in serious and taciturn. Princess Mary seemed even quieter\nand more diffident than usual. The guests were reluctant to address\nher, feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation. Count\nRostopch\xc3\xadn alone kept the conversation going, now relating the latest\ntown news, and now the latest political gossip.\n\nLopukh\xc3\xadn and the old general occasionally took part in the\nconversation. Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski listened as a presiding judge receives a\nreport, only now and then, silently or by a brief word, showing that\nhe took heed of what was being reported to him. The tone of the\nconversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was\nbeing done in the political world. Incidents were related evidently\nconfirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse, but\nwhether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped,\nor was stopped, at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the\nsovereign himself.\n\nAt dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\nseizure of the Duke of Oldenburg\xe2\x80\x99s territory, and the Russian Note,\nhostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nCount Rostopch\xc3\xadn, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times\nbefore. \xe2\x80\x9cOne only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the\ncrowned heads. Now the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s turn has come and Bonaparte doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nscruple to depose the head of the Catholic Church\xe2\x80\x94yet all keep silent!\nOur sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the Duke\nof Oldenburg\xe2\x80\x99s territory, and even...\xe2\x80\x9d Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn paused,\nfeeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was\nimpossible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOther territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of\nOldenburg,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. \xe2\x80\x9cHe shifts the Dukes about as\nI might move my serfs from Bald Hills to Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo or my Ryaz\xc3\xa1n\nestates.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable\nstrength of character and resignation,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Bor\xc3\xads, joining in\nrespectfully.\n\nHe said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor\nof being presented to the Duke. Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski glanced at the\nyoung man as if about to say something in reply, but changed his mind,\nevidently considering him too young.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised\nhow badly the Note was worded,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn in the\ncasual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.\n\nPierre looked at Rostopch\xc3\xadn with na\xc3\xafve astonishment, not understanding\nwhy he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cso\nlong as its substance is forcible?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should be\neasy to have a good style,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn.\n\nPierre now understood the count\xe2\x80\x99s dissatisfaction with the wording of\nthe Note.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up,\xe2\x80\x9d\nremarked the old prince. \xe2\x80\x9cThere in Petersburg they are always\nwriting\xe2\x80\x94not notes only but even new laws. My Andrew there has written\na whole volume of laws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!\xe2\x80\x9d\nand he laughed unnaturally.\n\nThere was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general cleared\nhis throat to draw attention.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The\nfigure cut by the new French ambassador.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the march\npast,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the general, \xe2\x80\x9cand it seems the ambassador took\nno notice and allowed himself to reply that: \xe2\x80\x98We in France pay no\nattention to such trifles!\xe2\x80\x99 The Emperor did not condescend to reply.\nAt the next review, they say, the Emperor did not once deign to address\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it was\nimpossible to pass any judgment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpudent fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know M\xc3\xa9tivier? I turned\nhim out of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him in\nspite of my request that they should let no one in,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\nglancing angrily at his daughter.\n\nAnd he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and\nthe reasons that convinced him that M\xc3\xa9tivier was a spy. Though these\nreasons were very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.\n\nAfter the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to congratulate\nthe old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.\n\nHe gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled,\nclean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told\nher that he had not forgotten the morning\xe2\x80\x99s talk, that his decision\nremained in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered his\nspeaking of it to her now.\n\nWhen they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the old\nmen sat together.\n\nPrince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the\nimpending war.\n\nHe said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we\nsought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into European\naffairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nought not to fight either for or against Austria. Our political\ninterests are all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing\nis to have an armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will never dare\nto cross the Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can we fight the French, Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d said Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at\nour youths, look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our\nKingdom of Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrench dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you turned\nM\xc3\xa9tivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and\na scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their knees. I went to\na party last night, and there out of five ladies three were Roman\nCatholics and had the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s indulgence for doing woolwork on Sundays.\nAnd they themselves sit there nearly naked, like the signboards at our\nPublic Baths if I may say so. Ah, when one looks at our young people,\nPrince, one would like to take Peter the Great\xe2\x80\x99s old cudgel out of the\nmuseum and belabor them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps\nout of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll were silent. The old prince looked at Rostopch\xc3\xadn with a smile and\nwagged his head approvingly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by, your excellency, keep well!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rostopch\xc3\xadn,\ngetting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the\nprince.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of\nhearing him!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and\noffering his cheek to be kissed.\n\nFollowing Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s example the others also rose.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nPrincess Mary as she sat listening to the old men\xe2\x80\x99s talk and\nfaultfinding, understood nothing of what she heard; she only wondered\nwhether the guests had all observed her father\xe2\x80\x99s hostile attitude\ntoward her. She did not even notice the special attentions and\namiabilities shown her during dinner by Bor\xc3\xads Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y, who was\nvisiting them for the third time already.\n\nPrincess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre, who\nhat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to\napproach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone\nin the drawing room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I stay a little longer?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, letting his stout body sink\ninto an armchair beside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou noticed nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d her look asked.\n\nPierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. He looked straight before\nhim and smiled quietly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you known that young man long, Princess?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrubetsk\xc3\xb3y.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not long....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is an agreeable young man.... Why do you ask me that?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrincess Mary, still thinking of that morning\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with her\nfather.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from\nPetersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an\nheiress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have observed that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pierre with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cand this young man now\nmanages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is\ntoo. I can read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay\nsiege to\xe2\x80\x94you or Mademoiselle Julie Kar\xc3\xa1gina. He is very attentive to\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe visits them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very often. And do you know the new way of courting?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPierre with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good\nhumored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Princess Mary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy. He is very\nmelancholy with Mademoiselle Kar\xc3\xa1gina,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s kindly\nface and still thinking of her own sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a relief,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought she, \xe2\x80\x9cif I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone.\nI should like to tell everything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It\nwould be a relief. He would give me advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you marry him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel\nthat...\xe2\x80\x9d she went on in a trembling voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you can do nothing\nfor him but grieve him, and to know that you cannot alter this. Then\nthere is only one thing left\xe2\x80\x94to go away, but where could I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is wrong? What is it, Princess?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into\ntears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is the matter with me today. Don\xe2\x80\x99t take any\nnotice\xe2\x80\x94forget what I have said!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the\nprincess, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him; but\nshe only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that\nshe did not remember what she had said, and that she had no trouble\nexcept the one he knew of\xe2\x80\x94that Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s marriage threatened\nto cause a rupture between father and son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any news of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, to change the\nsubject. \xe2\x80\x9cI was told they are coming soon. I am also expecting Andrew\nany day. I should like them to meet here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how does he now regard the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre, referring to\nthe old prince.\n\nPrincess Mary shook her head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done? In a few months the year will be up. The thing\nis impossible. I only wish I could spare my brother the first moments.\nI wish they would come sooner. I hope to be friends with her. You have\nknown them a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me honestly\nthe whole truth: what sort of girl is she, and what do you think of\nher?\xe2\x80\x94The real truth, because you know Andrew is risking so much doing\nthis against his father\xe2\x80\x99s will that I should like to know....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAn undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and\nrepeated requests to be told the whole truth, expressed ill-will on\nthe princess\xe2\x80\x99 part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that\nhe should disapprove of Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s choice; but in reply he said what he\nfelt rather than what he thought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to answer your question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, blushing\nwithout knowing why. \xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what sort of girl she is;\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t analyze her at all. She is enchanting, but what makes her so I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. That is all one can say about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary sighed, and the expression on her face said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I expected and feared.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she clever?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\nPierre considered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet\xe2\x80\x94yes. She does not deign to be\nclever.... Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear they are expected very soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\nPrincess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future\nsister-in-law as soon as the Rost\xc3\xb3vs arrived and to try to accustom the\nold prince to her.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nBor\xc3\xads had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg, so\nwith the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered between\nthe two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though Princess\nMary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie, he,\nwithout knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to her. When they\nhad last met on the old prince\xe2\x80\x99s name day, she had answered at random\nall his attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently not listening to what\nhe was saying.\n\nJulie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a\nmanner peculiar to herself.\n\nShe was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become\nvery wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself not\nmerely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She\nwas confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very\nwealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less\ndangerous she became to men, and the more freely they could associate\nwith her and avail themselves of her suppers, soirees, and the animated\ncompany that assembled at her house, without incurring any obligation.\nA man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day\nto the house when there was a girl of seventeen there, for fear of\ncompromising her and committing himself, would now go boldly every day\nand treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance.\n\nThat winter the Kar\xc3\xa1gins\xe2\x80\x99 house was the most agreeable and hospitable\nin Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties, a large\ncompany, chiefly of men, gathered there every day, supping at midnight\nand staying till three in the morning. Julie never missed a ball, a\npromenade, or a play. Her dresses were always of the latest fashion.\nBut in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and\ntold everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love,\nor any of the joys of life, and expected peace only \xe2\x80\x9cyonder.\xe2\x80\x9d She\nadopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment, like a\ngirl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by\nhim. Though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in\nthat light, and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered\nmuch in life. This melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing\nherself, did not hinder the young people who came to her house from\npassing the time pleasantly. Every visitor who came to the house paid\nhis tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused\nhimself with society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts\nrim\xc3\xa9s, which were in vogue at the Kar\xc3\xa1gins\xe2\x80\x99. Only a few of these\nyoung men, among them Bor\xc3\xads, entered more deeply into Julie\xe2\x80\x99s\nmelancholy, and with these she had prolonged conversations in private\non the vanity of all worldly things, and to them she showed her albums\nfilled with mournful sketches, maxims, and verses.\n\nTo Bor\xc3\xads, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early\ndisillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of friendship\nas she who had herself suffered so much could render, and showed him\nher album. Bor\xc3\xads sketched two trees in the album and wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cRustic\ntrees, your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:\n\n    La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.\n    Ah! contre les douleurs il n\xe2\x80\x99y a pas d\xe2\x80\x99autre asile. *\n\n    * Death gives relief and death is peaceful.\n      Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge.\n\nJulie said this was charming\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid to Bor\xc3\xads, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a\nbook. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness\nand despair, showing the possibility of consolation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn reply Bor\xc3\xads wrote these lines:\n\n    Aliment de poison d\xe2\x80\x99une \xc3\xa2me trop sensible,\n    Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,\n    Tendre m\xc3\xa9lancholie, ah, viens me consoler,\n    Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,\n    Et m\xc3\xaale une douceur secr\xc3\xa8te\n    A ces pleurs que je sens couler. *\n\n      *Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,\n     Thou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,\n     Tender melancholy, ah, come to console me,\n     Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,\n     And mingle a secret sweetness\n     With these tears that I feel to be flowing.\n\nFor Bor\xc3\xads, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. Bor\xc3\xads\nread Poor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted the reading\nbecause of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large gatherings\nJulie and Bor\xc3\xads looked on one another as the only souls who understood\none another in a world of indifferent people.\n\nAnna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna, who often visited the Kar\xc3\xa1gins, while playing cards\nwith the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s dowry (she was\nto have two estates in P\xc3\xa9nza and the Nizheg\xc3\xb3rod forests). Anna\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the\nwealthy Julie with emotion, and resignation to the Divine will.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to\nthe daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cBor\xc3\xads says his soul finds repose at your house. He has\nsuffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to\nthe mother. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how fond I have grown\nof Julie latterly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her son. \xe2\x80\x9cBut who could help loving\nher? She is an angelic being! Ah, Bor\xc3\xads, Bor\xc3\xads!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she paused.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how I pity her mother,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on; \xe2\x80\x9ctoday she showed me her\naccounts and letters from P\xc3\xa9nza (they have enormous estates there), and\nshe, poor thing, has no one to help her, and they do cheat her so!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother. He\nlaughed blandly at her na\xc3\xafve diplomacy but listened to what she had\nto say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the P\xc3\xa9nza and\nNizheg\xc3\xb3rod estates.\n\nJulie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and\nwas ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of repulsion for her,\nfor her passionate desire to get married, for her artificiality, and\na feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still\nrestrained Bor\xc3\xads. His leave was expiring. He spent every day and whole\ndays at the Kar\xc3\xa1gins\xe2\x80\x99, and every day on thinking the matter over\ntold himself that he would propose tomorrow. But in Julie\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\nlooking at her red face and chin (nearly always powdered), her moist\neyes, and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from\nmelancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss, Bor\xc3\xads could not\nutter the decisive words, though in imagination he had long regarded\nhimself as the possessor of those P\xc3\xa9nza and Nizheg\xc3\xb3rod estates and\nhad apportioned the use of the income from them. Julie saw Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99\nindecision, and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was\nrepulsive to him, but her feminine self-deception immediately supplied\nher with consolation, and she told herself that he was only shy from\nlove. Her melancholy, however, began to turn to irritability, and not\nlong before Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 departure she formed a definite plan of action.\nJust as Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 leave of absence was expiring, Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin made\nhis appearance in Moscow, and of course in the Kar\xc3\xa1gins\xe2\x80\x99 drawing\nroom, and Julie, suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became cheerful and\nvery attentive to Kur\xc3\xa1gin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna to her son, \xe2\x80\x9cI know from a\nreliable source that Prince Vas\xc3\xadli has sent his son to Moscow to get\nhim married to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for\nher. What do you think of it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole\nmonth of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing all\nthe revenue from the P\xc3\xa9nza estates which he had already mentally\napportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another, and\nespecially into the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained Bor\xc3\xads. He drove\nto the Kar\xc3\xa1gins\xe2\x80\x99 with the firm intention of proposing. Julie met\nhim in a gay, careless manner, spoke casually of how she had enjoyed\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s ball, and asked when he was leaving. Though Bor\xc3\xads had\ncome intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be\ntender, he began speaking irritably of feminine inconstancy, of how\neasily women can turn from sadness to joy, and how their moods depend\nsolely on who happens to be paying court to them. Julie was offended and\nreplied that it was true that a woman needs variety, and the same thing\nover and over again would weary anyone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I should advise you...\xe2\x80\x9d Bor\xc3\xads began, wishing to sting her;\nbut at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might\nhave to leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have\nvainly wasted his efforts\xe2\x80\x94which was a thing he never allowed to\nhappen.\n\nHe checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes to\navoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability had\nsuddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were fixed on\nhim with greedy expectation. \xe2\x80\x9cI can always arrange so as not to see\nher often,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Bor\xc3\xads. \xe2\x80\x9cThe affair has been begun and must be\nfinished!\xe2\x80\x9d He blushed hotly, raised his eyes to hers, and said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know my feelings for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was no need to say more: Julie\xe2\x80\x99s face shone with triumph and\nself-satisfaction; but she forced Bor\xc3\xads to say all that is said on such\noccasions\xe2\x80\x94that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more\nthan her. She knew that for the P\xc3\xa9nza estates and Nizheg\xc3\xb3rod forests\nshe could demand this, and she received what she demanded.\n\nThe affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and\nmelancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a splendid house in\nPetersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAt the end of January old Count Rost\xc3\xb3v went to Moscow with Nat\xc3\xa1sha and\nS\xc3\xb3nya. The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was\nimpossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in\nMoscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near\nMoscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his\nfuture daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski while he was in Moscow\ncould not be missed. The Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 Moscow house had not been heated\nthat winter and, as they had come only for a short time and the countess\nwas not with them, the count decided to stay with M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\nAkhros\xc3\xadmova, who had long been pressing her hospitality on them.\n\nLate one evening the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 four sleighs drove into M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s courtyard in the old Kony\xc3\xbasheny street. M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna lived alone. She had already married off her daughter, and\nher sons were all in the service.\n\nShe held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly,\nloudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach\nto others for any weakness, passion, or temptation\xe2\x80\x94the possibility of\nwhich she did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing\njacket, she attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out:\non holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on\naffairs of which she never spoke to anyone. On ordinary days, after\ndressing, she received petitioners of various classes, of whom there\nwere always some. Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing meal\nat which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she played\na game of boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read\nto her while she knitted. She rarely made an exception and went out to\npay visits, and then only to the most important persons in the town.\n\nShe had not yet gone to bed when the Rost\xc3\xb3vs arrived and the pulley of\nthe hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the Rost\xc3\xb3vs and their\nservants. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, with her spectacles hanging down on her\nnose and her head flung back, stood in the hall doorway looking with\na stern, grim face at the new arrivals. One might have thought she was\nangry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out, had she\nnot at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants\nfor the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe count\xe2\x80\x99s things? Bring them here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing to the\nportmanteaus and not greeting anyone. \xe2\x80\x9cThe young ladies\xe2\x80\x99? There\nto the left. Now what are you dawdling for?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried to the maids.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet the samovar ready!... You\xe2\x80\x99ve grown plumper and prettier,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nremarked, drawing Nat\xc3\xa1sha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold)\nto her by the hood. \xe2\x80\x9cFoo! You are cold! Now take off your things,\nquick!\xe2\x80\x9d she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re half frozen, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour,\nS\xc3\xb3nya dear!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning to S\xc3\xb3nya and indicating by this\nFrench greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude\ntoward her.\n\nWhen they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things and\ntidied themselves up after their journey, M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna kissed them\nall in due order.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was\nhigh time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, giving Nat\xc3\xa1sha a significant look. \xe2\x80\x9cThe old\nman is here and his son\xe2\x80\x99s expected any day. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make his\nacquaintance. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll speak of that later on,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, glancing\nat S\xc3\xb3nya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her\npresence. \xe2\x80\x9cNow listen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the count. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want\ntomorrow? Whom will you send for? Shinsh\xc3\xadn?\xe2\x80\x9d she crooked one of her\nfingers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sniveling Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna? That\xe2\x80\x99s two. She\xe2\x80\x99s here\nwith her son. The son is getting married! Then Bez\xc3\xbakhov, eh? He is here\ntoo, with his wife. He ran away from her and she came galloping after\nhim. He dined with me on Wednesday. As for them\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she pointed to\nthe girls\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ctomorrow I\xe2\x80\x99ll take them first to the Iberian shrine\nof the Mother of God, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll drive to the Super-Rogue\xe2\x80\x99s.\nI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll have everything new. Don\xe2\x80\x99t judge by me: sleeves\nnowadays are this size! The other day young Princess Ir\xc3\xadna Vas\xc3\xadlevna\ncame to see me; she was an awful sight\xe2\x80\x94looked as if she had put two\nbarrels on her arms. You know not a day passes now without some new\nfashion.... And what have you to do yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked the count\nsternly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a\npurchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If you\nwill be so kind, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a\nday, and leave my lassies with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. All right. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be safe with me, as safe as in\nChancery! I\xe2\x80\x99ll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and\npet them a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, touching her goddaughter and\nfavorite, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, on the cheek with her large hand.\n\nNext morning M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian\nshrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so\nafraid of M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna that she always let her have costumes at\na loss merely to get rid of her. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna ordered almost the\nwhole trousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the room\nexcept Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and then called her pet to her armchair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed.\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I\xe2\x80\x99ve known\nhim since he was so high.\xe2\x80\x9d She held her hand a couple of feet from the\nground. Nat\xc3\xa1sha blushed happily. \xe2\x80\x9cI like him and all his family.\nNow listen! You know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son\xe2\x80\x99s\nmarrying. The old fellow\xe2\x80\x99s crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not\na child and can shift without him, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not nice to enter a family\nagainst a father\xe2\x80\x99s will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly.\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re a clever girl and you\xe2\x80\x99ll know how to manage. Be kind, and use\nyour wits. Then all will be well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha remained silent, from shyness M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna supposed, but\nreally because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love\nof Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs\nthat no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew, he\nloved her only, and was to come one of these days and take her. She\nwanted nothing more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your\nfuture sister-in-law. \xe2\x80\x98Husbands\xe2\x80\x99 sisters bring up blisters,\xe2\x80\x99\nbut this one wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two\ntogether. Tomorrow you\xe2\x80\x99ll go with your father to see her. Be very\nnice and affectionate to her: you\xe2\x80\x99re younger than she. When he comes,\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll find you already know his sister and father and are liked by\nthem. Am I right or not? Won\xe2\x80\x99t that be best?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it will,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha answered reluctantly.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nNext day, by M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s advice, Count Rost\xc3\xb3v took Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nto call on Prince Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. The count did not set out\ncheerfully on this visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well remembered\nthe last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the\nenrollment, when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to\nlisten to an angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of\nmen. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, on the other hand, having put on her best gown, was in\nthe highest spirits. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t help liking me,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody always has liked me, and I am so willing to do anything\nthey wish, so ready to be fond of him\xe2\x80\x94for being his father\xe2\x80\x94and of\nher\xe2\x80\x94for being his sister\xe2\x80\x94that there is no reason for them not to\nlike me....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdv\xc3\xadzhenka and entered\nthe vestibule.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the Lord have mercy on us!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, half in jest,\nhalf in earnest; but Nat\xc3\xa1sha noticed that her father was flurried on\nentering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince\nand princess were at home.\n\nWhen they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the\nservants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by\nanother in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a\nmaidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning\nthe princess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced\nto the Rost\xc3\xb3vs that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess\nbegged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the visitors\nwas Mademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and daughter\nwith special politeness and showed them to the princess\xe2\x80\x99 room. The\nprincess, looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in patches, ran\nin to meet the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly trying to appear\ncordial and at ease. From the first glance Princess Mary did not like\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. She thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and\nvain. She did not at all realize that before having seen her future\nsister-in-law she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her\nbeauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by jealousy of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\nlove for her. Apart from this insuperable antipathy to her, Princess\nMary was agitated just then because on the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 being announced,\nthe old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them, that\nPrincess Mary might do so if she chose, but they were not to be admitted\nto him. She had decided to receive them, but feared lest the prince\nmight at any moment indulge in some freak, as he seemed much upset by\nthe Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 visit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, my dear princess, I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought you my songstress,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe count, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince\nmight appear. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad you should get to know one another... very\nsorry the prince is still ailing,\xe2\x80\x9d and after a few more commonplace\nremarks he rose. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me to leave my Nat\xc3\xa1sha in your\nhands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive round to see Anna\nSem\xc3\xabnovna, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite near in the Dogs\xe2\x80\x99 Square, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll\ncome back for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his\ndaughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk\nto one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of\nencountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention\nthis to his daughter, but Nat\xc3\xa1sha noticed her father\xe2\x80\x99s nervousness\nand anxiety and felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still\nangrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold and\ndefiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody. The\nprincess told the count that she would be delighted, and only begged him\nto stay longer at Anna Sem\xc3\xabnovna\xe2\x80\x99s, and he departed.\n\nDespite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x94who wished\nto have a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate with Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x94Mademoiselle Bourienne\nremained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and\ntheaters. Nat\xc3\xa1sha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in\nthe anteroom, by her father\xe2\x80\x99s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner\nof the princess who\xe2\x80\x94she thought\xe2\x80\x94was making a favor of receiving her,\nand so everything displeased her. She did not like Princess Mary, whom\nshe thought very plain, affected, and dry. Nat\xc3\xa1sha suddenly shrank\ninto herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated\nPrincess Mary still more. After five minutes of irksome, constrained\nconversation, they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly\napproaching. Princess Mary looked frightened.\n\nThe door opened and the old prince, in a dressing gown and a white\nnightcap, came in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, madam!\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cMadam, Countess... Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va, if\nI am not mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... I did not\nknow, madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with\na visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg you\nto excuse me... God is my witness, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated,\nstressing the word \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that\nPrincess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her\nfather or at Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nNor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.\nMademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not\nknow,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the old man, and after looking Nat\xc3\xa1sha over from head\nto foot he went out.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this\napparition and began speaking about the prince\xe2\x80\x99s indisposition.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence, and the\nlonger they did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater\ngrew their antipathy to one another.\n\nWhen the count returned, Nat\xc3\xa1sha was impolitely pleased and hastened\nto get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who\ncould place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an\nhour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nbegin talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary. She\nknew what she ought to have said to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, but she had been unable\nto say it because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and because,\nwithout knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of the\nmarriage. When the count was already leaving the room, Princess Mary\nwent up hurriedly to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, took her by the hand, and said with a\ndeep sigh:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, I must...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Natalie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to know that I am\nglad my brother has found happiness....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. Nat\xc3\xa1sha noticed\nthis and guessed its reason.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears\nchoking her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I said and what have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d thought she, as soon as she\nwas out of the room.\n\nThey waited a long time for Nat\xc3\xa1sha to come to dinner that day. She sat\nin her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing. S\xc3\xb3nya\nstood beside her, kissing her hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, what is it about?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they matter to\nyou? It will all pass, Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it, Nat\xc3\xa1sha. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your fault so why should\nyou mind? Kiss me,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed\nher wet face against her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. No one\xe2\x80\x99s to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t he come?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe came in to dinner with red eyes. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, who knew how\nthe prince had received the Rost\xc3\xb3vs, pretended not to notice how upset\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count\nand the other guests.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThat evening the Rost\xc3\xb3vs went to the Opera, for which M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna had taken a box.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not want to go, but could not refuse M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s\nkind offer which was intended expressly for her. When she came ready\ndressed into the ballroom to await her father, and looking in the large\nmirror there saw that she was pretty, very pretty, she felt even more\nsad, but it was a sweet, tender sadness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but\ndifferently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply\nembrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those searching\ninquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me, and then I\nwould make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes\xe2\x80\x94how I see those\neyes!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do his father and sister matter\nto me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and those eyes, with\nhis smile, manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better not think of\nhim; not think of him but forget him, quite forget him for the present.\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!\xe2\x80\x9d and she\nturned away from the glass, making an effort not to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\ncan S\xc3\xb3nya love Nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so\npatiently?\xe2\x80\x9d thought she, looking at S\xc3\xb3nya, who also came in quite\nready, with a fan in her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, she\xe2\x80\x99s altogether different. I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not\nenough for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at\nonce, to embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words of\nlove such as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside her\nfather, pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on\nthe frozen window, she felt still sadder and more in love, and forgot\nwhere she was going and with whom. Having fallen into the line of\ncarriages, the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels\nsqueaking over the snow. Nat\xc3\xa1sha and S\xc3\xb3nya, holding up their dresses,\njumped out quickly. The count got out helped by the footmen, and,\npassing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers,\nthey all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes.\nThrough the closed doors the music was already audible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, your hair!...\xe2\x80\x9d whispered S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\nAn attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and\nopened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the\ndoor rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and\nshoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before\ntheir eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy\nat Nat\xc3\xa1sha. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being\nplayed. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, smoothing her gown, went in with S\xc3\xb3nya and sat down,\nscanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite. A sensation she had not\nexperienced for a long time\xe2\x80\x94that of hundreds of eyes looking at\nher bare arms and neck\xe2\x80\x94suddenly affected her both agreeably and\ndisagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories, desires and\nemotions associated with that feeling.\n\nThe two remarkably pretty girls, Nat\xc3\xa1sha and S\xc3\xb3nya, with Count Rost\xc3\xb3v\nwho had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted general\nattention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s engagement\nto Prince Andrew, and knew that the Rost\xc3\xb3vs had lived in the country\never since, and all looked with curiosity at a fianc\xc3\xa9e who was making\none of the best matches in Russia.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the country,\nand that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty.\nShe struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty,\ncombined with her indifference to everything about her. Her black eyes\nlooked at the crowd without seeking anyone, and her delicate arm, bare\nto above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently\nunconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in time to the music,\ncrumpling her program. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, there\xe2\x80\x99s Al\xc3\xa9nina,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya,\n\xe2\x80\x9cwith her mother, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, Michael Kir\xc3\xadlovich has grown still stouter!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the\ncount.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at our Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna\xe2\x80\x94what a headdress she has on!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Kar\xc3\xa1gins, Julie\xe2\x80\x94and Bor\xc3\xads with them. One can see at once that\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re engaged....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrubetsk\xc3\xb3y has proposed?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I heard it today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shinsh\xc3\xadn, coming into the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 box.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked in the direction in which her father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were\nturned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her\nface and a string of pearls round her thick red neck\xe2\x80\x94which Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nknew was covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and leaning\nover with an ear to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, was Bor\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 handsome smoothly\nbrushed head. He looked at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs from under his brows and said\nsomething, smiling, to his betrothed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are talking about us, about me and him!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble\nthemselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBehind them sat Anna Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna wearing a green headdress and with a\nhappy look of resignation to the will of God on her face. Their box was\npervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which Nat\xc3\xa1sha knew\nso well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly remembered all\nthat had been so humiliating in her morning\xe2\x80\x99s visit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh,\nbetter not think of it\xe2\x80\x94not till he comes back!\xe2\x80\x9d she told herself,\nand began looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in\nthe stalls. In the front, in the very center, leaning back against\nthe orchestra rail, stood D\xc3\xb3lokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair\nbrushed up into a huge shock. He stood in full view of the audience,\nwell aware that he was attracting everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention, yet as much at\nease as though he were in his own room. Around him thronged Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s\nmost brilliant young men, whom he evidently dominated.\n\nThe count, laughing, nudged the blushing S\xc3\xb3nya and pointed to her\nformer adorer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you recognize him?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where has he sprung from?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe asked, turning to Shinsh\xc3\xadn. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t he vanish somewhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Shinsh\xc3\xadn. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was in the Caucasus and ran\naway from there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling\nprince in Persia, where he killed the Shah\xe2\x80\x99s brother. Now all the\nMoscow ladies are mad about him! It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98D\xc3\xb3lokhov the Persian\xe2\x80\x99 that\ndoes it! We never hear a word but D\xc3\xb3lokhov is mentioned. They swear\nby him, they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet.\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov and Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin have turned all our ladies\xe2\x80\x99 heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed\nplump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string of\nlarge pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress\nand took a long time settling into her place.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and pearls\nand coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls.\nWhile Nat\xc3\xa1sha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady\nlooked round and, meeting the count\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, nodded to him and smiled.\nShe was the Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova, Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and the count, who\nknew everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been here long, Countess?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call,\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll call to kiss your hand. I\xe2\x80\x99m here on business and have brought\nmy girls with me. They say Sem\xc3\xabnova acts marvelously. Count Pierre\nnever used to forget us. Is he here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he meant to look in,\xe2\x80\x9d answered H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, and glanced\nattentively at Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nCount Rost\xc3\xb3v resumed his seat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandsome, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a woman one could easily\nfall in love with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor\ntapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in the stalls,\nand the curtain rose.\n\nAs soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent, and\nall the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and all the\nwomen with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole attention with\neager curiosity to the stage. Nat\xc3\xa1sha too began to look at it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides was\nsome painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a cloth\nstretched over boards. In the center of the stage sat some girls in red\nbodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat\napart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of green cardboard\nwas glued. They all sang something. When they had finished their song\nthe girl in white went up to the prompter\xe2\x80\x99s box and a man with tight\nsilk trousers over his stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger,\nwent up to her and began singing, waving his arms about.\n\nFirst the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, then they\nboth paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand\nof the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with\nher. They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping\nand shouting, while the man and woman on the stage\xe2\x80\x94who represented\nlovers\xe2\x80\x94began smiling, spreading out their arms, and bowing.\n\nAfter her life in the country, and in her present serious mood, all this\nseemed grotesque and amazing to Nat\xc3\xa1sha. She could not follow the opera\nnor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted cardboard and the\nqueerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so strangely in\nthat brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to represent, but\nit was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed\nfor the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the\naudience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she\nherself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening\non the stage, and expressed delight which to Nat\xc3\xa1sha seemed feigned.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it has to be like this!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. She kept looking\nround in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at\nthe seminude women in the boxes, especially at H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne in the next box,\nwho\xe2\x80\x94apparently quite unclothed\xe2\x80\x94sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not\ntaking her eyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded\nthe whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, Nat\xc3\xa1sha little\nby little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not\nexperienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she\nwas, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought, the\nstrangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her\nmind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and\nsinging the aria the actress was singing, then she wished to touch with\nher fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then to lean over to\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne and tickle her.\n\nAt a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song, a door\nleading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 box creaked,\nand the steps of a belated arrival were heard. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Kur\xc3\xa1gin!\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhispered Shinsh\xc3\xadn. Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova turned smiling to the newcomer,\nand Nat\xc3\xa1sha, following the direction of that look, saw an exceptionally\nhandsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet\ncourteous bearing. This was Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin whom she had seen\nand noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was now in an\nadjutant\xe2\x80\x99s uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot. He moved with\na restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been\nso good-looking and had his handsome face not worn such an expression\nof good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though the performance was\nproceeding, he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway, his sword\nand spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high.\nHaving looked at Nat\xc3\xa1sha he approached his sister, laid his well gloved\nhand on the edge of her box, nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a\nquestion, with a motion toward Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMais charmante!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, evidently referring to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who did\nnot exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his\nlips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down\nbeside D\xc3\xb3lokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way\nthat D\xc3\xb3lokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily,\nsmiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra screen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow like the brother is to the sister,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the count. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nhow handsome they both are!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShinsh\xc3\xadn, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some intrigue\nof Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s in Moscow, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha tried to overhear it just\nbecause he had said she was \xe2\x80\x9ccharmante.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about, going\nout and coming in.\n\nBor\xc3\xads came to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 box, received their congratulations very\nsimply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and S\xc3\xb3nya his fianc\xc3\xa9e\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to her wedding, and\nwent away. Nat\xc3\xa1sha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and\ncongratulated on his approaching wedding that same Bor\xc3\xads with whom\nshe had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in,\neverything seemed simple and natural.\n\nThe scantily clad H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne smiled at everyone in the same way, and\nNat\xc3\xa1sha gave Bor\xc3\xads a similar smile.\n\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most\ndistinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another\nin their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.\n\nDuring the whole of that entr\xe2\x80\x99acte Kur\xc3\xa1gin stood with D\xc3\xb3lokhov\nin front of the orchestra partition, looking at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 box.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure.\nShe even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought\nwas its most becoming aspect. Before the beginning of the second act\nPierre appeared in the stalls. The Rost\xc3\xb3vs had not seen him since\ntheir arrival. His face looked sad, and he had grown still stouter since\nNat\xc3\xa1sha last saw him. He passed up to the front rows, not noticing\nanyone. Anatole went up to him and began speaking to him, looking at and\nindicating the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 box. On seeing Nat\xc3\xa1sha Pierre grew animated\nand, hastily passing between the rows, came toward their box. When he\ngot there he leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to her for a long\ntime. While conversing with Pierre, Nat\xc3\xa1sha heard a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice in\nCountess Bez\xc3\xbakhova\xe2\x80\x99s box and something told her it was Kur\xc3\xa1gin. She\nturned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed straight into her\neyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be\nso near him, to look at him like that, to be so sure he admired her, and\nnot to be acquainted with him.\n\nIn the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there was a\nround hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were raised over\nthe footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many\npeople appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding\nthings like daggers in their hands. They began waving their arms. Then\nsome other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been\nin white and was now in light blue. They did not drag her away at once,\nbut sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, and\nbehind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and\neveryone knelt down and sang a prayer. All these things were repeatedly\ninterrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience.\n\nDuring this act every time Nat\xc3\xa1sha looked toward the stalls she saw\nAnatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair,\nstaring at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and\nit did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it.\n\nWhen the second act was over Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova rose, turned to the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 box\xe2\x80\x94her whole bosom completely exposed\xe2\x80\x94beckoned the old\ncount with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had\nentered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo make me acquainted with your charming daughters,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole town is singing their praises and I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so pleased\nby praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to become a Moscovite too, now,\xe2\x80\x9d said H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCountess Bez\xc3\xbakhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating\nwoman. She could say what she did not think\xe2\x80\x94especially what was\nflattering\xe2\x80\x94quite simply and naturally.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I am\nnot staying here long this time\xe2\x80\x94nor are you\xe2\x80\x94I will try to amuse\nthem. I have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get\nto know you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Nat\xc3\xa1sha with her stereotyped and lovely\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x9cI had heard about you from my page, Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y. Have you\nheard he is getting married? And also from my husband\xe2\x80\x99s friend\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski, Prince Andrew Bolk\xc3\xb3nski,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on with special\nemphasis, implying that she knew of his relation to Nat\xc3\xa1sha. To get\nbetter acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come\ninto her box for the rest of the performance, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha moved over to\nit.\n\nThe scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles\nwere burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the\nwalls. In the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen. The\nking waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, sang something badly\nand sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden who had been first in white\nand then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and stood beside the\nthrone with her hair down. She sang something mournfully, addressing the\nqueen, but the king waved his arm severely, and men and women with bare\nlegs came in from both sides and began dancing all together. Then the\nviolins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick\nbare legs and thin arms, separating from the others, went behind the\nwings, adjusted her bodice, returned to the middle of the stage, and\nbegan jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other. In the\nstalls everyone clapped and shouted \xe2\x80\x9cbravo!\xe2\x80\x9d Then one of the men\nwent into a corner of the stage. The cymbals and horns in the orchestra\nstruck up more loudly, and this man with bare legs jumped very high and\nwaved his feet about very rapidly. (He was Duport, who received sixty\nthousand rubles a year for this art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes,\nand galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might, and the\nman stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides. Then other men\nand women danced with bare legs. Then the king again shouted to the\nsound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly a storm\ncame on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the\norchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number away,\nand the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise and\nclatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone began\nshouting: \xe2\x80\x9cDuport! Duport! Duport!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha no longer thought this\nstrange. She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t Duport delightful?\xe2\x80\x9d H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne asked her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nDuring the entr\xe2\x80\x99acte a whiff of cold air came into H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s box,\nthe door opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying not to brush\nagainst anyone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me introduce my brother to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, her eyes\nshifting uneasily from Nat\xc3\xa1sha to Anatole.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer\nand smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was as handsome\nat close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her and told her he\nhad long wished to have this happiness\xe2\x80\x94ever since the Nar\xc3\xbdshkins\xe2\x80\x99\nball in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing\nher. Kur\xc3\xa1gin was much more sensible and simple with women than among\nmen. He talked boldly and naturally, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha was strangely and\nagreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this\nman about whom there was so much talk, but that on the contrary his\nsmile was most na\xc3\xafve, cheerful, and good-natured.\n\nKur\xc3\xa1gin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a\nprevious performance Sem\xc3\xabnova had fallen down on the stage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know, Countess,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly addressing her as an\nold, familiar acquaintance, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are getting up a costume tournament;\nyou ought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We shall all meet at\nthe Kar\xc3\xa1gins\xe2\x80\x99! Please come! No! Really, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nWhile saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face,\nher neck, and her bare arms. Nat\xc3\xa1sha knew for certain that he was\nenraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel\nconstrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that\nhe was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye\nso that he should look into hers rather than this. But looking into his\neyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of\nmodesty she had always felt between herself and other men. She did not\nknow how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself\nterribly near to this man. When she turned away she feared he might\nseize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck. They\nspoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt that they were closer to\none another than she had ever been to any man. Nat\xc3\xa1sha kept turning to\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne and to her father, as if asking what it all meant, but H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\nwas engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her\nlook, and her father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes said nothing but what they always said:\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving a good time? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDuring one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s\nprominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, to break\nthe silence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the question and\nblushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing\nsomething improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasant\nce sont les jolies femmes, * isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so? But now I like it very\nmuch indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking at her significantly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come\nto the costume tournament, Countess? Do come!\xe2\x80\x9d and putting out his\nhand to her bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be the\nprettiest there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as a\npledge!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * Are the pretty women.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did\nhimself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper\nintention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had\nnot heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she felt that\nhe was there, behind, so close behind her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nasked herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked\nstraight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the\ngood-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just\nas he was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt with\nhorror that no barrier lay between him and her.\n\nThe curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nwent back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive to the\nworld she found herself in. All that was going on before her now seemed\nquite natural, but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her\nbetrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the country did not once\nrecur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past.\n\nIn the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm\nabout, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared\ndown below. That was the only part of the fourth act that Nat\xc3\xa1sha saw.\nShe felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of this was Kur\xc3\xa1gin whom\nshe could not help watching. As they were leaving the theater Anatole\ncame up to them, called their carriage, and helped them in. As he was\nputting Nat\xc3\xa1sha in he pressed her arm above the elbow. Agitated and\nflushed she turned round. He was looking at her with glittering eyes,\nsmiling tenderly.\n\n\nOnly after she had reached home was Nat\xc3\xa1sha able clearly to think over\nwhat had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she\nwas horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera, she\ngave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God! I am lost!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could I let him?\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to\nrealize what had happened to her, but was unable either to understand\nwhat had happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark, obscure,\nand terrible. There in that enormous, illuminated theater where the\nbare-legged Duport, in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped about to the\nmusic on wet boards, and young girls and old men, and the nearly\nnaked H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried\n\xe2\x80\x9cbravo!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94there in the presence of that H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne it had all seemed\nclear and simple; but now, alone by herself, it was incomprehensible.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What was that terror I felt of him? What is this gnawing\nof conscience I am feeling now?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\n\nOnly to the old countess at night in bed could Nat\xc3\xa1sha have told all\nshe was feeling. She knew that S\xc3\xb3nya with her severe and simple views\nwould either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such\na confession. So Nat\xc3\xa1sha tried to solve what was torturing her by\nherself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I spoiled for Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s love or not?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked herself, and\nwith soothing irony replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool I am to ask that! What did\nhappen to me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t lead him on\nat all. Nobody will know and I shall never see him again,\xe2\x80\x9d she told\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it is plain that nothing has happened and there is\nnothing to repent of, and Andrew can love me still. But why \xe2\x80\x98still?\xe2\x80\x99\nO God, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he here?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha quieted herself for a moment,\nbut again some instinct told her that though all this was true, and\nthough nothing had happened, yet the former purity of her love for\nPrince Andrew had perished. And again in imagination she went over her\nwhole conversation with Kur\xc3\xa1gin, and again saw the face, gestures, and\ntender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nAnatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him\naway from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles\na year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his\ncreditors demanded from his father.\n\nHis father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the\nlast time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to\nthe commander in chief\xe2\x80\x94a post his father had procured for him\xe2\x80\x94and\nwould at last try to make a good match there. He indicated to him\nPrincess Mary and Julie Kar\xc3\xa1gina.\n\nAnatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him\nafter a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and gave\nhim money under the guise of loans.\n\nAs Shinsh\xc3\xadn had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had\nturned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that\nhe slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French\nactresses\xe2\x80\x94with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to\nbe on intimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at Dan\xc3\xadlov\xe2\x80\x99s\nor other Moscow revelers\xe2\x80\x99, drank whole nights through, outvying\neveryone else, and was at all the balls and parties of the best society.\nThere was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted\nwith a few of them at the balls. But he did not run after the unmarried\ngirls, especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain.\nThere was a special reason for this, as he had got married two years\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94a fact known only to his most intimate friends. At that time\nwhile with his regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means had\nforced him to marry his daughter. Anatole had very soon abandoned his\nwife and, for a payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law,\nhad arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor.\n\nAnatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with\nothers. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was\nimpossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had\nnever in his life done anything base. He was incapable of considering\nhow his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or\nthat action of his might be. He was convinced that, as a duck is so made\nthat it must live in water, so God had made him such that he must spend\nthirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in\nsociety. He believed this so firmly that others, looking at him, were\npersuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place\nin society or money, which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and\nevidently would not repay.\n\nHe was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning. He was\nnot vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still less could\nhe be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed his father by\nspoiling his own career, and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds. He\nwas not mean, and did not refuse anyone who asked of him. All he cared\nabout was gaiety and women, and as according to his ideas there\nwas nothing dishonorable in these tastes, and he was incapable of\nconsidering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others,\nhe honestly considered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues\nand bad people, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high.\n\nRakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence\nsimilar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of\nforgiveness. \xe2\x80\x9cAll will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all\nwill be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and\nhis Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and\ndissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kur\xc3\xa1gin and\nmade use of him for his own ends.\n\nAnatole was sincerely fond of D\xc3\xb3lokhov for his cleverness and\naudacity. D\xc3\xb3lokhov, who needed Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s name, position, and\nconnections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set, made\nuse of him and amused himself at his expense without letting the other\nfeel it. Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole, the very\nprocess of dominating another\xe2\x80\x99s will was in itself a pleasure, a\nhabit, and a necessity to D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha had made a strong impression on Kur\xc3\xa1gin. At supper after\nthe opera he described to D\xc3\xb3lokhov with the air of a connoisseur the\nattractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his\nintention of making love to her. Anatole had no notion and was incapable\nof considering what might come of such love-making, as he never had any\nnotion of the outcome of any of his actions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell my sister to ask her to dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better wait till she\xe2\x80\x99s married....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at once,\xe2\x80\x9d\npursued Anatole.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been caught once already by a \xe2\x80\x98little girl,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov who knew of Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. \xe2\x80\x9cTake care!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that can\xe2\x80\x99t happen twice! Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, with a\ngood-humored laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe day after the opera the Rost\xc3\xb3vs went nowhere and nobody came to see\nthem. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna talked to the count about something which they\nconcealed from Nat\xc3\xa1sha. Nat\xc3\xa1sha guessed they were talking about the\nold prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her.\nShe was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a\nmanservant to the Vozdv\xc3\xadzhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had\nnot arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow.\nTo her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant\nrecollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince,\nand a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause. She\ncontinually fancied that either he would never come or that something\nwould happen to her before he came. She could no longer think of him by\nherself calmly and continuously as she had done before. As soon as she\nbegan to think of him, the recollection of the old prince, of Princess\nMary, of the theater, and of Kur\xc3\xa1gin mingled with her thoughts. The\nquestion again presented itself whether she was not guilty, whether she\nhad not already broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found\nherself recalling to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and\nevery shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had\nbeen able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying\nfeeling. To the family Nat\xc3\xa1sha seemed livelier than usual, but she was\nfar less tranquil and happy than before.\n\nOn Sunday morning M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna invited her visitors to Mass at her\nparish church\xe2\x80\x94the Church of the Assumption built over the graves of\nvictims of the plague.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like those fashionable churches,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, evidently\npriding herself on her independence of thought. \xe2\x80\x9cGod is the same\neverywhere. We have an excellent priest, he conducts the service\ndecently and with dignity, and the deacon is the same. What holiness is\nthere in giving concerts in the choir? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it, it\xe2\x80\x99s just\nself-indulgence!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her whole\nhouse was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the\nservants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church. At\nher table there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had vodka\nand roast goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was the\nholiday so noticeable as in M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s broad, stern face,\nwhich on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.\n\nAfter Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room\nwhere the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a servant\nannounced that the carriage was ready, and M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna rose with\na stern air. She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and\nannounced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski to have\nan explanation with him about Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nAfter she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited on\nthe Rost\xc3\xb3vs, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha, very glad of this diversion, having shut\nherself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying\non the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and\nonly tacked together, and was turning her head to see in the glass how\nthe back fitted, she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds\nof her father\xe2\x80\x99s voice and another\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that made her\nflush. It was H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne. Nat\xc3\xa1sha had not time to take off the bodice\nbefore the door opened and Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova, dressed in a purple\nvelvet gown with a high collar, came into the room beaming with\ngood-humored amiable smiles.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my enchantress!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried to the blushing Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming! No, this is really beyond anything, my dear count,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nshe to Count Rost\xc3\xb3v who had followed her in. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you live in\nMoscow and go nowhere? No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t let you off! Mademoiselle George\nwill recite at my house tonight and there\xe2\x80\x99ll be some people, and if\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t bring your lovely girls\xe2\x80\x94who are prettier than Mademoiselle\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t know you! My husband is away in Tver or I would send\nhim to fetch you. You must come. You positively must! Between eight and\nnine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied\nrespectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the\nlooking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely. She\ndid not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually praising\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s beauty. She looked at Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s dresses and praised\nthem, as well as a new dress of her own made of \xe2\x80\x9cmetallic gauze,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhich she had received from Paris, and advised Nat\xc3\xa1sha to have one like\nit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut anything suits you, my charmer!\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked.\n\nA smile of pleasure never left Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face. She felt happy and as\nif she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova\nwho had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was\nnow so kind to her. Nat\xc3\xa1sha brightened up and felt almost in love with\nthis woman, who was so beautiful and so kind. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne for her part was\nsincerely delighted with Nat\xc3\xa1sha and wished to give her a good time.\nAnatole had asked her to bring him and Nat\xc3\xa1sha together, and she was\ncalling on the Rost\xc3\xb3vs for that purpose. The idea of throwing her\nbrother and Nat\xc3\xa1sha together amused her.\n\nThough at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nfor drawing Bor\xc3\xads away, she did not think of that now, and in her own\nway heartily wished Nat\xc3\xa1sha well. As she was leaving the Rost\xc3\xb3vs she\ncalled her prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e aside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother dined with me yesterday\xe2\x80\x94we nearly died of laughter\xe2\x80\x94he\nate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite\nmadly, in love with you, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha blushed scarlet when she heard this.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d said H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nmust certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a\nreason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your\nfianc\xc3\xa9 would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre\xe2\x80\x94that good\nPierre\xe2\x80\x94have talked and laughed about this. So it\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d And\nagain, under H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed\nsimple and natural. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she is such a grande dame, so kind, and\nevidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, gazing at H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne with wide-open, wondering eyes.\n\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, having\nevidently suffered a defeat at the old prince\xe2\x80\x99s. She was still too\nagitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly. In\nanswer to the count\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries she replied that things were all\nright and that she would tell about it next day. On hearing of Countess\nBez\xc3\xbakhova\xe2\x80\x99s visit and the invitation for that evening, M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna remarked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care to have anything to do with Bez\xc3\xbakhova and don\xe2\x80\x99t\nadvise you to; however, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve promised\xe2\x80\x94go. It will divert your\nthoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, addressing Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nCount Rost\xc3\xb3v took the girls to Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova\xe2\x80\x99s. There were\na good many people there, but nearly all strangers to Nat\xc3\xa1sha. Count\nRost\xc3\xb3v was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely\nof men and women known for the freedom of their conduct. Mademoiselle\nGeorge was standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young\nmen. There were several Frenchmen present, among them M\xc3\xa9tivier who from\nthe time H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne reached Moscow had been an intimate in her house. The\ncount decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight\nand to get away as soon as Mademoiselle George\xe2\x80\x99s performance was over.\n\nAnatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the Rost\xc3\xb3vs.\nImmediately after greeting the count he went up to Nat\xc3\xa1sha and followed\nher. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had\nhad at the opera\xe2\x80\x94gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at\nthe absence of a moral barrier between them.\n\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne welcomed Nat\xc3\xa1sha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her\nbeauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George went\nout of the room to change her costume. In the drawing room people began\narranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved a chair for\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and was about to sit down beside her, but the count, who never\nlost sight of her, took the seat himself. Anatole sat down behind her.\n\nMademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red shawl\ndraped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for her, and\nassumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was audible.\n\nMademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and\nbegan reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for her\nson. In some places she raised her voice, in others she whispered,\nlifting her head triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse\nsounds, rolling her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdorable! divine! delicious!\xe2\x80\x9d was heard from every side.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor\nunderstood anything of what went on before her. She only felt herself\nagain completely borne away into this strange senseless world\xe2\x80\x94so\nremote from her old world\xe2\x80\x94a world in which it was impossible to know\nwhat was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat Anatole,\nand conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of\nexpectancy.\n\nAfter the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded\nMademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful she is!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha remarked to her father who had also\nrisen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so when I look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, following\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nare enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never ceased...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, Nat\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, as he turned back for his\ndaughter. \xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful she is!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha without saying anything\nstepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring\neyes.\n\nAfter giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, and Countess\nBez\xc3\xbakhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.\n\nThe count wished to go home, but H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne entreated him not to spoil her\nimprovised ball, and the Rost\xc3\xb3vs stayed on. Anatole asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha for\na valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her\nshe was bewitching and that he loved her. During the \xc3\xa9cossaise, which\nshe also danced with him, Anatole said nothing when they happened to be\nby themselves, but merely gazed at her. Nat\xc3\xa1sha lifted her frightened\neyes to him, but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate\nlook and smile that she could not, whilst looking at him, say what she\nhad to say. She lowered her eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say such things to me. I am betrothed and love another,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said rapidly.... She glanced at him.\n\nAnatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me of that! What can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell\nyou I am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that you are\nenchanting?... It\xe2\x80\x99s our turn to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open\nfrightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood hardly\nanything that went on that evening. They danced the \xc3\xa9cossaise and the\nGrossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to remain.\nWherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, she felt his eyes\nupon her. Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let\nher go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress, that H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne had\nfollowed her and spoken laughingly of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s love, and that she\nagain met Anatole in the little sitting room. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne had disappeared\nleaving them alone, and Anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender\nvoice:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see\nyou? I love you madly. Can I never...?\xe2\x80\x9d and, blocking her path, he\nbrought his face close to hers.\n\nHis large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw\nnothing but them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNatalie?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being\npainfully pressed. \xe2\x80\x9cNatalie?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. I have nothing to say,\xe2\x80\x9d her eyes replied.\n\nBurning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she felt\nherself released, and H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps and the rustle of her dress\nwere heard in the room. Nat\xc3\xa1sha looked round at her, and then, red\nand trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved\ntoward the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word, just one, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anatole.\n\nShe paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what\nhad happened and to which she could find no answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNatalie, just a word, only one!\xe2\x80\x9d he kept repeating, evidently not\nknowing what to say and he repeated it till H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne came up to them.\n\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne returned with Nat\xc3\xa1sha to the drawing room. The Rost\xc3\xb3vs went\naway without staying for supper.\n\nAfter reaching home Nat\xc3\xa1sha did not sleep all night. She was tormented\nby the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew.\nShe loved Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x94she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved\nhim. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cElse how\ncould all this have happened?\xe2\x80\x9d thought she. \xe2\x80\x9cIf, after that, I could\nreturn his smile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to\nthat, it means that I loved him from the first. It means that he is\nkind, noble, and splendid, and I could not help loving him. What am I to\ndo if I love him and the other one too?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked herself, unable to\nfind an answer to these terrible questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nMorning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and began\nto move about and talk, dressmakers came again. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\nappeared, and they were called to breakfast. Nat\xc3\xa1sha kept looking\nuneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept\nevery glance directed toward her, and tried to appear the same as usual.\n\nAfter breakfast, which was her best time, M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna sat down in\nher armchair and called Nat\xc3\xa1sha and the count to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is\nmy advice,\xe2\x80\x9d she began. \xe2\x80\x9cYesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to\nbegin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had\nto say!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the count.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe? He\xe2\x80\x99s crazy... he did not want to listen. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use\nof talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna. \xe2\x80\x9cMy advice to you is finish your business and go back\nhome to Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe... and wait there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, go back,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, \xe2\x80\x9cand wait there. If your\nbetrothed comes here now\xe2\x80\x94there will be no avoiding a quarrel; but\nalone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCount Rost\xc3\xb3v approved of this suggestion, appreciating its\nreasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better to\nvisit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding,\nagainst his wishes, could only be arranged at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old count.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But if he\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s his affair,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, looking for\nsomething in her reticule. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, the trousseau is ready, so there\nis nothing to wait for; and what is not ready I\xe2\x80\x99ll send after you.\nThough I don\xe2\x80\x99t like letting you go, it is the best way. So go, with\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s blessing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! She\xe2\x80\x99s\nafraid you might think that she does not like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t believe anyone, I know she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nNat\xc3\xa1sha boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold\nand angry resolution that caused M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna to look at her more\nintently and to frown.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t answer like that, my good girl!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I say is\ntrue! Write an answer!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\n\nPrincess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that\nhad occurred between them. Whatever her father\xe2\x80\x99s feelings might be,\nshe begged Nat\xc3\xa1sha to believe that she could not help loving her as\nthe one chosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was ready to\nsacrifice everything.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not think, however,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my father is\nill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be\nforgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his\nson happy.\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary went on to ask Nat\xc3\xa1sha to fix a time when\nshe could see her again.\n\nAfter reading the letter Nat\xc3\xa1sha sat down at the writing table\nto answer it. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote in French quickly and\nmechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after all that\nhad happened the evening before? \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! All that has happened, and\nnow all is changed,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought as she sat with the letter she had\nbegun before her. \xe2\x80\x9cMust I break off with him? Must I really? That\xe2\x80\x99s\nawful...\xe2\x80\x9d and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to\nS\xc3\xb3nya and began sorting patterns with her.\n\nAfter dinner Nat\xc3\xa1sha went to her room and again took up Princess\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s letter. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be that it is all over?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all\nthat went before?\xe2\x80\x9d She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its\nformer strength, and at the same time felt that she loved Kur\xc3\xa1gin. She\nvividly pictured herself as Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and the scenes of\nhappiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination, and\nat the same time, aglow with excitement, recalled every detail of\nyesterday\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Anatole.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy could that not be as well?\xe2\x80\x9d she sometimes asked herself in\ncomplete bewilderment. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly so could I be completely happy; but now I\nhave to choose, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t be happy without either of them. Only,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe thought, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide\nit from him are both equally impossible. But with that one nothing is\nspoiled. But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\nlove, in which I have lived so long?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Miss!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious\nair. \xe2\x80\x9cA man told me to give you this\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and she handed Nat\xc3\xa1sha a\nletter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly, for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake...\xe2\x80\x9d the girl went on, as Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\nwithout thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter\nfrom Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only\nthat it was a letter from him\xe2\x80\x94from the man she loved. Yes, she loved\nhim, or else how could that have happened which had happened? And how\ncould she have a love letter from him in her hand?\n\nWith trembling hands Nat\xc3\xa1sha held that passionate love letter which\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she found in it\nan echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you\nor to die. There is no other way for me,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter began. Then he\nwent on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him\xe2\x80\x94for\nthis there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her\xe2\x80\x94but that if\nshe loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power could\nhinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her away and\ncarry her off to the ends of the earth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! I love him!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha, reading the letter for the\ntwentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of\nit.\n\nThat evening M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna was going to the Akh\xc3\xa1rovs\xe2\x80\x99 and\nproposed to take the girls with her. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, pleading a headache,\nremained at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nOn returning late in the evening S\xc3\xb3nya went to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s room, and\nto her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open on\nthe table, beside her lay Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s letter. S\xc3\xb3nya picked it up and\nread it.\n\nAs she read she glanced at the sleeping Nat\xc3\xa1sha, trying to find in her\nface an explanation of what she was reading, but did not find it. Her\nface was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep herself\nfrom choking, S\xc3\xb3nya, pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat\ndown in an armchair and burst into tears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she have\nleft off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let Kur\xc3\xa1gin go to\nsuch lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, that\xe2\x80\x99s plain! What will\nNicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is\nthe meaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural look the day before\nyesterday, yesterday, and today,\xe2\x80\x9d thought S\xc3\xb3nya. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\nthat she loves him! She probably opened the letter without knowing who\nit was from. Probably she is offended by it. She could not do such a\nthing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya wiped away her tears and went up to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, again scanning her\nface.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, just audibly.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha awoke and saw S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you\xe2\x80\x99re back?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of\nawakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s look of\nembarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, you\xe2\x80\x99ve read that letter?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered S\xc3\xb3nya softly.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha smiled rapturously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, S\xc3\xb3nya, I can\xe2\x80\x99t any longer!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t hide it\nfrom you any longer. You know, we love one another! S\xc3\xb3nya, darling, he\nwrites... S\xc3\xb3nya...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya stared open-eyed at Nat\xc3\xa1sha, unable to believe her ears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Bolk\xc3\xb3nski?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, S\xc3\xb3nya, if you only knew how happy I am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what love is....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, can that be all over?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked at S\xc3\xb3nya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp\nthe question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand anything! Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense, just\nlisten!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, with momentary vexation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted S\xc3\xb3nya. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\nunderstand. How is it you have loved a man for a whole year and\nsuddenly... Why, you have only seen him three times! Nat\xc3\xa1sha, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nbelieve you, you\xe2\x80\x99re joking! In three days to forget everything and\nso...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree days?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me I\xe2\x80\x99ve loved him a\nhundred years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t understand it.... S\xc3\xb3nya, wait a bit, sit here,\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nembraced and kissed her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it\ntoo, but it\xe2\x80\x99s only now that I feel such love. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the same as\nbefore. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave,\nand that I could not help loving him. Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders\nI shall do. You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that. What can I do? What can I do,\nS\xc3\xb3nya?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha with a happy yet frightened expression.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut think what you are doing,\xe2\x80\x9d cried S\xc3\xb3nya. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t leave\nit like this. This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so\nfar?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you that I have no will,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou understand? I love him!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I won\xe2\x80\x99t let it come to that... I shall tell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried S\xc3\xb3nya,\nbursting into tears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake... If you tell, you are my\nenemy!\xe2\x80\x9d declared Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want me to be miserable, you want us\nto be separated....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen she saw Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s fright, S\xc3\xb3nya shed tears of shame and pity\nfor her friend.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what has happened between you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he said\nto you? Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he come to the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not answer her questions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, S\xc3\xb3nya, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone, don\xe2\x80\x99t torture\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha entreated. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember no one ought to interfere in such\nmatters! I have confided in you....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why this secrecy? Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he come to the house?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nS\xc3\xb3nya. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince\nAndrew gave you complete freedom\xe2\x80\x94if it is really so; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nbelieve it! Nat\xc3\xa1sha, have you considered what these secret reasons can\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked at S\xc3\xb3nya with astonishment. Evidently this question\npresented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how\nto answer it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya sighed and shook her head incredulously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there were reasons...\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\n\nBut Nat\xc3\xa1sha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, one can\xe2\x80\x99t doubt him! One can\xe2\x80\x99t, one can\xe2\x80\x99t! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he love you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he love me?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha repeated with a smile of pity at her\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s lack of comprehension. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you have read his letter and\nyou have seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he is dishonorable?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe! dishonorable? If you only knew!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or\ncease seeing you; and if you won\xe2\x80\x99t do this, I will. I will write to\nhim, and I will tell Papa!\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya resolutely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t live without him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you. And what are you saying! Think of\nyour father and of Nicholas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone, I don\xe2\x80\x99t love anyone but him. How dare you\nsay he is dishonorable? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that I love him?\xe2\x80\x9d screamed\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away, S\xc3\xb3nya! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to quarrel with you, but\ngo, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake go! You see how I am suffering!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha cried\nangrily, in a voice of despair and repressed irritation. S\xc3\xb3nya burst\ninto sobs and ran from the room.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha went to the table and without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection wrote\nthat answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all\nthe morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their\nmisunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the\nmagnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her\nfreedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her\nif she had been to blame toward her, but that she could not be his\nwife. At that moment this all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to\nNat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\nOn Friday the Rost\xc3\xb3vs were to return to the country, but on Wednesday\nthe count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow.\n\nOn the day the count left, S\xc3\xb3nya and Nat\xc3\xa1sha were invited to a big\ndinner party at the Kar\xc3\xa1gins\xe2\x80\x99, and M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna took them\nthere. At that party Nat\xc3\xa1sha again met Anatole, and S\xc3\xb3nya noticed\nthat she spoke to him, trying not to be overheard, and that all through\ndinner she was more agitated than ever. When they got home Nat\xc3\xa1sha was\nthe first to begin the explanation S\xc3\xb3nya expected.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, S\xc3\xb3nya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,\xe2\x80\x9d\nNat\xc3\xa1sha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be\npraised. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have had an explanation today.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what happened? What did he say? Nat\xc3\xa1sha, how glad I am\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not angry with me! Tell me everything\xe2\x80\x94the whole truth. What\ndid he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha became thoughtful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, S\xc3\xb3nya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I\nhad promised Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. He was glad I was free to refuse him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya sighed sorrowfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you haven\xe2\x80\x99t refused Bolk\xc3\xb3nski?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. Why do\nyou think so badly of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything, only I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand this...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, S\xc3\xb3nya, you\xe2\x80\x99ll understand everything. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see what\na man he is! Now don\xe2\x80\x99t think badly of me or of him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\nbadly of anyone: I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya did not succumb to the tender tone Nat\xc3\xa1sha used toward her.\nThe more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face\nbecame, the more serious and stern grew S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cyou asked me not to speak to you, and I\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken, but now you yourself have begun. I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust him,\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. Why this secrecy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain, again!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, I am afraid for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you\xe2\x80\x99re going to your ruin,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya resolutely,\nand was herself horrified at what she had said.\n\nAnger again showed in Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! It\xe2\x80\x99s not\nyour business! It won\xe2\x80\x99t be you, but I, who\xe2\x80\x99ll suffer. Leave me\nalone, leave me alone! I hate you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned S\xc3\xb3nya, aghast.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate you, I hate you! You\xe2\x80\x99re my enemy forever!\xe2\x80\x9d And Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nran out of the room.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not speak to S\xc3\xb3nya again and avoided her. With the same\nexpression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house,\ntaking up now one occupation, now another, and at once abandoning them.\n\nHard as it was for S\xc3\xb3nya, she watched her friend and did not let her\nout of her sight.\n\nThe day before the count was to return, S\xc3\xb3nya noticed that Nat\xc3\xa1sha sat\nby the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and\nthat she made a sign to an officer who drove past, whom S\xc3\xb3nya took to\nbe Anatole.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that\nat dinner and all that evening Nat\xc3\xa1sha was in a strange and unnatural\nstate. She answered questions at random, began sentences she did not\nfinish, and laughed at everything.\n\nAfter tea S\xc3\xb3nya noticed a housemaid at Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s door timidly\nwaiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at\nthe door learned that another letter had been delivered.\n\nThen suddenly it became clear to S\xc3\xb3nya that Nat\xc3\xa1sha had some dreadful\nplan for that evening. S\xc3\xb3nya knocked at her door. Nat\xc3\xa1sha did not let\nher in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will run away with him!\xe2\x80\x9d thought S\xc3\xb3nya. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is capable of\nanything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in\nher face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d S\xc3\xb3nya\nremembered. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it, she means to elope with him, but\nwhat am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly\nindicated that Nat\xc3\xa1sha had some terrible intention. \xe2\x80\x9cThe count is\naway. What am I to do? Write to Kur\xc3\xa1gin demanding an explanation? But\nwhat is there to oblige him to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince Andrew\nasked me to in case of some misfortune?... But perhaps she really\nhas already refused Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x94she sent a letter to Princess Mary\nyesterday. And Uncle is away....\xe2\x80\x9d To tell M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna who had\nsuch faith in Nat\xc3\xa1sha seemed to S\xc3\xb3nya terrible. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought S\xc3\xb3nya as she stood in the dark passage, \xe2\x80\x9cnow or never I must\nprove that I remember the family\xe2\x80\x99s goodness to me and that I love\nNicholas. Yes! If I don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep for three nights I\xe2\x80\x99ll not leave this\npassage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family\nbe disgraced,\xe2\x80\x9d thought she.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nAnatole had lately moved to D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s. The plan for Natalie\nRost\xc3\xb3va\xe2\x80\x99s abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov a few days before, and on the day that S\xc3\xb3nya, after listening\nat Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s door, resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been\nput into execution. Nat\xc3\xa1sha had promised to come out to Kur\xc3\xa1gin at the\nback porch at ten that evening. Kur\xc3\xa1gin was to put her into a troyka\nhe would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of\nK\xc3\xa1menka, where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a\nmarriage ceremony over them. At K\xc3\xa1menka a relay of horses was to wait\nwhich would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and from there they would\nhasten abroad with post horses.\n\nAnatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand rubles\nhe had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s help.\n\nTwo witnesses for the mock marriage\xe2\x80\x94Khv\xc3\xb3stikov, a retired petty\nofficial whom D\xc3\xb3lokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and\nMak\xc3\xa1rin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an unbounded\naffection for Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x94were sitting at tea in D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s front\nroom.\n\nIn his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with\nPersian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat D\xc3\xb3lokhov in a traveling cloak\nand high boots, at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles\nof paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to and fro from\nthe room where the witnesses were sitting, through the study to the room\nbehind, where his French valet and others were packing the last of his\nthings. D\xc3\xb3lokhov was counting the money and noting something down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cKhv\xc3\xb3stikov must have two thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to him, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMak\xc3\xa1rka\xe2\x80\x9d (their name for Mak\xc3\xa1rin) \xe2\x80\x9cwill go through fire and\nwater for you for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, showing him the memorandum. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that right?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Anatole, evidently not listening to\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not\nleave his face.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an\nironic smile:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know? You\xe2\x80\x99d really better drop it all. There\xe2\x80\x99s still\ntime!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Anatole. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense! If you only\nknew... it\xe2\x80\x99s the devil knows what!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, really, give it up!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov. \xe2\x80\x9cI am speaking\nseriously. It\xe2\x80\x99s no joke, this plot you\xe2\x80\x99ve hatched.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, making a\ngrimace. \xe2\x80\x9cReally it\xe2\x80\x99s no time for your stupid jokes,\xe2\x80\x9d and he left\nthe room.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had\ngone out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he called after him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not joking, I\xe2\x80\x99m\ntalking sense. Come here, come here!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnatole returned and looked at D\xc3\xb3lokhov, trying to give him his\nattention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow listen to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you this for the last time. Why\nshould I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for\nyou? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I\ndid it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?\xe2\x80\x9d And\nAnatole sighed and embraced D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a\ndangerous business, and if you think about it\xe2\x80\x94a stupid business. Well,\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll carry her off\xe2\x80\x94all right! Will they let it stop at that? It\nwill come out that you\xe2\x80\x99re already married. Why, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have you in\nthe criminal court....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nonsense, nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d Anatole ejaculated and again made a\ngrimace. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I explain to you? What?\xe2\x80\x9d And Anatole, with the\npartiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached\nby their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov a hundred times. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I explain to you that I have come\nto this conclusion: if this marriage is invalid,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, crooking\none finger, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I have nothing to answer for; but if it is valid, no\nmatter! Abroad no one will know anything about it. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so? And\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeriously, you\xe2\x80\x99d better drop it! You\xe2\x80\x99ll only get yourself into a\nmess!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the\nroom, but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov with his feet turned under him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the very devil!\nWhat? Feel how it beats!\xe2\x80\x9d He took D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s hand and put it on his\nheart. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a foot, my dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded in French. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes\nlooked at him\xe2\x80\x94evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell and when the money\xe2\x80\x99s gone, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a thought\nof the future. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?... Then, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.... But why talk\nnonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnatole went into the back room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then! Nearly ready? You\xe2\x80\x99re dawdling!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the\nservants.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to bring\nsomething for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went into\nthe room where Khv\xc3\xb3stikov and Mak\xc3\xa1rin were sitting.\n\nAnatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling\npensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and eat something. Have a drink!\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov shouted to him\nfrom the other room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Anatole continuing to smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! Balag\xc3\xa1 is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnatole rose and went into the dining room. Balag\xc3\xa1 was a famous troyka\ndriver who had known D\xc3\xb3lokhov and Anatole some six years and had given\nthem good service with his troykas. More than once when Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s\nregiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the\nevening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again\nthe next night. More than once he had enabled D\xc3\xb3lokhov to escape when\npursued. More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies\nand \xe2\x80\x9cladykins\xe2\x80\x9d as he called the cocottes. More than once in their\nservice he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets\nof Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by \xe2\x80\x9cmy\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x9d as he called them. He had ruined more than one horse in\ntheir service. More than once they had beaten him, and more than once\nthey had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira, which he loved; and\nhe knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have\nsent an ordinary man to Siberia. They often called Balag\xc3\xa1 into their\norgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies\xe2\x80\x99, and more than one\nthousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands. In their\nservice he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year, and in\ntheir service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would\nbuy. But he liked them; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour,\nliked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at\nfull gallop through the Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild,\ntipsy shouts behind him: \xe2\x80\x9cGet on! Get on!\xe2\x80\x9d when it was impossible\nto go any faster. He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some\npeasant who, more dead than alive, was already hurrying out of his way.\n\xe2\x80\x9cReal gentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d he considered them.\n\nAnatole and D\xc3\xb3lokhov liked Balag\xc3\xa1 too for his masterly driving and\nbecause he liked the things they liked. With others Balag\xc3\xa1 bargained,\ncharging twenty-five rubles for a two hours\xe2\x80\x99 drive, and rarely\ndrove himself, generally letting his young men do so. But with \xe2\x80\x9chis\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x9d he always drove himself and never demanded anything for\nhis work. Only a couple of times a year\xe2\x80\x94when he knew from their valets\nthat they had money in hand\xe2\x80\x94he would turn up of a morning quite sober\nand with a deep bow would ask them to help him. The gentlemen always\nmade him sit down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo help me out, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nych, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cyour excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe would say. \xe2\x80\x9cI am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to\ngo to the fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Anatole and D\xc3\xb3lokhov, when they had money, would give him a\nthousand or a couple of thousand rubles.\n\nBalag\xc3\xa1 was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of about\ntwenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck, glittering\nlittle eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine, dark-blue, silk-lined\ncloth coat over a sheepskin.\n\nOn entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the front\ncorner of the room, and went up to D\xc3\xb3lokhov, holding out a small, black\nhand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheodore Iv\xc3\xa1nych!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, bowing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow d\xe2\x80\x99you do, friend? Well, here he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, again holding out his hand to\nAnatole who had just come in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Balag\xc3\xa1,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, putting his hands on the man\xe2\x80\x99s\nshoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service....\nWhat horses have you come with? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs your messenger ordered, your special beasts,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Balag\xc3\xa1.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, listen, Balag\xc3\xa1! Drive all three to death but get me there in\nthree hours. Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they are dead, what shall I drive?\xe2\x80\x9d said Balag\xc3\xa1 with a wink.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind, I\xe2\x80\x99ll smash your face in! Don\xe2\x80\x99t make jokes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\nAnatole, suddenly rolling his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy joke?\xe2\x80\x9d said the driver, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cAs if I\xe2\x80\x99d grudge my\ngentlemen anything! As fast as ever the horses can gallop, so fast\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll go!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sit down!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stand, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nych.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down; nonsense! Have a drink!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, and filled a large\nglass of Madeira for him.\n\nThe driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After refusing\nit for manners\xe2\x80\x99 sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk\nhandkerchief he took out of his cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when are we to start, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell...\xe2\x80\x9d Anatole looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll start at once.\nMind, Balag\xc3\xa1! You\xe2\x80\x99ll get there in time? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be\nthere in time?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Balag\xc3\xa1. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t we get you to Tver in\nseven hours? I think you remember that, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole,\nsmilingly at the recollection and turning to Mak\xc3\xa1rin who gazed\nrapturously at him with wide-open eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you believe it,\nMak\xc3\xa1rka, it took one\xe2\x80\x99s breath away, the rate we flew. We came across\na train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them. Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose were horses!\xe2\x80\x9d Balag\xc3\xa1 continued the tale. \xe2\x80\x9cThat time I\xe2\x80\x99d\nharnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts,\xe2\x80\x9d he went\non, turning to D\xc3\xb3lokhov. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you believe it, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nych,\nthose animals flew forty miles? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold them in, my hands grew\nnumb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reins\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Catch hold\nyourself, your excellency!\xe2\x80\x99 says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom\nof the sleigh and sprawled there. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a case of urging them on,\nthere was no holding them in till we reached the place. The devils took\nus there in three hours! Only the near one died of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAnatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing\na fur coat girt with a silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily set on one\nside and very becoming to his handsome face. Having looked in a mirror,\nand standing before D\xc3\xb3lokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it,\nhe lifted a glass of wine.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d said\nAnatole. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, comrades and friends...\xe2\x80\x9d he considered for a moment \xe2\x80\x9c...\nof my youth, farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to Mak\xc3\xa1rin and the others.\n\nThough they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to make\nsomething touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades. He\nspoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed\none leg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll take glasses; you too, Balag\xc3\xa1. Well, comrades and friends of my\nyouth, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, when\nshall we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good time\xe2\x80\x94now\nfarewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!...\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and emptying his\nglass flung it on the floor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your health!\xe2\x80\x9d said Balag\xc3\xa1 who also emptied his glass, and wiped his\nmouth with his handkerchief.\n\nMak\xc3\xa1rin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Prince, how sorry I am to part from you!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Anatole.\n\nBalag\xc3\xa1 was about to leave the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole. \xe2\x80\x9cShut the door; we have first to sit down.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey shut the door and all sat down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, quick march, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, rising.\n\nJoseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache and saber, and they all\nwent out into the vestibule.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where\xe2\x80\x99s the fur cloak?\xe2\x80\x9d asked D\xc3\xb3lokhov. \xe2\x80\x9cHey, Ign\xc3\xa1tka! Go to\nMatr\xc3\xabna Matr\xc3\xa9vna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what\nelopements are like,\xe2\x80\x9d continued D\xc3\xb3lokhov with a wink. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, she\xe2\x80\x99ll rush\nout more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if you delay\nat all there\xe2\x80\x99ll be tears and \xe2\x80\x98Papa\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Mamma,\xe2\x80\x99 and she\xe2\x80\x99s frozen in a\nminute and must go back\xe2\x80\x94but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing\nand carry her to the sleigh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe valet brought a woman\xe2\x80\x99s fox-lined cloak.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool, I told you the sable one! Hey, Matr\xc3\xabna, the sable!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted so\nthat his voice rang far through the rooms.\n\nA handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes\nand curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable\nmantle on her arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, I don\xe2\x80\x99t grudge it\xe2\x80\x94take it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, evidently afraid of her\nmaster and yet regretful of her cloak.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over Matr\xc3\xabna, and\nwrapped her up in it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov, \xe2\x80\x9cand then so!\xe2\x80\x9d and he turned the collar\nup round her head, leaving only a little of the face uncovered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nthen so, do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d and he pushed Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s head forward to meet the\ngap left by the collar, through which Matr\xc3\xabna\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant smile was\nseen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by, Matr\xc3\xabna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, kissing her. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my revels here\nare over. Remember me to St\xc3\xabshka. There, good-by! Good-by, Matr\xc3\xabna, wish\nme luck!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Prince, may God give you great luck!\xe2\x80\x9d said Matr\xc3\xabna in her gypsy\naccent.\n\nTwo troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were\nholding the horses. Balag\xc3\xa1 took his seat in the front one and holding\nhis elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and D\xc3\xb3lokhov\ngot in with him. Mak\xc3\xa1rin, Khv\xc3\xb3stikov, and a valet seated themselves in\nthe other sleigh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Balag\xc3\xa1.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka tore\ndown the Nik\xc3\xadtski Boulevard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!...\xe2\x80\x9d The shouting of Balag\xc3\xa1\nand of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could\nbe heard. On the Arb\xc3\xa1t Square the troyka caught against a carriage;\nsomething cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the\nArb\xc3\xa1t Street.\n\nAfter taking a turn along the Podnov\xc3\xadnski Boulevard, Balag\xc3\xa1 began to\nrein in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old Kony\xc3\xbasheny\nStreet.\n\nThe young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and Anatole\nand D\xc3\xb3lokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the gate\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome into the courtyard or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be seen; she\xe2\x80\x99ll come out directly,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid she.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov stayed by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the\ncourtyard, turned the corner, and ran up into the porch.\n\nHe was met by Gabriel, M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s gigantic footman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to the mistress, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said the footman in his deep bass,\nintercepting any retreat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what Mistress? Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anatole in a breathless whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindly step in, my orders are to bring you in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKur\xc3\xa1gin! Come back!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted D\xc3\xb3lokhov. \xe2\x80\x9cBetrayed! Back!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, after Anatole entered, had remained at the wicket gate and was\nstruggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it. With a last\ndesperate effort D\xc3\xb3lokhov pushed the porter aside, and when Anatole ran\nback seized him by the arm, pulled him through the wicket, and ran back\nwith him to the troyka.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, having found S\xc3\xb3nya weeping in the corridor, made her\nconfess everything, and intercepting the note to Nat\xc3\xa1sha she read it and\nwent into Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s room with it in her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shameless good-for-nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t hear a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPushing back Nat\xc3\xa1sha who looked at her with astonished but tearless\neyes, she locked her in; and having given orders to the yard porter to\nadmit the persons who would be coming that evening, but not to let them\nout again, and having told the footman to bring them up to her, she\nseated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors.\n\nWhen Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run\naway again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands behind her paced\nthrough the rooms a long time considering what she should do. Toward\nmidnight she went to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s room fingering the key in her pocket.\nS\xc3\xb3nya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. \xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, for God\xe2\x80\x99s\nsake let me in to her!\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded, but M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna unlocked\nthe door and went in without giving her an answer.... \xe2\x80\x9cDisgusting,\nabominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! I\xe2\x80\x99m only sorry for her\nfather!\xe2\x80\x9d thought she, trying to restrain her wrath. \xe2\x80\x9cHard as it may\nbe, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the\ncount.\xe2\x80\x9d She entered the room with resolute steps. Nat\xc3\xa1sha lying on the\nsofa, her head hidden in her hands, and she did not stir. She was in\njust the same position in which M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna had left her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice girl! Very nice!\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna. \xe2\x80\x9cArranging meetings\nwith lovers in my house! It\xe2\x80\x99s no use pretending: you listen when I speak\nto you!\xe2\x80\x9d And M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna touched her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cListen when I speak!\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. I\xe2\x80\x99d treat you\ndifferently, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry for your father, so I will conceal it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved with\nnoiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna glanced\nround at S\xc3\xb3nya and seated herself on the sofa beside Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s lucky for him that he escaped me; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll find him!\xe2\x80\x9d she said in\nher rough voice. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear what I am saying or not?\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\n\nShe put her large hand under Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face and turned it toward her.\nBoth M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna and S\xc3\xb3nya were amazed when they saw how Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nlooked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her\ncheeks sunken.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered,\nwrenching herself from M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s hands with a vicious effort\nand sinking down again into her former position.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNatalie!\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish for your good. Lie still,\nstay like that then, I won\xe2\x80\x99t touch you. But listen. I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you how\nguilty you are. You know that yourself. But when your father comes back\ntomorrow what am I to tell him? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s body shook with sobs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no betrothed: I have refused him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d continued M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they hear of\nthis, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if he\nchallenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who asked\nyou to?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Nat\xc3\xa1sha, raising herself on the sofa and looking\nmalignantly at M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did you want?\xe2\x80\x9d cried M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, growing angry again.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to the house?\nWhy carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl?... Well, if he\nhad carried you off... do you think they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have found him?\nYour father, or brother, or your betrothed? And he\xe2\x80\x99s a scoundrel, a\nwretch\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is better than any of you!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Nat\xc3\xa1sha getting up. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? S\xc3\xb3nya,\nwhy?... Go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people\nbewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned. M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna was to speak again but Nat\xc3\xa1sha cried out:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!\xe2\x80\x9d and she threw herself\nback on the sofa.\n\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining on her\nthat it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody\nwould know anything about it if only Nat\xc3\xa1sha herself would undertake\nto forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she grew cold\nand had a shivering fit. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna put a pillow under her head,\ncovered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower\nwater, but Nat\xc3\xa1sha did not respond to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let her sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna as she went out of the room\nsupposing Nat\xc3\xa1sha to be asleep.\n\nBut Nat\xc3\xa1sha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open eyes she\nlooked straight before her. All that night she did not sleep or weep and\ndid not speak to S\xc3\xb3nya who got up and went to her several times.\n\nNext day Count Rost\xc3\xb3v returned from his estate near Moscow in time for\nlunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; the affair with\nthe purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and there was nothing to keep\nhim any longer in Moscow, away from the countess whom he missed. M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna met him and told him that Nat\xc3\xa1sha had been very unwell the\nday before and that they had sent for the doctor, but that she was\nbetter now. Nat\xc3\xa1sha had not left her room that morning. With compressed\nand parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she sat at the window, uneasily\nwatching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at\nanyone who entered the room. She was evidently expecting news of him and\nthat he would come or would write to her.\n\nWhen the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound\nof a man\xe2\x80\x99s footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent\nexpression. She did not even get up to greet him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter\nwith you, my angel? Are you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the count.\n\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence Nat\xc3\xa1sha answered: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn reply to the count\xe2\x80\x99s anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected\nand whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she assured him\nthat nothing had happened and asked him not to worry. M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\nconfirmed Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that nothing had happened. From\nthe pretense of illness, from his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s distress, and by the\nembarrassed faces of S\xc3\xb3nya and M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, the count saw clearly\nthat something had gone wrong during his absence, but it was so terrible\nfor him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved\ndaughter, and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity, that he\navoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly\nhad happened; and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition\ndelayed their return to the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nFrom the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go\naway somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the Rost\xc3\xb3vs came\nto Moscow the effect Nat\xc3\xa1sha had on him made him hasten to carry out\nhis intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich\xe2\x80\x99s widow, who\nhad long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nWhen he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great\nimportance relating to Andrew Bolk\xc3\xb3nski and his betrothed. Pierre had\nbeen avoiding Nat\xc3\xa1sha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her\nwas stronger than a married man\xe2\x80\x99s should be for his friend\xe2\x80\x99s fianc\xc3\xa9e.\nYet some fate constantly threw them together.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can have happened? And what can they want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he\nas he dressed to go to M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only Prince Andrew would\nhurry up and come and marry her!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he on his way to the house.\n\nOn the Tversk\xc3\xb3y Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPierre! Been back long?\xe2\x80\x9d someone shouted. Pierre raised his head. In\na sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the\ndashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Mak\xc3\xa1rin dashed\npast. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military\ndandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his\nhead slightly bent. His face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat,\ntilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled\nwith powdery snow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed, that\xe2\x80\x99s a true sage,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cHe sees nothing\nbeyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so he is\nalways cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I give to be like\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought enviously.\n\nIn M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s anteroom the footman who helped him off with his\nfur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.\n\nWhen he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw Nat\xc3\xa1sha sitting at the\nwindow, with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at him,\nfrowned, and left the room with an expression of cold dignity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre, entering M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine doings!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dm\xc3\xadtrievna. \xe2\x80\x9cFor fifty-eight years have I lived\nin this world and never known anything so disgraceful!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him,\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna informed him that Nat\xc3\xa1sha had refused Prince Andrew\nwithout her parents\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge and that the cause of this was Anatole\nKur\xc3\xa1gin into whose society Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s wife had thrown her and with whom\nNat\xc3\xa1sha had tried to elope during her father\xe2\x80\x99s absence, in order to be\nmarried secretly.\n\nPierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what was told\nhim, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\ndeeply loved affianced wife\xe2\x80\x94the same Nat\xc3\xa1sha Rost\xc3\xb3va who used to be so\ncharming\xe2\x80\x94should give up Bolk\xc3\xb3nski for that fool Anatole who was already\nsecretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with him as\nto agree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not conceive\nand could not imagine.\n\nHe could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Nat\xc3\xa1sha, whom\nhe had known from a child, with this new conception of her baseness,\nfolly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are all alike!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid to himself, reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate\nenough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied Prince Andrew to\nthe point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride, and the more\nhe pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with\ndisgust of that Nat\xc3\xa1sha who had just passed him in the ballroom with\nsuch a look of cold dignity. He did not know that Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s soul was\noverflowing with despair, shame, and humiliation, and that it was not\nher fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity\nand severity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how get married?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, in answer to M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\ncould not marry\xe2\x80\x94he is married!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings get worse from hour to hour!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nnice youth! What a scoundrel! And she\xe2\x80\x99s expecting him\xe2\x80\x94expecting him\nsince yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she won\xe2\x80\x99t go on\nexpecting him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter hearing the details of Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s marriage from Pierre, and giving\nvent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\ntold Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that the count or\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew of this affair\n(which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel,\nand she therefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to\nleave Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierre\xe2\x80\x94only\nnow realizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince\nAndrew\xe2\x80\x94promised to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly\nexplained her wishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing either,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will go and tell her it is no use expecting him! And\nstay to dinner if you care to!\xe2\x80\x9d she called after Pierre.\n\nPierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning\nNat\xc3\xa1sha had told him that she had rejected Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroubles, troubles, my dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat troubles\none has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret having\ncome here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she has broken\noff her engagement without consulting anybody? It\xe2\x80\x99s true this engagement\nnever was much to my liking. Of course he is an excellent man, but\nstill, with his father\xe2\x80\x99s disapproval they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been happy, and\nNat\xc3\xa1sha won\xe2\x80\x99t lack suitors. Still, it has been going on so long, and\nto take such a step without father\xe2\x80\x99s or mother\xe2\x80\x99s consent! And now she\xe2\x80\x99s\nill, and God knows what! It\xe2\x80\x99s hard, Count, hard to manage daughters in\ntheir mother\xe2\x80\x99s absence....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the\nsubject, but the count returned to his troubles.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya entered the room with an agitated face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha is not quite well; she\xe2\x80\x99s in her room and would like to see you.\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna is with her and she too asks you to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are a great friend of Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s, no doubt she wants to send\nhim a message,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count. \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear! Oh dear! How happy it all\nwas!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the\nroom.\n\nWhen M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna told Nat\xc3\xa1sha that Anatole was married, Nat\xc3\xa1sha\ndid not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by Pierre\nhimself. S\xc3\xb3nya told Pierre this as she led him along the corridor to\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s room.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, pale and stern, was sitting beside M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, and her\neyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look the\nmoment he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only gazed fixedly at\nhim, and her look asked only one thing: was he a friend, or like the\nothers an enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, he evidently did\nnot exist for her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna pointing to Pierre and\naddressing Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him tell you whether I have told the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal\nlooks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1lya Ilyn\xc3\xadchna,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre began, dropping his eyes with a feeling of\npity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether it is\ntrue or not should make no difference to you, because...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is not true that he\xe2\x80\x99s married!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is true.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he been married long?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cOn your honor?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre gave his word of honor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he still here?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, quickly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have just seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that\nthey should leave her alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nPierre did not stay for dinner, but left the room and went away at once.\nHe drove through the town seeking Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin, at the thought of\nwhom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in\nbreathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsies\xe2\x80\x99, nor at\nKomoneno\xe2\x80\x99s. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all was going on as\nusual. The members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about\nin groups; they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town news. The footman\nhaving greeted him, knowing his habits and his acquaintances, told him\nthere was a place left for him in the small dining room and that Prince\nMichael Zakh\xc3\xa1rych was in the library, but Paul Timof\xc3\xa9evich had not yet\narrived. One of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintances, while they were talking about\nthe weather, asked if he had heard of Kur\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s abduction of Rost\xc3\xb3va\nwhich was talked of in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and\nsaid it was nonsense for he had just come from the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99. He asked\neveryone about Anatole. One man told him he had not come yet, and\nanother that he was coming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to see this\ncalm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his\nsoul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and\nas Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home.\n\nAnatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with D\xc3\xb3lokhov,\nconsulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to\nhim essential to see Nat\xc3\xa1sha. In the evening he drove to his sister\xe2\x80\x99s\nto discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home\nafter vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince\nAnatole was with the countess. The countess\xe2\x80\x99 drawing room was full of\nguests.\n\nPierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his\nreturn\xe2\x80\x94at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever\xe2\x80\x94entered\nthe drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Pierre,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess going up to her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nwhat a plight our Anatole...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s head, in his\nglowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that\nrage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his\nduel with D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre to his wife.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in French.\n\nAnatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to\nfollow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself\nand was leading him from the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...\xe2\x80\x9d whispered H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, but\nPierre did not reply and went out of the room.\n\nAnatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed\nanxiety.\n\nHaving entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole\nwithout looking at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promised Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va to marry her and were about to elope with\nher, is that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon cher,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French),\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that\ntone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized Anatole\nby the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side\nto side till Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s face showed a sufficient degree of terror.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I tell you that I must talk to you!...\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, this is stupid. What?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, fingering a button of\nhis collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what deprives\nme from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre,\nexpressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.\n\nHe took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once put\nit back in its place.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you promise to marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI... I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it. I never promised, because...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any letters of hers? Any letters?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, moving toward\nAnatole.\n\nAnatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket\nand drew out his pocketbook.\n\nPierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table\nthat stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan\xe2\x80\x99t be violent, don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre in answer to a\nfrightened gesture of Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, the letters,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as if\nrepeating a lesson to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cSecondly,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued after a short\npause, again rising and again pacing the room, \xe2\x80\x9ctomorrow you must get\nout of Moscow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirdly,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre continued without listening to him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must never\nbreathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va.\nI know I can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark of\nconscience...\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre paced the room several times in silence.\n\nAnatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such\na thing as other people\xe2\x80\x99s happiness and peace, and that you are ruining\na whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse yourself with women\nlike my wife\xe2\x80\x94with them you are within your rights, for they know what\nyou want of them. They are armed against you by the same experience\nof debauchery; but to promise a maid to marry her... to deceive, to\nkidnap.... Don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man\nor a child?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with a\nquestioning look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anatole, growing more confident as\nPierre mastered his wrath. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw,\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut you have used such words to me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98mean\xe2\x80\x99 and so on\xe2\x80\x94which as a man of\nhonor I can\xe2\x80\x99t allow anyone to use.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he\nwanted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough it was t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate,\xe2\x80\x9d Anatole continued, \xe2\x80\x9cstill I can\xe2\x80\x99t...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it satisfaction you want?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre ironically.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do as\nyou wish, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take them back, I take them back!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cand I ask you to\nforgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if\nyou require money for your journey...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnatole smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile, which\nPierre knew so well in his wife, revolted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, vile and heartless brood!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, and left the room.\n\nNext day Anatole left for Petersburg.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nPierre drove to M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s to tell her of the fulfillment of her\nwish that Kur\xc3\xa1gin should be banished from Moscow. The whole house was in\na state of alarm and commotion. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was very ill, having, as M\xc3\xa1rya\nDm\xc3\xadtrievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the night after she had\nbeen told that Anatole was married, with some arsenic she had stealthily\nprocured. After swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she\nwoke S\xc3\xb3nya and told her what she had done. The necessary antidotes had\nbeen administered in time and she was now out of danger, though still so\nweak that it was out of the question to move her to the country, and\nso the countess had been sent for. Pierre saw the distracted count, and\nS\xc3\xb3nya, who had a tear-stained face, but he could not see Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nPierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about\nthe attempted abduction of Rost\xc3\xb3va. He resolutely denied these\nrumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his\nbrother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. It seemed to\nPierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re-establish\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s reputation.\n\nHe was awaiting Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s return with dread and went every day to\nthe old prince\xe2\x80\x99s for news of him.\n\nOld Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski heard all the rumors current in the town from\nMademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which\nNat\xc3\xa1sha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits than\nusual and awaited his son with great impatience.\n\nSome days after Anatole\xe2\x80\x99s departure Pierre received a note from Prince\nAndrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him.\n\nAs soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his\nfather Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement\n(Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and given\nit to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\nelopement, with additions.\n\nPrince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see him next\nmorning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost the same state\nas Nat\xc3\xa1sha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room\nto hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some\nintrigue going on in Petersburg. The old prince\xe2\x80\x99s voice and another now\nand then interrupted him. Princess Mary came out to meet Pierre. She\nsighed, looking toward the door of the room where Prince Andrew was,\nevidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow, but Pierre\nsaw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the\nway her brother had taken the news of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s faithlessness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he expected it,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cI know his pride will not let\nhim express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far better,\nthan I expected. Evidently it had to be....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it possible that all is really ended?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\nPrincess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand\nhow he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the study. Prince\nAndrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health, but with a fresh\nhorizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in civilian dress facing\nhis father and Prince Meshch\xc3\xa9rski, warmly disputing and vigorously\ngesticulating. The conversation was about Sper\xc3\xa1nski\xe2\x80\x94the news of whose\nsudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him\na month ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew was saying, \xe2\x80\x9cand by those who were unable to\nunderstand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on\nhim all the blame of other men\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes is very easy, but I maintain\nthat if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by\nhim, by him alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and immediately\nassumed a vindictive expression.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPosterity will do him justice,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, and at once turned to\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how are you? Still getting stouter?\xe2\x80\x9d he said with animation, but\nthe new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in\nanswer to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s question, and smiled.\n\nTo Pierre that smile said plainly: \xe2\x80\x9cI am well, but my health is now of\nno use to anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish\nfrontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, and\nabout M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his son\xe2\x80\x99s\ntutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about\nSper\xc3\xa1nski which was still going on between the two old men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon,\nthey would have been made public,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with warmth and haste. \xe2\x80\x9cI do\nnot, and never did, like Sper\xc3\xa1nski personally, but I like justice!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too\nfamiliar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters\nin order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate.\nWhen Prince Meshch\xc3\xa9rski had left, Prince Andrew took Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s arm and\nasked him into the room that had been assigned him. A bed had been made\nup there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince\nAndrew went to one and took out a small casket, from which he drew a\npacket wrapped in paper. He did it all silently and very quickly. He\nstood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me for troubling you....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and his\nbroad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince\nAndrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have received a refusal from Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va and have heard reports\nof your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that\nkind. Is that true?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth true and untrue,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are her letters and her portrait,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nHe took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive this to the countess... if you see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very ill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen she is here still?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Prince Kur\xc3\xa1gin?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded quickly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe left long ago. She has been at death\xe2\x80\x99s door.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI much regret her illness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his\nfather, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Monsieur Kur\xc3\xa1gin has not honored Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va with his hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe could not marry, for he was married already,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone to Peters... But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cTell Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va\nthat she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether\nhe had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say\nanything, looked fixedly at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre,\n\xe2\x80\x9cabout...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Prince Andrew hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI said that a fallen woman\nshould be forgiven, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say I could forgive her. I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut can this be compared...?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ask her hand\nagain, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very noble, but\nI am unable to follow in that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps. If you wish to be\nmy friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll give her the packet?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.\n\nThe old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same as\nalways, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her\nsatisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at them\nPierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention\nthe name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else.\n\nAt dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was becoming\nevident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now with his father,\nnow with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing an unnatural animation,\nthe cause of which Pierre so well understood.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nThat same evening Pierre went to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 to fulfill the commission\nentrusted to him. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was in bed, the count at the club, and Pierre,\nafter giving the letters to S\xc3\xb3nya, went to M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna who was\ninterested to know how Prince Andrew had taken the news. Ten minutes\nlater S\xc3\xb3nya came to M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha insists on seeing Count Peter Kir\xc3\xadlovich,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not been\ntidied up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\nM\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna only shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind, don\xe2\x80\x99t\ntell her everything!\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cOne hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the heart to scold\nher, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be pitied.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated, with\na pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find\nher. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently undecided\nwhether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.\n\nPierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as\nusual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her arms\nhanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she\nwent to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different\nexpression of face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Kir\xc3\xadlovich,\xe2\x80\x9d she began rapidly, \xe2\x80\x9cPrince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski was your\nfriend\xe2\x80\x94is your friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she corrected herself. (It seemed to her that\neverything that had once been must now be different.) \xe2\x80\x9cHe told me once\nto apply to you...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till then he had\nreproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he now felt so\nsorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped and\nbreathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... I will tell him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pierre; \xe2\x80\x9cbut...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did not know what to say.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she\nhad meant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I know all is over,\xe2\x80\x9d she said hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, that can never be.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only that I\nbeg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe trembled all over and sat down on a chair.\n\nA sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell him, I will tell him everything once more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut... I should like to know one thing....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow what?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s eyes asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know, did you love...\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre did not know how to\nrefer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdid you love that\nbad man?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t call him bad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, don\xe2\x80\x99t know at\nall....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love\nwelled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and\nhoped they would not be noticed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it any more, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, and his gentle,\ncordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it, my dear\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him everything; but one thing\nI beg of you, consider me your friend and if you want help, advice,\nor simply to open your heart to someone\xe2\x80\x94not now, but when your mind is\nclearer--think of me!\xe2\x80\x9d He took her hand and kissed it. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be happy\nif it\xe2\x80\x99s in my power...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre grew confused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me like that. I am not worth it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Nat\xc3\xa1sha and\nturned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.\n\nHe knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said it he was\namazed at his own words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, stop! You have your whole life before you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore me? No! All is over for me,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with shame and\nself-abasement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll over?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were not myself, but the handsomest,\ncleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this moment\nask on my knees for your hand and your love!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor the first time for many days Nat\xc3\xa1sha wept tears of gratitude and\ntenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.\n\nPierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom, restraining\ntears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without finding the\nsleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to now, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the coachman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere to?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre asked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere can I go now? Surely not to the\nClub or to pay calls?\xe2\x80\x9d All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in comparison\nwith this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in comparison\nwith that softened, grateful, last look she had given him through her\ntears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of frost Fahrenheit\nhe threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the\nair with joy.\n\nIt was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the\nblack roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky\ndid Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane\nthings compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised.\nAt the entrance to the Arb\xc3\xa1t Square an immense expanse of dark starry\nsky presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it, above the\nPrech\xc3\xadstenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars\nbut distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white\nlight, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant\ncomet of 1812\xe2\x80\x94the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes\nand the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long\nluminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed\njoyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having\ntraveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable\nspace, seemed suddenly\xe2\x80\x94like an arrow piercing the earth\xe2\x80\x94to remain\nfixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and\ndisplaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars. It\nseemed to Pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in\nhis own softened and uplifted soul, now blossoming into a new life.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK NINE: 1812\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nFrom the close of the year 1811 an intensified arming and concentrating of\nthe forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these forces\xe2\x80\x94millions\nof men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the army\xe2\x80\x94moved from the\nwest eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward which since 1811 Russian\nforces had been similarly drawn. On the twelfth of June, 1812, the\nforces of Western Europe crossed the Russian frontier and war began,\nthat is, an event took place opposed to human reason and to human\nnature. Millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable\ncrimes, frauds, treacheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of false money,\nburglaries, incendiarisms, and murders as in whole centuries are not\nrecorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world, but which\nthose who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes.\n\nWhat produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes? The\nhistorians tell us with na\xc3\xafve assurance that its causes were the wrongs\ninflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the Continental\nSystem, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of Alexander, the\nmistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.\n\nConsequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich,\nRumy\xc3\xa1ntsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have\ntaken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to\nhave written to Alexander: \xe2\x80\x9cMy respected Brother, I consent to restore\nthe duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and there would have been no war.\n\nWe can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries.\nIt naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by England\xe2\x80\x99s\nintrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena). It naturally\nseemed to members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war\nwas Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, that the cause of the\nwar was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the\nwar was the Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals\nand old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of\ngiving them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the\nneed of re-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of\nthat time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between\nRussia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed\nfrom Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. It\nis natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other\nreasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points\nof view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to\nposterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and\nperceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem insufficient.\nTo us it is incomprehensible that millions of Christian men killed and\ntortured each other either because Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander\nwas firm, or because England\xe2\x80\x99s policy was astute or the Duke of\nOldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances\nhave with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the\nDuke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed\nand ruined the people of Smol\xc3\xa9nsk and Moscow and were killed by them.\n\nTo us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried\naway by the process of research and can therefore regard the event\nwith unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present\nthemselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of\nthem we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears\nto us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance\ncompared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence\xe2\x80\x94apart\nfrom the cooperation of all the other coincident causes\xe2\x80\x94to occasion the\nevent. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to\nserve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to\nwithdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of\nOldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third,\nand a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have\nbeen so many less men in Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army and the war could not have\noccurred.\n\nHad Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw\nbeyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would\nhave been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second\nterm then also there could have been no war. Nor could there have been\na war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and\nhad Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic\ngovernment in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent\ndictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French\nRevolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have\nhappened. So all these causes\xe2\x80\x94myriads of causes\xe2\x80\x94coincided to bring it\nabout. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had\nto occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human\nfeelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows,\njust as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east\nto the west, slaying their fellows.\n\nThe actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed\nto hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was\ndrawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be\notherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom\nthe event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of\ninnumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event\ncould not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in\nwhose hands lay the real power\xe2\x80\x94the soldiers who fired, or transported\nprovisions and guns\xe2\x80\x94should consent to carry out the will of these weak\nindividuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number\nof diverse and complex causes.\n\nWe are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational\nevents (that is to say, events the reasonableness of which we do\nnot understand). The more we try to explain such events in history\nreasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to\nus.\n\nEach man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal\naims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from\ndoing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that action\nperformed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to\nhistory, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.\n\nThere are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life, which\nis the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental hive\nlife in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him.\n\nMan lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious instrument in\nthe attainment of the historic, universal, aims of humanity. A deed done\nis irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time with the actions of\nmillions of other men assumes an historic significance. The higher a man\nstands on the social ladder, the more people he is connected with\nand the more power he has over others, the more evident is the\npredestination and inevitability of his every action.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe king\xe2\x80\x99s heart is in the hands of the Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA king is history\xe2\x80\x99s slave.\n\nHistory, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind, uses\nevery moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.\n\nThough Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than ever that\nit depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses peuples\n*\xe2\x80\x94as Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him\xe2\x80\x94he had never\nbeen so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which compelled him, while\nthinking that he was acting on his own volition, to perform for the hive\nlife\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, for history\xe2\x80\x94whatever had to be performed.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cTo shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peoples.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and\nby the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and\nco-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the\nnonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburg\xe2\x80\x99s\nwrongs, the movement of troops into Prussia\xe2\x80\x94undertaken (as it seemed to\nNapoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace, the\nFrench Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s love and habit of war coinciding with his people\xe2\x80\x99s\ninclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations, and the\nexpenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages\nto compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors he received\nin Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the opinion of\ncontemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace,\nbut which only wounded the self-love of both sides, and millions of\nother causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or\ncoincided with it.\n\nWhen an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its\nattraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried\nby the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or\nbecause the boy standing below wants to eat it?\n\nNothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions in\nwhich all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the botanist\nwho finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so\nforth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says\nthe apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it. Equally\nright or wrong is he who says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he\nwanted to, and perished because Alexander desired his destruction, and\nhe who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because\nthe last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock. In historic\nevents the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and\nlike labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself.\n\nEvery act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will, is\nin an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of\nhistory and predestined from eternity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOn the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he had spent\nthree weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings,\nand even an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the\nemperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings\nand princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and diamonds\nof his own\xe2\x80\x94that is, which he had taken from other kings\xe2\x80\x94to the Empress\nof Austria, and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced the\nEmpress Marie Louise\xe2\x80\x94who regarded him as her husband, though he had left\nanother wife in Paris\xe2\x80\x94left her grieved by the parting which she seemed\nhardly able to bear. Though the diplomatists still firmly believed in\nthe possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end, and though\nthe Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander, calling him\nMonsieur mon fr\xc3\xa8re, and sincerely assured him that he did not want war\nand would always love and honor him\xe2\x80\x94yet he set off to join his army,\nand at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his\ntroops from west to east. He went in a traveling coach with six horses,\nsurrounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to\nPosen, Thorn, Danzig, and K\xc3\xb6nigsberg. At each of these towns thousands\nof people met him with excitement and enthusiasm.\n\nThe army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses carried\nhim in the same direction. On the tenth of June, * coming up with the\narmy, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of\na Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.\n\n    * Old style.\n\nNext day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the Niemen, and,\nchanging into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank in order to\nselect a place for the crossing.\n\nSeeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the\nwide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of Moscow\n(Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the Scythia\ninto which Alexander the Great had marched\xe2\x80\x94Napoleon unexpectedly, and\ncontrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an\nadvance, and the next day his army began to cross the Niemen.\n\nEarly in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent,\nwhich was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and\nlooked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of\nthe Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across\nthe river. The troops, knowing of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s presence, were on the\nlookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat\nand a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on\nthe hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cVive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!\xe2\x80\x9d and\none after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest\nthat had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and on by the three\nbridges to the other side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself, things\nget hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur! So these\nare the steppes of Asia! It\xe2\x80\x99s a nasty country all the same. Au revoir,\nBeauch\xc3\xa9; I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au revoir. Good\nluck!... Did you see the Emperor? Vive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!... preur!\xe2\x80\x94If\nthey make me Governor of India, G\xc3\xa9rard, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you Minister of\nKashmir\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s settled. Vive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! The\nCossacks\xe2\x80\x94those rascals\xe2\x80\x94see how they run! Vive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur! There he\nis, do you see him? I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him twice, as I see you now. The little\ncorporal... I saw him give the cross to one of the veterans.... Vive\nl\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!\xe2\x80\x9d came the voices of men, old and young, of most diverse\ncharacters and social positions. On the faces of all was one common\nexpression of joy at the commencement of the long-expected campaign and\nof rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on\nthe hill.\n\nOn the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse was\nbrought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the\nbridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant and rapturous\nacclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible\nto forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting,\nbut the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and\ndistracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the\ntime he joined the army. He rode across one of the swaying pontoon\nbridges to the farther side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in\nthe direction of K\xc3\xb3vno, preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the\nGuard who, breathless with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for\nhim through the troops. On reaching the broad river V\xc3\xadliya, he stopped\nnear a regiment of Polish Uhlans stationed by the river.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVivat!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and\npressing against one another to see him.\n\nNapoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log\nthat lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was handed\nhim which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him,\nand he gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became absorbed in a map laid\nout on the logs. Without lifting his head he said something, and two of\nhis aides-de-camp galloped off to the Polish Uhlans.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans\nwhen one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.\n\nThe order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel of the\nPolish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his speech\nfrom excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be permitted\nto swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford. In evident\nfear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse, he\nbegged to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\neyes. The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor would not be\ndispleased at this excess of zeal.\n\nAs soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer,\nwith happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted \xe2\x80\x9cVivat!\xe2\x80\x9d\nand, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped\ninto the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown\nrestive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest\npart where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after\nhim. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the\nstream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their\nhorses. Some of the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others\ntried to swim on, some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses\xe2\x80\x99\nmanes. They tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and,\nthough there was a ford one third of a mile away, were proud that they\nwere swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who\nsat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing. When\nthe aide-de-camp, having returned and choosing an opportune moment,\nventured to draw the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the devotion of the Poles\nto his person, the little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having\nsummoned Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving\nhim instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the\ndrowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.\n\nFor him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of\nthe world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough to\ndumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called for\nhis horse and rode to his quarters.\n\nSome forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were sent to\ntheir assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from which\nthey had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and with\ndifficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they had\ngot out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted \xe2\x80\x9cVivat!\xe2\x80\x9d\nand looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he\nno longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.\n\nThat evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper\nmoney prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as\npossible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a letter\ncontaining information about the orders to the French army had been\nfound, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish colonel who\nhad needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the L\xc3\xa9gion\nd\xe2\x80\x99honneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.\n\nQuos vult perdere dementat. *\n\n    * Those whom (God) wishes to destroy he drives mad.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in V\xc3\xadlna for more than a\nmonth, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for the\nwar that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor had come\nfrom Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The vacillation\nbetween the various plans that were proposed had even increased after\nthe Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each of the three\narmies had its own commander in chief, but there was no supreme\ncommander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume that\nresponsibility himself.\n\nThe longer the Emperor remained in V\xc3\xadlna the less did everybody\xe2\x80\x94tired of\nwaiting\xe2\x80\x94prepare for the war. All the efforts of those who surrounded the\nsovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly\nand forget that war was impending.\n\nIn June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by the\ncourtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the Polish\naides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for\nthe Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly received.\nThe Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected money by\nsubscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the\nEmperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a\nlandowner in the V\xc3\xadlna province, offered his country house for the fete,\nand the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner, regatta, and\nfireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsen\xe2\x80\x99s country seat.\n\nThe very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and\nhis vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian frontier,\nAlexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his\naides-de-camp at Bennigsen\xe2\x80\x99s country house.\n\nIt was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters declared\nthat rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place.\nCountess Bez\xc3\xbakhova was present among other Russian ladies who had\nfollowed the sovereign from Petersburg to V\xc3\xadlna and eclipsed the refined\nPolish ladies by her massive, so-called Russian type of beauty. The\nEmperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.\n\nBor\xc3\xads Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the\npresent en gar\xc3\xa7on (as he phrased it), was also there and, though not an\naide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses. Bor\xc3\xads\nwas now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought\npatronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his\nown age. He was meeting H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne in V\xc3\xadlna after not having seen her for\na long time and did not recall the past, but as H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne was enjoying\nthe favors of a very important personage and Bor\xc3\xads had only recently\nmarried, they met as good friends of long standing.\n\nAt midnight dancing was still going on. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, not having a suitable\npartner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with Bor\xc3\xads. They were the\nthird couple. Bor\xc3\xads, coolly looking at H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s dazzling bare shoulders\nwhich emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze gown, talked to her\nof old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware of it himself and\nunnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased to observe the Emperor\nwho was in the same room. The Emperor was not dancing, he stood in the\ndoorway, stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which\nhe alone knew how to utter.\n\nAs the mazurka began, Bor\xc3\xads saw that Adjutant General Balash\xc3\xabv, one of\nthose in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him and contrary\nto court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a Polish\nlady. Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked inquiringly\nat Balash\xc3\xabv and, evidently understanding that he only acted thus because\nthere were important reasons for so doing, nodded slightly to the lady\nand turned to him. Hardly had Balash\xc3\xabv begun to speak before a look of\namazement appeared on the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s face. He took Balash\xc3\xabv by the arm\nand crossed the room with him, unconsciously clearing a path seven\nyards wide as the people on both sides made way for him. Bor\xc3\xads noticed\nArakch\xc3\xa9ev\xe2\x80\x99s excited face when the sovereign went out with Balash\xc3\xabv.\nArakch\xc3\xa9ev looked at the Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with\nhis red nose, stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor\nto address him. (Bor\xc3\xads understood that Arakch\xc3\xa9ev envied Balash\xc3\xabv and\nwas displeased that evidently important news had reached the Emperor\notherwise than through himself.)\n\nBut the Emperor and Balash\xc3\xabv passed out into the illuminated garden\nwithout noticing Arakch\xc3\xa9ev who, holding his sword and glancing\nwrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.\n\nAll the time Bor\xc3\xads was going through the figures of the mazurka, he was\nworried by the question of what news Balash\xc3\xabv had brought and how he\ncould find it out before others. In the figure in which he had to choose\ntwo ladies, he whispered to H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne that he meant to choose Countess\nPotocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the veranda, and glided over\nthe parquet to the door opening into the garden, where, seeing Balash\xc3\xabv\nand the Emperor returning to the veranda, he stood still. They were\nmoving toward the door. Bor\xc3\xads, fluttering as if he had not had time to\nwithdraw, respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head.\n\nThe Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally\naffronted, was finishing with these words:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as long as\na single armed enemy remains in my country!\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed to Bor\xc3\xads that it\ngave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words. He was satisfied with\nthe form in which he had expressed his thoughts, but displeased that\nBor\xc3\xads had overheard it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet no one know of it!\xe2\x80\x9d the Emperor added with a frown.\n\nBor\xc3\xads understood that this was meant for him and, closing his eyes,\nslightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and\nremained there about another half-hour.\n\nBor\xc3\xads was thus the first to learn the news that the French army had\ncrossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain\nimportant personages that much that was concealed from others was\nusually known to him, and by this means he rose higher in their\nestimation.\n\n\nThe unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was\nparticularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations, and at\na ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of indignation\nand resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased him, fully\nexpressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On returning home\nat two o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night he sent for his secretary, Shishk\xc3\xb3v, and told\nhim to write an order to the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal\nPrince Saltyk\xc3\xb3v, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that\nhe would not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on\nRussian soil.\n\nNext day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:\n\nMonsieur mon fr\xc3\xa8re,\n\nYesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept\nmy engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian\nfrontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in\nwhich Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression, that\nYour Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me\nfrom the time Prince Kur\xc3\xa1kin asked for his passports. The reasons on\nwhich the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would\nnever have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for\naggression. In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has declared, was\nnever authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I was informed of\nit I let him know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain\nat his post. If Your Majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our\npeoples for such a misunderstanding, and consents to withdraw your\ntroops from Russian territory, I will regard what has passed as not\nhaving occurred and an understanding between us will be possible. In\nthe contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see myself forced to repel an\nattack that nothing on my part has provoked. It still depends on Your\nMajesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war.\n\nI am, etc.,\n\n(signed) Alexander\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAt two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, having\nsent for Balash\xc3\xabv and read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered him to\ntake it and hand it personally to the French Emperor. When dispatching\nBalash\xc3\xabv, the Emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make\npeace so long as a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told\nhim to transmit those words to Napoleon. Alexander did not insert them\nin his letter to Napoleon, because with his characteristic tact he felt\nit would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at\nreconciliation was being made, but he definitely instructed Balash\xc3\xabv to\nrepeat them personally to Napoleon.\n\nHaving set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a\nbugler and two Cossacks, Balash\xc3\xabv reached the French outposts at the\nvillage of Ryk\xc3\xb3nty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn. There he\nwas stopped by French cavalry sentinels.\n\nA French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform and a\nshaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balash\xc3\xabv to halt. Balash\xc3\xabv did\nnot do so at once, but continued to advance along the road at a walking\npace.\n\nThe noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse,\nadvanced his horse\xe2\x80\x99s chest against Balash\xc3\xabv, put his hand to his saber,\nand shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he deaf that\nhe did not do as he was told? Balash\xc3\xabv mentioned who he was. The\nnoncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental\nmatters without looking at the Russian general.\n\nAfter living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after\nconversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in general\nbeing accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service, Balash\xc3\xabv\nfound it very strange here on Russian soil to encounter this hostile,\nand still more this disrespectful, application of brute force to\nhimself.\n\nThe sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air was\nfresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road from\nthe village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one after\nanother, like bubbles rising in water.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer from the\nvillage. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked\nsilently at one another from time to time.\n\nA French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came\nriding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied\nby two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their horses all looked\nsmart and well kept.\n\nIt was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full\ntrim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of\nmartial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit\nof enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.\n\nThe French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was polite and\nevidently understood Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s importance. He led him past his soldiers\nand behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to\nthe Emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately, as the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nquarters were, he believed, not far off.\n\nThey rode through the village of Ryk\xc3\xb3nty, past tethered French hussar\nhorses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with\ncuriosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the other end of the\nvillage. The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile\nand a quarter away and would receive Balash\xc3\xabv and conduct him to his\ndestination.\n\nThe sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.\n\nThey had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a group\nof horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a black horse\nwith trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall man with plumes\nin his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders. He wore a red\nmantle, and stretched his long legs forward in French fashion. This man\nrode toward Balash\xc3\xabv at a gallop, his plumes flowing and his gems and\ngold lace glittering in the bright June sunshine.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv was only two horses\xe2\x80\x99 length from the equestrian with the\nbracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping\ntoward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when Julner, the\nFrench colonel, whispered respectfully: \xe2\x80\x9cThe King of Naples!\xe2\x80\x9d It was,\nin fact, Murat, now called \xe2\x80\x9cKing of Naples.\xe2\x80\x9d Though it was quite\nincomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he was called so,\nand was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore assumed a more\nsolemn and important air than formerly. He was so sure that he really\nwas the King of Naples that when, on the eve of his departure from that\ncity, while walking through the streets with his wife, some Italians\ncalled out to him: \xe2\x80\x9cViva il re!\xe2\x80\x9d * he turned to his wife with a pensive\nsmile and said: \xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellows, they don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I am leaving them\ntomorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cLong live the king.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nBut though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and pitied\nthe grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly, after he had\nbeen ordered to return to military service\xe2\x80\x94and especially since his last\ninterview with Napoleon in Danzig, when his august brother-in-law had\ntold him: \xe2\x80\x9cI made you King that you should reign in my way, but not in\nyours!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business, and\xe2\x80\x94like a\nwell-fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows\nskittish between the shafts\xe2\x80\x94he dressed up in clothes as variegated and\nexpensive as possible, and gaily and contentedly galloped along the\nroads of Poland, without himself knowing why or whither.\n\nOn seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its long hair\ncurling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner, and looked\ninquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully informed His\nMajesty of Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s mission, whose name he could not pronounce.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe Bal-mach\xc3\xa8ve!\xe2\x80\x9d said the King (overcoming by his assurance the\ndifficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). \xe2\x80\x9cCharmed to\nmake your acquaintance, General!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a gesture of kingly\ncondescension.\n\nAs soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity\ninstantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his\nnatural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the\nwithers of Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s horse and said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, General, it all looks like war,\xe2\x80\x9d as if regretting a circumstance\nof which he was unable to judge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Balash\xc3\xabv, \xe2\x80\x9cmy master, the Emperor, does not\ndesire war and as Your Majesty sees...\xe2\x80\x9d said Balash\xc3\xabv, using the words\nYour Majesty at every opportunity, with the affectation unavoidable in\nfrequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty.\n\nMurat\xe2\x80\x99s face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur\nde Bal-mach\xc3\xa8ve.\xe2\x80\x9d But royaut\xc3\xa9 oblige! * and he felt it incumbent on\nhim, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs with Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s\nenvoy. He dismounted, took Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and moving a few steps away\nfrom his suite, which waited respectfully, began to pace up and down\nwith him, trying to speak significantly. He referred to the fact that\nthe Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his\ntroops from Prussia, especially when that demand became generally known\nand the dignity of France was thereby offended.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cRoyalty has its obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv replied that there was \xe2\x80\x9cnothing offensive in the demand,\nbecause...\xe2\x80\x9d but Murat interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\nunexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of the\nwar.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear general!\xe2\x80\x9d Murat again interrupted him, \xe2\x80\x9cwith all my heart I\nwish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and that the war\nbegun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible!\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\nin the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another\ndespite a quarrel between their masters.\n\nAnd he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of his\nhealth, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent\nwith him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal dignity,\nMurat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which he had stood\nat his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t detain you longer, General. I wish success to your mission,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his\nglittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully\nawaiting him.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv rode on, supposing from Murat\xe2\x80\x99s words that he would very soon\nbe brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the next\nvillage the sentinels of Davout\xe2\x80\x99s infantry corps detained him as\nthe pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the corps\ncommander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to Marshal\nDavout.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nDavout was to Napoleon what Arakch\xc3\xa9ev was to Alexander\xe2\x80\x94though not a\ncoward like Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to\nexpress his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.\n\nIn the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are\nnecessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always\nappear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence and their\nproximity to the head of the government may be. This inevitability alone\ncan explain how the cruel Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, who tore out a grenadier\xe2\x80\x99s mustache\nwith his own hands, whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face\ndanger, and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier, was able to\nmaintain his powerful position with Alexander, whose own character was\nchivalrous, noble, and gentle.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s hut,\nwriting\xe2\x80\x94he was auditing accounts. Better quarters could have been\nfound him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put\nthemselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for\nbeing gloomy. For the same reason they are always hard at work and in a\nhurry. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I\nam sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?\xe2\x80\x9d the expression of\nhis face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity of such men,\nwhen they encounter anyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their own\ndreary, persistent activity. Davout allowed himself that pleasure when\nBalash\xc3\xabv was brought in. He became still more absorbed in his task when\nthe Russian general entered, and after glancing over his spectacles at\nBalash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s face, which was animated by the beauty of the morning and\nby his talk with Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still\nmore and sneered malevolently.\n\nWhen he noticed in Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s face the disagreeable impression this\nreception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he\nwanted.\n\nThinking he could have been received in such a manner only because\nDavout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor\nAlexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, Balash\xc3\xabv hastened to inform\nhim of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, after\nhearing him, became still surlier and ruder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your dispatch?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. \xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me. I will send it to\nthe Emperor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the\nEmperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s orders are obeyed in your army, but here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Davout,\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou must do as you\xe2\x80\x99re told.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his\ndependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer\non duty.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv took out the packet containing the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s letter and laid it\non the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid\nacross two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the inscription.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,\xe2\x80\x9d\nprotested Balash\xc3\xabv, \xe2\x80\x9cbut permit me to observe that I have the honor to\nbe adjutant general to His Majesty....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDavout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the\nsigns of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be treated as is fitting,\xe2\x80\x9d said he and, putting the packet in\nhis pocket, left the shed.\n\nA minute later the marshal\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant, de Castr\xc3\xa8s, came in and conducted\nBalash\xc3\xabv to the quarters assigned him.\n\nThat day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the barrels.\n\nNext day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balash\xc3\xabv to come to\nhim, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the\nbaggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one\nexcept Monsieur de Castr\xc3\xa8s.\n\nAfter four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his impotence\nand insignificance\xe2\x80\x94particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of\npower in which he had so lately moved\xe2\x80\x94and after several marches with\nthe marshal\xe2\x80\x99s baggage and the French army, which occupied the\nwhole district, Balash\xc3\xabv was brought to V\xc3\xadlna\xe2\x80\x94now occupied by the\nFrench\xe2\x80\x94through the very gate by which he had left it four days\npreviously.\n\nNext day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne, came\nto Balash\xc3\xabv and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s wish to honor him\nwith an audience.\n\nFour days before, sentinels of the Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk regiment had stood in\nfront of the house to which Balash\xc3\xabv was conducted, and now two French\ngrenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with\nshaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a\nbrilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting\nfor Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle\nhorse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received Balash\xc3\xabv in the very\nhouse in V\xc3\xadlna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThough Balash\xc3\xabv was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury\nand magnificence of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s court.\n\nThe Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many\ngenerals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates\xe2\x80\x94several of whom\nBalash\xc3\xabv had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia\xe2\x80\x94were waiting.\nDuroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going\nfor his ride.\n\nAfter some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into\nthe great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balash\xc3\xabv to follow\nhim.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a\nstudy, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him\non his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He heard hurried\nfootsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all\nwas silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps,\nfirm and resolute\xe2\x80\x94they were those of Napoleon. He had just finished\ndressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform, opening in front over\na white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, white\nleather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and\nHessian boots. His short hair had evidently just been brushed, but one\nlock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead. His plump white neck\nstood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled\nof Eau de Cologne. His full face, rather young-looking, with its\nprominent chin, wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial\nwelcome.\n\nHe entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head slightly\nthrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad thick\nshoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had that\nimposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in\ncomfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits that\nday.\n\nHe nodded in answer to Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s low and respectful bow, and coming up\nto him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his\ntime and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure\nhe will always say the right thing and say it well.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, General!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI have received the letter you brought\nfrom the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced with\nhis large eyes into Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s face and immediately looked past him.\n\nIt was plain that Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s personality did not interest him at all.\nEvidently only what took place within his own mind interested him.\nNothing outside himself had any significance for him, because everything\nin the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his will.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not, and did not, desire war,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it has been\nforced on me. Even now\xe2\x80\x9d (he emphasized the word) \xe2\x80\x9cI am ready to receive\nany explanations you can give me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for\ndissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly\nmoderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balash\xc3\xabv\nwas firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into\nnegotiations.\n\nWhen Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the\nRussian envoy, Balash\xc3\xabv began a speech he had prepared long before:\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire! The Emperor, my master...\xe2\x80\x9d but the sight of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\nbent on him confused him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are flurried\xe2\x80\x94compose yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d Napoleon\nseemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at\nBalash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s uniform and sword.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the\nEmperor Alexander did not consider Kur\xc3\xa1kin\xe2\x80\x99s demand for his passports a\nsufficient cause for war; that Kur\xc3\xa1kin had acted on his own initiative\nand without his sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s assent, that the Emperor Alexander did not\ndesire war, and had no relations with England.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to his\nfeelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balash\xc3\xabv might\nproceed.\n\nAfter saying all he had been instructed to say, Balash\xc3\xabv added that\nthe Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter into\nnegotiations except on condition that... Here Balash\xc3\xabv hesitated:\nhe remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his\nletter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltyk\xc3\xb3v and had\ntold Balash\xc3\xabv to repeat to Napoleon. Balash\xc3\xabv remembered these words,\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil,\xe2\x80\x9d but some\ncomplex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though he\nwished to do so. He grew confused and said: \xe2\x80\x9cOn condition that the\nFrench army retires beyond the Niemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNapoleon noticed Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassment when uttering these last\nwords; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver\nrhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began speaking in\na louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the speech that\nfollowed, Balash\xc3\xabv, who more than once lowered his eyes, involuntarily\nnoticed the quivering of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s left leg which increased the more\nNapoleon raised his voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\nI not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I\nhave waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to begin\nnegotiations, what is demanded of me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, frowning and making an\nenergetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Balash\xc3\xabv.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Niemen?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Napoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cSo now you want me to retire beyond\nthe Niemen\xe2\x80\x94only the Niemen?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Napoleon, looking straight at\nBalash\xc3\xabv.\n\nThe latter bowed his head respectfully.\n\nInstead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania,\nonly a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded. Napoleon turned\nquickly and began to pace the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen\nbefore commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago\nthe demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder,\nand yet you are willing to negotiate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again\nstopped in front of Balash\xc3\xabv. Balash\xc3\xabv noticed that his left leg was\nquivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern\nexpression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was\nconscious of. \xe2\x80\x9cThe vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe remarked at a later date.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be made to a\nPrince of Baden, but not to me!\xe2\x80\x9d Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his\nown surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept\nsuch conditions. You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his\narmy? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I\nhave expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when\nyour position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the\naim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued\nhurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace\nand discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and\npower and Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s errors and duplicity.\n\nThe commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the\nintention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing\nthat he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking,\nand the more he talked the less could he control his words.\n\nThe whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and\ninsult Alexander\xe2\x80\x94just what he had least desired at the commencement of\nthe interview.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear you have made peace with Turkey?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv bowed his head affirmatively.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeace has been concluded...\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\n\nBut Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the\ntalking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and\nunrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining\nMoldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those\nprovinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI promised and would\nhave given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now he\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united them to\nhis empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia from the\nGulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great could\nnot have done more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he\npaced up and down the room, repeating to Balash\xc3\xabv almost the very words\nhe had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. \xe2\x80\x9cAll that, he would have\nowed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated several\ntimes, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to\nhis nose, and greedily sniffed at it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s might have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked compassionately at Balash\xc3\xabv, and as soon as the latter tried\nto make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained\nthrough my friendship?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders\nin perplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no, he has preferred to surround himself with\nmy enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and\nWintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country;\nArmfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French\nsubject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all\nthe same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who\nshould awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s mind....\nGranted that were they competent they might be made use of,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x94hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts\nthat incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in his\nperception the two were one and the same)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut they are not even that!\nThey are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be the\nmost capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his first\nmovements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel proposes,\nArmfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on to act,\ndoes not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no result.\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n alone is a military man. He\xe2\x80\x99s stupid, but he has experience,\na quick eye, and resolution.... And what role is your young monarch\nplaying in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and throw on him\nthe responsibility for all that happens. A sovereign should not be with\nthe army unless he is a general!\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon, evidently uttering\nthese words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander\ndesired to be a military commander.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe campaign began only a week ago, and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t even been able to\ndefend V\xc3\xadlna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish\nprovinces. Your army is grumbling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, Your Majesty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Balash\xc3\xabv, hardly able to remember\nwhat had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with\ndifficulty, \xe2\x80\x9cthe troops are burning with eagerness...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know everything!\xe2\x80\x9d Napoleon interrupted him. \xe2\x80\x9cI know everything. I\nknow the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You have\nnot two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give\nyou my word of honor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor\ncould carry no weight\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI give you my word of honor that I have five\nhundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will\nbe of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making\npeace with you. As for the Swedes\xe2\x80\x94it is their fate to be governed by\nmad kings. Their king was insane and they changed him for\nanother\xe2\x80\x94Bernadotte, who promptly went mad\xe2\x80\x94for no Swede would ally\nhimself with Russia unless he were mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNapoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv knew how to reply to each of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, and would\nhave done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say\nsomething, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity\nof the Swedes, Balash\xc3\xabv wished to reply that when Russia is on her side\nSweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation\nto drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which\na man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is\nin the right. Balash\xc3\xabv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared\nto demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man,\nhe shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently\nseized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon\nhad any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them\nwhen he came to his senses. Balash\xc3\xabv stood with downcast eyes, looking\nat the movements of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting\nhis eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do I care about your allies?\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\nallies\xe2\x80\x94the Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like\nlions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this\nobvious falsehood, and that Balash\xc3\xabv still stood silently before him in\nthe same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned\nround, drew close to Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s face, and, gesticulating rapidly and\nenergetically with his white hands, almost shouted:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow that if you stir up Prussia against me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wipe it off the map\nof Europe!\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he\nstruck one of his small hands energetically with the other. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\nwill throw you back beyond the Dv\xc3\xadna and beyond the Dnieper, and will\nre-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of\nEurope to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you.\nThat is what you have gained by alienating me!\xe2\x80\x9d And he walked silently\nseveral times up and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching.\n\nHe put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted\nit several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balash\xc3\xabv. He\npaused, looked ironically straight into Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and said in a\nquiet voice:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the\nRussian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was\nsilent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to\nhim. Balash\xc3\xabv said that in Russia the best results were expected from\nthe war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s\nyour duty to say that, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it yourself. I have\nconvinced you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Balash\xc3\xabv had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed\nat it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door\nopened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor\nhis hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. Napoleon,\nwithout giving them a glance, turned to Balash\xc3\xabv:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssure the Emperor Alexander from me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, taking his hat, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\nI am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly\nesteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you\nshall receive my letter to the Emperor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception room\nrushed forward and descended the staircase.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nAfter all that Napoleon had said to him\xe2\x80\x94those bursts of anger and the\nlast dryly spoken words: \xe2\x80\x9cI will detain you no longer, General; you\nshall receive my letter,\xe2\x80\x9d Balash\xc3\xabv felt convinced that Napoleon would\nnot wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him\xe2\x80\x94an\ninsulted envoy\xe2\x80\x94especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. But,\nto his surprise, Balash\xc3\xabv received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine\nwith the Emperor that day.\n\nBessi\xc3\xa8res, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.\n\nNapoleon met Balash\xc3\xabv cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no sign\nof constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning,\nbut, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balash\xc3\xabv. It was evident that\nhe had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a\nmistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not\nbecause it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he\ndid it.\n\nThe Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through V\xc3\xadlna, where\ncrowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him. From all\nthe windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his\nmonogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcoming him, waved\ntheir handkerchiefs to him.\n\nAt dinner, having placed Balash\xc3\xabv beside him, Napoleon not only treated\nhim amiably but behaved as if Balash\xc3\xabv were one of his own courtiers,\none of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at\nhis success. In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and\nquestioned Balash\xc3\xabv about the Russian capital, not merely as an\ninterested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit, but as\nif convinced that Balash\xc3\xabv, as a Russian, must be flattered by his\ncuriosity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it true\nthat Moscow is called \xe2\x80\x98Holy Moscow\xe2\x80\x99? How many churches are there in\nMoscow?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nAnd receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches,\nhe remarked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy such a quantity of churches?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Russians are very devout,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Balash\xc3\xabv.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the\nbackwardness of a people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for\nappreciation of this remark.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery country has its own character,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Balash\xc3\xabv, \xe2\x80\x9cbesides Russia there\nis Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis reply of Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s, which hinted at the recent defeats of the\nFrench in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s\ncourt, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, where it\npassed unnoticed.\n\nThe uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they\nwere puzzled as to what Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s tone suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a point\nwe don\xe2\x80\x99t see it, or it is not at all witty,\xe2\x80\x9d their expressions seemed\nto say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not\nnotice it at all and na\xc3\xafvely asked Balash\xc3\xabv through what towns the\ndirect road from there to Moscow passed. Balash\xc3\xabv, who was on the alert\nall through the dinner, replied that just as \xe2\x80\x9call roads lead to Rome,\xe2\x80\x9d\nso all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and \xe2\x80\x9camong them the\nroad through Polt\xc3\xa1va, which Charles XII chose.\xe2\x80\x9d Balash\xc3\xabv involuntarily\nflushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but hardly had\nhe uttered the word Polt\xc3\xa1va before Caulaincourt began speaking of the\nbadness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg\nreminiscences.\n\nAfter dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s study, which four\ndays previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander. Napoleon sat\ndown, toying with his S\xc3\xa8vres coffee cup, and motioned Balash\xc3\xabv to a\nchair beside him.\n\nNapoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than\nany reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to\nconsider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was surrounded\nby men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his dinner,\nBalash\xc3\xabv too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned to him with a\npleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied? Strange,\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it, General?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, evidently not doubting that this remark\nwould be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s,\nsuperiority to Alexander.\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv made no reply and bowed his head in silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were\ndeliberating,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Napoleon with the same derisive and\nself-confident smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cis that\nthe Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies.\nThat I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may do the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\nand he turned inquiringly to Balash\xc3\xabv, and evidently this thought turned\nhim back on to the track of his morning\xe2\x80\x99s anger, which was still fresh\nin him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd let him know that I will do so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon, rising and pushing\nhis cup away with his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll drive all his W\xc3\xbcrttemberg, Baden, and\nWeimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive them out. Let him\nprepare an asylum for them in Russia!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBalash\xc3\xabv bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to\nmake his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help\nhearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression;\nhe treated Balash\xc3\xabv not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man\nnow fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master\xe2\x80\x99s\nhumiliation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What is\nthe good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to reign\nand not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a\nresponsibility?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up and down\nthe room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly, went up to\nBalash\xc3\xabv and with a slight smile, as confidently, quickly, and simply\nas if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to\nBalash\xc3\xabv, he raised his hand to the forty-year-old Russian general\xe2\x80\x99s\nface and, taking him by the ear, pulled it gently, smiling with his lips\nonly.\n\nTo have one\xe2\x80\x99s ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest\nhonor and mark of favor at the French court.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you say\nanything?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the\nadorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cAre the horses\nready for the general?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a slight inclination of his head\nin reply to Balash\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s bow. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him have mine, he has a long way to\ngo!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe letter taken by Balash\xc3\xabv was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander.\nEvery detail of the interview was communicated to the Russian monarch,\nand the war began....\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nAfter his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to\nPetersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet\nAnatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching\nPetersburg he inquired for Kur\xc3\xa1gin but the latter had already left the\ncity. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on\nhis track. Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin promptly obtained an appointment from\nthe Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia. While in\nPetersburg Prince Andrew met Kut\xc3\xbazov, his former commander who was\nalways well disposed toward him, and Kut\xc3\xbazov suggested that he should\naccompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general had\nbeen appointed commander in chief. So Prince Andrew, having received an\nappointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.\n\nPrince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge Kur\xc3\xa1gin.\nHe thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might\ncompromise the young Countess Rost\xc3\xb3va and so he wanted to meet Kur\xc3\xa1gin\npersonally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel. But he again\nfailed to meet Kur\xc3\xa1gin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived,\nthe latter returned to Russia. In a new country, amid new conditions,\nPrince Andrew found life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken\nfaith with him\xe2\x80\x94which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to\nconceal its effects\xe2\x80\x94the surroundings in which he had been happy became\ntrying to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized\nso highly were still more so. Not only could he no longer think the\nthoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the\nfield of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre, and which\nhad filled his solitude at Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo and then in Switzerland and Rome,\nbut he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons\nthey had revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical\nmatters unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more\neagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if\nthat lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him\nhad suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down, in\nwhich all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.\n\nOf the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was the\nsimplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s staff,\nhe applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised\nKut\xc3\xbazov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not having found\nKur\xc3\xa1gin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back\nto Russia after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might\nbe before he met Kur\xc3\xa1gin, despite his contempt for him and despite all\nthe proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping\nto a conflict with him\xe2\x80\x94he knew that when he did meet him he would not\nbe able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help\nsnatching at food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet\navenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and\npoisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in\nTurkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and\nambitious activity.\n\nIn the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached\nBucharest\xe2\x80\x94where Kut\xc3\xbazov had been living for two months, passing his\ndays and nights with a Wallachian woman\xe2\x80\x94Prince Andrew asked Kut\xc3\xbazov\nto transfer him to the Western Army. Kut\xc3\xbazov, who was already weary of\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very\nreadily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.\n\nBefore joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at\nDrissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way,\nbeing only two miles off the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk highroad. During the last three\nyears there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt,\nand seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that\non reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find\nthe way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail.\nHe entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up\nthe avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted,\nsleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the\nsame stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture,\nthe same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only\nsomewhat older. Princess Mary was still the same timid, plain maiden\ngetting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of\nher life in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was\nthe same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her\nexistence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become\nmore self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had\nbrought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and\ntalking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly\nintelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old prince\nhad changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a\nnoticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was the same as\never, only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was\nhappening in the world. Little Nicholas alone had changed. He had grown,\nbecome rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when merry and laughing, quite\nunconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just\nas the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey the law of\nimmutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. But though externally\nall remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people had\nchanged since Prince Andrew had seen them last. The household was\ndivided into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for\nhis sake and only met because he was there. To the one camp belonged\nthe old prince, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other\nPrincess Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and\nmaids.\n\nDuring his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but they\nwere ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose\nsake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all\nfeel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he\nwas taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb\nand retired to his apartments directly after dinner. In the evening,\nwhen Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to\ntell him of the young Count K\xc3\xa1mensky\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, the old prince\nbegan unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her\nsuperstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said,\nwas the only person really attached to him.\n\nThe old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess\nMary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by\nindulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The\nold prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her\nlife was very hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting\nher and that she deserved it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does Prince Andrew, who sees this,\nsay nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an\nold fool who, without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance\nand attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, so I\nmust explain it, and he must hear me out,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the old prince.\nAnd he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\nunreasonable character.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was\ncensuring his father for the first time in his life), \xe2\x80\x9cI did not wish to\nspeak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank opinion. If\nthere is any misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\nblame her for it at all. I know how she loves and respects you. Since\nyou ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Prince Andrew, becoming irritable\xe2\x80\x94as he was\nalways liable to do of late\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI can only say that if there are any\nmisunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman, who is not\nfit to be my sister\xe2\x80\x99s companion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural smile\ndisclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew could\nnot get accustomed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat companion, my dear boy? Eh? You\xe2\x80\x99ve already been talking it over!\nEh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, I did not want to judge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, in a hard and\nbitter tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall\nsay, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame\xe2\x80\x94the one to blame\xe2\x80\x94is\nthat Frenchwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man in a\nlow voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment,\nbut then he suddenly jumped up and cried: \xe2\x80\x9cBe off, be off! Let not a\ntrace of you remain here!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nPrince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him\nto stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did not\nleave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and\nT\xc3\xadkhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next day,\nbefore leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son\xe2\x80\x99s rooms. The boy,\ncurly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,\nand Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell\ninto a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this\npretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He\nsought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret\nat leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him,\nand was horrified to find neither. What meant still more to him was that\nhe sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son\nwhich he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on\nhis knee.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on!\xe2\x80\x9d said his son.\n\nPrince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out\nof the room.\n\nAs soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and\nespecially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had\nbeen happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity,\nand he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as\nsoon as possible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to go, Andrew?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his sister.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God that I can,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry you\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you say that,\nwhen you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle\nBourienne says he has been asking about you....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears\nbegan to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what\xe2\x80\x94what trash\xe2\x80\x94can cause\npeople misery!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary.\n\nShe understood that when speaking of \xe2\x80\x9ctrash\xe2\x80\x9d he referred not only to\nMademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who\nhad ruined his own happiness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, touching his\nelbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nunderstand you\xe2\x80\x9d (she looked down). \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that sorrow is the\nwork of men. Men are His tools.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked a little above Prince\nAndrew\xe2\x80\x99s head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks\nat the place where a familiar portrait hangs. \xe2\x80\x9cSorrow is sent by Him,\nnot by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to blame. If you think\nsomeone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We have no right to\npunish. And then you will know the happiness of forgiving.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman\xe2\x80\x99s virtue. But\na man should not and cannot forgive and forget,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and though\ntill that moment he had not been thinking of Kur\xc3\xa1gin, all his unexpended\nanger suddenly swelled up in his heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mary is already persuading me to forgive, it means that I ought long\nago to have punished him,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. And giving her no further reply,\nhe began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet\nKur\xc3\xa1gin who he knew was now in the army.\n\nPrincess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew how\nunhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled to\nhim, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again\nfrom the army and would certainly write to his father, but that the\nlonger he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men are\nnever to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d were the last words he heard from his sister when he\ntook leave of her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it must be so!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the\navenue from the house at Bald Hills. \xe2\x80\x9cShe, poor innocent creature, is\nleft to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits. The old\nman feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is growing up\nand rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be\ndeceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I want\nto meet that man whom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and\nlaugh at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThese conditions of life had been the same before, but then they were\nall connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only senseless\nthings, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nPrince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of\nJune. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied the fortified\ncamp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying to effect a\njunction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by\nlarge French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the general course\nof affairs in the Russian army, but no one anticipated any danger of\ninvasion of the Russian provinces, and no one thought the war would\nextend farther than the western, the Polish, provinces.\n\nPrince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on\nthe bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large\nvillage in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and\ncourtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the\nvillages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles. Barclay\nde Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He received\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he\nwould mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment,\nbut asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin, whom\nPrince Andrew had hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had\ngone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His mind\nwas occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting\na gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a while from the\ndistraction caused by the thought of Kur\xc3\xa1gin. During the first four\ndays, while no duties were required of him, Prince Andrew rode round the\nwhole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own knowledge and by\ntalks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion about it. But the\nquestion whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained\nfor him undecided. Already from his military experience and what he had\nseen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to the conclusion that in\nwar the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all\ndepends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy\xe2\x80\x94that cannot be\nforeseen\xe2\x80\x94are met, and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled.\nTo clear up this last point for himself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his\nposition and acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the control\nof the army and of the men and parties engaged in it, and he deduced for\nhimself the following of the state of affairs.\n\nWhile the Emperor had still been at V\xc3\xadlna, the forces had been divided\ninto three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the\narmy under Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, and thirdly, the one commanded by Torm\xc3\xa1sov. The\nEmperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. In the\norders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command,\nbut only that he would be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had\nwith him not a commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s staff but the imperial headquarters\nstaff. In attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff,\nQuartermaster General Prince Volk\xc3\xb3nski, as well as generals, imperial\naides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners,\nbut not the army staff. Besides these, there were in attendance on the\nEmperor without any definite appointments: Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, the ex-Minister\nof War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general in rank; the Grand Duke\nTsar\xc3\xa9vich Constantine P\xc3\xa1vlovich; Count Rumy\xc3\xa1ntsev, the Chancellor;\nStein, a former Prussian minister; Armfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel,\nthe chief author of the plan of campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general\nand Sardinian \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9; Wolzogen\xe2\x80\x94and many others. Though these men had no\nmilitary appointment in the army, their position gave them influence,\nand often a corps commander, or even the commander in chief, did not\nknow in what capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke,\nArakch\xc3\xa9ev, or Prince Volk\xc3\xb3nski, or was given this or that advice and did\nnot know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated\nfrom the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it had to be\nexecuted or not. But this was only the external condition; the essential\nsignificance of the presence of the Emperor and of all these people,\nfrom a courtier\xe2\x80\x99s point of view (and in an Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s vicinity all became\ncourtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the Emperor did not\nassume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies;\nthe men around him were his assistants. Arakch\xc3\xa9ev was a faithful\ncustodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s bodyguard.\nBennigsen was a landlord in the V\xc3\xadlna province who appeared to be doing\nthe honors of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful\nas an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke\nwas there because it suited him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there\nbecause his advice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high\nesteem personally. Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general\nfull of self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander.\nPaulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The\nadjutants general were there because they always accompanied the\nEmperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up\nthe plan of campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander to\nbelieve in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole business\nof the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts in\na more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, bookish\ntheorist, self-confident to the point of despising everyone else) was\nable to do.\n\nBesides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected\nideas every day\xe2\x80\x94especially the foreigners, who did so with a boldness\ncharacteristic of people employed in a country not their own\xe2\x80\x94there were\nmany secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals\nwere there.\n\nAmong the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant,\nand proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply defined\nsubdivisions of tendencies and parties:\n\nThe first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents\xe2\x80\x94military theorists\nwho believed in a science of war with immutable laws\xe2\x80\x94laws of oblique\nmovements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents demanded\na retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise\nlaws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism,\nignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that theory. To\nthis party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and\nothers, chiefly Germans.\n\nThe second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as\nalways happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of\nthis party were those who had demanded an advance from V\xc3\xadlna into Poland\nand freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold\naction, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still\nmore one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, Erm\xc3\xb3lov\n(who was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a\nfamous joke of Erm\xc3\xb3lov\xe2\x80\x99s was being circulated, that as a great favor he\nhad petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party,\nremembering Suv\xc3\xb3rov, said that what one had to do was not to reason,\nor stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of\nRussia, and not let the army get discouraged.\n\nTo the third party\xe2\x80\x94in which the Emperor had most confidence\xe2\x80\x94belonged the\ncourtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two. The\nmembers of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakch\xc3\xa9ev belonged,\nthought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to\nhave some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war, particularly\nagainst such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now),\nneeds most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and\nin that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be\nacknowledged that the theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one\nshould not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel\xe2\x80\x99s\nopponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and\nthen choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp\nat Drissa, according to Pfuel\xe2\x80\x99s plan, but on changing the movements of\nthe other armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other\ncould be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third\nparty.\n\nOf a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the\nTsar\xc3\xa9vich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, where\nhe had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry\nuniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French gallantly; but\nunexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid\nthe general confusion. The men of this party had both the quality\nand the defect of frankness in their opinions. They feared Napoleon,\nrecognized his strength and their own weakness, and frankly said so.\nThey said: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this!\nWe have abandoned V\xc3\xadlna and V\xc3\xadtebsk and shall abandon Drissa. The only\nreasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible,\nbefore we are turned out of Petersburg.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis view was very general in the upper army circles and found support\nalso in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumy\xc3\xa1ntsev, who, for other\nreasons of state, was in favor of peace.\n\nThe fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de\nTolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in\nchief. \xe2\x80\x9cBe he what he may\xe2\x80\x9d (they always began like that), \xe2\x80\x9che is an\nhonest, practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real power,\nfor war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command, and\nhe will show what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our army is well\norganized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering\nany defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to\nbe superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his\nincapacity already in 1807.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any\nrate there was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: \xe2\x80\x9cand\ntwist about as you may, you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually.\nLet the others make mistakes now!\xe2\x80\x9d said they, arguing that our\nretirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series\nof blunders. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any\nrate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this.\nWhat is wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen,\nwho made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justice\xe2\x80\x94a\nman whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the\nonly such man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to\nbe found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there were\nparticularly many round Alexander\xe2\x80\x94generals and imperial aides-de-camp\npassionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a monarch but as a\nman, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as Rost\xc3\xb3v had done\nin 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human\ncapabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with the sovereign\nfor refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for such excessive\nmodesty, and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign\nshould abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place\nhimself at the head of the army, gather round him a commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s\nstaff, and, consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where\nnecessary, would himself lead the troops, whose spirits would thereby be\nraised to the highest pitch.\n\nThe eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the\nothers as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither\npeace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa\nor anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor\nBennigsen, but only the one most essential thing\xe2\x80\x94as much advantage\nand pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of\nconflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nheadquarters, it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at\nother times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would\ntoday agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the day after,\nmerely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor, would declare\nthat he had no opinion at all on the matter. Another who wished to\ngain some advantage would attract the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s attention by loudly\nadvocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day before,\nand would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast and\nchallenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby proving\nthat he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good. A third,\nin the absence of opponents, between two councils would simply solicit\na special gratuity for his faithful services, well knowing that at that\nmoment people would be too busy to refuse him. A fourth while seemingly\noverwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\neye. A fifth, to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the\nEmperor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some\nnewly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more\nor less forcible and correct.\n\nAll the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and\npromotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial\nfavor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole\ndrone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it\nwas all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the\nuncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious danger giving\na peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid this vortex of\nintrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, and the diversity\nof race among these people\xe2\x80\x94this eighth and largest party of those\npreoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and\nobscurity to the common task. Whatever question arose, a swarm of these\ndrones, without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew\nover to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of\nthose who were disputing honestly.\n\nFrom among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached\nthe army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning\nto raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men\nexperienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any of\nthose conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of what\nwas going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of\nescape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.\n\nThe men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted\nchiefly from the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the army with his military court\nand from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional,\nand unsteady fluctuation of relations, which is in place at court but\nharmful in an army; that a sovereign should reign but not command the\narmy, and that the only way out of the position would be for the Emperor\nand his court to leave the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor\nparalyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his\npersonal safety, and that the worst commander in chief, if independent,\nwould be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and\nauthority of the monarch.\n\nJust at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa,\nShishk\xc3\xb3v, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of\nthis party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which Arakch\xc3\xa9ev and Balash\xc3\xabv\nagreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of permission given him\nby the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfully\nsuggested\xe2\x80\x94on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse\na warlike spirit in the people of the capital\xe2\x80\x94that the Emperor should\nleave the army.\n\nThat arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to\ndefend their country\xe2\x80\x94the very incitement which was the chief cause of\nRussia\xe2\x80\x99s triumph in so far as it was produced by the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s personal\npresence in Moscow\xe2\x80\x94was suggested to the Emperor, and accepted by him, as\na pretext for quitting the army.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThis letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when Barclay, one\nday at dinner, informed Bolk\xc3\xb3nski that the sovereign wished to see him\npersonally, to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrew was to\npresent himself at Bennigsen\xe2\x80\x99s quarters at six that evening.\n\nNews was received at the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s quarters that very day of a fresh\nmovement by Napoleon which might endanger the army\xe2\x80\x94news subsequently\nfound to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had ridden round the\nDrissa fortifications with the Emperor and had pointed out to him that\nthis fortified camp constructed by Pfuel, and till then considered\na chef-d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvre of tactical science which would ensure Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\ndestruction, was an absurdity, threatening the destruction of the\nRussian army.\n\nPrince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen\xe2\x80\x99s quarters\xe2\x80\x94a country gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river. Neither\nBennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chern\xc3\xbdshev, the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\naide-de-camp, received Bolk\xc3\xb3nski and informed him that the Emperor,\naccompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second\ntime that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the\nsuitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.\n\nChern\xc3\xbdshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel\nin his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was still\nan organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one corner stood\nthe folding bedstead of Bennigsen\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant. This adjutant was also\nthere and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding, evidently exhausted by\nwork or by feasting. Two doors led from the room, one straight on into\nwhat had been the drawing room, and another, on the right, to the study.\nThrough the first door came the sound of voices conversing in German\nand occasionally in French. In that drawing room were gathered, by\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s wish, not a military council (the Emperor preferred\nindefiniteness), but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in\nview of the impending difficulties. It was not a council of war, but,\nas it were, a council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor\npersonally. To this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General\nArmfeldt, Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had\nreferred to as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein\nwho was not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince\nAndrew had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince Andrew\nhad an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon\nafter himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a\nminute to speak to Chern\xc3\xbdshev.\n\nAt first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general,\nwhich fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince\nAndrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about\nhim something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German\ntheorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more\ntypical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German\ntheorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to\nsuch an extent.\n\nPfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust build,\nbroad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face was\nmuch wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been hastily\nbrushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in quaint\nlittle tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and angrily\naround, as if afraid of everything in that large apartment. Awkwardly\nholding up his sword, he addressed Chern\xc3\xbdshev and asked in German where\nthe Emperor was. One could see that he wished to pass through the rooms\nas quickly as possible, finish with the bows and greetings, and sit down\nto business in front of a map, where he would feel at home. He nodded\nhurriedly in reply to Chern\xc3\xbdshev, and smiled ironically on hearing that\nthe sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, had\nplanned in accord with his theory. He muttered something to himself\nabruptly and in a bass voice, as self-assured Germans do\xe2\x80\x94it might\nhave been \xe2\x80\x9cstupid fellow\xe2\x80\x9d... or \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole affair will be ruined,\xe2\x80\x9d or\n\xe2\x80\x9csomething absurd will come of it.\xe2\x80\x9d... Prince Andrew did not catch\nwhat he said and would have passed on, but Chern\xc3\xbdshev introduced him to\nPfuel, remarking that Prince Andrew was just back from Turkey where the\nwar had terminated so fortunately. Pfuel barely glanced\xe2\x80\x94not so much at\nPrince Andrew as past him\xe2\x80\x94and said, with a laugh: \xe2\x80\x9cThat must have been a\nfine tactical war\xe2\x80\x9d; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the room\nfrom which the sound of voices was heard.\n\nPfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly\ndisturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect\nand criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with\nPfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to\nform a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly\nand immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of\nmartyrdom as only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident\non the basis of an abstract notion\xe2\x80\x94science, that is, the supposed\nknowledge of absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he\nregards himself personally, both in mind and body, as irresistibly\nattractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured, as being a\ncitizen of the best-organized state in the world, and therefore as an\nEnglishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as\nan Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because\nhe is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian\nis self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know\nanything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The\nGerman\xe2\x80\x99s self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more\nrepulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the\ntruth\xe2\x80\x94science\xe2\x80\x94which he himself has invented but which is for him the\nabsolute truth.\n\nPfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science\xe2\x80\x94the theory of oblique\nmovements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Great\xe2\x80\x99s wars,\nand all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to\nhim absurd and barbarous\xe2\x80\x94monstrous collisions in which so many blunders\nwere committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars,\nthey did not accord with the theory, and therefore could not serve as\nmaterial for science.\n\nIn 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of\ncampaign that ended in Jena and Auerst\xc3\xa4dt, but he did not see the least\nproof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war. On\nthe contrary, the deviations made from his theory were, in his opinion,\nthe sole cause of the whole disaster, and with characteristically\ngleeful sarcasm he would remark, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, I said the whole affair would\ngo to the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d Pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love\ntheir theory that they lose sight of the theory\xe2\x80\x99s object\xe2\x80\x94its practical\napplication. His love of theory made him hate everything practical, and\nhe would not listen to it. He was even pleased by failures, for failures\nresulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him\nthe accuracy of his theory.\n\nHe said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chern\xc3\xbdshev about the present\nwar, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong,\nand who is not displeased that it should be so. The unbrushed tufts\nof hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples\nexpressed this most eloquently.\n\nHe passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his\nvoice were at once heard from there.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when\nCount Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, but not\npausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he\nwent. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on\nto make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign.\nChern\xc3\xbdshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor,\nwho looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to\nhim with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the\nleft, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward\nevidently wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited\nItalian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as for the man who advised forming this camp\xe2\x80\x94the Drissa camp,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPaulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince Andrew\nscanned his unfamiliar face, \xe2\x80\x9cas to that person, sire...\xe2\x80\x9d continued\nPaulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthe man\nwho advised the Drissa camp\xe2\x80\x94I see no alternative but the lunatic asylum\nor the gallows!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWithout heeding the end of the Italian\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, and as though\nnot hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, addressed him\ngraciously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting, and wait\nfor me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter\nMikh\xc3\xa1ylovich Volk\xc3\xb3nski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind them.\nPrince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s permission, accompanied\nPaulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the\ncouncil was assembled.\n\nPrince Peter Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovich Volk\xc3\xb3nski occupied the position, as it were,\nof chief of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s staff. He came out of the study into the\ndrawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put\nquestions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen\npresent. What had happened was that news (which afterwards proved to be\nfalse) had been received during the night of a movement by the French to\noutflank the Drissa camp.\n\nThe first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that\npresented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position\naway from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was\ninexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an\nopinion), but he urged that at this point the army should unite and\nthere await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that\nplan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions\nput\xe2\x80\x94which, in fact, his plan did not answer\xe2\x80\x94as to avail himself of the\nopportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals, one as\ngood as another, that could be made as long as it was quite unknown\nwhat character the war would take. Some disputed his arguments, others\ndefended them. Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish general\xe2\x80\x99s views\nmore warmly than anyone else, and in the course of the dispute drew from\nhis side pocket a well-filled notebook, which he asked permission to\nread to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme,\ntotally different from Armfeldt\xe2\x80\x99s or Pfuel\xe2\x80\x99s plan of campaign. In answer\nto Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged,\ncould alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap\n(as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.\n\nDuring all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen\n(his \xe2\x80\x9cbridge\xe2\x80\x9d in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted\ncontemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean\nhimself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when\nPrince Volk\xc3\xb3nski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his\nopinion, he merely said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an\nexposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s attack\xe2\x80\x94very fine, or\na retreat, also good! Why ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you yourselves know\neverything better than I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut when Volk\xc3\xb3nski said, with a frown, that it was in the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s name\nthat he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing animated,\nbegan to speak:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody thought they\nknew better than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters? There\nis nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly\nadhered to,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nis the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no\neventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that\neverything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really going to\noutflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.\n\nPaulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in French.\nWolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly,\nand began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with Pfuel, who\nwas rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened, but all\nthat could happen, had been foreseen in his scheme, and that if there\nwere now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan\nhad not been precisely executed. He kept laughing sarcastically, he\ndemonstrated, and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate, like\na mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of\na problem that has already been proved. Wolzogen took his place and\ncontinued to explain his views in French, every now and then turning to\nPfuel and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not so, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d But Pfuel, like a man\nheated in a fight who strikes those on his own side, shouted angrily at\nhis own supporter, Wolzogen:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, what more is there to explain?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPaulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in French.\nArmfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to Volk\xc3\xb3nski in\nRussian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.\n\nOf all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry,\ndetermined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present,\nevidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no\nhatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a\ntheory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out. He was\nridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary\nrespect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks\nof all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable\nat the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\ngenius, which, though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder.\nEverything was assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him\nfrom every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other\xe2\x80\x99s\nproposals. Pfuel alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian like\neveryone else who opposed his theory. But besides this feeling of\nrespect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrew. From the tone in which\nthe courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to\nspeak of him to the Emperor, but above all from a certain desperation\nin Pfuel\xe2\x80\x99s own expressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel\nhimself felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence\nand grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly\nbrushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he\nconcealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was\nevidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his\ntheory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world\nwas slipping away from him.\n\nThe discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted\nthe more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and\npersonalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general\nconclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to this\npolyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and shouts,\nfelt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A thought that had\nlong since and often occurred to him during his military activities\xe2\x80\x94the\nidea that there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that\ntherefore there can be no such thing as a military genius\xe2\x80\x94now appeared\nto him an obvious truth. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat theory and science is possible about a\nmatter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot\nbe defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be\nascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x99s armies will be in a day\xe2\x80\x99s time, and no one can gauge the\nforce of this or that detachment. Sometimes\xe2\x80\x94when there is not a coward\nat the front to shout, \xe2\x80\x98We are cut off!\xe2\x80\x99 and start running, but a brave\nand jolly lad who shouts, \xe2\x80\x98Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94a detachment of five thousand\nis worth thirty thousand, as at Sch\xc3\xb6n Grabern, while at times fifty\nthousand run from eight thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can\nthere be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing\ncan be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the\nsignificance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives\nno one knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci\nsays we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that\nthe worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it,\nand Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes\none plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the\nadvantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial.\nAnd why do they all speak of a \xe2\x80\x98military genius\xe2\x80\x99? Is a man a genius who\ncan order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go\nto the right and who to the left? It is only because military men are\ninvested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power,\nattributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The best\ngenerals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded\nmen. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And of\nBonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the\nfield of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any\nspecial qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest\nand best human attributes\xe2\x80\x94love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic\ninquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he\nis doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient\npatience), and only then will he be a brave leader. God forbid that he\nshould be humane, should love, or pity, or think of what is just\nand unjust. It is understandable that a theory of their \xe2\x80\x98genius\xe2\x80\x99 was\ninvented for them long ago because they have power! The success of a\nmilitary action depends not on them, but on the man in the ranks who\nshouts, \xe2\x80\x98We are lost!\xe2\x80\x99 or who shouts, \xe2\x80\x98Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99 And only in the ranks\ncan one serve with assurance of being useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he roused\nhimself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.\n\nAt the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he would\nlike to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court circles\nforever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s person, but\nfor permission to serve in the army.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nBefore the beginning of the campaign, Rost\xc3\xb3v had received a letter from\nhis parents in which they told him briefly of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s illness and the\nbreaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they explained by\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas to retire from\nthe army and return home. On receiving this letter, Nicholas did not\neven make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the\narmy, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry Nat\xc3\xa1sha was ill and her\nengagement broken off, and that he would do all he could to meet their\nwishes. To S\xc3\xb3nya he wrote separately.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdored friend of my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing but honor could keep\nme from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of the\ncampaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comrades\xe2\x80\x99 eyes but\nin my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the\nFatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe me, directly\nthe war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by you, I will\nthrow up everything and fly to you, to press you forever to my ardent\nbreast.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that prevented\nRost\xc3\xb3v from returning home as he had promised and marrying S\xc3\xb3nya. The\nautumn in Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe with the hunting, and the winter with the Christmas\nholidays and S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s love, had opened out to him a vista of tranquil\nrural joys and peace such as he had never known before, and which now\nallured him. \xe2\x80\x9cA splendid wife, children, a good pack of hounds, a\ndozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by\nelection...\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. But now the campaign was beginning, and he had\nto remain with his regiment. And since it had to be so, Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nas was natural to him, felt contented with the life he led in the\nregiment and was able to find pleasure in that life.\n\nOn his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully welcomed\nby his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the\nUkraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation\nfrom his commanders. During his absence he had been promoted captain,\nand when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in\nnumbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.\n\nThe campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay,\nnew officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody was\ninfected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement\nof a war, and Rost\xc3\xb3v, conscious of his advantageous position in the\nregiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of\nmilitary service, though he knew that sooner or later he would have to\nrelinquish them.\n\nThe troops retired from V\xc3\xadlna for various complicated reasons of state,\npolitical and strategic. Each step of the retreat was accompanied by\na complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and passions at\nheadquarters. For the P\xc3\xa1vlograd hussars, however, the whole of this\nretreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies\nwas a very simple and agreeable business.\n\nIt was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness, and\nintriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where\nthey were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat, it was only\nbecause they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or some\npretty young Polish lady. If the thought that things looked bad chanced\nto enter anyone\xe2\x80\x99s head, he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good\nsoldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs, but only of\nthe task nearest to hand. First they camped gaily before V\xc3\xadlna, making\nacquaintance with the Polish landowners, preparing for reviews and being\nreviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders. Then came an order\nto retreat to Sventsy\xc3\xa1ni and destroy any provisions they could not carry\naway with them. Sventsy\xc3\xa1ni was remembered by the hussars only as the\ndrunken camp, a name the whole army gave to their encampment there,\nand because many complaints were made against the troops, who, taking\nadvantage of the order to collect provisions, took also horses,\ncarriages, and carpets from the Polish proprietors. Rost\xc3\xb3v remembered\nSventsy\xc3\xa1ni, because on the first day of their arrival at that small town\nhe changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken\nmen of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels\nof old beer. From Sventsy\xc3\xa1ni they retired farther and farther to Drissa,\nand thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier of Russia\nproper.\n\nOn the thirteenth of July the P\xc3\xa1vlograds took part in a serious action\nfor the first time.\n\nOn the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy\nstorm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was remarkable\nfor its storms.\n\nThe two P\xc3\xa1vlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye, which\nwas already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and\nhorses. The rain was descending in torrents, and Rost\xc3\xb3v, with a young\nofficer named Ily\xc3\xadn, his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, was sitting in a hastily constructed\nshelter. An officer of their regiment, with long mustaches extending\nonto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the\nrain, entered Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s shelter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of Ra\xc3\xa9vski\xe2\x80\x99s\nexploit?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the officer gave them details of the Salt\xc3\xa1nov battle, which he had\nheard at the staff.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water\ntrickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional\nglance at Ily\xc3\xadn, who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad\nof sixteen who had recently joined the regiment, was now in the same\nrelation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Den\xc3\xadsov seven years\nbefore. Ily\xc3\xadn tried to imitate Rost\xc3\xb3v in everything and adored him as a\ngirl might have done.\n\nZdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently of\nthe Salt\xc3\xa1nov dam being \xe2\x80\x9ca Russian Thermopylae,\xe2\x80\x9d and of how a deed worthy\nof antiquity had been performed by General Ra\xc3\xa9vski. He recounted how\nRa\xc3\xa9vski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had\ncharged with them beside him. Rost\xc3\xb3v heard the story and not only said\nnothing to encourage Zdrzhinski\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm but, on the contrary,\nlooked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no\nintention of contradicting it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and\nof 1807 Rost\xc3\xb3v knew by experience that men always lie when describing\nmilitary exploits, as he himself had done when recounting them; besides\nthat, he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at\nall as we can imagine or relate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski\xe2\x80\x99s\ntale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches\nextending over his cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was\nhis habit, and crowded Rost\xc3\xb3v in the narrow shanty. Rost\xc3\xb3v looked at him\nin silence. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, there must have been such a confusion\nand crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Ra\xc3\xa9vski did lead\nhis sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen\nmen nearest to him,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe rest could not have seen how or\nwith whom Ra\xc3\xa9vski came onto the dam. And even those who did see it\nwould not have been much stimulated by it, for what had they to do with\nRa\xc3\xa9vski\xe2\x80\x99s tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger?\nAnd besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not depend on whether\nthey took the Salt\xc3\xa1nov dam or not, as we are told was the case at\nThermopylae. So why should he have made such a sacrifice? And why expose\nhis own children in the battle? I would not have taken my brother P\xc3\xa9tya\nthere, or even Ily\xc3\xadn, who\xe2\x80\x99s a stranger to me but a nice lad, but would\nhave tried to put them somewhere under cover,\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholas continued\nto think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his\nthoughts, for in such matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew\nthat this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to\npretend not to doubt it. And he acted accordingly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand this any more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ily\xc3\xadn, noticing that Rost\xc3\xb3v did not\nrelish Zdrzhinski\xe2\x80\x99s conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cMy stockings and shirt... and the\nwater is running on my seat! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and look for shelter. The rain\nseems less heavy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIly\xc3\xadn went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.\n\nFive minutes later Ily\xc3\xadn, splashing through the mud, came running back\nto the shanty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! Rost\xc3\xb3v, come quick! I\xe2\x80\x99ve found it! About two hundred yards away\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a tavern where ours have already gathered. We can at least get\ndry there, and Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty young\nGerman woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether from lack\nof means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in\nthe early days of their marriage, took her about with him wherever the\nhussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among\nthe hussar officers.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavr\xc3\xbashka to\nfollow with the things, and\xe2\x80\x94now slipping in the mud, now splashing right\nthrough it\xe2\x80\x94set off with Ily\xc3\xadn in the lessening rain and the darkness\nthat was occasionally rent by distant lightning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRost\xc3\xb3v, where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere. What lightning!\xe2\x80\x9d they called to one another.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIn the tavern, before which stood the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s covered cart, there were\nalready some five officers. Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna, a plump little blonde\nGerman, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench\nin the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her.\nRost\xc3\xb3v and Ily\xc3\xadn, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts\nand laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, how jolly we are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why do you stand there gaping?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don\xe2\x80\x99t make our\ndrawing room so wet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mess Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna\xe2\x80\x99s dress!\xe2\x80\x9d cried other voices.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v and Ily\xc3\xadn hastened to find a corner where they could change into\ndry clothes without offending Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna\xe2\x80\x99s modesty. They were\ngoing into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but found it\ncompletely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light\nof a solitary candle on an empty box, and these officers would on no\naccount yield their position. Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna obliged them with the\nloan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and behind that screen\nRost\xc3\xb3v and Ily\xc3\xadn, helped by Lavr\xc3\xbashka who had brought their kits,\nchanged their wet things for dry ones.\n\nA fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was found,\nfixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was\nproduced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary\nHendr\xc3\xadkhovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One offered her a\nclean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands, another spread a jacket\nunder her little feet to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat\nover the window to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies\noff her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face, lest he should wake up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave him alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna, smiling timidly and happily.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer, \xe2\x80\x9cone must look after\nthe doctor. Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99ll take pity on me someday, when it comes to\ncutting off a leg or an arm for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one could\nnot make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held\nonly six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to\ntake turns in order of seniority to receive one\xe2\x80\x99s tumbler from Mary\nHendr\xc3\xadkhovna\xe2\x80\x99s plump little hands with their short and not overclean\nnails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love with\nher that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition soon\nleft their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the general\nmood of courting Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna. She, seeing herself surrounded by\nsuch brilliant and polite young men, beamed with satisfaction, try as\nshe might to hide it, and perturbed as she evidently was each time her\nhusband moved in his sleep behind her.\n\nThere was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything\nelse, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary\nHendr\xc3\xadkhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rost\xc3\xb3v received\nhis tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna to stir\nit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you take it without sugar?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling all the time, as if\neverything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and\nhad a double meaning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should stir\nmy tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone\nmeanwhile had pounced on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUse your finger, Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna, it will be still nicer,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nRost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo hot!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, blushing with pleasure.\n\nIly\xc3\xadn put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to\nMary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my cup,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly dip your finger in it and I\xe2\x80\x99ll drink it\nall up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen they had emptied the samovar, Rost\xc3\xb3v took a pack of cards and\nproposed that they should play \xe2\x80\x9cKings\xe2\x80\x9d with Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna. They drew\nlots to settle who should make up her set. At Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion it\nwas agreed that whoever became \xe2\x80\x9cKing\xe2\x80\x9d should have the right to kiss Mary\nHendr\xc3\xadkhovna\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and that the \xe2\x80\x9cBooby\xe2\x80\x9d should go to refill and reheat\nthe samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but supposing Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna is \xe2\x80\x98King\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ily\xc3\xadn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey had hardly begun to play before the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s disheveled head\nsuddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendr\xc3\xadkhovna. He had been awake for\nsome time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found nothing\nentertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad and\ndepressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked\nto be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon as he\nhad left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and Mary\nHendr\xc3\xadkhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became\nstill more attractive to them. Returning from the yard, the doctor\ntold his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and looked at him in\nalarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had ceased and they must go\nto sleep in their covered cart, or everything in it would be stolen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll send an orderly.... Two of them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idea,\ndoctor!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stand guard on it myself!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ily\xc3\xadn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for two\nnights,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his wife,\nwaiting for the game to end.\n\nSeeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers grew\nstill merrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, for\nwhich they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had gone, taking\nhis wife with him, and had settled down with her in their covered cart,\nthe officers lay down in the tavern, covering themselves with their\nwet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged\nremarks, recalling the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s uneasiness and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s delight, now\nthey ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the\ncovered trap. Several times Rost\xc3\xb3v, covering his head, tried to go\nto sleep, but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be\nresumed, to the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nIt was nearly three o\xe2\x80\x99clock but no one was yet asleep, when the\nquartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town\nof Ostr\xc3\xb3vna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly\ngetting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar. But\nRost\xc3\xb3v went off to his squadron without waiting for tea. Day was\nbreaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were dispersing. It felt\ndamp and cold, especially in clothes that were still moist. As they left\nthe tavern in the twilight of the dawn, Rost\xc3\xb3v and Ily\xc3\xadn both glanced\nunder the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s cart, from\nunder the apron of which his feet were sticking out, and in the middle\nof which his wife\xe2\x80\x99s nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing\naudible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe really is a dear little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v to Ily\xc3\xadn, who was\nfollowing him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA charming woman!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ily\xc3\xadn, with all the gravity of a boy of\nsixteen.\n\nHalf an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The command\nwas heard to \xe2\x80\x9cmount\xe2\x80\x9d and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted.\nRost\xc3\xb3v riding in front gave the order \xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d and the hussars, with\nclanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs splashing in the\nmud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch\ntrees on each side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone\non in front.\n\nTattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding\nbefore the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass\nwhich always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still\nwet with the night\xe2\x80\x99s rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also\nwet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one\nside. The soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 faces were more and more clearly visible. Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nalways closely followed by Ily\xc3\xadn, rode along the side of the road\nbetween two rows of birch trees.\n\nWhen campaigning, Rost\xc3\xb3v allowed himself the indulgence of riding not\na regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman,\nhe had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Don\xc3\xa9ts horse,\ndun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could\noutgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought\nof the horse, of the morning, of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s wife, but not once of the\nimpending danger.\n\nFormerly, when going into action, Rost\xc3\xb3v had felt afraid; now he had\nnot the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown\nused to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because\nhe had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown\naccustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would\nseem most likely to interest him\xe2\x80\x94the impending danger. During the\nfirst period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached\nhimself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time\nit had come of itself. Now he rode beside Ily\xc3\xadn under the birch trees,\noccasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, sometimes\ntouching his horse\xe2\x80\x99s side with his foot, or, without turning round,\nhanding a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him, with as\ncalm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride. He\nglanced with pity at the excited face of Ily\xc3\xadn, who talked much and in\ngreat agitation. He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of\nterror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could\nhelp him.\n\nAs soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds,\nthe wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning\nafter the storm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and\nall was still. The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared\nbehind a long narrow cloud that hung above it. A few minutes later it\nreappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its\nedge. Everything grew bright and glittered. And with that light, and as\nif in reply to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them.\n\nBefore Rost\xc3\xb3v had had time to consider and determine the distance of\nthat firing, Count Ostermann-Tolst\xc3\xb3y\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant came galloping from\nV\xc3\xadtebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.\n\nThe squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery\xe2\x80\x94which had\nalso quickened their pace\xe2\x80\x94rode down a hill, and passing through an empty\nand deserted village again ascended. The horses began to lather and the\nmen to flush.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalt! Dress your ranks!\xe2\x80\x9d the order of the regimental commander was\nheard ahead. \xe2\x80\x9cForward by the left. Walk, march!\xe2\x80\x9d came the order from in\nfront.\n\nAnd the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of\nour position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To\nthe right stood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve.\nHigher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through\nthe wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning\nsunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\ncolumns and guns. Our advanced line, already in action, could be heard\nbriskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale.\n\nAt these sounds, long unheard, Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s spirits rose, as at the strains\nof the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now together,\nnow several quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then\nagain it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding\nthem.\n\nThe hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade\nbegan. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron,\nhalted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to\nthe guns.\n\nAfter Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForm column! Prepare to charge!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry\nto pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears fluttering,\nand trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was seen below to\nthe left.\n\nAs soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered up\nthe hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by the\nUhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but fell\nspent without taking effect.\n\nThe sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more\npleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rost\xc3\xb3v than the previous sounds\nof firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening out\nbefore him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement\nof the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French dragoons, something\nconfused happened there amid the smoke, and five minutes later our\nUhlans were galloping back, not to the place they had occupied but more\nto the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and\nbehind them, in a large group, blue French dragoons on gray horses could\nbe seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, with his keen sportsman\xe2\x80\x99s eye, was one of the first to catch\nsight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and\nnearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons\npursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small\nat the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving their\narms and their sabers in the air.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He felt\ninstinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now, the\nlatter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be made it must\nbe done now, at that very moment, or it would be too late. He looked\naround. A captain, standing beside him, was gazing like himself with\neyes fixed on the cavalry below them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew Sevasty\xc3\xa1nych!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, we could crush them....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine thing too!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand really...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to\nthe front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the\nword of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following\nhim. Rost\xc3\xb3v himself did not know how or why he did it. He acted as he\ndid when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He saw the dragoons\nnear and that they were galloping in disorder; he knew they could not\nwithstand an attack\xe2\x80\x94knew there was only that moment and that if he let\nit slip it would not return. The bullets were whining and whistling so\nstimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could\nnot restrain himself. He touched his horse, gave the word of command,\nand immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his\ndeployed squadron, rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons.\nHardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace\ninstinctively changed to a gallop, which grew faster and faster as they\ndrew nearer to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after\nthem. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the\nforemost began to turn, while those behind began to halt. With the same\nfeeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf, Rost\xc3\xb3v\ngave rein to his Don\xc3\xa9ts horse and galloped to intersect the path of the\ndragoons\xe2\x80\x99 disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot\nflung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless\nhorse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were\ngalloping back. Rost\xc3\xb3v, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after\nhim. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and\nalmost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would\nimmediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his\nuniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse\nand urging it on with his saber. In another moment Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s horse dashed\nits breast against the hindquarters of the officer\xe2\x80\x99s horse, almost\nknocking it over, and at the same instant Rost\xc3\xb3v, without knowing why,\nraised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.\n\nThe instant he had done this, all Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s animation vanished. The\nofficer fell, not so much from the blow\xe2\x80\x94which had but slightly cut his\narm above the elbow\xe2\x80\x94as from the shock to his horse and from fright.\nRost\xc3\xb3v reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he\nhad vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on\nthe ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed\nup with fear as if he every moment expected another blow, gazed up at\nRost\xc3\xb3v with shrinking terror. His pale and mud-stained face\xe2\x80\x94fair and\nyoung, with a dimple in the chin and light-blue eyes\xe2\x80\x94was not an enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\nface at all suited to a battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face.\nBefore Rost\xc3\xb3v had decided what to do with him, the officer cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI\nsurrender!\xe2\x80\x9d He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the\nstirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s face.\nSome hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the\nsaddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was\nwounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his\nhorse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him;\na third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In front, the\nFrench infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily\nback with their prisoners. Rost\xc3\xb3v galloped back with the rest, aware of\nan unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart. Something vague and\nconfused, which he could not at all account for, had come over him with\nthe capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him.\n\nCount Ostermann-Tolst\xc3\xb3y met the returning hussars, sent for Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nthanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to the Emperor\nand would recommend him for a St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Cross. When sent for by Count\nOstermann, Rost\xc3\xb3v, remembering that he had charged without orders,\nfelt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of\ndiscipline. Ostermann\xe2\x80\x99s flattering words and promise of a reward should\ntherefore have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt\nthat same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\non earth is worrying me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself as he rode back from the\ngeneral. \xe2\x80\x9cIly\xc3\xadn? No, he\xe2\x80\x99s safe. Have I disgraced myself in any way? No,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not it.\xe2\x80\x9d Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\noh yes, that French officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm\npaused when I raised it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have\na look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. He was sitting in\nhis foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about\nhim. The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound. He\nglanced at Rost\xc3\xb3v with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting.\nRost\xc3\xb3v still had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.\n\nAll that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nwithout being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied.\nHe drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept turning something\nover in his mind.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which to\nhis amazement had gained him the St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Cross and even given him\na reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at all\nunderstand. \xe2\x80\x9cSo others are even more afraid than I am!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cSo\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all there is in what is called heroism! And did I do it for my\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes?\nAnd how frightened he was! He thought that I should kill him. Why should\nI kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given me a St. George\xe2\x80\x99s\nCross.... I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it out at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach\nno clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune in the\nservice, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the affair at\nOstr\xc3\xb3vna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar\nbattalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nOn receiving news of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s illness, the countess, though not quite\nwell yet and still weak, went to Moscow with P\xc3\xa9tya and the rest of the\nhousehold, and the whole family moved from M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s house to\ntheir own and settled down in town.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for\nher parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness,\nher conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the\nbackground. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider\nin how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat\nor sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them\nfeel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help\nher. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in\nFrench, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great\nvariety of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple\nidea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was suffering from, as no disease suffered by a live man can be\nknown, for every living person has his own peculiarities and always\nhas his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to\nmedicine\xe2\x80\x94not a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so\non mentioned in medical books, but a disease consisting of one of the\ninnumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs. This simple\nthought could not occur to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard\nthat he is unable to work his charms) because the business of their\nlives was to cure, and they received money for it and had spent the best\nyears of their lives on that business. But, above all, that thought\nwas kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were\nreally useful, as in fact they were to the whole Rost\xc3\xb3v family. Their\nusefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for\nthe most part harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, as they\nwere given in small doses), but they were useful, necessary, and\nindispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and\nof those who loved her\xe2\x80\x94and that is why there are, and always will be,\npseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They satisfied\nthat eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy, and that\nsomething should be done, which is felt by those who are suffering. They\nsatisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child, when it\nwants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A child knocks itself\nand runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching\nspot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better when this is done. The child\ncannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no\nremedy for its pain, and the hope of relief and the expression of its\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it. The doctors were\nof use to Nat\xc3\xa1sha because they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her\nthat it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s in\nthe Arb\xc3\xa1t and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble\nand seventy kopeks, and if she took those powders in boiled water at\nintervals of precisely two hours, neither more nor less.\n\nWhat would S\xc3\xb3nya and the count and countess have done, how would they\nhave looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been those pills\nto give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken cutlets, and all the\nother details of life ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of which\nsupplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle? How would\nthe count have borne his dearly loved daughter\xe2\x80\x99s illness had he not\nknown that it was costing him a thousand rubles, and that he would not\ngrudge thousands more to benefit her, or had he not known that if her\nillness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take\nher abroad for consultations there, and had he not been able to explain\nthe details of how M\xc3\xa9tivier and Feller had not understood the symptoms,\nbut Frise had, and M\xc3\xbadrov had diagnosed them even better? What would the\ncountess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid\nfor not strictly obeying the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll never get well like that,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, forgetting her grief\nin her vexation, \xe2\x80\x9cif you won\xe2\x80\x99t obey the doctor and take your medicine at\nthe right time! You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t trifle with it, you know, or it may turn to\npneumonia,\xe2\x80\x9d she would go on, deriving much comfort from the utterance of\nthat foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well as to herself.\n\nWhat would S\xc3\xb3nya have done without the glad consciousness that she had\nnot undressed during the first three nights, in order to be ready to\ncarry out all the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s injunctions with precision, and that she\nstill kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the\nslightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered?\nEven to Nat\xc3\xa1sha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices\nwere being made for her sake, and to know that she had to take medicine\nat certain hours, though she declared that no medicine would cure her\nand that it was all nonsense. And it was even pleasant to be able to\nshow, by disregarding the orders, that she did not believe in medical\ntreatment and did not value her life.\n\nThe doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and\nregardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he had\ngone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed him, he\nassumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though\nthere was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and\none must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly mental, but... And\nthe countess, trying to conceal the action from herself and from him,\nslipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient\nwith a more tranquil mind.\n\nThe symptoms of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s illness were that she ate little, slept\nlittle, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that\nshe could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in the\nstifling atmosphere of the town, and the Rost\xc3\xb3vs did not move to the\ncountry that summer of 1812.\n\nIn spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out\nof the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of\nsuch things made a large collection, and in spite of being deprived of\nthe country life to which she was accustomed, youth prevailed. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\ngrief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life, it ceased\nto press so painfully on her heart, it gradually faded into the past,\nand she began to recover physically.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all external\nforms of pleasure\xe2\x80\x94balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters\xe2\x80\x94but she\nnever laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not\nsing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears\nchoked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure\ntimes which could never return, tears of vexation that she should so\nuselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy.\nLaughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy,\nin face of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint, no wish to\ncoquet ever entered her head. She said and felt at that time that no\nman was more to her than Nast\xc3\xa1sya Iv\xc3\xa1novna, the buffoon. Something stood\nsentinel within her and forbade her every joy. Besides, she had lost all\nthe old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full\nof hope. The previous autumn, the hunting, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Christmas\nholidays spent with Nicholas at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe were what she recalled oftenest\nand most painfully. What would she not have given to bring back even a\nsingle day of that time! But it was gone forever. Her presentiment at\nthe time had not deceived her\xe2\x80\x94that that state of freedom and readiness\nfor any enjoyment would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live\non.\n\nIt comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly\nimagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But\nthis was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat next?\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut there was nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet life was\npassing. Nat\xc3\xa1sha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to\nanyone, but wanted nothing for herself. She kept away from everyone in\nthe house and felt at ease only with her brother P\xc3\xa9tya. She liked to\nbe with him better than with the others, and when alone with him she\nsometimes laughed. She hardly ever left the house and of those who came\nto see them was glad to see only one person, Pierre. It would have been\nimpossible to treat her with more delicacy, greater care, and at the\nsame time more seriously than did Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov. Nat\xc3\xa1sha unconsciously\nfelt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society. But\nshe was not even grateful to him for it; nothing good on Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s part\nseemed to her to be an effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind\nto everyone that there was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nnoticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence,\nespecially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared that\nsomething they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her. She\nnoticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness,\nwhich she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her.\nAfter those involuntary words\xe2\x80\x94that if he were free he would have asked\non his knees for her hand and her love\xe2\x80\x94uttered at a moment when she was\nso strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Nat\xc3\xa1sha of his feelings;\nand it seemed plain to her that those words, which had then so comforted\nher, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort\na crying child. It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because\nNat\xc3\xa1sha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of\nwhich she had experienced with Kur\xc3\xa1gin that it never entered her head\nthat the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her\npart, still less on his, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious,\nromantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known\nseveral instances.\n\nBefore the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agraf\xc3\xa9na Iv\xc3\xa1novna Bel\xc3\xb3va, a\ncountry neighbor of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions at\nthe shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Nat\xc3\xa1sha should fast\nand prepare for Holy Communion, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha gladly welcomed the idea.\nDespite the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders that she should not go out early in the\nmorning, Nat\xc3\xa1sha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament,\nnot as they generally prepared for it in the Rost\xc3\xb3v family by attending\nthree services in their own house, but as Agraf\xc3\xa9na Iv\xc3\xa1novna did, by\ngoing to church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers,\nMatins, or Mass.\n\nThe countess was pleased with Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s zeal; after the poor results of\nthe medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer\nmight help her daughter more than medicines and, though not without\nfear and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s wish and\nentrusted her to Bel\xc3\xb3va. Agraf\xc3\xa9na Iv\xc3\xa1novna used to come to wake Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nat three in the morning, but generally found her already awake. She was\nafraid of being late for Matins. Hastily washing, and meekly putting on\nher shabbiest dress and an old mantilla, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, shivering in the fresh\nair, went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn.\nBy Agraf\xc3\xa9na Iv\xc3\xa1novna\xe2\x80\x99s advice Nat\xc3\xa1sha prepared herself not in their\nown parish, but at a church where, according to the devout Agraf\xc3\xa9na\nIv\xc3\xa1novna, the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were\nnever many people in the church; Nat\xc3\xa1sha always stood beside Bel\xc3\xb3va in\nthe customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the\nscreen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her, of\nhumility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her when\nat that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the Virgin\nilluminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light\nfalling from the window, she listened to the words of the service which\nshe tried to follow with understanding. When she understood them her\npersonal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its\nown. When she did not understand, it was sweeter still to think that\nthe wish to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to\nunderstand all, that it is only necessary to believe and to commit\noneself to God, whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments. She\ncrossed herself, bowed low, and when she did not understand, in horror\nat her own vileness, simply asked God to forgive her everything,\neverything, to have mercy upon her. The prayers to which she surrendered\nherself most of all were those of repentance. On her way home at an\nearly hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men\nsweeping the street, and everybody within the houses was still asleep,\nNat\xc3\xa1sha experienced a feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility\nof correcting her faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of\nhappiness.\n\nDuring the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every\nday. And the happiness of taking communion, or \xe2\x80\x9ccommuning\xe2\x80\x9d as Agraf\xc3\xa9na\nIv\xc3\xa1novna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nso great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.\n\nBut the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed in\nwhite muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for\nmany months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life\nthat lay before her.\n\nThe doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the\npowders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe, evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly, please be\nparticular about it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quite easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the gold\ncoin in his palm. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will soon be singing and frolicking about. The\nlast medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has freshened\nup very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at her\nnails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nAt the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the war\nbegan to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the Emperor to\nthe people, and of his coming himself from the army to Moscow. And as\nup to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received,\nexaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of\nRussia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was\nin danger, it was said that Smol\xc3\xa9nsk had surrendered, that Napoleon had\nan army of a million and only a miracle could save Russia.\n\nOn the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was received\nbut was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99, promised\nto come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto\nand appeal, which he would obtain from Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn.\n\nThat Sunday, the Rost\xc3\xb3vs went to Mass at the Razum\xc3\xb3vskis\xe2\x80\x99 private chapel\nas usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\ngot out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of\nhawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves\nof the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white\ntrousers of a battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on\nthe cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that\nsummer languor, that content and discontent with the present, which\nis most strongly felt on a bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow\nnotabilities, all the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 acquaintances, were at the Razum\xc3\xb3vskis\xe2\x80\x99\nchapel, for, as if expecting something to happen, many wealthy families\nwho usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that\nsummer. As Nat\xc3\xa1sha, at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side, passed through the crowd\nbehind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them, she heard a\nyoung man speaking about her in too loud a whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Rost\xc3\xb3va, the one who...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s much thinner, but all the same she\xe2\x80\x99s pretty!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kur\xc3\xa1gin and Bolk\xc3\xb3nski. But\nshe was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that everyone\nwho looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her. With a\nsinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself\nin a crowd, Nat\xc3\xa1sha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace\nwalked\xe2\x80\x94as women can walk\xe2\x80\x94with the more repose and stateliness the\ngreater the pain and shame in her soul. She knew for certain that she\nwas pretty, but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to.\nOn the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late, and\nparticularly so on this bright, hot summer day in town. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday\nagain\xe2\x80\x94another week past,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, recalling that she had been here\nthe Sunday before, \xe2\x80\x9cand always the same life that is no life, and the\nsame surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty,\nI\xe2\x80\x99m young, and I know that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I\nknow I am good,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9cbut yet my best years are slipping by\nand are no good to anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d She stood by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side and exchanged\nnods with acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladies\xe2\x80\x99\ndresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not\ncrossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she thought\nwith vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others,\nand suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt horrified at her own\nvileness, horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to\nher.\n\nA comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that\nmild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the\nsouls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were closed,\nthe curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft mysterious voice\npronounced some words. Tears, the cause of which she herself did not\nunderstand, made Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s breast heave, and a joyous but oppressive\nfeeling agitated her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good\nforever, forever!\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded.\n\nThe deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and,\nholding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his dalmatic\nand, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a loud and\nsolemn voice to recite the words of the prayer....\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn peace let us pray unto the Lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs one community, without distinction of class, without enmity, united\nby brotherly love\xe2\x80\x94let us pray!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our souls.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,\xe2\x80\x9d prayed\nNat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nWhen they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and\nDen\xc3\xadsov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she\nremembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her\nall the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love us,\nshe prayed for the members of her own family, her father and mother and\nS\xc3\xb3nya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward\nthem, and feeling all the strength of her love for them. When they\nprayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of her enemies and\npeople who hated her, in order to pray for them. She included among her\nenemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her\nfather, and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she\nremembered Anatole who had done her so much harm\xe2\x80\x94and though he did not\nhate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy. Only at prayer did\nshe feel able to think clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole,\nas men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and\ndevotion to God. When they prayed for the Imperial family and the Synod,\nshe bowed very low and made the sign of the cross, saying to herself\nthat even if she did not understand, still she could not doubt, and at\nany rate loved the governing Synod and prayed for it.\n\nWhen he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over his\nbreast and said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us commit ourselves and our whole lives to Christ\nthe Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommit ourselves to God,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha inwardly repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cLord God, I\nsubmit myself to Thy will!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI want nothing, wish for\nnothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d prayed Nat\xc3\xa1sha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing\nherself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some\ninvisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself,\nfrom her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.\n\nThe countess looked round several times at her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s softened face\nand shining eyes and prayed God to help her.\n\nUnexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order\nNat\xc3\xa1sha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he\nknelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it before the doors\nof the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his purple velvet\nbiretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down with an effort.\nEverybody followed his example and they looked at one another in\nsurprise. Then came the prayer just received from the Synod\xe2\x80\x94a prayer for\nthe deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord God of might, God of our salvation!\xe2\x80\x9d began the priest in that\nvoice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the Slav clergy\nread and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and\nblessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and\nhave mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay\nwaste the whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are gathered\ntogether to overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem, Thy\nbeloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to overthrow Thine altars, and to\ndesecrate our holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how long shall the wicked\ntriumph? How long shall they wield unlawful power?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might\nour most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander P\xc3\xa1vlovich; be\nmindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to his\nrighteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless his\ncounsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom by\nThine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as Thou\ngavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and David over\nGoliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands of those who\nhave armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins with strength\nfor the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us;\nconfound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us, may\nthey be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the\nwind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight; may\nthey be ensnared when they know it not, and may the plots they have laid\nin secret be turned against them; let them fall before Thy servants\xe2\x80\x99\nfeet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art able to save both\ngreat and small; Thou art God, and man cannot prevail against Thee!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and loving-kindness\nwhich are from of old; turn not Thy face from us, but be gracious to our\nunworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy many mercies regard not\nour transgressions and iniquities! Create in us a clean heart and renew\na right spirit within us, strengthen us all in Thy faith, fortify our\nhope, inspire us with true love one for another, arm us with unity of\nspirit in the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and\nto our fathers, and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against\nthe destiny of those Thou hast sanctified.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust, let us\nnot be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token of Thy\nblessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and\nbe put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that Thou art\nthe Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this day, O Lord,\nand grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice\nin Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath\nthe feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art the defense, the succor,\nand the victory of them that put their trust in Thee, and to Thee be all\nglory, to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and forever, world without\nend. Amen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her\nstrongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over\nAmalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about\nthe destruction of \xe2\x80\x9cThy Jerusalem,\xe2\x80\x9d and she prayed to God with the\ntenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but without\nfully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer. She\nshared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness,\nfor the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope, and its animation\nby love. But she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under\nfoot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more\nof them that she might pray for them. But neither could she doubt the\nrighteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees. She\nfelt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the\npunishment that overtakes men for their sins, and especially of her own\nsins, and she prayed to God to forgive them all, and her too, and to\ngive them all, and her too, peace and happiness. And it seemed to her\nthat God heard her prayer.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nFrom the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 with Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\ngrateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to\nbe fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own\nhorizon\xe2\x80\x94from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all\nearthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no longer presented\nitself. That terrible question \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWherefore?\xe2\x80\x9d which had come to him\namid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a\nreply to the former question, but by her image. When he listened to, or\nhimself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of\nhuman baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did\nnot ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so\ntransient and incomprehensible\xe2\x80\x94but he remembered her as he had last\nseen her, and all his doubts vanished\xe2\x80\x94not because she had answered\nthe questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of her\ntransferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual\nactivity in which no one could be justified or guilty\xe2\x80\x94a realm of beauty\nand love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness\npresented itself to him, he said to himself:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, supposing N. N. has swindled the country and the Tsar, and the\ncountry and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter? She\nsmiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her, and\nno one will ever know it.\xe2\x80\x9d And his soul felt calm and peaceful.\n\nPierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same idle\nand dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99\nthere were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the habits and\nacquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that bore him along\nirresistibly. But latterly, when more and more disquieting reports came\nfrom the seat of war and Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s health began to improve and she\nno longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity, an\never-increasing restlessness, which he could not explain, took\npossession of him. He felt that the condition he was in could not\ncontinue long, that a catastrophe was coming which would change his\nwhole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that\napproaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons had revealed to\nPierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon, drawn from the\nRevelation of St. John.\n\nIn chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:\n\nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of\nthe beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred\nthreescore and six.\n\nAnd in the fifth verse of the same chapter:\n\nAnd there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and\nblasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two\nmonths.\n\n\nThe French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as the\nHebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the others\ntens, will have the following significance:\n\n      a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k\n      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10\n       l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s\n      20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90\n             t    u    v    w    x    y\n            100  110  120  130  140  150\n                        z\n                       160\n\nWriting the words L\xe2\x80\x99Empereur Napol\xc3\xa9on in numbers, it appears that the\nsum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold\nin the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words\nquarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that \xe2\x80\x9cspoke\ngreat things and blasphemies,\xe2\x80\x9d the same number 666 was obtained; from\nwhich it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s power had come\nin the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy\npleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an\nend to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the\nsame system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an\nanswer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words L\xe2\x80\x99Empereur\nAlexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums\nwere either more or less than 666. Once when making such calculations he\nwrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the\nsum of the numbers did not come right. Then he changed the spelling,\nsubstituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le, still\nwithout obtaining the desired result. Then it occurred to him: if the\nanswer to the question were contained in his name, his nationality would\nalso be given in the answer. So he wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding\nup the numbers got 671. This was only five too much, and five was\nrepresented by e, the very letter elided from the article le before the\nword Empereur. By omitting the e, though incorrectly, Pierre got the\nanswer he sought. L\xe2\x80\x99russe Besuhof made 666. This discovery excited him.\nHow, or by what means, he was connected with the great event foretold in\nthe Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt that connection for\na moment. His love for Nat\xc3\xa1sha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the\ncomet, 666, L\xe2\x80\x99Empereur Napol\xc3\xa9on, and L\xe2\x80\x99russe Besuhof\xe2\x80\x94all this had to\nmature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere\nof Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a\ngreat achievement and great happiness.\n\n    * Forty-two.\n\n\nOn the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre had\npromised the Rost\xc3\xb3vs to bring them, from Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn whom he knew\nwell, both the appeal to the people and the news from the army. In the\nmorning, when he went to call at Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s he met there a courier\nfresh from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who often danced at\nMoscow balls.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo, please, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, relieve me of something!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncourier. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a sackful of letters to parents.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAmong these letters was one from Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v to his father. Pierre\ntook that letter, and Rostopch\xc3\xadn also gave him the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to\nMoscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, and his own\nmost recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, Pierre found in\none of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and rewarded, the name of\nNicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v, awarded a St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Cross of the Fourth Class for\ncourage shown in the Ostr\xc3\xb3vna affair, and in the same order the name\nof Prince Andrew Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, appointed to the command of a regiment of\nChasseurs. Though he did not want to remind the Rost\xc3\xb3vs of Bolk\xc3\xb3nski,\nPierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their\nson\xe2\x80\x99s having received a decoration, so he sent that printed army order\nand Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 letter to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs, keeping the appeal, the bulletin,\nand the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner.\n\nHis conversation with Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn and the latter\xe2\x80\x99s tone of anxious\nhurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly\nthings were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in\nMoscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised\nto be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s being expected to arrive next day\xe2\x80\x94all aroused with fresh force\nthat feeling of agitation and expectation in Pierre which he had been\nconscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and especially\nsince the beginning of the war.\n\nHe had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so\nhad he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society of\nFreemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual\npeace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact that when he\nsaw the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking\npatriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step. But the chief\nreason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the\nvague idea that he was L\xe2\x80\x99russe Besuhof who had the number of the beast,\n666; that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the\npower of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been\npredestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought not to undertake\nanything, but wait for what was bound to come to pass.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nA few intimate friends were dining with the Rost\xc3\xb3vs that day, as usual\non Sundays.\n\nPierre came early so as to find them alone.\n\nHe had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he\nnot been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried his\nbulk with evident ease.\n\nHe went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman did\nnot even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his master was\nat the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 he stayed till midnight. The Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 footman rushed\neagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and\nstick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and stick in the\nanteroom.\n\nThe first person he saw in the house was Nat\xc3\xa1sha. Even before he saw\nher, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing solfa\nexercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since her\nillness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him. He\nopened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had worn at\nchurch, walking about the room singing. She had her back to him when he\nopened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised\nface, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to try to sing again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding as if by way of excuse,\n\xe2\x80\x9cit is, at least, something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s capital!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow glad I am you\xe2\x80\x99ve come! I am so happy today,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with the old\nanimation Pierre had not seen in her for a long time. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know Nicholas\nhas received a St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Cross? I am so proud of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to interrupt you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added, and was about to go to the drawing room.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha stopped him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount, is it wrong of me to sing?\xe2\x80\x9d she said blushing, and fixing her\neyes inquiringly on him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha answered quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should not like\nto do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely. You\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how important you are to me, how much you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for me....\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nsaw in that same army order that he, Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x9d (she whispered the name\nhastily), \xe2\x80\x9cis in Russia, and in the army again. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she\nwas speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might fail\nher\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWill he ever forgive me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling\ntoward me? What do you think? What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think...\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has nothing to forgive.... If I\nwere in his place...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBy association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the day\nwhen, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself but\nthe best man in the world and free, he would ask on his knees for her\nhand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took possession\nof him and the same words rose to his lips. But she did not give him\ntime to say them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you... you...\xe2\x80\x9d she said, uttering the word you rapturously\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s\na different thing. I know no one kinder, more generous, or better than\nyou; nobody could be! Had you not been there then, and now too, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow what would have become of me, because...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music\nbefore her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and\ndown the room.\n\nJust then P\xc3\xa9tya came running in from the drawing room.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and\nresembled Nat\xc3\xa1sha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and\nhis friend Obol\xc3\xa9nski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair.\nHe had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the\nhussars.\n\nPierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what P\xc3\xa9tya\nwas saying.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what about my plan? Peter Kir\xc3\xadlych, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake! You are my\nonly hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it\nall up today.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the old count. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\ncountess has been to Mass at the Razum\xc3\xb3vskis\xe2\x80\x99 and heard the new prayer.\nShe says it\xe2\x80\x99s very fine.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor is to be here tomorrow...\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are\ntalking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are again retreating. They say we\xe2\x80\x99re already near Smol\xc3\xa9nsk,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, O Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the count. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the manifesto?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s appeal? Oh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find\nthem. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess\nwho entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently expecting\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing\nroom.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done with it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is, always losing everything!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the countess.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and\nsat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nfeatures, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and while still\nsearching for the papers he glanced at her several times.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, really! I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive home, I must have left them there. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\ncertainly...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll be late for dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! And my coachman has gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut S\xc3\xb3nya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom, had\nfound them in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s hat, where he had carefully tucked them under the\nlining. Pierre was about to begin reading.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, after dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old count, evidently expecting much\nenjoyment from that reading.\n\nAt dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new\nchevalier of St. George, Shinsh\xc3\xadn told them the town news, of the\nillness of the old Georgian princess, of M\xc3\xa9tivier\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance from\nMoscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nand accused of being a French \xe2\x80\x9cspyer\xe2\x80\x9d (so Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn had told the\nstory), and how Rostopch\xc3\xadn let him go and assured the people that he was\n\xe2\x80\x9cnot a spire at all, but only an old German ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are being arrested...\xe2\x80\x9d said the count. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told the countess\nshe should not speak French so much. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the time for it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you heard?\xe2\x80\x9d Shinsh\xc3\xadn asked. \xe2\x80\x9cPrince Gol\xc3\xadtsyn has engaged a\nmaster to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak French in\nthe streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how about you, Count Peter Kir\xc3\xadlych? If they call up the militia,\nyou too will have to mount a horse,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the old count, addressing\nPierre.\n\nPierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not\nto grasp what was said. He looked at the count.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, the war,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo! What sort of warrior should I make? And\nyet everything is so strange, so strange! I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it out. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nknow, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no\none can answer for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and\nwith a serious face asked S\xc3\xb3nya, who was considered an excellent reader,\nto read the appeal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Moscow, our ancient Capital!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He\ncomes to despoil our beloved country.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count listened\nwith closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father and\nnow at Pierre.\n\nPierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The countess\nshook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression\nin the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that the danger\nthreatening her son would not soon be over. Shinsh\xc3\xadn, with a sarcastic\nsmile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that\ngave him the opportunity: S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s reading, any remark of the count\xe2\x80\x99s, or\neven the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself.\n\nAfter reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes the\nEmperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility,\nS\xc3\xb3nya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was\nbeing paid to her, read the last words:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that Capital\nand in other parts of our realm for consultation, and for the direction\nof all our levies, both those now barring the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s path and those\nfreshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the ruin he\nhopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered\nfrom bondage glorify the name of Russia!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing\nrepeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cLet the Emperor but say the word and we\xe2\x80\x99ll sacrifice everything\nand begrudge nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBefore Shinsh\xc3\xadn had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the\ncount\xe2\x80\x99s patriotism, Nat\xc3\xa1sha jumped up from her place and ran to her\nfather.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a darling our Papa is!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, kissing him, and she again\nlooked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her\nwith her better spirits.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a patriot for you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Shinsh\xc3\xadn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a patriot at all, but simply...\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha replied in an injured\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything seems funny to you, but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t at all a joke....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA joke indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d put in the count. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him but say the word and we\xe2\x80\x99ll\nall go.... We\xe2\x80\x99re not Germans!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut did you notice, it says, \xe2\x80\x98for consultation\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what it\xe2\x80\x99s for....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt this moment, P\xc3\xa9tya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came up\nto his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice\nthat was now deep and now shrill:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it\xe2\x80\x99s as you please,\nbut I say definitely that you must let me enter the army, because I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t... that\xe2\x80\x99s all....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and\nturned angrily to her husband.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat comes of your talking!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\nBut the count had already recovered from his excitement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You must\nstudy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not nonsense, Papa. F\xc3\xa9dya Obol\xc3\xa9nski is younger than I, and he\xe2\x80\x99s\ngoing too. Besides, all the same I can\xe2\x80\x99t study now when...\xe2\x80\x9d P\xc3\xa9tya\nstopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words,\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen our Fatherland is in danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do, that\xe2\x80\x99ll do\xe2\x80\x94nonsense....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cP\xc3\xa9tya! Be quiet, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the count, with a glance at his\nwife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I tell you\xe2\x80\x94Peter Kir\xc3\xadlych here will also tell you...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, I tell you. Your mother\xe2\x80\x99s milk has hardly dried on your lips\nand you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d and the\ncount moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably to reread\nthem in his study before having a nap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Peter Kir\xc3\xadlych, let\xe2\x80\x99s go and have a smoke,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nPierre was agitated and undecided. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s unwontedly brilliant eyes,\ncontinually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had reduced\nhim to this condition.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You don\xe2\x80\x99t\noften come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count\ngood-naturedly, pointing to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9conly brightens up when you\xe2\x80\x99re\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPierre hurriedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, au revoir!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, and went out of the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you going? Why are you upset?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and she looked\nchallengingly into Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I love you!\xe2\x80\x9d was what he wanted to say, but he did not say it,\nand only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it is better for me to come less often... because... No, simply\nI have business....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? No, tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.\n\nThey looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He tried\nto smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently\nkissed her hand and went out.\n\nPierre made up his mind not to go to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 any more.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nAfter the definite refusal he had received, P\xc3\xa9tya went to his room\nand there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea,\nsilent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to\nnotice anything.\n\nNext day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99\ndomestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That\nmorning P\xc3\xa9tya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and\ncollar to look like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass,\ngesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word\nto anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to\navoid notice. P\xc3\xa9tya decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and\nto explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor\nto be always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nin spite of his youth wished to serve his country; that youth could be\nno hindrance to loyalty, and that he was ready to... While\ndressing, P\xc3\xa9tya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the\ngentleman-in-waiting.\n\nIt was on the very fact of being so young that P\xc3\xa9tya counted for success\nin reaching the Emperor\xe2\x80\x94he even thought how surprised everyone would be\nat his youthfulness\xe2\x80\x94and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair\nand by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man.\nBut the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the\never-increasing crowds moving toward the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin, the less he remembered\nto walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man. As he approached\nthe Kr\xc3\xa9mlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck\nout his elbows in a menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he\nwas so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the\npatriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his\ndetermination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in,\nrumbling beneath the archway. Beside P\xc3\xa9tya stood a peasant woman, a\nfootman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing some\ntime in the gateway, P\xc3\xa9tya tried to move forward in front of the others\nwithout waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began resolutely\nworking his way with his elbows, but the woman just in front of him, who\nwas the first against whom he directed his efforts, angrily shouted at\nhim:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you shoving for, young lordling? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see we\xe2\x80\x99re all\nstanding still? Then why push?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody can shove,\xe2\x80\x9d said the footman, and also began working his elbows\nto such effect that he pushed P\xc3\xa9tya into a very filthy corner of the\ngateway.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp\ncollar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a man\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nHe felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if he were\nnow to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be\nadmitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten oneself up\nor move to another place, because of the crowd. One of the generals who\ndrove past was an acquaintance of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99, and P\xc3\xa9tya thought of\nasking his help, but came to the conclusion that that would not be a\nmanly thing to do. When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd,\ncarrying P\xc3\xa9tya with it, streamed forward into the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin Square which\nwas already full of people. There were people not only in the square,\nbut everywhere\xe2\x80\x94on the slopes and on the roofs. As soon as P\xc3\xa9tya found\nhimself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous\nvoices of the crowd that filled the whole Kr\xc3\xa9mlin.\n\nFor a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared,\nand everyone rushed forward in one direction. P\xc3\xa9tya was being pressed so\nthat he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah!\nhurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d P\xc3\xa9tya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see\nnothing except the people about him.\n\nAll the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. A\ntradesman\xe2\x80\x99s wife standing beside P\xc3\xa9tya sobbed, and the tears ran down\nher cheeks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather! Angel! Dear one!\xe2\x80\x9d she kept repeating, wiping away her tears\nwith her fingers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d was heard on all sides.\n\nFor a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush\nforward.\n\nQuite beside himself, P\xc3\xa9tya, clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes\nferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting \xe2\x80\x9churrah!\xe2\x80\x9d as\nif he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else, but\non both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed\nforward and everybody shouted \xe2\x80\x9churrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is what the Emperor is!\xe2\x80\x9d thought P\xc3\xa9tya. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t petition\nhim myself\xe2\x80\x94that would be too bold.\xe2\x80\x9d But in spite of this he continued\nto struggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those\nin front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth\nspread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed back\xe2\x80\x94the police\nin front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the\nprocession: the Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of\nthe Assumption\xe2\x80\x94and P\xc3\xa9tya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side\nand ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim\nbefore his eyes and he lost consciousness. When he came to himself, a\nman of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of\nhis head and wearing a shabby blue cassock\xe2\x80\x94probably a church clerk and\nchanter\xe2\x80\x94was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off\nthe pressure of the crowd with the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve crushed the young gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you up\nto? Gently!... They\xe2\x80\x99ve crushed him, crushed him!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd spread\nout again more evenly, and the clerk led P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x94pale and breathless\xe2\x80\x94to\nthe Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for P\xc3\xa9tya, and suddenly a\ncrowd turned toward him and pressed round him. Those who stood nearest\nhim attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised\nplatform of the cannon, and reproached those others (whoever they might\nbe) who had crushed him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing\npeople! Poor dear, he\xe2\x80\x99s as white as a sheet!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94various voices were heard\nsaying.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain had\npassed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained\na place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who\nwould be returning that way. P\xc3\xa9tya no longer thought of presenting his\npetition. If he could only see the Emperor he would be happy!\n\nWhile the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumption\xe2\x80\x94it\nwas a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\narrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the\nTurks\xe2\x80\x94the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling kvass,\ngingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which P\xc3\xa9tya was particularly\nfond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard. A tradesman\xe2\x80\x99s\nwife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had\ncost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear. The clerk\nwho had rescued P\xc3\xa9tya was talking to a functionary about the priests who\nwere officiating that day with the bishop. The clerk several times used\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9cplenary\xe2\x80\x9d (of the service), a word P\xc3\xa9tya did not understand.\nTwo young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking\nnuts. All these conversations, especially the joking with the girls,\nwere such as might have had a particular charm for P\xc3\xa9tya at his age, but\nthey did not interest him now. He sat on his elevation\xe2\x80\x94the pedestal of\nthe cannon\xe2\x80\x94still agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and by\nhis love for him. The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when\nhe was being crushed, together with that of rapture, still further\nintensified his sense of the importance of the occasion.\n\nSuddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment,\nto celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and the crowd rushed\nimpetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing. P\xc3\xa9tya too would\nhave run there, but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under\nhis protection stopped him. The firing was still proceeding when\nofficers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the\ncathedral, and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were\nagain raised, and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back\nagain. At last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the\ncathedral doors. \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the crowd again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is he? Which?\xe2\x80\x9d asked P\xc3\xa9tya in a tearful voice, of those around\nhim, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and P\xc3\xa9tya,\nfixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the\ntears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm\non him\xe2\x80\x94though it happened not to be the Emperor\xe2\x80\x94frantically shouted\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d and resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join the\narmy.\n\nThe crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and began\nto disperse. It was already late, and P\xc3\xa9tya had not eaten anything and\nwas drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home but stood with\nthat diminishing, but still considerable, crowd before the palace while\nthe Emperor dined\xe2\x80\x94looking in at the palace windows, expecting he knew\nnot what, and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance\nto dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table,\nglimpses of whom could be seen through the windows.\n\nWhile the Emperor was dining, Val\xc3\xbaev, looking out of the window, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit, rose\nand went out onto the balcony. The people, with P\xc3\xa9tya among them, rushed\ntoward the balcony.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...\xe2\x80\x9d cried the crowd, and P\xc3\xa9tya with\nit, and again the women and men of weaker mold, P\xc3\xa9tya among them, wept\nwith joy.\n\nA largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand broke\noff, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A coachman in\na jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched it up. Several\npeople in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this the Emperor had\na plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from\nthe balcony. P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s eyes grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the\ndanger of being crushed, he rushed at the biscuits. He did not know why,\nbut he had to have a biscuit from the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s hand and he felt that he\nmust not give way. He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was\ncatching at a biscuit; the old woman did not consider herself defeated\nthough she was lying on the ground\xe2\x80\x94she grabbed at some biscuits but\nher hand did not reach them. P\xc3\xa9tya pushed her hand away with his knee,\nseized a biscuit, and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d with a voice already hoarse.\n\nThe Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began\nto disperse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! I said if only we waited\xe2\x80\x94and so it was!\xe2\x80\x9d was being joyfully said\nby various people.\n\nHappy as P\xc3\xa9tya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all\nthe enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home from\nthe Kr\xc3\xa9mlin, but called on his friend Obol\xc3\xa9nski, who was fifteen and was\nalso entering the regiment. On returning home P\xc3\xa9tya announced resolutely\nand firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would\nrun away. And next day, Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x94though he had not yet quite\nyielded\xe2\x80\x94went to inquire how he could arrange for P\xc3\xa9tya to serve where\nthere would be least danger.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTwo days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of carriages\nwere standing outside the Slob\xc3\xb3da Palace.\n\nThe great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry in\ntheir uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats\nof blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemen\xe2\x80\x99s hall there was\nan incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat on\nhigh-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor,\nbut most of the gentry were strolling about the room.\n\nAll these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own\nhouses, were in uniform\xe2\x80\x94some in that of Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s day, others in that\nof Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s time or\nthe ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the general characteristic\nof being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these\ndiverse and familiar personalities, both old and young. The old men,\ndim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled,\nwere especially striking. For the most part they sat quietly in their\nplaces and were silent, or, if they walked about and talked, attached\nthemselves to someone younger. On all these faces, as on the faces\nof the crowd P\xc3\xa9tya had seen in the Square, there was a striking\ncontradiction: the general expectation of a solemn event, and at the\nsame time the everyday interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook,\nZina\xc3\xadda Dm\xc3\xadtrievna\xe2\x80\x99s health, and so on.\n\nPierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s\nuniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated;\nthis extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the\nmerchant-class\xe2\x80\x94les \xc3\xa9tats g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9raux (States-General)\xe2\x80\x94evoked in him a whole\nseries of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in\nhis soul: thoughts of the Contrat Social and the French Revolution. The\nwords that had struck him in the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s appeal\xe2\x80\x94that the sovereign was\ncoming to the capital for consultation with his people\xe2\x80\x94strengthened this\nidea. And imagining that in this direction something important which\nhe had long awaited was drawing near, he strolled about watching and\nlistening to conversations, but nowhere finding any confirmation of the\nideas that occupied him.\n\nThe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all moved\nabout discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of conversation, Pierre\nheard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when\nthe Emperor entered, when a ball should be given in the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nhonor, whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole\nprovinces... and so on; but as soon as the war was touched on, or\nwhat the nobility had been convened for, the talk became undecided and\nindefinite. Then all preferred listening to speaking.\n\nA middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a retired\nnaval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small crowd was\npressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round\nthe speaker and listened. Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v, in a military uniform of\nCatherine\xe2\x80\x99s time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd,\nwith all of whom he was acquainted. He too approached that group and\nlistened with a kindly smile and nods of approval, as he always did,\nto what the speaker was saying. The retired naval man was speaking very\nboldly, as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners\nand from the fact that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and\nquietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement\nwith him. Pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group, listened,\nand convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal, but of views\nquite different from his own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly\nsonorous, musical, and aristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly\nswallowing his r\xe2\x80\x99s and generally slurring his consonants: the voice of\na man calling out to his servant, \xe2\x80\x9cHeah! Bwing me my pipe!\xe2\x80\x9d It was\nindicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk people have offahd to waise militia for the\nEmpewah? Ah we to take Smol\xc3\xa9nsk as our patte\xe2\x80\x99n? If the noble awistocwacy\nof the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its loyalty to our\nsov\xe2\x80\x99weign the Empewah in other ways. Have we fo\xe2\x80\x99gotten the waising of\nthe militia in the yeah \xe2\x80\x98seven? All that did was to enwich the pwiests\xe2\x80\x99\nsons and thieves and wobbahs....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCount Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v smiled blandly and nodded approval.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only wuined\nour farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... o\xe2\x80\x99 ou\xe2\x80\x99 men will wetu\xe2\x80\x99n\nneithah soldiers no\xe2\x80\x99 peasants, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get only depwavity fwom them.\nThe nobility don\xe2\x80\x99t gwudge theah lives\xe2\x80\x94evewy one of us will go and bwing\nin more wecwuits, and the sov\xe2\x80\x99weign\xe2\x80\x9d (that was the way he referred to\nthe Emperor) \xe2\x80\x9cneed only say the word and we\xe2\x80\x99ll all die fo\xe2\x80\x99 him!\xe2\x80\x9d added\nthe orator with animation.\n\nCount Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but\nPierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred,\nbut not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he\nopened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his\nhead, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the first\nspeaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing debates and\nto maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI imagine, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we\nhave been summoned here not to discuss whether it\xe2\x80\x99s best for the empire\nat the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia.\nWe have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign\nthe Emperor has honored us. But to judge what is best\xe2\x80\x94conscription or\nthe militia\xe2\x80\x94we can leave to the supreme authority....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his heart\nagainst the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude\ninto the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped forward and\ninterrupted him. He himself did not yet know what he would say, but he\nbegan to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French or expressing\nhimself in bookish Russian.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. (He was well acquainted with\nthe senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him\nformally.) \xe2\x80\x9cThough I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the gentleman...\xe2\x80\x9d (he hesitated:\nhe wished to say, \xe2\x80\x9cMon tr\xc3\xa8s honorable pr\xc3\xa9opinant\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy very honorable\nopponent\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cwith the gentleman... whom I have not the honor of knowing,\nI suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express\ntheir sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which\nwe can assist our Fatherland! I imagine,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, warming to his\nsubject, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us\nmerely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service, and\nchair \xc3\xa0 canon * we are ready to make of ourselves\xe2\x80\x94and not to obtain from\nus any co-co-counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cFood for cannon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nMany persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator\xe2\x80\x99s sarcastic\nsmile and the freedom of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s remarks. Only Count Rost\xc3\xb3v was pleased\nwith them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer, the\nsenator, and in general with whatever speech he had last heard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that before discussing these questions,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre continued, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\nshould ask the Emperor\xe2\x80\x94most respectfully ask His Majesty\xe2\x80\x94to let us know\nthe number of our troops and the position in which our army and our\nforces now are, and then...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from\nthree sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance,\na boston player who had always been well disposed toward him, Step\xc3\xa1n\nStep\xc3\xa1novich Adr\xc3\xa1ksin. Adr\xc3\xa1ksin was in uniform, and whether as a result\nof the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a\ndifferent man. With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face,\nAdr\xc3\xa1ksin shouted at Pierre:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor\nabout that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, the\nEmperor could not answer such a question. The troops are moved\naccording to the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s movements and the number of men increases and\ndecreases....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years\nof age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies\xe2\x80\x99 and knew as a bad\ncardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre,\ninterrupted Adr\xc3\xa1ksin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and this is not a time for discussing,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\nacting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy\nRussia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our wives\nand children.\xe2\x80\x9d The nobleman smote his breast. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will all arise,\neveryone of us will go, for our father the Tsar!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, rolling\nhis bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were heard in the crowd.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are Russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith,\nthe throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are sons of\nour Fatherland! We will show Europe how Russia rises to the defense of\nRussia!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that his\nwords, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible than the\nsound of his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\n\nCount Rost\xc3\xb3v at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several\npersons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a\nphrase, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, quite right! Just so!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his\nserfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in\norder to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many voices\nshouted and talked at the same time, so that Count Rost\xc3\xb3v had not time\nto signify his approval of them all, and the group increased, dispersed,\nre-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and\nto the big table. Not only was Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to speak unsuccessful,\nbut he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned away\nfrom him as from a common enemy. This happened not because they were\ndispleased by the substance of his speech, which had even been forgotten\nafter the many subsequent speeches, but to animate it the crowd needed a\ntangible object to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre became the\nlatter. Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in\nthe same tone. Many spoke eloquently and with originality.\n\nGl\xc3\xadnka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized (cries\nof \xe2\x80\x9cauthor! author!\xe2\x80\x9d were heard in the crowd), said that \xe2\x80\x9chell must be\nrepulsed by hell,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning\nflashes and thunderclaps, but \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not be that child.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, at thunderclaps!\xe2\x80\x9d was repeated approvingly in the back rows\nof the crowd.\n\nThe crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald\nseventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed, almost all of whom\nPierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing\nboston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced\nto the table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of the\nchairs, the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together.\nThose standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened\nto supply it. Others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find\nsome thought and hastened to utter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre\nknew, sat and turned to look first at one and then at another, and their\nfaces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very\nhot. Pierre, however, felt excited, and the general desire to show that\nthey were ready to go to all lengths\xe2\x80\x94which found expression in the tones\nand looks more than in the substance of the speeches\xe2\x80\x94infected him too.\nHe did not renounce his opinions, but felt himself in some way to blame\nand wished to justify himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices\nwhen we know what is needed!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, trying to be heard above the\nother voices.\n\nOne of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention was\nimmediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\none man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is the enemy of mankind!\xe2\x80\x9d cried another. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to speak....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, you are crushing me!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nAt that moment Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn with his protruding chin and alert eyes,\nwearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered\nthe room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rostopch\xc3\xadn.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are in, I think\nthere is little need for discussion. The Emperor has deigned to summon\nus and the merchants. Millions will pour forth from there\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he pointed\nto the merchants\xe2\x80\x99 hall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut our business is to supply men and not spare\nourselves.... That is the least we can do!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table.\nThe whole consultation passed more than quietly. After all the preceding\nnoise the sound of their old voices saying one after another, \xe2\x80\x9cI\nagree,\xe2\x80\x9d or for variety, \xe2\x80\x9cI too am of that opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d and so on had even a\nmournful effect.\n\nThe secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow\nnobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully equipped,\nout of every thousand serfs, as the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk gentry had done. Their\nchairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose\nwith apparent relief, and began walking up and down, arm in arm, to\nstretch their legs and converse in couples.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor! The Emperor!\xe2\x80\x9d a sudden cry resounded through the halls and\nthe whole throng hurried to the entrance.\n\nThe Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of\nnobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity. Pierre\nstood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said. From\nwhat he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger\nthreatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow\nnobility. He was answered by a voice which informed him of the\nresolution just arrived at.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor with a quivering voice.\n\nThere was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that\nPierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying\nwith emotion:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it has\nsurpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the Fatherland!\nGentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and\nrapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, most precious... a royal word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Count Rost\xc3\xb3v, with a sob. He\nstood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything, understood\neverything in his own way.\n\nFrom the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants.\nThere he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those who saw him\ncome out from the merchants\xe2\x80\x99 hall with tears of emotion in his eyes.\nAs became known later, he had scarcely begun to address the merchants\nbefore tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling\nvoice. When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two\nmerchants, one of whom Pierre knew, a fat otkupshch\xc3\xadk. The other was\nthe mayor, a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard. Both were\nweeping. Tears filled the thin man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and the fat otkupshch\xc3\xadk\nsobbed outright like a child and kept repeating:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur lives and property\xe2\x80\x94take them, Your Majesty!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was\nready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. He now\nfelt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought\nan opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count Mam\xc3\xb3nov was\nfurnishing a regiment, Bez\xc3\xbakhov at once informed Rostopch\xc3\xadn that he\nwould give a thousand men and their maintenance.\n\nOld Rost\xc3\xb3v could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and\nat once consented to P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s request and went himself to enter his name.\n\nNext day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all took off\ntheir uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs, and not\nwithout some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment,\nfeeling amazed themselves at what they had done.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TEN: 1812\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nNapoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going\nto Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he\nreceived, could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the\nstimulating influence of a June morning, and could not refrain from\nbursts of anger in the presence of Kur\xc3\xa1kin and then of Balash\xc3\xabv.\n\nAlexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally\ninsulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best\nway, because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great\ncommander. Rost\xc3\xb3v charged the French because he could not restrain\nhis wish for a gallop across a level field; and in the same way the\ninnumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their\npersonal characteristics, habits, circumstances, and aims. They were\nmoved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, imagining\nthat they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will,\nbut they all were involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work\nconcealed from them but comprehensible to us. Such is the inevitable\nfate of men of action, and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy\nthe less are they free.\n\nThe actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal\ninterests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that\ntime but its historic results.\n\nProvidence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to\nfurther the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all\nexpected\xe2\x80\x94neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still less any of those\nwho did the actual fighting.\n\nThe cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us\nnow. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance\ninto the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for\na winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war\nby the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused\namong the Russian people. But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems\nso evident) that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand\nmen\xe2\x80\x94the best in the world and led by the best general\xe2\x80\x94could be destroyed\nin conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength, and led by\ninexperienced commanders as the Russian army was. Not only did no one\nsee this, but on the Russian side every effort was made to hinder the\nonly thing that could save Russia, while on the French side, despite\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s experience and so-called military genius, every effort was\ndirected to pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to\ndoing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction.\n\nIn historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of\nsaying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he\nsought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk,\nand of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign\nwas even then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of telling\nus that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was\nadopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some\nof them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to\nToll, and others again to Alexander himself\xe2\x80\x94pointing to notes, projects,\nand letters which contain hints of such a line of action. But all these\nhints at what happened, both from the French side and the Russian, are\nadvanced only because they fit in with the event. Had that event not\noccurred these hints would have been forgotten, as we have forgotten the\nthousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary\nwhich were current then but have now been forgotten because the event\nfalsified them. There are always so many conjectures as to the issue of\nany event that however it may end there will always be people to say:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said then that it would be so,\xe2\x80\x9d quite forgetting that amid their\ninnumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect.\n\nConjectures as to Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s awareness of the danger of extending his\nline, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths\nof Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can\nhistorians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals,\nor such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat\ncontradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period of the war\nnot only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French\ninto the heart of the country, but from their first entry into Russia\neverything was done to stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid\nto extend his line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and\ndid not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.\n\nAt the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our sole\naim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage if we\nmeant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country. Our\nEmperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian\nsoil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel\xe2\x80\x99s\nplan, and there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor\nreproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could\nnot bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, still less\ncould he contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did\nunite he was displeased that Smol\xc3\xa9nsk was abandoned and burned without a\ngeneral engagement having been fought under its walls.\n\nSo thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were still\nmore provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the\ndepths of the country.\n\nNapoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and\nmissed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now\nsee that advance was evidently ruinous to him.\n\nThe facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the\nadvance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then\nthink of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of\nNapoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan,\nfor no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex\ninterplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in\nthe war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one\nway of saving Russia. Everything came about fortuitously. The armies\nwere divided at the commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite\nthem, with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the\nenemy\xe2\x80\x99s advance, and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle\nwith a much stronger enemy, and necessarily withdrawing the armies at\nan acute angle\xe2\x80\x94we led the French on to Smol\xc3\xa9nsk. But we withdrew at an\nacute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies;\nthe angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther, because\nBarclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagrati\xc3\xb3n (who\nwould come under his command), and Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x94being in command of the\nsecond army\xe2\x80\x94tried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclay\xe2\x80\x99s\ncommand as long as he could. Bagrati\xc3\xb3n was slow in effecting the\njunction\xe2\x80\x94though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters\xe2\x80\x94because,\nas he alleged, he exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was\nbest for him to retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying\nthe enemy from flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for\nhis army; and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under\nthe command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior\nto his own.\n\nThe Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence and\nignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of advisers and\nplans, destroyed the first army\xe2\x80\x99s energy and it retired.\n\nThe intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but Paulucci,\naiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed his energy\nto influence Alexander, and Pfuel\xe2\x80\x99s whole plan was abandoned and the\ncommand entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not inspire confidence\nhis power was limited. The armies were divided, there was no unity of\ncommand, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division,\nand the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief, there resulted\non the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could\nnot have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else,\ninstead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing\nindignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.\n\nAt last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed\nthe only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary\nfor him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in\ngeneral to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow\nthe strength of the Russian army was trebled.\n\nHe left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s undivided\ncontrol of the army, and hoping that more decisive action would then\nbe taken, but the command of the armies became still more confused and\nenfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsar\xc3\xa9vich, and a swarm of adjutants general\nremained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation\nand arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under\nthe observation of all these \xe2\x80\x9ceyes of the Emperor,\xe2\x80\x9d became still more\ncautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.\n\nBarclay stood for caution. The Tsar\xc3\xa9vich hinted at treachery and\ndemanded a general engagement. Lubom\xc3\xadrski, Bronn\xc3\xadtski, Wlocki, and the\nothers of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under\npretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish\nadjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with\nBennigsen and the Tsar\xc3\xa9vich.\n\nAt Smol\xc3\xa9nsk the armies at last reunited, much as Bagrati\xc3\xb3n disliked it.\n\nBagrati\xc3\xb3n drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay.\nBarclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior\nofficer Bagrati\xc3\xb3n.\n\nDespite his seniority in rank Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, in this contest of magnanimity,\ntook his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted, agreed with him\nless than ever. By the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s orders Bagrati\xc3\xb3n reported direct to\nhim. He wrote to Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s confidant: \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be as\nmy sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with the Minister (meaning\nBarclay). For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake send me somewhere else if only in command of\na regiment. I cannot stand it here. Headquarters are so full of Germans\nthat a Russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything. I thought\nI was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out\nthat I am serving Barclay. I confess I do not want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe swarm of Bronn\xc3\xadtskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still further\nembittered the relations between the commanders in chief, and even\nless unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the French before\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk. A general was sent to survey the position. This general,\nhating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a corps commander,\nand, having spent the day with him, returned to Barclay and condemned,\nas unsuitable from every point of view, the battleground he had not\nseen.\n\nWhile disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of\nbattle, and while we were looking for the French\xe2\x80\x94having lost touch with\nthem\xe2\x80\x94the French stumbled upon Nev\xc3\xa9rovski\xe2\x80\x99s division and reached the\nwalls of Smol\xc3\xa9nsk.\n\nIt was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk to save our\nlines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were killed\non both sides.\n\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the\nwhole people. But Smol\xc3\xa9nsk was burned by its own inhabitants who had\nbeen misled by their governor. And these ruined inhabitants, setting\nan example to other Russians, went to Moscow thinking only of their own\nlosses but kindling hatred of the foe. Napoleon advanced farther and we\nretired, thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess Mary\nto come to his study.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Are you satisfied now?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve made me quarrel with my\nson! Satisfied, are you? That\xe2\x80\x99s all you wanted! Satisfied?... It hurts\nme, it hurts. I\xe2\x80\x99m old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well then,\ngloat over it! Gloat over it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He was\nill and did not leave his study.\n\nPrincess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the\nold prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit\nMademoiselle Bourienne either. T\xc3\xadkhon alone attended him.\n\nAt the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way\nof life, devoting himself with special activity to building operations\nand the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his\nrelations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks and cold tone to his\ndaughter seemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, you see? You plotted against me, you\nlied to Prince Andrew about my relations with that Frenchwoman and made\nme quarrel with him, but you see I need neither her nor you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching\nhis lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to\nDessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her old\nnurse, or with \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s folk\xe2\x80\x9d who sometimes came by the back door to see\nher.\n\nOf the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She\nfeared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at\nthe strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did not\nunderstand the significance of this war, which seemed to her like all\nprevious wars. She did not realize the significance of this war, though\nDessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested\nin its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her,\nand though the \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s folk\xe2\x80\x9d who came to see her reported, in their own\nway, the rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist,\nand though Julie (now Princess Drubetsk\xc3\xa1ya), who had resumed\ncorrespondence with her, wrote patriotic letters from Moscow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI write you in Russian, my good friend,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Julie in her Frenchified\nRussian, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I have a detestation for all the French, and the\nsame for their language which I cannot support to hear spoken.... We in\nMoscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but the\nnews which I have inspires me yet more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard probably of the heroic exploit of Ra\xc3\xa9vski, embracing his two\nsons and saying: \xe2\x80\x98I will perish with them but we will not be shaken!\xe2\x80\x99\nAnd truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we were\nunshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The\nprincesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy\nwidows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie, only\nyou, my friend, are missing...\xe2\x80\x9d and so on.\n\nThe chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of\nthis war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recognize\nit, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner.\nThe prince\xe2\x80\x99s tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary\nunhesitatingly believed him.\n\nAll that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated.\nHe planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic\nserfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that\nhe slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual,\nchanged his sleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp\nbed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he remained on the\ncouch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without\nundressing, while\xe2\x80\x94instead of Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x94a serf boy read to\nhim. Then again he would spend a night in the dining room.\n\nOn August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his\nfirst letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had\ndutifully asked his father\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself\nto say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old\nprince had replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the\nFrenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s second letter, written near\nV\xc3\xadtebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a brief account of\nthe whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts\nas to the further progress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew\npointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near\nthe theater of war and on the army\xe2\x80\x99s direct line of march, and advised\nhim to move to Moscow.\n\nAt dinner that day, on Dessalles\xe2\x80\x99 mentioning that the French were said\nto have already entered V\xc3\xadtebsk, the old prince remembered his son\xe2\x80\x99s\nletter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a letter from Prince Andrew today,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Princess\nMary\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you read it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Father,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied in a frightened voice.\n\nShe could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had\narrived.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe writes about this war,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince, with the ironic smile that\nhad become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat must be very interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dessalles. \xe2\x80\x9cPrince Andrew is in a\nposition to know...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and get it for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know\xe2\x80\x94under the paperweight on the little table.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed with a frown. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go, Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMichael Iv\xc3\xa1novich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he had left\nthe room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin\nand went himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything... always make some muddle,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\n\nWhile he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and\neven little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince returned\nwith quick steps, accompanied by Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich, bringing the letter\nand a plan. These he put down beside him\xe2\x80\x94not letting anyone read them at\ndinner.\n\nOn moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and,\nspreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his\neyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she had done so\nPrincess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was examining the\nplan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of it, Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d Dessalles ventured to ask.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I?...\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not taking\nhis eyes from the plan of the building.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa ha ha! The theater of war!\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince. \xe2\x80\x9cI have said and still\nsay that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get\nbeyond the Niemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of the\nNiemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess Mary,\nforgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that what\nher father was saying was correct.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the snow melts they\xe2\x80\x99ll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they\ncould fail to see it,\xe2\x80\x9d the prince continued, evidently thinking of the\ncampaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. \xe2\x80\x9cBennigsen should have\nadvanced into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different\nturn...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d Dessalles began timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe letter mentions\nV\xc3\xadtebsk....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the letter? Yes...\xe2\x80\x9d replied the prince peevishly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes... yes...\xe2\x80\x9d\nHis face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\nwrites that the French were beaten at... at... what river is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDessalles dropped his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prince says nothing about that,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked gently.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t he? But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t invent it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNo one spoke for a long time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... yes... Well, Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich,\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly went on, raising\nhis head and pointing to the plan of the building, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me how you mean\nto alter it....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMichael Iv\xc3\xa1novich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking to\nhim about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and\nwent to his own room.\n\nPrincess Mary saw Dessalles\xe2\x80\x99 embarrassed and astonished look fixed on\nher father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her\nfather had forgotten his son\xe2\x80\x99s letter on the drawing room table; but she\nwas not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his\nconfusion and silence, but was afraid even to think about it.\n\nIn the evening Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich, sent by the prince, came to Princess\nMary for Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s letter which had been forgotten in the drawing\nroom. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so,\nventured to ask him what her father was doing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways busy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich with a respectfully ironic\nsmile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s worrying very much\nabout the new building. He has been reading a little, but now\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Michael\nIv\xc3\xa1novich went on, lowering his voice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnow he\xe2\x80\x99s at his desk, busy with\nhis will, I expect.\xe2\x80\x9d (One of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s favorite occupations of late\nhad been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death\nand which he called his \xe2\x80\x9cwill.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Alp\xc3\xa1tych is being sent to Smol\xc3\xa9nsk?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Princess Mary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWhen Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich returned to the study with the letter, the old\nprince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting at his\nopen bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in his outstretched\nhand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript\xe2\x80\x94his\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemarks\xe2\x80\x9d as he termed it\xe2\x80\x94which was to be transmitted to the Emperor\nafter his death.\n\nWhen Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich went in there were tears in the prince\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\nevoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had\nbeen written. He took the letter from Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich\xe2\x80\x99s hand, put it\nin his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in Alp\xc3\xa1tych who had long\nbeen waiting.\n\nThe prince had a list of things to be bought in Smol\xc3\xa9nsk and, walking\nup and down the room past Alp\xc3\xa1tych who stood by the door, he gave his\ninstructions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst, notepaper\xe2\x80\x94do you hear? Eight quires, like this sample,\ngilt-edged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing wax,\nas in Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich\xe2\x80\x99s list.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be\nof a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather case\nhad to be ordered to keep the \xe2\x80\x9cwill\xe2\x80\x9d in.\n\nThe instructions to Alp\xc3\xa1tych took over two hours and still the prince\ndid not let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, and\ndozed off. Alp\xc3\xa1tych made a slight movement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go, go! If anything more is wanted I\xe2\x80\x99ll send after you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into it,\nfingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at the table\nto write to the governor.\n\nIt was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished\nto sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing\nthoughts came to him in bed. So he called T\xc3\xadkhon and went through the\nrooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.\n\nHe went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed\nunsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study.\nThat couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive\nthoughts he had had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory everywhere,\nbut the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than\nother places: he had never slept there yet.\n\nWith the help of a footman T\xc3\xadkhon brought in the bedstead and began\nputting it up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not right! That\xe2\x80\x99s not right!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the prince, and himself\npushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at last I\xe2\x80\x99ve finished, now I\xe2\x80\x99ll rest,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the prince, and\nlet T\xc3\xadkhon undress him.\n\nFrowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his\ncoat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on the\nbed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his\nwithered yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring the\nmoment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the\nbed. \xe2\x80\x9cUgh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you would\nrelease me!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that effort\nfor the twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had he done so\nbefore he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if\nit were breathing heavily and jolting. This happened to him almost every\nnight. He opened his eyes as they were closing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo peace, damn them!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, angry he knew not with whom. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\nyes, there was something else important, very important, that I was\nkeeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him about them.\nNo, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary\ntalked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something. Something in\nmy pocket\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t remember....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cT\xc3\xadkhon, what did we talk about at dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Prince Michael...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d The prince slapped his hand on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\nknow, Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said\nsomething about V\xc3\xadtebsk. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had the letter taken from his pocket and the table\xe2\x80\x94on which stood a\nglass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle\xe2\x80\x94moved close to the bed, and\nputting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in the stillness of\nthe night, reading it by the faint light under the green shade, did he\ngrasp its meaning for a moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe French at V\xc3\xadtebsk, in four days\xe2\x80\x99 march they may be at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk;\nperhaps are already there! T\xc3\xadkhon!\xe2\x80\x9d T\xc3\xadkhon jumped up. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwant anything!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\nHe put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there\nrose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian\ncamp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face,\nvigorous and alert, entering Pot\xc3\xabmkin\xe2\x80\x99s gaily colored tent, and a\nburning sense of jealousy of \xe2\x80\x9cthe favorite\xe2\x80\x9d agitated him now as strongly\nas it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that\nfirst meeting with Pot\xc3\xabmkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather\nsallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile\nand her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that same\nface on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with Z\xc3\xbabov over her\ncoffin about his right to kiss her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all\nthe present! Quicker, quicker\xe2\x80\x94and that they should leave me in peace!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s estate, lay forty miles east\nfrom Smol\xc3\xa9nsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.\n\nThe same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alp\xc3\xa1tych,\nDessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the\nprince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety,\nthough from Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald\nHills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter\nby Alp\xc3\xa1tych to the Provincial Governor at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, asking him to let\nher know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which\nBald Hills was exposed. Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor\nfor Princess Mary, she signed it, and it was given to Alp\xc3\xa1tych with\ninstructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as\npossible if there was danger.\n\nHaving received all his orders Alp\xc3\xa1tych, wearing a white beaver hat\xe2\x80\x94a\npresent from the prince\xe2\x80\x94and carrying a stick as the prince did, went out\naccompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready harnessed to\na small conveyance with a leather hood.\n\nThe larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed\nwith paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with\nringing bells; but on a long journey Alp\xc3\xa1tych liked to have them. His\nsatellites\xe2\x80\x94the senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid,\na cook, two old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and various\ndomestic serfs\xe2\x80\x94were seeing him off.\n\nHis daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on and\nbehind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, and one\nof the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! There! Women\xe2\x80\x99s fuss! Women, women!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alp\xc3\xa1tych, puffing and\nspeaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the trap.\n\nAfter giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, Alp\xc3\xa1tych, not\ntrying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald head and\ncrossed himself three times.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is anything... come back, Y\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych! For Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake\nthink of us!\xe2\x80\x9d cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the\nenemy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen, women! Women\xe2\x80\x99s fuss!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Alp\xc3\xa1tych to himself and started\non his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the\nstill-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black fields just\nbeing plowed a second time.\n\nAs he went along he looked with pleasure at the year\xe2\x80\x99s splendid crop\nof corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were\nalready being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing and the\nharvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the\nprince\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\n\nHaving baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town toward\nevening on the fourth of August.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the\nroad. As he approached Smol\xc3\xa9nsk he heard the sounds of distant firing,\nbut these did not impress him. What struck him most was the sight of a\nsplendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which\nwas being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder. This fact\nimpressed Alp\xc3\xa1tych, but in thinking about his own business he soon\nforgot it.\n\nAll the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been\nbounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit.\nEverything not connected with the execution of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s orders did\nnot interest and did not even exist for Alp\xc3\xa1tych.\n\nOn reaching Smol\xc3\xa9nsk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up\nin the G\xc3\xa1china suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov,\nwhere he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years.\nSome thirty years ago Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov, by Alp\xc3\xa1tych\xe2\x80\x99s advice, had bought a\nwood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an\ninn, and a corn dealer\xe2\x80\x99s shop in that province. He was a stout, dark,\nred-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a\nnose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly.\n\nWearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov was standing\nbefore his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing Alp\xc3\xa1tych he went\nup to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, Y\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych. Folks are leaving the town, but you\nhave come to it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are they leaving the town?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Alp\xc3\xa1tych.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen\xe2\x80\x99s fuss, women\xe2\x80\x99s fuss!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alp\xc3\xa1tych.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust what I think, Y\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych. What I say is: orders have been\ngiven not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants are\nasking three rubles for carting\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Christian!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nY\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for hay\nfor his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.\n\nAll night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning Alp\xc3\xa1tych\ndonned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business. It was a\nsunny morning and by eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock it was already hot. \xe2\x80\x9cA good day for\nharvesting,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Alp\xc3\xa1tych.\n\nFrom beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At eight\no\xe2\x80\x99clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry. Many\npeople were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers,\nbut cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops, and\nservice was being held in the churches as usual. Alp\xc3\xa1tych went to the\nshops, to government offices, to the post office, and to the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s.\nIn the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking\nabout the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town,\neverybody was asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm\none another.\n\nIn front of the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s house Alp\xc3\xa1tych found a large number of\npeople, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s. At the\nporch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an\nex-captain of police, was saying angrily:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no joke, you know! It\xe2\x80\x99s all very well if you\xe2\x80\x99re single. \xe2\x80\x98One man\nthough undone is but one,\xe2\x80\x99 as the proverb says, but with thirteen in\nyour family and all the property... They\xe2\x80\x99ve brought us to utter ruin!\nWhat sort of governors are they to do that? They ought to be hanged\xe2\x80\x94the\nbrigands!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh come, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough!\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care? Let him hear! We\xe2\x80\x99re not dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ex-captain of\npolice, and looking round he noticed Alp\xc3\xa1tych.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Y\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych! What have you come for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see the Governor by his excellency\xe2\x80\x99s order,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Alp\xc3\xa1tych,\nlifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his\ncoat as he always did when he mentioned the prince.... \xe2\x80\x9cHe has ordered\nme to inquire into the position of affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, go and find out!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the angry gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve brought\nthings to such a pass that there are no carts or anything!... There it\nis again, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, pointing in the direction whence came\nthe sounds of firing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve brought us all to ruin... the brigands!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, and\ndescended the porch steps.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were\ntradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another. The\ndoor of the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s room opened and they all rose and moved forward.\nAn official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called a stout\nofficial with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and vanished\nagain, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions\naddressed to him. Alp\xc3\xa1tych moved forward and next time the official came\nout addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat,\nand handed him two letters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nannounced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned\nto him and took the letters.\n\nA few minutes later the Governor received Alp\xc3\xa1tych and hurriedly said to\nhim:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on the\nhighest instructions\xe2\x80\x94here...\xe2\x80\x9d and he handed a paper to Alp\xc3\xa1tych. \xe2\x80\x9cStill,\nas the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to Moscow. I am\njust starting myself. Inform them...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into the\nroom and began to say something in French. The Governor\xe2\x80\x99s face expressed\nterror.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, nodding his head to Alp\xc3\xa1tych, and began questioning the\nofficer.\n\nEager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alp\xc3\xa1tych when he came\nout of the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s room. Involuntarily listening now to the firing,\nwhich had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength, Alp\xc3\xa1tych hurried\nto his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you that the town of Smol\xc3\xa9nsk is not in the slightest danger\nas yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any. I from\nthe one side and Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n from the other are marching to unite\nour forces before Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, which junction will be effected on the\n22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces will defend our\ncompatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts\nshall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland, or till the last\nwarrior in our valiant ranks has perished. From this you will see that\nyou have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, for\nthose defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory.\xe2\x80\x9d\n(Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk, 1812.)\n\nPeople were anxiously roaming about the streets.\n\nCarts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept\nemerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets.\nLoaded carts stood at the house next to Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov\xe2\x80\x99s and women were\nwailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round\nbarking in front of the harnessed horses.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went\nstraight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman was\nasleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage.\nFrom the host\xe2\x80\x99s room came the sounds of a child crying, the despairing\nsobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov. The cook\nbegan running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen,\njust as Alp\xc3\xa1tych entered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged her\nabout so!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Alp\xc3\xa1tych.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe kept begging to go away. She\xe2\x80\x99s a woman! \xe2\x80\x98Take me away,\xe2\x80\x99 says she,\n\xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t let me perish with my little children! Folks,\xe2\x80\x99 she says, \xe2\x80\x98are all\ngone, so why,\xe2\x80\x99 she says, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t we go?\xe2\x80\x99 And he began beating and pulling\nher about so!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt these words Alp\xc3\xa1tych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to\nhear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s, where\nhe had left his purchases.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou brute, you murderer!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a baby\nin her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through the door\nat that moment and down the steps into the yard.\n\nFerap\xc3\xb3ntov came out after her, but on seeing Alp\xc3\xa1tych adjusted his\nwaistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alp\xc3\xa1tych into the\nopposite room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing already?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his packages\nand asked how much he owed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nFerap\xc3\xb3ntov. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has been decided?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith our business, how can we get away?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d have\nto pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogob\xc3\xbazh and I tell them they\xe2\x80\x99re\nnot Christians to ask it! Seliv\xc3\xa1nov, now, did a good stroke last\nThursday\xe2\x80\x94sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will you have\nsome tea?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\nWhile the horses were being harnessed Alp\xc3\xa1tych and Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov over their\ntea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather for\nharvesting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it seems to be getting quieter,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov, finishing\nhis third cup of tea and getting up. \xe2\x80\x9cOurs must have got the best of it.\nThe orders were not to let them in. So we\xe2\x80\x99re in force, it seems....\nThey say the other day Matthew Iv\xc3\xa1nych Pl\xc3\xa1tov drove them into the river\nM\xc3\xa1rina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who had come\nin, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels, hoofs, and\nbells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out.\n\nIt was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in shadow, the\nother half brightly lit by the sun. Alp\xc3\xa1tych looked out of the window\nand went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling\nand thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull\nroar that set the windows rattling.\n\nHe went out into the street: two men were running past toward the\nbridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of\ncannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds\nwere hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the\ntown and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was\nbeing bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered\nup after four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of\nthis bombardment.\n\nAt first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused\ncuriosity. Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under\nthe shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate,\nlistening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.\n\nThe cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively curiosity\neveryone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over\ntheir heads. Several people came round the corner talking eagerly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat force!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked one. \xe2\x80\x9cKnocked the roof and ceiling all to\nsplinters!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRouted up the earth like a pig,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s grand, it bucks one up!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the first. \xe2\x80\x9cLucky you jumped\naside, or it would have wiped you out!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOthers joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen\non a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now with\nthe swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the agreeable\nintermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people\xe2\x80\x99s heads incessantly,\nbut not one fell close by, they all flew over. Alp\xc3\xa1tych was getting into\nhis trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you staring at?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt,\nwith sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the\ncorner to listen to what was being said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat marvels!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, but hearing her master\xe2\x80\x99s voice she turned\nback, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.\n\nOnce more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping\ndownwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the\nstreet, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cScoundrel, what are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the\ncook.\n\nAt that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different\nsides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently\nwith pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her\nwailing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me die! My good\nsouls!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFive minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her\nthigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen.\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych, his coachman, Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov\xe2\x80\x99s wife and children and the house\nporter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns, the\nwhistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook, which\nrose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The mistress\nrocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked\nin a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained\nin the street. A shopman who entered told her that her husband had\ngone with others to the cathedral, whence they were fetching the\nwonder-working icon of Smol\xc3\xa9nsk.\n\nToward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alp\xc3\xa1tych left the cellar\nand stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was\nclouded with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon\nshone strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush\nseemed to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of footsteps,\nthe moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed\nwidespread everywhere. The cook\xe2\x80\x99s moans had now subsided. On two sides\nblack curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires. Through\nthe streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in\ndifferent directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. Several of them\nran into Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov\xe2\x80\x99s yard before Alp\xc3\xa1tych\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Alp\xc3\xa1tych went out\nto the gate. A retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the\nstreet.\n\nNoticing him, an officer said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe town is being abandoned. Get away,\nget away!\xe2\x80\x9d and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to run into the yards!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him to\nset off. Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov\xe2\x80\x99s whole household came out too, following Alp\xc3\xa1tych\nand the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then, suddenly\nbegan to wail as they looked at the fires\xe2\x80\x94the smoke and even the flames\nof which could be seen in the failing twilight\xe2\x80\x94and as if in reply the\nsame kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street.\nInside the shed Alp\xc3\xa1tych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and\ntraces of their horses with trembling hands.\n\nAs Alp\xc3\xa1tych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in\nFerap\xc3\xb3ntov\xe2\x80\x99s open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and\nknapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov returned\nand entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at\nthem, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair, burst into sobs\nand laughter:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoot everything, lads! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let those devils get it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, taking\nsome bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.\n\nSome of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on\nfilling their bags. On seeing Alp\xc3\xa1tych, Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov turned to him:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRussia is done for!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAlp\xc3\xa1tych, I\xe2\x80\x99ll set the place on fire\nmyself. We\xe2\x80\x99re done for!...\xe2\x80\x9d and Ferap\xc3\xb3ntov ran into the yard.\n\nSoldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking\nit completely, so that Alp\xc3\xa1tych could not pass out and had to wait.\nFerap\xc3\xb3ntov\xe2\x80\x99s wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till\nit was possible to drive out.\n\nNight had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out\namid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the Dnieper\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych\xe2\x80\x99s cart and that of the innkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s wife, which were slowly\nmoving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop.\nIn a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped, a\nhouse and some shops were on fire. This fire was already burning itself\nout. The flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke, now\nsuddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness\nthe faces of the people crowding at the crossroads. Black figures\nflitted about before the fire, and through the incessant crackling of\nthe flames talking and shouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap\nwould not be able to move on for some time, Alp\xc3\xa1tych got down and turned\ninto the side street to look at the fire. Soldiers were continually\nrushing backwards and forwards near it, and he saw two of them and a\nman in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the\nstreet, while others carried bundles of hay.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was\nblazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen\nin, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters were alight. The\ncrowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in, and Alp\xc3\xa1tych\nwatched for it too.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlp\xc3\xa1tych!\xe2\x80\x9d a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy on us! Your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Alp\xc3\xa1tych, immediately\nrecognizing the voice of his young prince.\n\nPrince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking\nat Alp\xc3\xa1tych from the back of the crowd.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour... your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered Alp\xc3\xa1tych and broke into sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\nwe really lost? Master!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you here?\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew repeated.\n\nAt that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master\xe2\x80\x99s pale\nworn face. Alp\xc3\xa1tych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it\nwas to get away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we really quite lost, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked again.\n\nPrince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee\nbegan writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmol\xc3\xa9nsk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the enemy\nwithin a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when\nyou will start. Send by special messenger to Usvy\xc3\xa1zh.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving written this and given the paper to Alp\xc3\xa1tych, he told him how\nto arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before\nhe had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of staff\nfollowed by a suite galloped up to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the chief of staff with a German accent,\nin a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cHouses are set on fire in your\npresence and you stand by! What does this mean? You will answer for\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Berg, who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the\ncommander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army, a place,\nas Berg said, \xe2\x80\x9cvery agreeable and well en \xc3\xa9vidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by the\ntenth I don\xe2\x80\x99t receive news that they have all got away I shall have to\nthrow up everything and come myself to Bald Hills.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cI only spoke because\nI have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly.... You must\nplease excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on apologetically.\n\nSomething cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and\nwreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another\nterrible crash and something huge collapsed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOu-rou-rou!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof\nof the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all\naround. The flames flared up again, lighting the animated, delighted,\nexhausted faces of the spectators.\n\nThe man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fine, lads! Now it\xe2\x80\x99s raging... It\xe2\x80\x99s fine!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the owner himself,\xe2\x80\x9d cried several voices.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Prince Andrew to Alp\xc3\xa1tych, \xe2\x80\x9creport to them as I\nhave told you\xe2\x80\x9d; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside\nhim, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nFrom Smol\xc3\xa9nsk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the enemy.\nOn the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching\nalong the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills. Heat and\ndrought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day fleecy clouds\nfloated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun, but toward\nevening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist.\nHeavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The unreaped corn was\nscorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried up. The cattle lowed from\nhunger, finding no food on the sun-parched meadows. Only at night and\nin the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness. But on the\nroad, the highroad along which the troops marched, there was no such\nfreshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest; the\ndew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches\ndeep. As soon as day dawned the march began. The artillery and baggage\nwagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very\nhubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft,\nchoking, hot dust that never cooled even at night. Some of this dust\nwas kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a\ncloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and\nworst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that\nroad. The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and\nthrough the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked\neye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded\nsky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless\natmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and\nmouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells\nand fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.\n\nPrince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of that\nregiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving\nand giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smol\xc3\xa9nsk and its\nabandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against\nthe foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely devoted to the\naffairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and\nofficers. In the regiment they called him \xe2\x80\x9cour prince,\xe2\x80\x9d were proud\nof him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to those of his\nregiment, to Tim\xc3\xb3khin and the like\xe2\x80\x94people quite new to him, belonging\nto a different world and who could not know and understand his past. As\nsoon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the\nstaff, he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful, ironical, and\ncontemptuous. Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to\nhim, and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself\nto trying to do his duty and not to be unfair.\n\nIn truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to\nPrince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smol\xc3\xa9nsk on the sixth\nof August (he considered that it could and should have been defended)\nand after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to\npillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled.\nBut despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to\nthink about entirely apart from general questions. Two days previously\nhe had received news that his father, son, and sister had left for\nMoscow; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince\nAndrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that\nhe must ride there.\n\nHe ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the\nmarch, rode to his father\xe2\x80\x99s estate where he had been born and spent his\nchildhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens\nof women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden\nbeetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that\nthe little washing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was\nfloating on its side in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s\nlodge. No one was at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door\nstood open. Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths, and\nhorses and calves were straying in the English park. Prince Andrew rode\nup to the hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken, and of the\ntrees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up. He called for\nTar\xc3\xa1s the gardener, but no one replied. Having gone round the corner\nof the hothouse to the ornamental garden, he saw that the carved garden\nfence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with\nthe fruit. An old peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often\nseen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast\nshoe.\n\nHe was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting on\nthe seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of\nbast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.\n\nPrince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old garden had\nbeen cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of\nthe house among the rosebushes. The shutters were all closed, except at\none window which was open. A little serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran\ninto the house. Alp\xc3\xa1tych, having sent his family away, was alone at\nBald Hills and was sitting indoors reading the Lives of the Saints. On\nhearing that Prince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on\nhis nose, buttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word\nbegan weeping and kissing Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s knee.\n\nThen, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to report\non the position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable had been\nremoved to Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted\naway. The hay and the spring corn, of which Alp\xc3\xa1tych said there had been\na remarkable crop that year, had been commandeered by the troops and\nmown down while still green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too\nhad gone to Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, only a few remained.\n\nWithout waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did my father and sister leave?\xe2\x80\x9d meaning when did they leave for\nMoscow.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for\nBoguch\xc3\xa1rovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again went\ninto details concerning the estate management, asking for instructions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them?\nWe have still six hundred quarters left,\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to say to him?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew, looking down on the\nold man\xe2\x80\x99s bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on\nhis face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions\nwere and only asked them to allay his grief.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, let them have it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you noticed some disorder in the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alp\xc3\xa1tych, \xe2\x80\x9cit was\nimpossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent\nthe night, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their\ncommanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy\noccupies the place?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Prince Andrew.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and suddenly\nwith a solemn gesture raised his arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my refuge! His will be done!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\n\nA group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward\nthe prince.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alp\xc3\xa1tych. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\nmust go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the\nRyaz\xc3\xa1n estate or to the one near Moscow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych clung to Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s leg and burst into sobs. Gently\ndisengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the\navenue at a gallop.\n\nThe old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly\nimpassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on\nwhich he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out\nfrom the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from\nthe trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young master,\nthe elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the\nhand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some\ngreen plums they had dropped.\n\nPrince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them\nsee that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty frightened\nlittle girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible\ndesire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him\nwhen, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of other human\ninterests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those\nthat occupied him. Evidently these girls passionately desired one\nthing\xe2\x80\x94to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught\xe2\x80\x94and\nPrince Andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise. He\ncould not resist looking at them once more. Believing their danger past,\nthey sprang from their ambush and, chirruping something in their shrill\nlittle voices and holding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned\nfeet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass.\n\nPrince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty\nhighroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills\nhe again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting\nplace by the dam of a small pond. It was past one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The sun,\na red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably\nthrough his black coat. The dust always hung motionless above the buzz\nof talk that came from the resting troops. There was no wind. As he\ncrossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the\npond. He longed to get into that water, however dirty it might be, and\nhe glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and\nlaughter. The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a\nfoot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies\nof soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing\nabout in it. All this naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking,\nfloundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering\ncan, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered\nit specially pathetic.\n\nOne fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince Andrew\nknew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed himself,\nstepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water; another,\na dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood up to his\nwaist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted\nwith satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands\nblackened to the wrists. There were sounds of men slapping one another,\nyelling, and puffing.\n\nEverywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was healthy,\nwhite, muscular flesh. The officer, Tim\xc3\xb3khin, with his red little nose,\nstanding on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing\nthe prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very nice, your excellency! Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s dirty,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll clear it out for you in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim\xc3\xb3khin, and, still\nundressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prince wants to bathe.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat prince? Ours?\xe2\x80\x9d said many voices, and the men were in such haste\nto clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He decided that he\nwould rather wash himself with water in the barn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlesh, bodies, cannon fodder!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and he looked at his own\nnaked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust\nand horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that\nimmense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.\n\n\nOn the seventh of August Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n wrote as follows from his\nquarters at Mikh\xc3\xa1ylovna on the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk road:\n\nDear Count Al\xc3\xa9xis Andr\xc3\xa9evich\xe2\x80\x94(He was writing to Arakch\xc3\xa9ev but knew that\nhis letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every\nword in it to the best of his ability.)\n\nI expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the\nabandonment of Smol\xc3\xa9nsk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and\nthe whole army is in despair that this most important place has been\nwantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most urgently\nand finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. I swear\nto you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and\nmight have lost half his army but could not have taken Smol\xc3\xa9nsk. Our\ntroops fought, and are fighting, as never before. With fifteen thousand\nmen I held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he\nwould not hold out even for fourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain\non our army, and as for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If\nhe reports that our losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about\nfour thousand, not more, and not even that; but even were they ten\nthousand, that\xe2\x80\x99s war! But the enemy has lost masses....\n\nWhat would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They would\nhave had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water for men\nor horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but suddenly sent\ninstructions that he was retiring that night. We cannot fight in this\nway, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow....\n\nThere is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you\nshould make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You\nwould set all Russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed\nto wear the uniform. If it has come to this\xe2\x80\x94we must fight as long as\nRussia can and as long as there are men able to stand....\n\nOne man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may perhaps\nbe good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad but\nexecrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country.... I\nam really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly. It is clear\nthat the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that the\nMinister should command the army, does not love our sovereign and\ndesires the ruin of us all. So I write you frankly: call out the\nmilitia. For the Minister is leading these visitors after him to Moscow\nin a most masterly way. The whole army feels great suspicion of the\nImperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He is said to be more Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s man\nthan ours, and he is always advising the Minister. I am not merely civil\nto him but obey him like a corporal, though I am his senior. This is\npainful, but, loving my benefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only I am\nsorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he.\nConsider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the\nhospital more than fifteen thousand men, and had we attacked this would\nnot have happened. Tell me, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, what will Russia, our mother\nRussia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning our\ngood and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of\nhatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we scared at and of whom\nare we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is vacillating,\na coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The whole army\nbewails it and calls down curses upon him....\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAmong the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human\nlife one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails\nand those in which form prevails. To the latter\xe2\x80\x94as distinguished\nfrom village, country, provincial, or even Moscow life\xe2\x80\x94we may allot\nPetersburg life, and especially the life of its salons. That life of\nthe salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had\nagain quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade\nthem again, but the salons of Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna and H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne remained just\nas they had been\xe2\x80\x94the one seven and the other five years before. At Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s they talked with perplexity of Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s successes just\nas before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the\nEuropean sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was\nto cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna was the representative. And in H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s salon, which Rumy\xc3\xa1ntsev\nhimself honored with his visits, regarding H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne as a remarkably\nintelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat nation\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat man,\xe2\x80\x9d and regretted our rupture\nwith France, a rupture which, according to them, ought to be promptly\nterminated by peace.\n\nOf late, since the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s return from the army, there had been some\nexcitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations\nof hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency.\nIn Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were\ndeep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the\neffect that one ought not to go to the French theater and that to\nmaintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole\narmy corps. The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only\nthe reports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French\ncircle of H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne and Rumy\xc3\xa1ntsev the reports of the cruelty of the\nenemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s attempts at\nconciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those\nwho advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kaz\xc3\xa1n of the court and\nthe girls\xe2\x80\x99 educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager\nEmpress. In H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s circle the war in general was regarded as a series\nof formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the\nview prevailed expressed by Bil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x94who now in Petersburg was quite at\nhome in H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s house, which every clever man was obliged to visit\xe2\x80\x94that\nnot by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be\nsettled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm\xe2\x80\x94news of which had reached\nPetersburg simultaneously with the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s return\xe2\x80\x94was ridiculed\nsarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm\nand spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients.\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a\nconnecting link between these two circles. He visited his \xe2\x80\x9cgood friend\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x9d as well as his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdiplomatic salon,\xe2\x80\x9d and often\nin his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused\nand said at H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s what he should have said at Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s and\nvice versa.\n\nSoon after the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s return Prince Vas\xc3\xadli in a conversation about\nthe war at Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s severely condemned Barclay de Tolly, but was\nundecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief. One of the\nvisitors, usually spoken of as \xe2\x80\x9ca man of great merit,\xe2\x80\x9d having described\nhow he had that day seen Kut\xc3\xbazov, the newly chosen chief of the\nPetersburg militia, presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the\nTreasury, cautiously ventured to suggest that Kut\xc3\xbazov would be the man\nto satisfy all requirements.\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kut\xc3\xbazov had done\nnothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli interrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they did not listen to me. I told them his\nelection as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They did\nnot listen to me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all this mania for opposition,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who for? It is\nall because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,\xe2\x80\x9d\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli continued, forgetting for a moment that though at H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s\none had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s one had to\nbe ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, is\nit suitable that Count Kut\xc3\xbazov, the oldest general in Russia, should\npreside at that tribunal? He will get nothing for his pains! How could\nthey make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse, who drops\nasleep at a council, and has the very worst morals! A good reputation\nhe made for himself at Bucharest! I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of his capacity as a\ngeneral, but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit, blind old\nman, positively blind? A fine idea to have a blind general! He can\xe2\x80\x99t see\nanything. To play blindman\xe2\x80\x99s bulff? He can\xe2\x80\x99t see at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNo one replied to his remarks.\n\nThis was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the\ntwenty-ninth of July Kut\xc3\xbazov received the title of Prince. This might\nindicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince Vas\xc3\xadli\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\ncontinued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express\nit. But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting of Field Marshal\nSaltyk\xc3\xb3v, Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, Vyazm\xc3\xadtinov, Lopukh\xc3\xadn, and Kochub\xc3\xa9y met to consider\nthe progress of the war. This committee came to the conclusion that\nour failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the\nmembers of the committee were aware of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s dislike of Kut\xc3\xbazov,\nafter a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as\ncommander in chief. That same day Kut\xc3\xbazov was appointed commander\nin chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region\noccupied by them.\n\nOn the ninth of August Prince Vas\xc3\xadli at Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s again met the\n\xe2\x80\x9cman of great merit.\xe2\x80\x9d The latter was very attentive to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\nbecause he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational\nestablishments for young ladies. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli entered the room with the\nair of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you heard the great news? Prince Kut\xc3\xbazov is field marshal!\nAll dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At last\nwe have a man!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, glancing sternly and significantly round at\neveryone in the drawing room.\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cman of great merit,\xe2\x80\x9d despite his desire to obtain the post of\ndirector, could not refrain from reminding Prince Vas\xc3\xadli of his former\nopinion. Though this was impolite to Prince Vas\xc3\xadli in Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s\ndrawing room, and also to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna herself who had received the\nnews with delight, he could not resist the temptation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Prince, they say he is blind!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, reminding Prince Vas\xc3\xadli of\nhis own words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? Nonsense! He sees well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Vas\xc3\xadli rapidly, in a\ndeep voice and with a slight cough\xe2\x80\x94the voice and cough with which he was\nwont to dispose of all difficulties.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sees well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what I am so pleased about,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x9cis that our sovereign has given him full powers over all\nthe armies and the whole region\xe2\x80\x94powers no commander in chief ever had\nbefore. He is a second autocrat,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded with a victorious smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it! God grant it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cman of great merit,\xe2\x80\x9d who was still a novice in court circles,\nwishing to flatter Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna by defending her former position on\nthis question, observed:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kut\xc3\xbazov those powers.\nThey say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read, when he said to\nKut\xc3\xbazov: \xe2\x80\x98Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the heart took no part in that speech,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d warmly rejoined Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, who would not now yield\nKut\xc3\xbazov to anyone; in his opinion Kut\xc3\xbazov was not only admirable\nhimself, but was adored by everybody. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant only that Prince Kut\xc3\xbazov assumes real power and does not\nallow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nUnderstanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vas\xc3\xadli said in a\nwhisper:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know for a fact that Kut\xc3\xbazov made it an absolute condition that the\nTsar\xc3\xa9vich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to the\nEmperor?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Prince Vas\xc3\xadli repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by\nKut\xc3\xbazov to the Emperor. \xe2\x80\x9cI can neither punish him if he does wrong nor\nreward him if he does right.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a very wise man is Prince Kut\xc3\xbazov! I have known him a long time!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey even say,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the \xe2\x80\x9cman of great merit\xe2\x80\x9d who did not yet\npossess courtly tact, \xe2\x80\x9cthat his excellency made it an express condition\nthat the sovereign himself should not be with the army.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs soon as he said this both Prince Vas\xc3\xadli and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna turned away\nfrom him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nWhile this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already passed\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow. Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\nhistorian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying to justify his\nhero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against his will. He\nis as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic\nevents in the will of one man; he is as right as the Russian historians\nwho maintain that Napoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the\nRussian commanders. Here besides the law of retrospection, which regards\nall the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur,\nthe law of reciprocity comes in, confusing the whole matter. A good\nchessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss\nresulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the\nopening, but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar\nmistakes and that none of his moves were perfect. He only notices the\nmistake to which he pays attention, because his opponent took advantage\nof it. How much more complex than this is the game of war, which\noccurs under certain limits of time, and where it is not one will that\nmanipulates lifeless objects, but everything results from innumerable\nconflicts of various wills!\n\nAfter Smol\xc3\xa9nsk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogob\xc3\xbazh at Vy\xc3\xa1zma, and\nthen at Ts\xc3\xa1revo-Zaym\xc3\xadshche, but it happened that owing to a conjunction\nof innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give battle till\nthey reached Borodin\xc3\xb3, seventy miles from Moscow. From Vy\xc3\xa1zma Napoleon\nordered a direct advance on Moscow.\n\nMoscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacr\xc3\xa9e des\npeuples d\xe2\x80\x99Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables \xc3\xa9glises en forme de\npagodes chinoises, * this Moscow gave Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s imagination no rest.\nOn the march from Vy\xc3\xa1zma to Ts\xc3\xa1revo-Zaym\xc3\xadshche he rode his light bay\nbobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages,\nand aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind to\nquestion a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by\nLelorgne d\xe2\x80\x99Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop\nand reined in his horse with an amused expression.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cMoscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the\n     sacred city of Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s people, Moscow with its\n     innumerable churches shaped like Chinese pagodas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Napoleon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of Pl\xc3\xa1tov\xe2\x80\x99s Cossacks says that Pl\xc3\xa1tov\xe2\x80\x99s corps is joining up with\nthe main army and that Kut\xc3\xbazov has been appointed commander in chief. He\nis a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNapoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the\nman to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped\noff, and an hour later, Lavr\xc3\xbashka, the serf Den\xc3\xadsov had handed over\nto Rost\xc3\xb3v, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly\xe2\x80\x99s jacket and on a French\ncavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride\nby his side and began questioning him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a Cossack?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a Cossack, your Honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s plain\nappearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind\nthe presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the\nincidents of the war,\xe2\x80\x9d says Thiers, narrating this episode. In\nreality Lavr\xc3\xbashka, having got drunk the day before and left his master\ndinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of\nchickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him prisoner.\nLavr\xc3\xbashka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who have seen all\nsorts of things, consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and\ncunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master,\nand are keen at guessing their master\xe2\x80\x99s baser impulses, especially those\nprompted by vanity and pettiness.\n\nFinding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had easily\nand surely recognized, Lavr\xc3\xbashka was not in the least abashed but merely\ndid his utmost to gain his new master\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\n\nHe knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s presence could\nno more intimidate him than Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s, or a sergeant major\xe2\x80\x99s with the\nrods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major\nor Napoleon could deprive him of.\n\nSo he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the\norderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the\nRussians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavr\xc3\xbashka screwed up\nhis eyes and considered.\n\nIn this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning\nin everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cif there\xe2\x80\x99s a battle soon, yours\nwill win. That\xe2\x80\x99s right. But if three days pass, then after that, well,\nthen that same battle will not soon be over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLelorgne d\xe2\x80\x99Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf a battle takes place within the next three days the French will\nwin, but if later, God knows what will happen.\xe2\x80\x9d Napoleon did not smile,\nthough he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words\nto be repeated.\n\nLavr\xc3\xbashka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending not to\nknow who Napoleon was, added:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the\nworld, but we are a different matter...\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94without knowing why or how this\nbit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.\n\nThe interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, and\nBonaparte smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cThe young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor\nsmile,\xe2\x80\x9d says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence, Napoleon\nturned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was\ntalking to the Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who had written his\nimmortally victorious name on the Pyramids, would affect this enfant du\nDon. *\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cChild of the Don.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavr\xc3\xbashka.\n\nLavr\xc3\xbashka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and that\nNapoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters\npromptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes\nwide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be\nwhipped. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s interpreter had spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d says Thiers,\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word, but rode\non, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across\nthe steppes of the East. All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and\nreplaced by a na\xc3\xafve and silent feeling of admiration. Napoleon, after\nmaking the Cossack a present, had him set free like a bird restored to\nits native fields.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNapoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his\nimagination, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe bird restored to its native fields\xe2\x80\x9d galloped to\nour outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that\nhe meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place he did\nnot wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling. He\nfound the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating with Pl\xc3\xa1tov\xe2\x80\x99s\ndetachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v, quartered\nat Yank\xc3\xb3vo. Rost\xc3\xb3v was just mounting to go for a ride round the\nneighboring villages with Ily\xc3\xadn; he let Lavr\xc3\xbashka have another horse and\ntook him along with him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nPrincess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew\nsupposed.\n\nAfter the return of Alp\xc3\xa1tych from Smol\xc3\xa9nsk the old prince suddenly\nseemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called\nup from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in\nchief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the\nlast extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s\ndiscretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where\none of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he\nannounced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills.\n\nBut while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of\nthe princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo and\nthence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her father\xe2\x80\x99s feverish and\nsleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to\nleave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey\nhim. She refused to go away and her father\xe2\x80\x99s fury broke over her in a\nterrible storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on\nher. Trying to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused\nhis quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making\nit the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove her from\nhis study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same\nto him. He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and\nwarned her not to dare to let him see her. The fact that he did not, as\nshe had feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her\nnot to let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof\nthat in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and\nhad not gone away.\n\nThe morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned his\nfull uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His cal\xc3\xa8che\nwas already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in\nhis uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his\narmed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window listening to\nhis voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly several men came\nrunning up the avenue with frightened faces.\n\nPrincess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path, and\ninto the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving\ntoward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by\nthe armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and\ndecorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that\nfell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,\ncould not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see\nwas that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one\nof timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his helpless\nlips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out what he\nwanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on the very\ncouch he had so feared of late.\n\nThe doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said that the\nprince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.\n\nIt was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and\nnext day they moved the prince to Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, the doctor accompanying\nhim.\n\nBy the time they reached Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, Dessalles and the little prince\nhad already left for Moscow.\n\nFor three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new\nhouse Prince Andrew had built at Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, ever in the same state,\ngetting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay like\na distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips\ntwitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was\ngoing on around him or not. One thing was certain\xe2\x80\x94that he was suffering\nand wished to say something. But what it was, no one could tell: it\nmight be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate\nto public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.\n\nThe doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due\nto physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell\nher something, and the fact that her presence always increased his\nrestlessness confirmed her opinion.\n\nHe was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was no\nhope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not do\nto let him die on the road. \xe2\x80\x9cWould it not be better if the end did come,\nthe very end?\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly\nsleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say, often watched\nhim not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find\nsymptoms of the approach of the end.\n\nStrange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet\nthere it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed with\nhim expecting something to happen), all the personal desires and hopes\nthat had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened. Thoughts\nthat had not entered her mind for years\xe2\x80\x94thoughts of a life free from\nthe fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and of family\nhappiness\xe2\x80\x94floated continually in her imagination like temptations of the\ndevil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions continually recurred\nto her as to how she would order her life now, after that. These were\ntemptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it. She knew that the\nsole weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray. She assumed\nan attitude of prayer, looked at the icons, repeated the words of a\nprayer, but she could not pray. She felt that a different world had\nnow taken possession of her\xe2\x80\x94the life of a world of strenuous and free\nactivity, quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she\nhad been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer.\nShe could not pray, could not weep, and worldly cares took possession of\nher.\n\nIt was becoming dangerous to remain in Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo. News of the approach\nof the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten miles from\nBoguch\xc3\xa1rovo, a homestead had been looted by French marauders.\n\nThe doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the\nprovincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary\nto persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of the\nrural police having come to Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo urged the same thing, saying\nthat the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that French\nproclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the princess\ndid not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could not answer\nfor the consequences.\n\nThe princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of preparation\nand giving orders, for which everyone came to her, occupied her all day.\nShe spent the night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in\nthe room next to the one where the prince lay. Several times, waking up,\nshe heard his groans and muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps\nof T\xc3\xadkhon and the doctor when they turned him over. Several times she\nlistened at the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were\nlouder than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not\nsleep and several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter\nbut not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw\nand knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him.\nShe had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she\nsometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in during\nthe night at an unusual hour would irritate him.\n\nBut never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing\nhim. She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his\nfound an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid these memories\ntemptations of the devil would surge into her imagination: thoughts of\nhow things would be after his death, and how her new, liberated life\nwould be ordered. But she drove these thoughts away with disgust. Toward\nmorning he became quiet and she fell asleep.\n\nShe woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her\nclearly what chiefly concerned her about her father\xe2\x80\x99s illness. On waking\nshe listened to what was going on behind the door and, hearing him\ngroan, said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!\xe2\x80\x9d she\ncried with a feeling of loathing for herself.\n\nShe washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In\nfront of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed\ninto the vehicles.\n\nIt was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch, still\nhorrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts\nbefore going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and went out to\nher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a little better today,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI was looking for you. One can\nmake out something of what he is saying. His head is clearer. Come in,\nhe is asking for you....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale\nand leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him, talk to\nhim, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with\nthose dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\n\nPrincess Mary entered her father\xe2\x80\x99s room and went up to his bed. He was\nlying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with\ntheir knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed\nstraight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips\nmotionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His face\nseemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown smaller.\nPrincess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand pressed hers\nso that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come. He\ntwitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered angrily.\n\nShe looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her. When\nshe changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he\ncalmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips\nand tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and\nimploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.\n\nStraining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic\nefforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with\ndifficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said something,\nrepeating the same words several times. She could not understand them,\nbut tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words\nhe uttered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMmm...ar...ate...ate...\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated several times.\n\nIt was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor thought\nhe had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cMary, are you afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe prince shook his head, again repeated the same sounds.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind, my mind aches?\xe2\x80\x9d questioned Princess Mary.\n\nHe made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and\nbegan pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find\nthe right place for it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways thoughts... about you... thoughts...\xe2\x80\x9d he then uttered much\nmore clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being\nunderstood.\n\nPrincess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide her sobs\nand tears.\n\nHe moved his hand over her hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been calling you all night...\xe2\x80\x9d he brought out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only I had known...\xe2\x80\x9d she said through her tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid to\ncome in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe pressed her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t you asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary, shaking her head.\n\nUnconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as\nhe did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move\nwith difficulty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear one... Dearest...\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary could not quite make out what he\nhad said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender\ncaressing word such as he had never used to her before. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\ncome in?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was wishing for his death!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary.\n\nHe was silent awhile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!... thank\nyou!... forgive!... thank you!...\xe2\x80\x9d and tears began to flow from his\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cCall Andrew!\xe2\x80\x9d he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression\nof doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.\n\nHe himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least it\nseemed to Princess Mary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a letter from him,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\n\nHe glanced at her with timid surprise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s with the army, Father, at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in\nanswer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and\nremembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, softly and distinctly. \xe2\x80\x9cRussia has perished. They\xe2\x80\x99ve\ndestroyed her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes. Princess Mary\ncould no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face.\n\nAgain he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes, and\nT\xc3\xadkhon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.\n\nThen he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could\nunderstand for a long time, till at last T\xc3\xadkhon understood and repeated\nit. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in\nwhich he had just been speaking. She thought he was speaking of Russia,\nor Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or of his own death, and\nso she could not guess his words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut on your white dress. I like it,\xe2\x80\x9d was what he said.\n\nHaving understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the doctor\ntaking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and trying to\npersuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the\nprince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the\nEmperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice, and\nthen he had a second and final stroke.\n\nPrincess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot and\nsunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel nothing,\nexcept passionate love for her father, love such as she thought she had\nnever felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing into the garden and as\nfar as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had\nplanted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end\nquicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me? What\nuse will peace be when he is no longer here?\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary murmured,\npacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom\nwhich heaved with convulsive sobs.\n\nWhen she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her\nagain to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x94who had remained\nat Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo and did not wish to leave it\xe2\x80\x94coming toward her with a\nstranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who\nhad come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her\nprompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding him; she\nled him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then,\nexcusing herself, she went to the door of the old prince\xe2\x80\x99s room. The\ndoctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away, Princess! Go away... go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the\nslope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know how\nlong she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\nfootsteps running along the path. She rose and saw Duny\xc3\xa1sha her maid,\nwho was evidently looking for her, and who stopped suddenly as if in\nalarm on seeing her mistress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease come, Princess... The Prince,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duny\xc3\xa1sha in a breaking\nvoice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmediately, I\xe2\x80\x99m coming, I\xe2\x80\x99m coming!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the princess hurriedly,\nnot giving Duny\xc3\xa1sha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to\navoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess, it\xe2\x80\x99s God\xe2\x80\x99s will! You must be prepared for everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe Marshal, meeting her at the house door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alone; it\xe2\x80\x99s not true!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried angrily to him.\n\nThe doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s door. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are these people with frightened faces stopping me?\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any of them! And what are they doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\nShe opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened\nroom startled her. In the room were her nurse and other women. They all\ndrew back from the bed, making way for her. He was still lying on the\nbed as before, but the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess\nMary stop short on the threshold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s not dead\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d she told herself and approached\nhim, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed her lips\nto his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force of the\ntenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was\nreplaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\nis no more! He is not, but here where he was is something unfamiliar and\nhostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!\xe2\x80\x9d And hiding\nher face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor,\nwho held her up.\n\n\nIn the presence of T\xc3\xadkhon and the doctor the women washed what had been\nthe prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should\nnot stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied together the\nlegs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed him in uniform\nwith his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table.\nHeaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but it all got done\nas if of its own accord. Toward night candles were burning round his\ncoffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was strewn with sprays of\njuniper, a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head, and in a\ncorner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms.\n\nJust as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the\ninmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round\nthe coffin\xe2\x80\x94the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women\xe2\x80\x94and all with\nfixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old\nprince\xe2\x80\x99s cold and stiffened hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nUntil Prince Andrew settled in Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo its owners had always been\nabsentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character from\nthose of Bald Hills. They differed from them in speech, dress, and\ndisposition. They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used to\napprove of them for their endurance at work when they came to Bald Hills\nto help with the harvest, or to dig ponds and ditches, but he disliked\nthem for their boorishness.\n\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s last stay at Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, when he introduced hospitals\nand schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay, had not\nsoftened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in\nthem the traits of character the old prince called boorishness. Various\nobscure rumors were always current among them: at one time a rumor that\nthey would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at another of a new religion to\nwhich they were all to be converted; then of some proclamation of the\nTsar\xe2\x80\x99s and of an oath to the Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which\nit was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had\nstopped it), then of Peter F\xc3\xabdorovich\xe2\x80\x99s return to the throne in seven\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 time, when everything would be made free and so \xe2\x80\x9csimple\xe2\x80\x9d that\nthere would be no restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and\nhis invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague\nnotions of Antichrist, the end of the world, and \xe2\x80\x9cpure freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the vicinity of Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo were large villages belonging to the\ncrown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they\npleased. There were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood\nand also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in the lives of the\npeasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of\nthe Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to\ncontemporaries, were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among\nothers. One instance, which had occurred some twenty years before, was\na movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown \xe2\x80\x9cwarm rivers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHundreds of peasants, among them the Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo folk, suddenly began\nselling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast.\nAs birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea, so these men with their\nwives and children streamed to the southeast, to parts where none of\nthem had ever been. They set off in caravans, bought their freedom one\nby one or ran away, and drove or walked toward the \xe2\x80\x9cwarm rivers.\xe2\x80\x9d Many\nof them were punished, some sent to Siberia, many died of cold and\nhunger on the road, many returned of their own accord, and the movement\ndied down of itself just as it had sprung up, without apparent reason.\nBut such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new\nforces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and\nat the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone\nliving in close touch with these people it was apparent that these\nundercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych, who had reached Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo shortly before the old prince\xe2\x80\x99s\ndeath, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contrary to\nwhat was happening in the Bald Hills district, where over a radius of\nforty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages\nto be devastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe region\nround Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo were, it was rumored, in touch with the French,\nreceived leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand, and did not\nmigrate. He learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant\nKarp, who possessed great influence in the village commune and had\nrecently been away driving a government transport, had returned with\nnews that the Cossacks were destroying deserted villages, but that the\nFrench did not harm them. Alp\xc3\xa1tych also knew that on the previous day\nanother peasant had even brought from the village of Vislo\xc3\xbakhovo, which\nwas occupied by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no\nharm would be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would\nbe paid for anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had\nbrought from Vislo\xc3\xbakhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that\nthey were false) paid to him in advance for hay.\n\nMore important still, Alp\xc3\xa1tych learned that on the morning of the\nvery day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the\nprincess\xe2\x80\x99 luggage from Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, there had been a village meeting at\nwhich it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no\ntime to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old prince\xe2\x80\x99s death,\nthe Marshal had insisted on Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s leaving at once, as it was\nbecoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he could\nnot be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of the day the\nold prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return next day for\nthe funeral. But this he was unable to do, for he received tidings that\nthe French had unexpectedly advanced, and had barely time to remove his\nown family and valuables from his estate.\n\nFor some thirty years Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo had been managed by the village Elder,\nDron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive \xe2\x80\x9cDr\xc3\xb3nushka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow\nbig beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they\nare sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as\nstraight and strong at sixty as at thirty.\n\nSoon after the migration to the \xe2\x80\x9cwarm rivers,\xe2\x80\x9d in which he had taken\npart like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of\nBoguch\xc3\xa1rovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for\ntwenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their\nmaster. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the steward\nrespected him and jestingly called him \xe2\x80\x9cthe Minister.\xe2\x80\x9d During the\nwhole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill, never after\nsleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue,\nand though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money\naccount or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless\ncartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of the whole corn\ncrop on any single acre of the Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo fields.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for his\nDron on the day of the prince\xe2\x80\x99s funeral and told him to have twelve\nhorses got ready for the princess\xe2\x80\x99 carriages and eighteen carts for\nthe things to be removed from Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo. Though the peasants paid\nquitrent, Alp\xc3\xa1tych thought no difficulty would be made about complying\nwith this order, for there were two hundred and thirty households at\nwork in Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo and the peasants were well to do. But on hearing the\norder Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent. Alp\xc3\xa1tych named certain\npeasants he knew, from whom he told him to take the carts.\n\nDron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting.\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no horses\navailable: some horses were carting for the government, others were too\nweak, and others had died for want of fodder. It seemed that no horses\ncould be had even for the carriages, much less for the carting.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a model\nvillage Elder, so Alp\xc3\xa1tych had not managed the prince\xe2\x80\x99s estates for\ntwenty years in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in the highest\ndegree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt\nwith. Having glanced at Dron he at once understood that his answers did\nnot express his personal views but the general mood of the Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo\ncommune, by which the Elder had already been carried away. But he also\nknew that Dron, who had acquired property and was hated by the commune,\nmust be hesitating between the two camps: the masters\xe2\x80\x99 and the serfs\xe2\x80\x99.\nHe noticed this hesitation in Dron\xe2\x80\x99s look and therefore frowned and\nmoved closer up to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow just listen, Dr\xc3\xb3nushka,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense to me. His\nexcellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people\naway and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order from the\nTsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you\nhear?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear,\xe2\x80\x9d Dron answered without lifting his eyes.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych was not satisfied with this reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Dron, it will turn out badly!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shaking his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe power is in your hands,\xe2\x80\x9d Dron rejoined sadly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Dron, drop it!\xe2\x80\x9d Alp\xc3\xa1tych repeated, withdrawing his hand from his\nbosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron\xe2\x80\x99s feet. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see\nthrough you and three yards into the ground under you,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\ngazing at the floor in front of Dron.\n\nDron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alp\xc3\xa1tych and again lowered\nhis eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their\nhomes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning\nfor the princess\xe2\x80\x99 things. And don\xe2\x80\x99t go to any meeting yourself, do you\nhear?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDron suddenly fell on his knees.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cY\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge me,\nfor Christ\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Alp\xc3\xa1tych sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cI see through you and three yards\nunder you,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his\nknowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had\nbeen able to retain the old prince\xe2\x80\x99s favor for twenty years had long\nsince gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of\nseeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.\n\nDron got up and was about to say something, but Alp\xc3\xa1tych interrupted\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you thinking\nof, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do with the people?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dron. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re quite beside\nthemselves; I have already told them...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Told them,\xe2\x80\x99 I dare say!\xe2\x80\x9d said Alp\xc3\xa1tych. \xe2\x80\x9cAre they drinking?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\nabruptly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite beside themselves, Y\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych; they\xe2\x80\x99ve fetched another\nbarrel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, listen! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the police officer, and you tell them\nso, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time\nand knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion\nthat they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive \xe2\x80\x9cI understand\xe2\x80\x9d\nfrom Dron, Alp\xc3\xa1tych contented himself with that, though he not only\ndoubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the\ncarts would not be forthcoming.\n\nAnd so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. In the\nvillage, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being held, which\ndecided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the\ncarts should not be provided. Without saying anything of this to the\nprincess, Alp\xc3\xa1tych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which\nhad arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for\nthe princess\xe2\x80\x99 carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police\nauthorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nAfter her father\xe2\x80\x99s funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and\ndid not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alp\xc3\xa1tych was\nasking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with\nDron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been\nlying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go\naway and begged to be left in peace.\n\nThe windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. She\nlay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the\nleather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused\nthoughts were centered on one subject\xe2\x80\x94the irrevocability of death and\nher own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had\nshown itself during her father\xe2\x80\x99s illness. She wished to pray but did not\ndare to, dared not in her present state of mind address herself to God.\nShe lay for a long time in that position.\n\nThe sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays\nshone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco\ncushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of her thoughts\nsuddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her hair, got up,\nand went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the\nclear but windy evening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will\nhinder you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her\nhead fall on the window sill.\n\nSomeone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and\nkissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black\ndress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed\nher, and immediately began to cry. The princess looked up at her. All\ntheir former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind.\nBut she remembered too how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle\nBourienne and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were\nthe reproaches Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\nis it for me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nthought.\n\nPrincess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of Mademoiselle\nBourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but who yet was\ndependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry for her\nand held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry. Mademoiselle\nBourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand, speaking of\nthe princess\xe2\x80\x99 sorrow and making herself a partner in it. She said her\nonly consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her\nsorrow, that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but\nthis great grief; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone,\nand that he, from above, saw her affection and gratitude. The princess\nheard her, not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and\nlistening to the sound of her voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour position is doubly terrible, dear princess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle\nBourienne after a pause. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand that you could not, and cannot,\nthink of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\nPrincess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go or\nwhere to. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it not\nall the same?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, and did not reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, ch\xc3\xa8re Marie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle Bourienne, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are in\ndanger\xe2\x80\x94are surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move now.\nIf we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God knows...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was\ntalking about.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I would on no account wish to go away from him.... Alp\xc3\xa1tych\ndid say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do nothing,\nnothing, and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow,\nbut I think it would now be better to stay here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle\nBourienne. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause, you will agree, ch\xc3\xa8re Marie, to fall into the hands\nof the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not\nprinted on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau\xe2\x80\x99s, telling people\nnot to leave their homes and that the French authorities would afford\nthem proper protection. She handed this to the princess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be best to appeal to that general,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I am sure that all due respect would be shown you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled\nsobs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom whom did you get this?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey probably recognized that I am French, by my name,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nMademoiselle Bourienne blushing.\n\nPrincess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and with\na pale face went out of the room and into what had been Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\nstudy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuny\xc3\xa1sha, send Alp\xc3\xa1tych, or Dr\xc3\xb3nushka, or somebody to me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, hearing\nMademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must go at once, at once!\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\nappalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French! That\nI, the daughter of Prince Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, asked General Rameau for\nprotection and accepted his favor!\xe2\x80\x9d This idea horrified her, made her\nshudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never\nexperienced before. All that was distressing, and especially all that\nwas humiliating, in her position rose vividly to her mind. \xe2\x80\x9cThey, the\nFrench, would settle in this house: M. le G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9ral Rameau would occupy\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s study and amuse himself by looking through and reading\nhis letters and papers. Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of\nBoguch\xc3\xa1rovo for him. I should be given a small room as a favor, the\nsoldiers would violate my father\xe2\x80\x99s newly dug grave to steal his crosses\nand stars, they would tell me of their victories over the Russians, and\nwould pretend to sympathize with my sorrow...\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary,\nnot thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father\nand her brother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what\nhappened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead\nfather and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their thoughts\nand felt their feelings. What they would have said and what they would\nhave done she felt bound to say and do. She went into Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\nstudy, trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her\nposition.\n\nThe demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her father\xe2\x80\x99s\ndeath, all at once rose before her with a new, previously unknown force\nand took possession of her.\n\nAgitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael\nIv\xc3\xa1novich and now for T\xc3\xadkhon or Dron. Duny\xc3\xa1sha, the nurse, and the other\nmaids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s statement was\ncorrect. Alp\xc3\xa1tych was not at home, he had gone to the police. Neither\ncould the architect Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich, who on being sent for came in\nwith sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With just the same smile\nof agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to\nanswer the old prince without expressing views of his own, he now\nreplied to Princess Mary, so that nothing definite could be got from his\nanswers. The old valet T\xc3\xadkhon, with sunken, emaciated face that bore the\nstamp of inconsolable grief, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Princess\xe2\x80\x9d to all Princess\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her.\n\nAt length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a deep bow\nto Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.\n\nPrincess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr\xc3\xb3nushka,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, regarding as a sure friend this Dr\xc3\xb3nushka who\nalways used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the\nfair at Vy\xc3\xa1zma every year and smilingly offer it to her, \xe2\x80\x9cDr\xc3\xb3nushka, now\nsince our misfortune...\xe2\x80\x9d she began, but could not go on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all in God\xe2\x80\x99s hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a sigh.\n\nThey were silent for a while.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr\xc3\xb3nushka, Alp\xc3\xa1tych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to turn\nto. Is it true, as they tell me, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t even go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you go away, your excellency? You can go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dron.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend, I\ncan do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go away\ntonight or early tomorrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no\nhorses; I told Y\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are there none?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the princess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all God\xe2\x80\x99s scourge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dron. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat horses we had have been\ntaken for the army or have died\xe2\x80\x94this is such a year! It\xe2\x80\x99s not a case of\nfeeding horses\xe2\x80\x94we may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some go three\ndays without eating. We\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been ruined.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe peasants are ruined? They have no bread?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re dying of hunger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dron. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a case of carting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me, Dr\xc3\xb3nushka? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible to help them?\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do all I can....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow\nwas filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich\ncould refrain from helping the poor. She had heard vaguely that there\nwas such a thing as \xe2\x80\x9clandlord\xe2\x80\x99s corn\xe2\x80\x9d which was sometimes given to the\npeasants. She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would\nrefuse to help the peasants in need, she only feared to make some\nmistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to\ngive. She was glad such cares presented themselves, enabling her\nwithout scruple to forget her own grief. She began asking Dron about the\npeasants\xe2\x80\x99 needs and what there was in Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo that belonged to the\nlandlord.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we have grain belonging to my brother?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe landlord\xe2\x80\x99s grain is all safe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dron proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cOur prince\ndid not order it to be sold.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you leave\nin my brother\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\nDron made no answer but sighed deeply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all. I\ngive this order in my brother\xe2\x80\x99s name; and tell them that what is ours is\ntheirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDischarge me, little mother, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Order the keys to be taken\nfrom me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI have served twenty-three years and have done no\nwrong. Discharge me, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was\nasking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his\ndevotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the\npeasants.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nAn hour later Duny\xc3\xa1sha came to tell the princess that Dron had come, and\nall the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess\xe2\x80\x99 order and\nwished to have word with their mistress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I never told them to come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI only told Dron\nto let them have the grain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and don\xe2\x80\x99t go\nout to them. It\xe2\x80\x99s all a trick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Duny\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9cand when Y\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych\nreturns let us get away... and please don\xe2\x80\x99t...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a trick?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Princess Mary in surprise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it is, only listen to me for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Ask nurse too. They say\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t agree to leave Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo as you ordered.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrincess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cCall Dr\xc3\xb3nushka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDron came and confirmed Duny\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s words; the peasants had come by the\nprincess\xe2\x80\x99 order.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I never sent for them,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the princess. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have given\nmy message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the grain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDron only sighed in reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you order it they will go away,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary, and in spite of\nthe nurse\xe2\x80\x99s and Duny\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s protests she went out into the porch; Dron,\nDuny\xc3\xa1sha, the nurse, and Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich following her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to\nremain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the\nFrench,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI will offer them monthly rations and\nhousing at our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in\nmy place,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd\nstanding on the pasture by the barn.\n\nThe men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their\nhats. Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt, came\nclose up to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were fixed\non her, and there were so many different faces, that she could not\ndistinguish any of them and, feeling that she must speak to them all\nat once, did not know how to do it. But again the sense that she\nrepresented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she boldly\nbegan her speech.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad you have come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said without raising her eyes, and\nfeeling her heart beating quickly and violently. \xe2\x80\x9cDr\xc3\xb3nushka tells me\nthat the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune, and I\nshall grudge nothing to help you. I am myself going away because it\nis dangerous here... the enemy is near... because... I am giving you\neverything, my friends, and I beg you to take everything, all our grain,\nso that you may not suffer want! And if you have been told that I am\ngiving you the grain to keep you here\xe2\x80\x94that is not true. On the contrary,\nI ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow, and\nI promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for nothing.\nYou shall be given food and lodging.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not doing this on my own account,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI do it in the\nname of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my brother\nand his son.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain she paused. No one broke the silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOurs is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that is\nmine is yours,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, scanning the faces before her.\n\nAll eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She\ncould not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or\napprehension and distrust\xe2\x80\x94but the expression on all the faces was\nidentical.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all very thankful for your bounty, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t do for us to\ntake the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s grain,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice at the back of the crowd.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the princess.\n\nNo one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd, found that\nevery eye she met now was immediately dropped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to take it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked again.\n\nNo one answered.\n\nThe silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch\nsomeone\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired of a very old man who stood just\nin front of her leaning on his stick. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you think something more is\nwanted, tell me! I will do anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, catching his eye.\n\nBut as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we agree? We don\xe2\x80\x99t want the grain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we give up everything? We don\xe2\x80\x99t agree. Don\xe2\x80\x99t agree.... We\nare sorry for you, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not willing. Go away yourself, alone...\xe2\x80\x9d\ncame from various sides of the crowd.\n\nAnd again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression,\nthough now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude,\nbut of angry resolve.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t have understood me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary with a sad smile.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to go? I promise to house and feed you, while here\nthe enemy would ruin you....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not willing. Let them ruin us! We won\xe2\x80\x99t take your grain. We don\xe2\x80\x99t\nagree.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain Princess Mary tried to catch someone\xe2\x80\x99s eye, but not a single eye\nin the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying to avoid\nher look. She felt strange and awkward.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your houses\nand go into bondage! I dare say! \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you grain, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 she\nsays,\xe2\x80\x9d voices in the crowd were heard saying.\n\nWith drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the\nhouse. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her\ndeparture next morning, she went to her room and remained alone with her\nown thoughts.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nFor a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her\nroom hearing the sound of the peasants\xe2\x80\x99 voices that reached her from\nthe village, but it was not of them she was thinking. She felt that she\ncould not understand them however much she might think about them. She\nthought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after the break caused\nby cares for the present, seemed already to belong to the past. Now she\ncould remember it and weep or pray.\n\nAfter sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh. Toward\nmidnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full moon began\nto show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to\nrise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.\n\nPictures of the near past\xe2\x80\x94her father\xe2\x80\x99s illness and last moments\xe2\x80\x94rose\none after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now lingered\nover these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the\npicture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in\nimagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these pictures\npresented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they\nseemed now present, now past, and now future.\n\nShe vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was\nbeing dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills,\nmuttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray\neyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had always thought what he said then.\xe2\x80\x9d And she recalled in\nall its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke,\nwhen with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his\nwill. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going\nto the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened\nat the door. In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to\nT\xc3\xadkhon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the Empress.\nEvidently he had wanted to talk. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he call me? Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhe let me be there instead of T\xc3\xadkhon?\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary had thought and\nthought again now. \xe2\x80\x9cNow he will never tell anyone what he had in his\nsoul. Never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have\nsaid all he longed to say, and not T\xc3\xadkhon but I might have heard and\nunderstood him. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I enter the room?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\nwould then have said to me what he said the day he died. While talking\nto T\xc3\xadkhon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, and I was\nstanding close by, outside the door. It was sad and painful for him\nto talk to T\xc3\xadkhon who did not understand him. I remember how he began\nspeaking to him about Lise as if she were alive\xe2\x80\x94he had forgotten she\nwas dead\xe2\x80\x94and T\xc3\xadkhon reminded him that she was no more, and he shouted,\n\xe2\x80\x98Fool!\xe2\x80\x99 He was greatly depressed. From behind the door I heard how he\nlay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98My God!\xe2\x80\x99 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nI go in then? What could he have done to me? What could I have lost? And\nperhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word\nto me.\xe2\x80\x9d And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said\nto her on the day of his death. \xe2\x80\x9cDear-est!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, and began\nsobbing, with tears that relieved her soul. She now saw his face before\nher. And not the face she had known ever since she could remember and\nhad always seen at a distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen\nfor the first time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details,\nwhen she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear-est!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she\nsaw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay\nin his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief. And the\nhorror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself\nthat that was not he, but something mysterious and horrible, seized her\nagain. She tried to think of something else and to pray, but could do\nneither. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows,\nexpecting every moment to see his dead face, and she felt that the\nsilence brooding over the house and within it held her fast.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuny\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cDuny\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed wildly, and tearing\nherself out of this silence she ran to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 quarters to meet\nher old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nOn the seventeenth of August Rost\xc3\xb3v and Ily\xc3\xadn, accompanied by Lavr\xc3\xbashka\nwho had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly, left\ntheir quarters at Yank\xc3\xb3vo, ten miles from Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, and went for a\nride\xe2\x80\x94to try a new horse Ily\xc3\xadn had bought and to find out whether there\nwas any hay to be had in the villages.\n\nFor the last three days Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo had lain between the two hostile\narmies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as\nfor the French vanguard; Rost\xc3\xb3v, as a careful squadron commander, wished\nto take such provisions as remained at Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo before the French\ncould get them.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v and Ily\xc3\xadn were in the merriest of moods. On the way to\nBoguch\xc3\xa1rovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where\nthey hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they questioned\nLavr\xc3\xbashka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one\nanother to try Ily\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s horse.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of\nthat very Bolk\xc3\xb3nski who had been engaged to his sister.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v and Ily\xc3\xadn gave rein to their horses for a last race along the\nincline before reaching Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, and Rost\xc3\xb3v, outstripping Ily\xc3\xadn, was\nthe first to gallop into the village street.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re first!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ily\xc3\xadn, flushed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, always first both on the grassland and here,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rost\xc3\xb3v,\nstroking his heated Don\xc3\xa9ts horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99d have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lavr\xc3\xbashka\nfrom behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, \xe2\x80\x9conly I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to\nmortify you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants was\nstanding.\n\nSome of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals\nwithout doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces\nand scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and\nsinging some incoherent song, and approached the officers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any hay here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how like one another,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ily\xc3\xadn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!\xe2\x80\x9d sang one of the peasants with a\nblissful smile.\n\nOne of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho do you belong to?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe French,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ily\xc3\xadn jestingly, \xe2\x80\x9cand here is Napoleon\nhimself\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he pointed to Lavr\xc3\xbashka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are Russians?\xe2\x80\x9d the peasant asked again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is there a large force of you here?\xe2\x80\x9d said another, a short man,\ncoming up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery large,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why have you collected here?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it a holiday?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nthe peasant, moving away.\n\nAt that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and a\nman in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one in pink is mine, so keep off!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ily\xc3\xadn on seeing Duny\xc3\xa1sha\nrunning resolutely toward him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be ours!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lavr\xc3\xbashka to Ily\xc3\xadn, winking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, my pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d said Ily\xc3\xadn with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Count Rost\xc3\xb3v, squadron commander, and I am your humble\nservant.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCo-o-om-pa-ny!\xe2\x80\x9d roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as\nhe looked at Ily\xc3\xadn talking to the girl. Following Duny\xc3\xa1sha, Alp\xc3\xa1tych\nadvanced to Rost\xc3\xb3v, having bared his head while still at a distance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I make bold to trouble your honor?\xe2\x80\x9d said he respectfully, but with\na shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand\nthrust into his bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince\nNicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding\nherself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\npointed to the peasants\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9casks you to come up to the house.... Won\xe2\x80\x99t\nyou, please, ride on a little farther,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alp\xc3\xa1tych with a melancholy\nsmile, \xe2\x80\x9cas it is not convenient in the presence of...?\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to\nthe two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!... Alp\xc3\xa1tych... Ah, Y\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych... Grand! Forgive us for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s\nsake, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr perhaps they amuse your honor?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Alp\xc3\xa1tych with a staid air,\nas he pointed at the old men with his free hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much to be amused at here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, and rode on a\nlittle way. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don\xe2\x80\x99t\nwish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her\nhorses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her\nexcellency cannot get away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honor to report to you the actual truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alp\xc3\xa1tych.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alp\xc3\xa1tych\nto the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared\nthat the princess\xe2\x80\x99 offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and\nher talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect\nthat Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had\nnot appeared when Alp\xc3\xa1tych sent for him; and that in the morning when\nthe princess gave orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had\ncome in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let\nher leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that\nthey would unharness the horses. Alp\xc3\xa1tych had gone out to admonish them,\nbut was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing\nhimself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that\nthere was an order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would\nserve her as before and obey her in everything.\n\nAt the moment when Rost\xc3\xb3v and Ily\xc3\xadn were galloping along the road,\nPrincess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alp\xc3\xa1tych, her nurse, and the\nmaids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the\ncavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran\naway, and the women in the house began to wail.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather! Benefactor! God has sent you!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed deeply moved voices as\nRost\xc3\xb3v passed through the anteroom.\n\nPrincess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting\nroom, when Rost\xc3\xb3v was shown in. She could not grasp who he was and why\nhe had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian\nface, and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a\nman of her own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and\nbegan speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This\nmeeting immediately struck Rost\xc3\xb3v as a romantic event. \xe2\x80\x9cA helpless girl\noverwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants!\nAnd what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there\nare in her features and expression!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he as he looked at her and\nlistened to her timid story.\n\nWhen she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, her voice trembled. She turned away, and then, as if\nfearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at\nhim with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s\neyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that\nradiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride here\nand am able to show my readiness to serve you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cGo\nwhen you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare\nto cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward\nthe door.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would\nconsider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to\ntake advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.\n\nPrincess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very, very grateful to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in French, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I hope it\nwas all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.\xe2\x80\x9d She\nsuddenly began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, is she pretty? Ah, friend\xe2\x80\x94my pink one is delicious; her name is\nDuny\xc3\xa1sha....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut on glancing at Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s face Ily\xc3\xadn stopped short. He saw that his\nhero and commander was following quite a different train of thought.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v glanced angrily at Ily\xc3\xadn and without replying strode off with\nrapid steps to the village.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show them; I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to them, the brigands!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to\nhimself.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with\nhim with difficulty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat decision have you been pleased to come to?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecision? What decision? Old dotard!...\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been\nabout? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t manage them? You\xe2\x80\x99re\na traitor yourself! I know you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll flay you all alive!...\xe2\x80\x9d And as if\nafraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alp\xc3\xa1tych and went rapidly\nforward. Alp\xc3\xa1tych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with\nRost\xc3\xb3v at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said\nthe peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be\nimprudent to \xe2\x80\x9coverresist\xe2\x80\x9d them without an armed force, and would it not\nbe better first to send for the military?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give them armed force... I\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x98overresist\xe2\x80\x99 them!\xe2\x80\x9d uttered Rost\xc3\xb3v\nmeaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to\nvent it.\n\nWithout considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick,\nresolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it the more\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results.\nThe peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw\nRost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.\n\nAfter the hussars had come to the village and Rost\xc3\xb3v had gone to see the\nprincess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd.\nSome of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and\nmight take it amiss that the mistress was being detained. Dron was of\nthis opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked\ntheir ex-Elder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many years have you been fattening on the commune?\xe2\x80\x9d Karp shouted at\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all one to you! You\xe2\x80\x99ll dig up your pot of money and take\nit away with you.... What does it matter to you whether our homes are\nruined or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their homes\nor take away a single grain, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all about it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was your son\xe2\x80\x99s turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You begrudged\nyour lump of a son,\xe2\x80\x9d a little old man suddenly began attacking Dron\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand\nso they took my V\xc3\xa1nka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all have to\ndie.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, we all have to die. I\xe2\x80\x99m not against the commune,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nDron.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94not against it! You\xe2\x80\x99ve filled your belly....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rost\xc3\xb3v, followed by\nIly\xc3\xadn, Lavr\xc3\xbashka, and Alp\xc3\xa1tych, came up to the crowd, Karp, thrusting\nhis fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked to the front.\nDron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer\ntogether.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is your Elder here? Hey?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Rost\xc3\xb3v, coming up to the crowd\nwith quick steps.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Elder? What do you want with him?...\xe2\x80\x9d asked Karp.\n\nBut before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off and a\nfierce blow jerked his head to one side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaps off, traitors!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Rost\xc3\xb3v in a wrathful voice. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the\nElder?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried furiously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakh\xc3\xa1rych, you!\xe2\x80\x9d meek and\nflustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to\ncome off their heads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t riot, we\xe2\x80\x99re following the orders,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Karp, and at that\nmoment several voices began speaking together.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as the old men have decided\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s too many of you giving\norders.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cArguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rost\xc3\xb3v unmeaningly in a\nvoice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. \xe2\x80\x9cBind him, bind him!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nshouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavr\xc3\xbashka and Alp\xc3\xa1tych.\n\nLavr\xc3\xbashka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from\nbehind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I call up our men from beyond the hill?\xe2\x80\x9d he called out.\n\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come\nand bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking\noff their belts.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the Elder?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Rost\xc3\xb3v in a loud voice.\n\nWith a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you the Elder? Bind him, Lavr\xc3\xbashka!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Rost\xc3\xb3v, as if that\norder, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.\n\nAnd in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own\nbelt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you all listen to me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v to the peasants. \xe2\x80\x9cBe off to your\nhouses at once, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let one of your voices be heard!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nall nonsense.... I said then that it was not in order,\xe2\x80\x9d voices were\nheard bickering with one another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! What did I say?\xe2\x80\x9d said Alp\xc3\xa1tych, coming into his own again. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\nwrong, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll our stupidity, Y\xc3\xa1kov Alp\xc3\xa1tych,\xe2\x80\x9d came the answers, and the crowd\nbegan at once to disperse through the village.\n\nThe two bound men were led off to the master\xe2\x80\x99s house. The two drunken\npeasants followed them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye, when I look at you!...\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them to Karp.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking of,\nyou fool?\xe2\x80\x9d added the other\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA real fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwo hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the\nBoguch\xc3\xa1rovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the\nproprietor\xe2\x80\x99s goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron, liberated at\nPrincess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s wish from the cupboard where he had been confined, was\nstanding in the yard directing the men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put it in so carelessly,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the peasants, a man with a\nround smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it has\ncost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord\nwhere it\xe2\x80\x99ll get rubbed? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that way of doing things. Let it\nall be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put it under the\nbast matting and cover it with hay\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the way!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, books, books!\xe2\x80\x9d said another peasant, bringing out Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\nlibrary cupboards. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t catch up against it! It\xe2\x80\x99s heavy, lads\xe2\x80\x94solid\nbooks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they worked all day and didn\xe2\x80\x99t play!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the tall,\nround-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the\ndictionaries that were on the top.\n\n\nUnwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rost\xc3\xb3v did not go back to\nthe house but remained in the village awaiting her departure. When her\ncarriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied her eight\nmiles from Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo to where the road was occupied by our troops. At\nthe inn at Yank\xc3\xb3vo he respectfully took leave of her, for the first time\npermitting himself to kiss her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you speak so!\xe2\x80\x9d he blushingly replied to Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\nexpressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had\noccurred. \xe2\x80\x9cAny police officer would have done as much! If we had had\nonly peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nam only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance.\nGood-by, Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet\nyou again in happier circumstances. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make me blush,\nplease don\xe2\x80\x99t thank me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked\nhim with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and\ntenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him\nfor. On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he not been\nthere she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the\nFrench, and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger\nto save her, and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and\nnoble soul, able to understand her position and her sorrow. His kind,\nhonest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to\ncry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.\n\nWhen she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt\nher eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the strange\nquestion presented itself to her: did she love him?\n\nOn the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess\xe2\x80\x99 position was not\na cheerful one, Duny\xc3\xa1sha, who went with her in the carriage, more than\nonce noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at\nsomething with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, supposing I do love him?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary.\n\nAshamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in\nlove with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted herself\nwith the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not\nbe to blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she continued to\nthe end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for\nthe first and last time in her life.\n\nSometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his words,\nhappiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those moments that\nDuny\xc3\xa1sha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it not fate that brought him to Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, and at that very\nmoment?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that caused his sister to refuse my\nbrother?\xe2\x80\x9d And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence.\n\nThe impression the princess made on Rost\xc3\xb3v was a very agreeable one. To\nremember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of his\nadventure at Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, rallied him on having gone to look for hay\nand having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he grew\nangry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle\nPrincess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune,\nhad against his will more than once entered his head. For himself\npersonally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her\nhe would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s affairs in order, and would even\xe2\x80\x94he felt it\xe2\x80\x94ensure Princess\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s happiness.\n\nBut S\xc3\xb3nya? And his plighted word? That was why Rost\xc3\xb3v grew angry when he\nwas rallied about Princess Bolk\xc3\xb3nskaya.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nOn receiving command of the armies Kut\xc3\xbazov remembered Prince Andrew and\nsent an order for him to report at headquarters.\n\nPrince Andrew arrived at Ts\xc3\xa1revo-Zaym\xc3\xadshche on the very day and at the\nvery hour that Kut\xc3\xbazov was reviewing the troops for the first time. He\nstopped in the village at the priest\xe2\x80\x99s house in front of which stood the\ncommander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s carriage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate\nawaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now called Kut\xc3\xbazov. From the\nfield beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the\nroar of many voices shouting \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d to the new commander in chief.\nTwo orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces\nfrom Prince Andrew, availing themselves of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s absence and of the\nfine weather. A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick\nmustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince\nAndrew, inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and\nwhether he would soon be back.\n\nPrince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness\xe2\x80\x99 staff\nbut was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart\norderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in\nchief\xe2\x80\x99s orderly speaks to officers, replied:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? His Serene Highness? I expect he\xe2\x80\x99ll be here soon. What do you\nwant?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the\norderly\xe2\x80\x99s tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and\napproached Bolk\xc3\xb3nski with a slight bow. Bolk\xc3\xb3nski made room for him on\nthe bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re also waiting for the commander in chief?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say he\nweceives evewyone, thank God!... It\xe2\x80\x99s awful with those sausage eaters!\nErm\xc3\xb3lov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now p\xe2\x80\x99waps\nWussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what was\nhappening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in the\ncampaign?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had the pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cnot only of taking part in\nthe retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dear\xe2\x80\x94not to mention\nthe estate and home of my birth\xe2\x80\x94my father, who died of grief. I belong\nto the province of Smol\xc3\xa9nsk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh? You\xe2\x80\x99re Pwince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance! I\xe2\x80\x99m\nLieutenant Colonel Den\xc3\xadsov, better known as \xe2\x80\x98V\xc3\xa1ska,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov,\npressing Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s hand and looking into his face with a\nparticularly kindly attention. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said he sympathetically,\nand after a short pause added: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s Scythian warfare. It\xe2\x80\x99s all\nvewy well\xe2\x80\x94only not for those who get it in the neck. So you are Pwince\nAndwew Bolk\xc3\xb3nski?\xe2\x80\x9d He swayed his head. \xe2\x80\x9cVewy pleased, Pwince, to make\nyour acquaintance!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated again, smiling sadly, and he again\npressed Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\n\nPrince Andrew knew Den\xc3\xadsov from what Nat\xc3\xa1sha had told him of her first\nsuitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful\nfeelings of which he had not thought lately, but which still found\nplace in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and very serious\nimpressions\xe2\x80\x94such as the retreat from Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, his visit to Bald Hills,\nand the recent news of his father\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x94and had experienced so many\nemotions, that for a long time past those memories had not entered his\nmind, and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their\nformer strength. For Den\xc3\xadsov, too, the memories awakened by the name of\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after supper and\nafter Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen\nwithout realizing what he was doing. He smiled at the recollection of\nthat time and of his love for Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and passed at once to what now\ninterested him passionately and exclusively. This was a plan of campaign\nhe had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had\nproposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it\nto Kut\xc3\xbazov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line\nof operation was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or\nconcurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of the French,\nwe should attack their line of communication. He began explaining his\nplan to Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t hold all that line. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible. I will undertake to\nbweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s certain! There\xe2\x80\x99s only one way\xe2\x80\x94guewilla warfare!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the\narmy, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with music\nand songs and coming from the field where the review was held. Sounds of\nhoofs and shouts were nearing the village.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming! He\xe2\x80\x99s coming!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.\n\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski and Den\xc3\xadsov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers\n(a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kut\xc3\xbazov coming down the\nstreet mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of generals\nrode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and a crowd of\nofficers ran after and around them shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kut\xc3\xbazov was impatiently\nurging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he\nraised his hand to his white Horse Guard\xe2\x80\x99s cap with a red band and no\npeak, nodding his head continually. When he came up to the guard of\nhonor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who were\ngiving him the salute, he looked at them silently and attentively for\nnearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to\nthe crowd of generals and officers surrounding him. Suddenly his face\nassumed a subtle expression, he shrugged his shoulders with an air of\nperplexity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,\nGeneral,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and\nDen\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah! hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted those behind him.\n\nSince Prince Andrew had last seen him Kut\xc3\xbazov had grown still more\ncorpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and the\nfamiliar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was wearing\nthe white Horse Guard\xe2\x80\x99s cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging\nover his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and swayed limply on\nhis brisk little horse.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew... whew... whew!\xe2\x80\x9d he whistled just audibly as he rode into the\nyard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who\nmeans to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the stirrup\nand, lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the\neffort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned on his knee,\ngroaned, and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants\nwho stood ready to assist him.\n\nHe pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes, glanced\nat Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved with his\nwaddling gait to the porch. \xe2\x80\x9cWhew... whew... whew!\xe2\x80\x9d he whistled, and\nagain glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, it was\nonly after some seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\nface linked itself up with Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s remembrance of his personality.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come\nalong...\xe2\x80\x9d said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the porch\nwhich creaked under his weight.\n\nHe unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\xe2\x80\x99s your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI received news of his death, yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew\nabruptly.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off\nhis cap and crossed himself:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay the kingdom of Heaven be his! God\xe2\x80\x99s will be done to us all!\xe2\x80\x9d He\nsighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nloved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for some\ntime did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw that\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He\nsighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! Come with me, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nBut at that moment Den\xc3\xadsov, no more intimidated by his superiors than by\nthe enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch, despite\nthe angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him. Kut\xc3\xbazov, his\nhands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly. Den\xc3\xadsov, having\ngiven his name, announced that he had to communicate to his Serene\nHighness a matter of great importance for their country\xe2\x80\x99s welfare.\nKut\xc3\xbazov looked wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of\nannoyance, folded them across his stomach, repeating the words: \xe2\x80\x9cFor our\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov blushed like a\ngirl (it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous,\ntime-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the\nenemy\xe2\x80\x99s lines of communication between Smol\xc3\xa9nsk and Vy\xc3\xa1zma. Den\xc3\xadsov came\nfrom those parts and knew the country well. His plan seemed decidedly\na good one, especially from the strength of conviction with which he\nspoke. Kut\xc3\xbazov looked down at his own legs, occasionally glancing at the\ndoor of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge\nfrom it. And from that hut, while Den\xc3\xadsov was speaking, a general with a\nportfolio under his arm really did appear.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov, in the midst of Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s explanations, \xe2\x80\x9care you\nready so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReady, your Serene Highness,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the general.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov swayed his head, as much as to say: \xe2\x80\x9cHow is one man to deal with\nit all?\xe2\x80\x9d and again listened to Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I\ncan bweak Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s line of communication!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat relation are you to Intendant General Kir\xc3\xadl Andr\xc3\xa9evich Den\xc3\xadsov?\xe2\x80\x9d\nasked Kut\xc3\xbazov, interrupting him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, we were friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right,\nfriend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith a nod to Den\xc3\xadsov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers\nKonovn\xc3\xadtsyn had brought him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould not your Serene Highness like to come inside?\xe2\x80\x9d said the general\non duty in a discontented voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthe plans must be examined and several\npapers have to be signed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAn adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness\nwithin. But Kut\xc3\xbazov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he\nwas disengaged. He made a grimace....\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look\nat them here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go away,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to Prince\nAndrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the general\xe2\x80\x99s report.\n\nWhile this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\nvoice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several times on\nglancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome\nwoman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding\na dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief.\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of\nthe priest whose home it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene\nHighness bread and salt. \xe2\x80\x9cHer husband has welcomed his Serene Highness\nwith the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the\nhouse.... She\xe2\x80\x99s very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d added the adjutant with a smile. At\nthose words Kut\xc3\xbazov looked round. He was listening to the general\xe2\x80\x99s\nreport\xe2\x80\x94which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at\nTs\xc3\xa1revo-Zaym\xc3\xadshche\xe2\x80\x94as he had listened to Den\xc3\xadsov, and seven years\npreviously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of\nwar. He evidently listened only because he had ears which, though there\nwas a piece of tow in one of them, could not help hearing; but it\nwas evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even\ninterest him, that he knew all that would be said beforehand, and heard\nit all only because he had to, as one has to listen to the chanting of\na service of prayer. All that Den\xc3\xadsov had said was clever and to the\npoint. What the general was saying was even more clever and to\nthe point, but it was evident that Kut\xc3\xbazov despised knowledge\nand cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94something independent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince\nAndrew watched the commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s face attentively, and the only\nexpression he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the\nmeaning of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to\nobserve propriety. It was evident that Kut\xc3\xbazov despised cleverness and\nlearning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Den\xc3\xadsov, but despised\nthem not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge\xe2\x80\x94he did not\ntry to display any of these\xe2\x80\x94but because of something else. He despised\nthem because of his old age and experience of life. The only instruction\nKut\xc3\xbazov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by\nthe Russian troops. At the end of the report the general put before\nhim for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army\ncommanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when landowners\nlodged petitions for compensation.\n\nAfter hearing the matter, Kut\xc3\xbazov smacked his lips together and shook\nhis head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInto the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all, my\ndear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cinto the fire with all such things! Let them cut\nthe crops and burn wood to their hearts\xe2\x80\x99 content. I don\xe2\x80\x99t order it\nor allow it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t exact compensation either. One can\xe2\x80\x99t get on\nwithout it. \xe2\x80\x98When wood is chopped the chips will fly.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at the\npaper again. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, this German precision!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, shaking his head.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov as he signed the last of the documents,\nand rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he\nmoved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.\n\nThe priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had after\nall not managed to present at the right moment, though she had so long\nbeen preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\nHe screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the\ndish for her. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, and how are we getting on?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\nmoving to the door of the room assigned to him. The priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife\nsmiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room.\nThe adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with\nhim. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to Kut\xc3\xbazov.\nHe found him reclining in an armchair, still in the same unbuttoned\novercoat. He had in his hand a French book which he closed as Prince\nAndrew entered, marking the place with a knife. Prince Andrew saw by the\ncover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sit down, sit down here. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\nsad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a father to you,\na second father....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew told Kut\xc3\xbazov all he knew of his father\xe2\x80\x99s death, and what\nhe had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat... what they have brought us to!\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov suddenly cried in an\nagitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince\nAndrew\xe2\x80\x99s story the condition Russia was in. \xe2\x80\x9cBut give me time, give me\ntime!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this\nagitating conversation, and added: \xe2\x80\x9cI sent for you to keep you with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the\nstaff,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew with a smile which Kut\xc3\xbazov noticed.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov glanced inquiringly at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut above all,\xe2\x80\x9d added Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cI have grown used to my regiment,\nam fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I should be\nsorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being with you,\nbelieve me...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s podgy\nface. He cut Bolk\xc3\xb3nski short.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, for I need you. But you\xe2\x80\x99re right, you\xe2\x80\x99re right! It\xe2\x80\x99s not\nhere that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men are\nnot. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers\nserved there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I remember,\nyes, I remember you with the standard!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov, and a flush of\npleasure suffused Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s face at this recollection.\n\nTaking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kut\xc3\xbazov offered his cheek to\nbe kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\nThough Prince Andrew knew that Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s tears came easily, and that he\nwas particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to\nshow sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both\npleasant and flattering to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of\nhonor!\xe2\x80\x9d He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cI missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to\nsend.\xe2\x80\x9d And changing the subject, Kut\xc3\xbazov began to speak of the Turkish\nwar and the peace that had been concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have been much\nblamed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cboth for that war and the peace... but everything\ncame at the right time. Tout vient \xc3\xa0 point \xc3\xa0 celui qui sait attendre. *\nAnd there were as many advisers there as here...\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, returning\nto the subject of \xe2\x80\x9cadvisers\xe2\x80\x9d which evidently occupied him. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, those\nadvisers!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we had listened to them all we should not have\nmade peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war.\nEverything in haste, but more haste, less speed. K\xc3\xa1menski would have\nbeen lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand\nmen. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to\nwin a campaign. For that, not storming and attacking but patience and\ntime are wanted. K\xc3\xa1menski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed\nthese two things and took more fortresses than K\xc3\xa1menski and made them\nTurks eat horseflesh!\xe2\x80\x9d He swayed his head. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the French shall too,\nbelieve me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, growing warmer and beating his chest, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\nmake them eat horseflesh!\xe2\x80\x9d And tears again dimmed his eyes.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cEverything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut shan\xe2\x80\x99t we have to accept battle?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall if everybody wants it; it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped.... But believe\nme, my dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two: patience and\ntime, they will do it all. But the advisers n\xe2\x80\x99entendent pas de cette\noreille, voil\xc3\xa0 le mal. * Some want a thing\xe2\x80\x94others don\xe2\x80\x99t. What\xe2\x80\x99s one to\ndo?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, evidently expecting an answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you want\nus to do?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd look.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, as Prince Andrew still did not\nreply: \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what to do, and what I do. Dans le doute, mon\ncher,\xe2\x80\x9d he paused, \xe2\x80\x9cabstiens-toi\xe2\x80\x9d *(2)\xe2\x80\x94he articulated the French proverb\ndeliberately.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t see it that way, that\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * (2) \xe2\x80\x9cWhen in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share\nyour sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince,\nnor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything come\nstraight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter\nhad left the room Kut\xc3\xbazov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his\nunfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.\n\nPrince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that\ninterview with Kut\xc3\xbazov he went back to his regiment reassured as to\nthe general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been\nentrusted. The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in\nthat old man\xe2\x80\x94in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions,\nand in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions)\nonly the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events\xe2\x80\x94the more\nreassured he was that everything would be as it should. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will not\nbring in any plan of his own. He will not devise or undertake\nanything,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he will hear everything, remember\neverything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder\nanything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that there is\nsomething stronger and more important than his own will\xe2\x80\x94the inevitable\ncourse of events, and he can see them and grasp their significance,\nand seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his\npersonal wish directed to something else. And above all,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince\nAndrew, \xe2\x80\x9cone believes in him because he\xe2\x80\x99s Russian, despite the novel\nby Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98What they have brought us to!\xe2\x80\x99 and had a sob in it when he said\nhe would \xe2\x80\x98make them eat horseflesh!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and\ngeneral approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the\npopular choice of Kut\xc3\xbazov as commander in chief was received.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAfter the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual\ncourse, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to\nremember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe\nthat Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English\nClub were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything\nfor it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had\ndisplayed during the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s stay was the call for contributions of\nmen and money, a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made\nassumed a legal, official form and became unavoidable.\n\nWith the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s approach to Moscow, the Moscovites\xe2\x80\x99 view of their\nsituation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even\nmore frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger\napproaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices that\nspeak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a\nman to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it;\nthe other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and\npainful to think of the danger, since it is not in man\xe2\x80\x99s power to\nforesee everything and avert the general course of events, and it is\ntherefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to\nthink about what is pleasant. In solitude a man generally listens to\nthe first voice, but in society to the second. So it was now with the\ninhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people had been as gay in\nMoscow as that year.\n\nRostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a potman,\nand a Moscow burgher called Karp\xc3\xbashka Chig\xc3\xadrin, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x94having been a\nmilitiaman and having had rather too much at the pub\xe2\x80\x94heard that Napoleon\nwished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the French in very bad\nlanguage, came out of the drink shop, and, under the sign of the\neagle, began to address the assembled people,\xe2\x80\x9d were read and discussed,\ntogether with the latest of Vas\xc3\xadli Lv\xc3\xb3vich P\xc3\xbashkin\xe2\x80\x99s bouts rim\xc3\xa9s.\n\nIn the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these\nbroadsheets, and some liked the way Karp\xc3\xbashka jeered at the French,\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cThey will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our\nbuckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are all\ndwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOthers did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar. It was\nsaid that Rostopch\xc3\xadn had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners\nfrom Moscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon\namong them; but this was told chiefly to introduce Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s witty\nremark on that occasion. The foreigners were deported to N\xc3\xadzhni by\nboat, and Rostopch\xc3\xadn had said to them in French: \xe2\x80\x9cRentrez en vous-m\xc3\xaames;\nentrez dans la barque, et n\xe2\x80\x99en faites pas une barque de Charon.\xe2\x80\x9d * There\nwas talk of all the government offices having been already removed from\nMoscow, and to this Shinsh\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s witticism was added\xe2\x80\x94that for that alone\nMoscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon. It was said that Mam\xc3\xb3nov\xe2\x80\x99s\nregiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that Bez\xc3\xbakhov\nhad spent even more on his, but that the best thing about Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s\naction was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the\nhead of his regiment without charging anything for the show.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cThink it over; get into the barque, and take care not to\n     make it a barque of Charon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t spare anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julie Drubetsk\xc3\xa1ya as she collected\nand pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed\nfingers.\n\nJulie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell\nsoiree.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBez\xc3\xbakhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What\npleasure is there to be so caustique?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA forfeit!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called \xe2\x80\x9cmon\nchevalier,\xe2\x80\x9d and who was going with her to N\xc3\xadzhni.\n\nIn Julie\xe2\x80\x99s set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been agreed\nthat they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a\nslip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary\nContributions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother forfeit for a Gallicism,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Russian writer who was\npresent. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What pleasure is there to be\xe2\x80\x99 is not Russian!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou spare no one,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Julie to the young man without heeding the\nauthor\xe2\x80\x99s remark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor caustique\xe2\x80\x94I am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay again\nfor the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I won\xe2\x80\x99t be\nresponsible,\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked, turning to the author: \xe2\x80\x9cI have neither the\nmoney nor the time, like Prince Gal\xc3\xadtsyn, to engage a master to teach me\nRussian!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here he is!\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cQuand on... No, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the\nmilitia officer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou won\xe2\x80\x99t catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its\nrays!\xe2\x80\x9d and she smiled amiably at Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were just talking of you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were\nsaying that your regiment would be sure to be better than Mam\xc3\xb3nov\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me of my regiment,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre, kissing his\nhostess\xe2\x80\x99 hand and taking a seat beside her. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so sick of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will, of course, command it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Julie, directing a sly,\nsarcastic glance toward the militia officer.\n\nThe latter in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s presence had ceased to be caustic, and his face\nexpressed perplexity as to what Julie\xe2\x80\x99s smile might mean. In spite of\nhis absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s personality immediately\nchecked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nshould make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I\nshould hardly be able to climb onto a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAmong those whom Julie\xe2\x80\x99s guests happened to choose to gossip about were\nthe Rost\xc3\xb3vs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julie. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\nis so unreasonable, the count himself I mean. The Razum\xc3\xb3vskis wanted\nto buy his house and his estate near Moscow, but it drags on and on. He\nasks too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think the sale will come off in a few days,\xe2\x80\x9d said someone.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Julie. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think Moscow is in danger?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why are you leaving?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is\ngoing: and besides\xe2\x80\x94I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his\ndebts,\xe2\x80\x9d said the militia officer, speaking of Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so long in\nMoscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago. Natalie is quite\nwell again now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are waiting for their younger son,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHe joined\nObol\xc3\xa9nski\xe2\x80\x99s Cossacks and went to B\xc3\xa9laya Ts\xc3\xa9rkov where the regiment is\nbeing formed. But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and\nare expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave long ago, but the\ncountess won\xe2\x80\x99t on any account leave Moscow till her son returns.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met them the day before yesterday at the Arkh\xc3\xa1rovs\xe2\x80\x99. Natalie has\nrecovered her looks and is brighter. She sang a song. How easily some\npeople get over everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet over what?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Pierre, looking displeased.\n\nJulie smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de\nSouza\xe2\x80\x99s novels.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat knights? What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Pierre, blushing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come, my dear count! C\xe2\x80\x99est la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous admire,\nma parole d\xe2\x80\x99honneur!\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForfeit, forfeit!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the militia officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, one can\xe2\x80\x99t talk\xe2\x80\x94how tiresome!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is \xe2\x80\x98the talk of all Moscow\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre asked angrily, rising to his\nfeet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, Count, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always more\nfriendly with V\xc3\xa9ra\xe2\x80\x94that dear V\xc3\xa9ra.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madame!\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not\ntaken on myself the role of Natalie Rost\xc3\xb3va\xe2\x80\x99s knight at all, and have\nnot been to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot understand the\ncruelty...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQui s\xe2\x80\x99excuse s\xe2\x80\x99accuse,\xe2\x80\x9d * said Julie, smiling and waving the lint\ntriumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the\nsubject. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I heard today? Poor Mary Bolk\xc3\xb3nskaya arrived\nin Moscow yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her father?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cWho excuses himself, accuses himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? Where is she? I should like very much to see her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI spent the evening with her yesterday. She is going to their estate\nnear Moscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and how is she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is quite a\nromance. Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v! She was surrounded, and they wanted to kill\nher and had wounded some of her people. He rushed in and saved her....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother romance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the militia officer. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, this general\nflight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off. Catiche\nis one and Princess Bolk\xc3\xb3nskaya another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune\nhomme.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cA little bit in love with the young man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForfeit, forfeit, forfeit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how could one say that in Russian?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nWhen Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s broadsheets\nthat had been brought that day.\n\nThe first declared that the report that Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn had forbidden\npeople to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was glad that\nladies and tradesmen\xe2\x80\x99s wives were leaving the city. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be less\npanic and less gossip,\xe2\x80\x9d ran the broadsheet \xe2\x80\x9cbut I will stake my life on\nit that that scoundrel will not enter Moscow.\xe2\x80\x9d These words showed Pierre\nclearly for the first time that the French would enter Moscow. The\nsecond broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at Vy\xc3\xa1zma, that\nCount Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as many of the\ninhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were ready for them\nat the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which could be had at a low\nprice. The tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former\nChig\xc3\xadrin talks. Pierre pondered over these broadsheets. Evidently the\nterrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul\nbut which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself\nfor the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on the table\nand began to lay them out for a game of patience.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this patience comes out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself after shuffling the\ncards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, \xe2\x80\x9cif it comes out,\nit means... what does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the\neldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it will mean that I must go to the army,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre to himself.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in!\xe2\x80\x9d he added to the princess.\n\nOnly the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist,\nwas still living in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s house. The two younger ones had both\nmarried.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my coming to you, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a reproachful and\nagitated voice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know some decision must be come to. What is going\nto happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is\nit that we are staying on?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre\nin the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling\nuncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSatisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Iv\xc3\xa1novna told me today\nhow our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly does them\ncredit! And the people too are quite mutinous\xe2\x80\x94they no longer obey,\neven my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they will soon begin\nbeating us. One can\xe2\x80\x99t walk in the streets. But, above all, the French\nwill be here any day now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one\nthing of you, cousin,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9carrange for me to be taken to\nPetersburg. Whatever I may be, I can\xe2\x80\x99t live under Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On the\ncontrary...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to do this...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I will, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give the order at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with.\nMuttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have been misinformed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything is quiet in\nthe city and there is not the slightest danger. See! I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been\nreading...\xe2\x80\x9d He showed her the broadsheet. \xe2\x80\x9cCount Rostopch\xc3\xadn writes that\nhe will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that count of yours!\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess malevolently. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a\nhypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhe write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, \xe2\x80\x98whoever it might be,\nshould be dragged to the lockup by his hair\xe2\x80\x99? (How silly!) \xe2\x80\x98And honor\nand glory to whoever captures him,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. This is what his cajolery\nhas brought us to! Barbara Iv\xc3\xa1novna told me the mob near killed her\nbecause she said something in French.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so... You take everything so to heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, and\nbegan laying out his cards for patience.\n\nAlthough that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army,\nbut remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation,\nirresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting\nsomething terrible.\n\nNext day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s head steward\ncame to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his\nregiment could not be found without selling one of the estates. In\ngeneral the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of raising\na regiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to\nrepress a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, sell it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done? I can\xe2\x80\x99t draw back\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the better\nwas Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he\nexpected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was left in town. Julie\nhad gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his intimate friends only the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs remained, but he did not go to see them.\n\nTo distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of Voronts\xc3\xb3vo\nto see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe,\nand a trial balloon that was to go up next day. The balloon was not yet\nready, but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\ndesire. The Emperor had written to Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn as follows:\n\nAs soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and\nintelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kut\xc3\xbazov to let\nhim know. I have informed him of the matter.\n\nPlease impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for\nthe first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\nhands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of\nthe commander in chief.\n\n\nOn his way home from Voronts\xc3\xb3vo, as he was passing the Bol\xc3\xb3tnoe Place\nPierre, seeing a large crowd round the L\xc3\xb3bnoe Place, stopped and got out\nof his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged. The\nflogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the\nflogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and\na green jacket, who was moaning piteously. Another criminal, thin and\npale, stood near. Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen. With\na frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s\nface, Pierre pushed his way in through the crowd.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Who is it? What is it for?\xe2\x80\x9d he kept asking.\n\nBut the attention of the crowd\xe2\x80\x94officials, burghers, shopkeepers,\npeasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses\xe2\x80\x94was so eagerly centered on\nwhat was passing in L\xc3\xb3bnoe Place that no one answered him. The stout man\nrose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently trying to appear\nfirm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him, but suddenly\nhis lips trembled and he began to cry, in the way full-blooded grown-up\nmen cry, though angry with himself for doing so. In the crowd people\nbegan talking loudly, to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s cook to some prince.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets his\nteeth on edge!\xe2\x80\x9d said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre,\nwhen the Frenchman began to cry.\n\nThe clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be\nappreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch in\ndismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.\n\nPierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went back\nto his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took his\nseat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so\naudibly that the coachman asked him:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your pleasure?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to\nLuby\xc3\xa1nka Street.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s, as you ordered,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the coachman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool! Idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman\xe2\x80\x94a thing he rarely\ndid. \xe2\x80\x9cHome, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI must get away\nthis very day,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured to himself.\n\nAt the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the\nL\xc3\xb3bnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no\nlonger remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that\nit seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the\nman ought to have known it for himself.\n\nOn reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evst\xc3\xa1fey\xe2\x80\x94his head coachman who\nknew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow\xe2\x80\x94that\nhe would leave that night for the army at Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk, and that his saddle\nhorses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged that day,\nso on Evst\xc3\xa1fey\xe2\x80\x99s representation Pierre had to put off his departure till\nnext day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain, and\nafter dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night\nin Perkh\xc3\xbashkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that\nevening. (This was the battle of Shev\xc3\xa1rdino.) He was told that there in\nPerkh\xc3\xbashkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer\nhis questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was approaching\nMozh\xc3\xa1ysk.\n\nEvery house in Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel\nwhere Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be\nhad. It was full of officers.\n\nEverywhere in Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on the\nmarch. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and cannon\nwere everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and the\nfarther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea\nof troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and\njoyful feeling he had not experienced before. It was a feeling akin\nto what he had felt at the Slob\xc3\xb3da Palace during the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s visit\xe2\x80\x94a\nsense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing\nsomething. He now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that\nconstitutes men\xe2\x80\x99s happiness\xe2\x80\x94the comforts of life, wealth, even\nlife itself\xe2\x80\x94is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away, compared with\nsomething... With what? Pierre could not say, and he did not try to\ndetermine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in\nsacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the question of what to\nsacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and\njoyous sensation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nOn the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt was\nfought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, and on\nthe twenty-sixth the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 itself took place.\n\nWhy and how were the battles of Shev\xc3\xa1rdino and Borodin\xc3\xb3 given and\naccepted? Why was the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 fought? There was not the least\nsense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result\nfor the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer\nto the destruction of Moscow\xe2\x80\x94which we feared more than anything in\nthe world; and for the French its immediate result was that they were\nbrought nearer to the destruction of their whole army\xe2\x80\x94which they feared\nmore than anything in the world. What the result must be was quite\nobvious, and yet Napoleon offered and Kut\xc3\xbazov accepted that battle.\n\nIf the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must\nhave been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles\nand giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army,\nhe was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally\nclear to Kut\xc3\xbazov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a\nquarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For Kut\xc3\xbazov this was\nmathematically clear, as it is that if when playing draughts I have one\nman less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore\nshould not exchange. When my opponent has sixteen men and I have\nfourteen, I am only one eighth weaker than he, but when I have exchanged\nthirteen more men he will be three times as strong as I am.\n\nBefore the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 our strength in proportion to the French\nwas about as five to six, but after that battle it was little more than\none to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and\ntwenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a\nhundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced Kut\xc3\xbazov accepted the\nbattle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius,\ngave it, losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of\ncommunication still more. If it is said that he expected to end the\ncampaign by occupying Moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by\noccupying Vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary. Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\nhistorians themselves tell us that from Smol\xc3\xa9nsk onwards he wished\nto stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the\noccupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had\nseen at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, and\nhad not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his\nwish to negotiate.\n\nIn giving and accepting battle at Borodin\xc3\xb3, Kut\xc3\xbazov acted involuntarily\nand irrationally. But later on, to fit what had occurred, the historians\nprovided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the\ngenerals who, of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved\nand involuntary.\n\nThe ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish\nthe whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to accustom\nourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are\nmeaningless.\n\nOn the other question, how the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 and the preceding\nbattle of Shev\xc3\xa1rdino were fought, there also exists a definite and\nwell-known, but quite false, conception. All the historians describe the\naffair as follows:\n\nThe Russian army, they say, in its retreat from Smol\xc3\xa9nsk sought out\nfor itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a\nposition at Borodin\xc3\xb3.\n\nThe Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the left\nof the highroad (from Moscow to Smol\xc3\xa9nsk) and almost at a right angle\nto it, from Borodin\xc3\xb3 to Ut\xc3\xadtsa, at the very place where the battle was\nfought.\n\nIn front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set up on\nthe Shev\xc3\xa1rdino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth, we\nare told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the\ntwenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in position on\nthe field of Borodin\xc3\xb3.\n\nSo the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to\nlook into the matter can easily convince himself.\n\nThe Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary,\nduring the retreat passed many positions better than Borodin\xc3\xb3. They did\nnot stop at any one of these positions because Kut\xc3\xbazov did not wish to\noccupy a position he had not himself chosen, because the popular demand\nfor a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough, and because\nMilor\xc3\xa1dovich had not yet arrived with the militia, and for many other\nreasons. The fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger,\nand that the position at Borodin\xc3\xb3 (the one where the battle was fought),\nfar from being strong, was no more a position than any other spot one\nmight find in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at\nhazard.\n\nNot only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of\nBorodin\xc3\xb3 to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that\nis, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the\ntwenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be\nfought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no\nentrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the\ntwenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the\nposition of the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless\nin front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it\nmore strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts\nexhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at\nnight on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to\nobserve the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the\nbattle was fought had not been foreseen and that the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt\nwas not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to\nthe twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and Bagrati\xc3\xb3n were convinced that the\nShev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that Kut\xc3\xbazov\nhimself in his report, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of\nthe Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt as the left flank of the position. It was much\nlater, when reports on the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 were written at leisure,\nthat the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to\njustify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented\nas infallible) that the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt was an advanced post\xe2\x80\x94whereas\nin reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank\xe2\x80\x94and that\nthe battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 was fought by us on an entrenched position\npreviously selected, whereas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot\nwhich was almost unentrenched.\n\nThe case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river\nKoloch\xc3\xa1\xe2\x80\x94which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute\nangle\xe2\x80\x94so that the left flank was at Shev\xc3\xa1rdino, the right flank near the\nvillage of N\xc3\xb3voe, and the center at Borodin\xc3\xb3 at the confluence of the\nrivers Koloch\xc3\xa1 and V\xc3\xb3yna.\n\nTo anyone who looks at the field of Borodin\xc3\xb3 without thinking of how\nthe battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river\nKoloch\xc3\xa1, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to\nprevent an enemy from advancing along the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk road to Moscow.\n\nNapoleon, riding to Val\xc3\xbaevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as the\nhistory books say he did) the position of the Russians from Ut\xc3\xadtsa\nto Borodin\xc3\xb3 (he could not have seen that position because it did not\nexist), nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while\npursuing the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the\nRussian position\xe2\x80\x94at the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt\xe2\x80\x94and unexpectedly for the\nRussians moved his army across the Koloch\xc3\xa1. And the Russians, not having\ntime to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the\nposition they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which\nhad not been foreseen and was not fortified. By crossing to the other\nside of the Koloch\xc3\xa1 to the left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the\nwhole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the Russian\nside) and transferred it to the plain between Ut\xc3\xadtsa, Sem\xc3\xabnovsk, and\nBorodin\xc3\xb3\xe2\x80\x94a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain\nin Russia\xe2\x80\x94and there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took\nplace.\n\nHad Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the\nKoloch\xc3\xa1, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt\nbut had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that\nthe Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the\nbattle would have taken place where we expected it. In that case\nwe should probably have defended the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt\xe2\x80\x94our left\nflank\xe2\x80\x94still more obstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the\ncenter or on the right, and the engagement would have taken place on the\ntwenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fortified. But as the\nattack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of\nour rear guard (that is, immediately after the fight at Gridn\xc3\xabva), and\nas the Russian commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a\ngeneral engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first\nand chief action of the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 was already lost on the\ntwenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the\ntwenty-sixth.\n\nAfter the loss of the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the\nmorning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and\nwere forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to\nbe.\n\nNot only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak,\nunfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was\nincreased by the fact that the Russian commanders\xe2\x80\x94not having fully\nrealized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left\nflank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from\nright to left\xe2\x80\x94maintained their extended position from the village of\nN\xc3\xb3voe to Ut\xc3\xadtsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to\nleft during the battle. So it happened that throughout the whole battle\nthe Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left\nflank with but half as many men. (Poniatowski\xe2\x80\x99s action against Ut\xc3\xadtsa,\nand Uv\xc3\xa1rov\xe2\x80\x99s on the right flank against the French, were actions\ndistinct from the main course of the battle.) So the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3\ndid not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders\xe2\x80\x99\nmistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian\narmy and people) it has been described. The battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 was not\nfought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly\nweaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the\nShev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 on an\nopen and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous\nas the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not\nmerely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive\nresult, but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete\ndisintegration and flight.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nOn the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk. At the\ndescent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the\ntown past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and\nthe bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on\nfoot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by\nits singers. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who\nhad been wounded in the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers,\nshouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The\ncarts, in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying\nor sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep\nincline to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged with\nrags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to\nthe sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another. Almost\nall of them stared with na\xc3\xafve, childlike curiosity at Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s white hat\nand green swallow-tail coat.\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to\none side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the hill\nwith its singers, surrounded Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s carriage and blocked the road.\nPierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in which\nthe road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into\nthe cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s head was\nthe bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily. One of the\ncarts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to Pierre. The\ndriver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one\nof its tireless hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his\nlittle horse.\n\nOne of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following\nthe cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to\nlook at Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us on to\nMoscow?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nPierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. He was\nlooking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded,\nnow at the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men\nwere sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had\nprobably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags\nand one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby\xe2\x80\x99s head. His nose\nand mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the\ncathedral and crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a fair-haired\nrecruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face, looked\nat Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third lay prone so that his\nface was not visible. The cavalry singers were passing close by:\n\n   Ah lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,\n   Living in a foreign land...\n\nthey sang their soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 dance song.\n\nAs if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the\nmetallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of\nthe sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of\nmerriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded near the\npanting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber, and sad.\n\nThe soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry\nsingers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the coxcombs!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered reproachfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the soldiers only, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen peasants today, too....\nThe peasants\xe2\x80\x94even they have to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier behind the cart,\naddressing Pierre with a sad smile. \xe2\x80\x9cNo distinctions made nowadays....\nThey want the whole nation to fall on them\xe2\x80\x94in a word, it\xe2\x80\x99s Moscow! They\nwant to make an end of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn spite of the obscurity of the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s words Pierre understood what\nhe wanted to say and nodded approval.\n\nThe road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.\n\nHe kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but only\nsaw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different\nbranches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at his white\nhat and green tail coat.\n\nHaving gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and\neagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was\ndriving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon,\nand on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driver\xe2\x80\x99s\nseat to pull up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount! Your excellency, how come you to be here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the doctor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, I wanted to see...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, there will be something to see....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of\ntaking part in a battle.\n\nThe doctor advised him to apply direct to Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, exchanging glances with his young companion. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow his Serene\nHighness knows you and will receive you graciously. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you must\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is\nexactly?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe position?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s not my line. Drive\npast Tat\xc3\xa1rinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the hillock\nand you\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan one see from there?... If you would...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would go with you but on my honor I\xe2\x80\x99m up to here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he pointed to\nhis throat. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m galloping to the commander of the corps. How do matters\nstand?... You know, Count, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a battle tomorrow. Out of an army\nof a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded,\nand we haven\xe2\x80\x99t stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for\nsix thousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we need other things as\nwell\xe2\x80\x94we must manage as best we can!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who\nhad stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had\nnoticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death\namazed Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk hill,\nthe carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the\nsun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment\nthink of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded. Yet from\namong these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they wonder at my\nhat! Strange!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, continuing his way to Tat\xc3\xa1rinova.\n\nIn front of a landowner\xe2\x80\x99s house to the left of the road stood carriages,\nwagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The commander in chief\nwas putting up there, but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and\nhardly any of the staff were there\xe2\x80\x94they had gone to the church service.\nPierre drove on toward G\xc3\xb3rki.\n\nWhen he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street, he\nsaw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with\ncrosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated and\nperspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the\nright of the road.\n\nSome of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth\nalong planks, while others stood about doing nothing.\n\nTwo officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On seeing\nthese peasants, who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their\nposition as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at\nMozh\xc3\xa1ysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\nwant the whole nation to fall on them.\xe2\x80\x9d The sight of these bearded\npeasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots\nand perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the left toward\nthe middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed\nPierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment\nthan anything he had yet seen or heard.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nPierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling militiamen,\nascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, the battlefield\ncould be seen.\n\nIt was about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The sun shone somewhat to the left and\nbehind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising like\nan amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere.\n\nFrom above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk\nhighroad, passing through a village with a white church some five\nhundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was Borodin\xc3\xb3.\nBelow the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding\ndown and up, rose higher and higher to the village of Val\xc3\xbaevo visible\nabout four miles away, where Napoleon was then stationed. Beyond Val\xc3\xbaevo\nthe road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in\nthe distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the\ncross and belfry of the Koloch\xc3\xa1 Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and\nthere over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of the\nforest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite\nmasses of troops\xe2\x80\x94ours and the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s. The ground to the right\xe2\x80\x94along the\ncourse of the Koloch\xc3\xa1 and Moskv\xc3\xa1 rivers\xe2\x80\x94was broken and hilly. Between\nthe hollows the villages of Bez\xc3\xbabova and Zakh\xc3\xa1rino showed in the\ndistance. On the left the ground was more level; there were fields of\ngrain, and the smoking ruins of Sem\xc3\xabnovsk, which had been burned down,\ncould be seen.\n\nAll that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the\nright side of the field fully satisfied his expectations. Nowhere\ncould he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only fields,\nmeadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and\nstreams; and try as he would he could descry no military \xe2\x80\x9cposition\xe2\x80\x9d in\nthis place which teemed with life, nor could he even distinguish our\ntroops from the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must ask someone who knows,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and addressed an officer who\nwas looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat village that is in front?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cB\xc3\xbardino, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, turning to his companion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBorodin\xc3\xb3,\xe2\x80\x9d the other corrected him.\n\nThe officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up to\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre those our men there?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre inquired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and there, further on, are the French,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\nthey are, there... you can see them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? Where?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left\nbeyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression that Pierre\nhad noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, those are the French! And over there?...\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre pointed to a knoll\non the left, near which some troops could be seen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ours! And there?...\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre pointed to another knoll in the\ndistance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow\nwhere also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s his again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer. (It was the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt.)\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was ours yesterday, but now it is his.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen how about our position?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur position?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cI\ncan tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our\nentrenchments. There, you see? There\xe2\x80\x99s our center, at Borodin\xc3\xb3, just\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white\nchurch. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where one crosses the Koloch\xc3\xa1. You see down there where\nthe rows of hay are lying in the hollow, there\xe2\x80\x99s the bridge. That\xe2\x80\x99s our\ncenter. Our right flank is over there\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he pointed sharply to the right,\nfar away in the broken ground\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where the Moskv\xc3\xa1 River is, and\nwe have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong ones. The left\nflank...\xe2\x80\x9d here the officer paused. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, that\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to\nexplain.... Yesterday our left flank was there at Shev\xc3\xa1rdino, you see,\nwhere the oak is, but now we have withdrawn our left wing\xe2\x80\x94now it is over\nthere, do you see that village and the smoke? That\xe2\x80\x99s Sem\xc3\xabnovsk, yes,\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d he pointed to Ra\xc3\xa9vski\xe2\x80\x99s knoll. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the battle will hardly\nbe there. His having moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will\nprobably pass round to the right of the Moskv\xc3\xa1. But wherever it may be,\nmany a man will be missing tomorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\n\nAn elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving\nthese explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking, but\nat this point, evidently not liking the officer\xe2\x80\x99s remark, interrupted\nhim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabions must be sent for,\xe2\x80\x9d said he sternly.\n\nThe officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might\nthink of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak\nof it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, send number three company again,\xe2\x80\x9d the officer replied hurriedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, are you one of the doctors?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come on my own,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pierre, and he went down the hill\nagain, passing the militiamen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, those damned fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the officer who followed him,\nholding his nose as he ran past the men at work.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... They\xe2\x80\x99ll be\nhere in a minute...\xe2\x80\x9d voices were suddenly heard saying; and officers,\nsoldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the road.\n\nA church procession was coming up the hill from Borodin\xc3\xb3. First along\nthe dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with arms\nreversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.\n\nSoldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the\nprocession.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of God!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsomeone cried.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Smol\xc3\xa9nsk Mother of God,\xe2\x80\x9d another corrected him.\n\nThe militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who had\nbeen at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to meet the\nchurch procession. Following the battalion that marched along the dusty\nroad came priests in their vestments\xe2\x80\x94one little old man in a hood with\nattendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers bore a large,\ndark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was the icon that had\nbeen brought from Smol\xc3\xa9nsk and had since accompanied the army. Behind,\nbefore, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked,\nran, and bowed to the ground.\n\nAt the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had\nbeen holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by\nothers, the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The hot\nrays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with\nthe hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon.\nThe singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd\nof bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon.\nBehind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot\nreserved for them. A bald general with a St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Cross on his neck\nstood just behind the priest\xe2\x80\x99s back, and without crossing himself (he\nwas evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which\nhe considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the\npatriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial\npose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest\nwhile looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre\nrecognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did not\nlook at them\xe2\x80\x94his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious\nexpression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were\nall gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, who were\nsinging the service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and\nmechanically to sing: \xe2\x80\x9cSave from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of\nGod,\xe2\x80\x9d and the priest and deacon chimed in: \xe2\x80\x9cFor to Thee under God we all\nflee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection,\xe2\x80\x9d there again kindled in\nall those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity\nof the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of\nthe hill at Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met\nthat morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back,\nand sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.\n\nThe crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre.\nSomeone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which way\nwas made for him, was approaching the icon.\n\nIt was Kut\xc3\xbazov, who had been riding round the position and on his way\nback to Tat\xc3\xa1rinova had stopped where the service was being held. Pierre\nrecognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which distinguished him\nfrom everybody else.\n\nWith a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body,\nwith uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the\neye he had lost, Kut\xc3\xbazov walked with plunging, swaying gait into\nthe crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an\naccustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and\nbowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind Kut\xc3\xbazov was Bennigsen and\nthe suite. Despite the presence of the commander in chief, who attracted\nthe attention of all the superior officers, the militiamen and soldiers\ncontinued their prayers without looking at him.\n\nWhen the service was over, Kut\xc3\xbazov stepped up to the icon, sank heavily\nto his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried vainly to\nrise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight. His\nwhite head twitched with the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon as\na child does with na\xc3\xafvely pouting lips, and again bowed till he touched\nthe ground with his hand. The other generals followed his example,\nthen the officers, and after them with excited faces, pressing on one\nanother, crowding, panting, and pushing, scrambled the soldiers and\nmilitiamen.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nStaggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount Peter Kir\xc3\xadlovich! How did you get here?\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice.\n\nPierre looked round. Bor\xc3\xads Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y, brushing his knees with his hand\n(he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the icon),\ncame up to him smiling. Bor\xc3\xads was elegantly dressed, with a slightly\nmartial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long coat and like\nKut\xc3\xbazov had a whip slung across his shoulder.\n\nMeanwhile Kut\xc3\xbazov had reached the village and seated himself in the\nshade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run\nto fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and\nbrilliant suite surrounded him.\n\nThe icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre stopped\nsome thirty paces from Kut\xc3\xbazov, talking to Bor\xc3\xads.\n\nHe explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the\nposition.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what you must do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads. \xe2\x80\x9cI will do the honors of the\ncamp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen\nwill be. I am in attendance on him, you know; I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention it to him.\nBut if you want to ride round the position, come along with us. We are\njust going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend the night\nwith me and we\xe2\x80\x99ll arrange a game of cards. Of course you know Dm\xc3\xadtri\nSerg\xc3\xa9evich? Those are his quarters,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed to the third house\nin the village of G\xc3\xb3rki.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I should like to see the right flank. They say it\xe2\x80\x99s very strong,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to start from the Moskv\xc3\xa1 River and ride\nround the whole position.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left flank.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. But where is Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s regiment? Can you point it\nout to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s? We shall pass it and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the left flank?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state our\nleft flank is in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads confidentially lowering his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\nnot at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify that knoll\nquite differently, but...\xe2\x80\x9d Bor\xc3\xads shrugged his shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9chis Serene\nHighness would not have it, or someone persuaded him. You see...\xe2\x80\x9d but\nBor\xc3\xads did not finish, for at that moment Kays\xc3\xa1rov, Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant,\ncame up to Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Kays\xc3\xa1rov!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bor\xc3\xads, addressing him with an\nunembarrassed smile, \xe2\x80\x9cI was just trying to explain our position to\nthe count. It is amazing how his Serene Highness could so foresee the\nintentions of the French!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean the left flank?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kays\xc3\xa1rov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Kut\xc3\xbazov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff, Bor\xc3\xads\nhad contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He had\nestablished himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom Bor\xc3\xads\nhad been in attendance, considered young Prince Drubetsk\xc3\xb3y an invaluable\nman.\n\nIn the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s\nparty and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Bor\xc3\xads belonged to the\nlatter and no one else, while showing servile respect to Kut\xc3\xbazov, could\nso create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that\nBennigsen managed everything. Now the decisive moment of battle had come\nwhen Kut\xc3\xbazov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even\nif Kut\xc3\xbazov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by\nBennigsen. In any case many great rewards would have to be given for\ntomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s action, and new men would come to the front. So Bor\xc3\xads was\nfull of nervous vivacity all day.\n\nAfter Kays\xc3\xa1rov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had not\ntime to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon\nhim, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all expressed\nanimation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of\nthe excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions\nof personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different\nexpression he saw on other faces\xe2\x80\x94an expression that spoke not of\npersonal matters but of the universal questions of life and death.\nKut\xc3\xbazov noticed Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s figure and the group gathered round him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall him to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\nAn adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness\xe2\x80\x99 wish, and Pierre went\ntoward Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It was\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did that fellow get here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a creature that wriggles in anywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\nhas been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He\xe2\x80\x99s been\nproposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s picket\nline at night.... He\xe2\x80\x99s a brave fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send\nme away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nlose anything...\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov was saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland\nfor which I am ready to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his\nskin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene\nHighness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes... Yes...\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more and\nmore as he looked at Pierre.\n\nJust then Bor\xc3\xads, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s side near Kut\xc3\xbazov and in a most natural manner, without\nraising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted\nconversation:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What\nheroism, Count!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBor\xc3\xads evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his\nSerene Highness. He knew Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s attention would be caught by those\nwords, and so it was.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you saying about the militia?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Bor\xc3\xads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPreparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness\xe2\x80\x94for death\xe2\x80\x94they have put on\nclean shirts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh... a wonderful, a matchless people!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov; and he closed his\neyes and swayed his head. \xe2\x80\x9cA matchless people!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated with a sigh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you want to smell gunpowder?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\npleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wife\xe2\x80\x99s adorers. Is\nshe well? My quarters are at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd as often happens with old people, Kut\xc3\xbazov began looking about\nabsent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.\n\nThen, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew\nKays\xc3\xa1rov, his adjutant\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose verses... those verses of M\xc3\xa1rin\xe2\x80\x99s... how do they go, eh? Those he\nwrote about Ger\xc3\xa1kov: \xe2\x80\x98Lectures for the corps inditing\xe2\x80\x99... Recite them,\nrecite them!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, evidently preparing to laugh.\n\nKays\xc3\xa1rov recited.... Kut\xc3\xbazov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of\nthe verses.\n\nWhen Pierre had left Kut\xc3\xbazov, D\xc3\xb3lokhov came up to him and took his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to meet you here, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud, regardless\nof the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to\nsurvive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the\nmisunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to\nhave any ill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre looked at D\xc3\xb3lokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to him.\nWith tears in his eyes D\xc3\xb3lokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.\n\nBor\xc3\xads said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to\nPierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will interest you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very much,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre.\n\nHalf an hour later Kut\xc3\xbazov left for Tat\xc3\xa1rinova, and Bennigsen and his\nsuite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nFrom G\xc3\xb3rki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which, when\nthey had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out as\nbeing the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay\nlay by the riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of\nBorodin\xc3\xb3 and thence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of\ntroops and guns, and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging.\nThis was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as\nthe Ra\xc3\xa9vski Redoubt, or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special\nattention to it. He did not know that it would become more memorable to\nhim than any other spot on the plain of Borodin\xc3\xb3.\n\nThey then crossed the hollow to Sem\xc3\xabnovsk, where the soldiers were\ndragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode\ndownhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by\nhail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows\nof the plowed land, and reached some fl\xc3\xa8ches * which were still being\ndug.\n\n    * A kind of entrenchment.\n\nAt the fl\xc3\xa8ches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino\nRedoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several\nhorsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon or\nMurat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of\nhorsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the\nscarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men\nrode away from the mound and disappeared.\n\nBennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining\nthe whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him, straining each\nfaculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but\nwas mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the\ntask. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and,\nnoticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly said to him:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think this interests you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary it\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre not quite\ntruthfully.\n\nFrom the fl\xc3\xa8ches they rode still farther to the left, along a road\nwinding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of the\nwood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of\nthe many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front\nof them for some time, arousing general attention and laughter, and only\nwhen several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear\nin the thicket. After going through the wood for about a mile and a half\nthey came out on a glade where troops of T\xc3\xbachkov\xe2\x80\x99s corps were stationed\nto defend the left flank.\n\nHere, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with\nmuch heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military\nimportance. In front of T\xc3\xbachkov\xe2\x80\x99s troops was some high ground not\noccupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, saying\nthat it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around\nunoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the generals expressed\nthe same opinion. One in particular declared with martial heat that they\nwere put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen on his own authority ordered\nthe troops to occupy the high ground. This disposition on the left flank\nincreased Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s doubt of his own capacity to understand military\nmatters. Listening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the\nposition of the troops behind the hill, he quite understood them and\nshared their opinion, but for that very reason he could not understand\nhow the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross\nand palpable a blunder.\n\nPierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen supposed,\nput there to defend the position, but were in a concealed position as\nan ambush, that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an\napproaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not know this and moved\nthe troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the\nmatter to the commander in chief.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nOn that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his\nelbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazk\xc3\xb3vo at the further\nend of his regiment\xe2\x80\x99s encampment. Through a gap in the broken wall he\ncould see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty-year-old birches\nwith their lower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of\noats were standing, and some bushes near which rose the smoke of\ncampfires\xe2\x80\x94the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 kitchens.\n\nNarrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to\nhim, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as\nhe had done seven years before at Austerlitz.\n\nHe had received and given the orders for next day\xe2\x80\x99s battle and had\nnothing more to do. But his thoughts\xe2\x80\x94the simplest, clearest, and\ntherefore most terrible thoughts\xe2\x80\x94would give him no peace. He knew that\ntomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken\npart in, and for the first time in his life the possibility of death\npresented itself to him\xe2\x80\x94not in relation to any worldly matter or with\nreference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to himself, to\nhis own soul\xe2\x80\x94vividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as a certainty. And\nfrom the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and\npreoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without\nshadows, without perspective, without distinction of outline. All life\nappeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been\ngazing by artificial light through a glass. Now he suddenly saw those\nbadly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nyes! There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured,\nand tormented me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself, passing in review the principal\npictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold\nwhite daylight of his clear perception of death. \xe2\x80\x9cThere they are, those\nrudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious.\nGlory, the good of society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itself\xe2\x80\x94how\nimportant these pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they\nseemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the\ncold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.\xe2\x80\x9d The\nthree great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his\nlove for a woman, his father\xe2\x80\x99s death, and the French invasion which had\noverrun half Russia. \xe2\x80\x9cLove... that little girl who seemed to me brimming\nover with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made romantic plans\nof love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I was!\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud\nbitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cAh me! I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her\nfaithful to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the gentle dove\nin the fable she was to pine apart from me.... But it was much simpler\nreally.... It was all very simple and horrible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his\nland, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside,\nunconscious of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his path,\nand his Bald Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says\nit is a trial sent from above. What is the trial for, when he is not\nhere and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is the trial\nintended? The Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I\nshall be killed, perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own\nmen, by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them\ndid yesterday, and the French will come and take me by head and heels\nand fling me into a hole that I may not stink under their noses, and new\nconditions of life will arise, which will seem quite ordinary to others\nand about which I shall know nothing. I shall not exist....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their\nmotionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. \xe2\x80\x9cTo die... to be\nkilled tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this should still\nbe, but no me....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the\nsmoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed\nterrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose\nquickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.\n\nAfter he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe cried.\n\nThe red-nosed Captain Tim\xc3\xb3khin, formerly D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s squadron commander,\nbut now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the\nshed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster.\n\nPrince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come\nabout, gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss\nthem when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil take it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice of a man stumbling over something.\n\nPrince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped\nover a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It was\nunpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in general,\nand Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful moments of\nhis last visit to Moscow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? What a surprise!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat brings you here? This is\nunexpected!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness\xe2\x80\x94they\nexpressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached\nthe shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s face he felt\nconstrained and ill at ease.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word\n\xe2\x80\x9cinteresting.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to see the battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would they\nstop it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew sarcastically. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and how\xe2\x80\x99s Moscow? And\nmy people? Have they reached Moscow at last?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked seriously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they have. Julie Drubetsk\xc3\xa1ya told me so. I went to see them, but\nmissed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nThe officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently\nreluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have\ntea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with\nsurprise at Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of\nMoscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince\nAndrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre\naddressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you understand the whole position of our troops?\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew\ninterrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that is, how do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cNot being a military man\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general\nposition.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince\nAndrew. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what do you think of Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s appointment?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nasked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was very glad of his appointment, that\xe2\x80\x99s all I know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince\nAndrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are saying\nheaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk them,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.\n\nPierre looked at Tim\xc3\xb3khin with the condescendingly interrogative smile\nwith which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your\nexcellency,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim\xc3\xb3khin timidly, and continually turning to glance at\nhis colonel.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when\nwe were retreating from Sventsy\xc3\xa1ni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp\nof hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it all;\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t it so, your excellency?\xe2\x80\x9d and again Tim\xc3\xb3khin turned to the prince.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we daren\xe2\x80\x99t. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for\nthat kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became\nstraightforward. Now we see light....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why was it forbidden?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTim\xc3\xb3khin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer\nsuch a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the\nenemy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very sound:\none can\xe2\x80\x99t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to\nmarauding. At Smol\xc3\xa9nsk too he judged correctly that the French might\noutflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand\nthis,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him\ninvoluntarily: \xe2\x80\x9che could not understand that there, for the first time,\nwe were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the\nmen such as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for\ntwo days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold. He\nordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and losses went for nothing.\nHe had no thought of betraying us, he tried to do the best he could,\nhe thought out everything, and that is why he is unsuitable. He is\nunsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and\naccurately as every German has to. How can I explain?... Well, say your\nfather has a German valet, and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s requirements better than you could, then it\xe2\x80\x99s all right to let\nhim serve. But if your father is mortally sick you\xe2\x80\x99ll send the valet\naway and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands,\nand will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could.\nSo it has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could\nserve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger\nshe needs one of her own kin. But in your Club they have been making him\nout a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the only result will\nbe that afterwards, ashamed of their false accusations, they will make\nhim out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor, and that will be still\nmore unjust. He is an honest and very punctilious German.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they say he\xe2\x80\x99s a skillful commander,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what is meant by \xe2\x80\x98a skillful commander,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nPrince Andrew ironically.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA skillful commander?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, one who foresees all\ncontingencies... and foresees the adversary\xe2\x80\x99s intentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter\nsettled long ago.\n\nPierre looked at him in surprise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet they say that war is like a game of chess?\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Prince Andrew, \xe2\x80\x9cbut with this little difference, that\nin chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not\nlimited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always\nstronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while\nin war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes\nweaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can\nnever be known to anyone. Believe me,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cif things\ndepended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making\narrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in\nthe regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s\nbattle will depend and not on those others.... Success never depends,\nand never will depend, on position, or equipment, or even on numbers,\nand least of all on position.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut on what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the feeling that is in me and in him,\xe2\x80\x9d he pointed to Tim\xc3\xb3khin, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nin each soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew glanced at Tim\xc3\xb3khin, who looked at his commander in alarm\nand bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity\nPrince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from\nexpressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose\nthe battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours,\nbut very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle,\nand we did lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to fight for\nthere, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could.\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ve lost, so let us run,\xe2\x80\x99 and we ran. If we had not said that till\nthe evening, heaven knows what might not have happened. But tomorrow we\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t say it! You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the\nright flank too extended,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense, there\xe2\x80\x99s\nnothing of the kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred million most\ndiverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that\nour men or theirs run or do not run, and that this man or that man is\nkilled, but all that is being done at present is only play. The fact is\nthat those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only\ndo not help matters, but hinder. They are only concerned with their own\npetty interests.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt such a moment?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre reproachfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt such a moment!\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cTo them it is only a moment\naffording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross\nor ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred\nthousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and\nthe thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side\nthat fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you\nlike I will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at\nthe top may make, we shall win tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s battle. Tomorrow, happen what\nmay, we shall win!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, your excellency! That\xe2\x80\x99s the truth, the real truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nTim\xc3\xb3khin. \xe2\x80\x9cWho would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion,\nbelieve me, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t drink their vodka! \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not the day for that!\xe2\x80\x99\nthey say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the shed\nwith them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had gone\nPierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation\nwhen they heard the clatter of three horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs on the road not far\nfrom the shed, and looking in that direction Prince Andrew recognized\nWolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by\ncontinuing to converse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these\nwords:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDer Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht genug\nPreis geben,\xe2\x80\x9d * said one of them.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cThe war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently\n     commend that view.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ja,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, \xe2\x80\x9cder Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schw\xc3\xa4chen,\nso kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung\nnehmen.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of\n     course one cannot take into account the loss of private\n     individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d agreed the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cExtend widely!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they had\nridden past. \xe2\x80\x9cIn that \xe2\x80\x98extend\xe2\x80\x99 were my father, son, and sister, at Bald\nHills. That\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to him! That\xe2\x80\x99s what I was saying to you\xe2\x80\x94those\nGerman gentlemen won\xe2\x80\x99t win the battle tomorrow but will only make all\nthe mess they can, because they have nothing in their German heads but\ntheories not worth an empty eggshell and haven\xe2\x80\x99t in their hearts the one\nthing needed tomorrow\xe2\x80\x94that which Tim\xc3\xb3khin has. They have yielded up all\nEurope to him, and have now come to teach us. Fine teachers!\xe2\x80\x9d and again\nhis voice grew shrill.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think we shall win tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s battle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Prince Andrew absently. \xe2\x80\x9cOne thing I would do if\nI had the power,\xe2\x80\x9d he began again, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not take prisoners. Why take\nprisoners? It\xe2\x80\x99s chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on\ntheir way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me\nevery moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals.\nAnd so thinks Tim\xc3\xb3khin and the whole army. They should be executed!\nSince they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been\nsaid at Tilsit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite agree with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk hill and all\nthat day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He now\nunderstood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the\nimpending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and\nstern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up\nfor him by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in\nphysics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen,\nand this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly, and as\nit were lightheartedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot take prisoners,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThat by itself would\nquite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have\nplayed at war\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that\nstuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and\nsensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she\nis so kindhearted that she can\xe2\x80\x99t look at blood, but enjoys eating the\ncalf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of\nchivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. It\xe2\x80\x99s\nall rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged\nus and we humbugged them. They plunder other people\xe2\x80\x99s houses, issue\nfalse paper money, and worst of all they kill my children and my\nfather, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! Take no\nprisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come to this as I have\nthrough the same sufferings...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or\nnot Moscow was taken as Smol\xc3\xa9nsk had been, was suddenly checked in his\nspeech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a\nfew times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips\nquivered as he began speaking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only\nwhen it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would\nnot be war because Paul Iv\xc3\xa1novich had offended Michael Iv\xc3\xa1novich. And\nwhen there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the\ndetermination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these\nWestphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow\nhim into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia\nwithout knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in\nlife; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to\naccept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in\nthat: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is\nnow, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military\ncalling is the most highly honored.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the\nhabits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war\nare spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country\xe2\x80\x99s\ninhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud\nand falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class\nare the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance,\ncruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the\nhighest class, respected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese,\nwear military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the\nhighest rewards.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill\nand maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for\nhaving killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they\nannounce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed\nthe greater their achievement. How does God above look at them and hear\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, my\nfriend, it has of late become hard for me to live. I see that I have\nbegun to understand too much. And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do for man to taste of the\ntree of knowledge of good and evil.... Ah, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not for long!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, you\xe2\x80\x99re sleepy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time for me to sleep. Go back to\nG\xc3\xb3rki!\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew suddenly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened,\ncompassionate eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, go! Before a battle one must have one\xe2\x80\x99s sleep out,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Prince\nAndrew.\n\nHe came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, be\noff!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether we meet again or not...\xe2\x80\x9d and turning away\nhurriedly he entered the shed.\n\nIt was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the\nexpression of Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s face was angry or tender.\n\nFor some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow\nhim or go away. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he does not want it!\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I know\nthat this is our last meeting!\xe2\x80\x9d He sighed deeply and rode back to G\xc3\xb3rki.\n\nOn re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he could\nnot sleep.\n\nHe closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On\none of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening\nin Petersburg. Nat\xc3\xa1sha with animated and excited face was telling him\nhow she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost\nher way in the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of\nthe forest, her feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and\nconstantly interrupted her story to say: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t! I\xe2\x80\x99m not telling\nit right; no, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d though he encouraged her by saying\nthat he did understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to\nsay. But Nat\xc3\xa1sha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that\nthey did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced\nthat day and wished to convey. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was such a delightful old man, and\nit was so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\ndescribe it,\xe2\x80\x9d she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andrew smiled\nnow the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nunderstood her,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI not only understood her, but it was just\nthat inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that frankness of soul\xe2\x80\x94that\nvery soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body\xe2\x80\x94it was that\nsoul I loved in her... loved so strongly and happily...\xe2\x80\x9d and suddenly\nhe remembered how his love had ended. \xe2\x80\x9cHe did not need anything of that\nkind. He neither saw nor understood anything of the sort. He only saw in\nher a pretty and fresh young girl, with whom he did not deign to unite\nhis fate. And I?... and he is still alive and gay!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began\npacing up and down in front of the shed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nOn August 25, the eve of the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, M. de Beausset, prefect\nof the French Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s palace, arrived at Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s quarters at\nVal\xc3\xbaevo with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the latter from\nMadrid.\n\nDonning his court uniform, M. de Beausset ordered a box he had\nbrought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first\ncompartment of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s tent, where he began opening the box while\nconversing with Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s aides-de-camp who surrounded him.\n\nFabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking to some\ngenerals of his acquaintance.\n\nThe Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his\ntoilet. Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and\nnow his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing\nhim down. Another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle,\nwas sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s pampered body with an\nexpression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau\nde Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s short hair was wet and\nmatted on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed\nphysical satisfaction. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on, harder, go on!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to the valet\nwho was rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp,\nwho had entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of\nprisoners taken in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s action, was standing by the door after\ndelivering his message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon,\nfrowning, looked at him from under his brows.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo prisoners!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, repeating the aide-de-camp\xe2\x80\x99s words. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\nare forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the Russian\narmy.... Go on... harder, harder!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, hunching his back and\npresenting his fat shoulders.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\nnodding to the aide-de-camp.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire,\xe2\x80\x9d and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the\ntent.\n\nTwo valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of\nthe Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.\n\nDe Beausset\xe2\x80\x99s hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present\nhe had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in front of the\nentrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected\nrapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise.\n\nNapoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were\nnot ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him\na surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to\nhim, listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him\nof the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at\nthe other end of Europe, with but one thought\xe2\x80\x94to be worthy of their\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x94and but one fear\xe2\x80\x94to fail to please him. The result of that\nbattle had been deplorable. Napoleon made ironic remarks during\nFabvier\xe2\x80\x99s account, as if he had not expected that matters could go\notherwise in his absence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must make up for that in Moscow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see you\nlater,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had\nprepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered\nit with a cloth.\n\nDe Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the\nold retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,\npresenting an envelope.\n\nNapoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nasked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial\ntone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, all Paris regrets your absence,\xe2\x80\x9d replied de Beausset as was\nproper.\n\nBut though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this\nkind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was\npleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching his ear.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry to have made you travel so far,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of Moscow,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreplied de Beausset.\n\nNapoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the\nright. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a\ngold snuffbox, which he took.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it has happened luckily for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, raising the open\nsnuffbox to his nose. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are fond of travel, and in three days you\nwill see Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital.\nYou will have a pleasant journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDe Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of\nwhich he had not till then been aware).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were\nlooking at something concealed under a cloth.\n\nWith courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without turning his\nback to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the cloth at the\nsame time, and said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA present to Your Majesty from the Empress.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was a portrait, painted in bright colors by G\xc3\xa9rard, of the son borne\nto Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy whom for\nsome reason everyone called \xe2\x80\x9cThe King of Rome.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine\nMadonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball represented the\nterrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.\n\nThough it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting\nthe so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory\napparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in\nParis, quite clear and very pleasing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King of Rome!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to the portrait with a graceful\ngesture. \xe2\x80\x9cAdmirable!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the expression of\nhis face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look\nof pensive tenderness. He felt that what he now said and did would be\nhistorical, and it seemed to him that it would now be best for him\xe2\x80\x94whose\ngrandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial\nglobe\xe2\x80\x94to show, in contrast to that grandeur, the simplest paternal\ntenderness. His eyes grew dim, he moved forward, glanced round at a\nchair (which seemed to place itself under him), and sat down on it\nbefore the portrait. At a single gesture from him everyone went out on\ntiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and his emotion.\n\nHaving sat still for a while he touched\xe2\x80\x94himself not knowing why\xe2\x80\x94the\nthick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait,\nrose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He ordered the\nportrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed\nround it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of\nRome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.\n\nAnd while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with\nhim, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of the\nofficers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!\xe2\x80\x9d came those\necstatic cries.\n\nAfter breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset\xe2\x80\x99s presence dictated his order of\nthe day to the army.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShort and energetic!\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked when he had read over the\nproclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections. It\nran:\n\nSoldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends on\nyou. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need: comfortable\nquarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you did at\nAusterlitz, Friedland, V\xc3\xadtebsk, and Smol\xc3\xa9nsk. Let our remotest posterity\nrecall your achievements this day with pride. Let it be said of each of\nyou: \xe2\x80\x9cHe was in the great battle before Moscow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore Moscow!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who was\nso fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of the tent\nto where the horses stood saddled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Majesty is too kind!\xe2\x80\x9d replied de Beausset to the invitation to\naccompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride and\nwas afraid of doing so.\n\nBut Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount. When\nNapoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before his\nson\xe2\x80\x99s portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him away!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to\nthe portrait. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too soon for him to see a field of battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDe Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to\nindicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s words.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nOn the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, Napoleon spent\nthe whole day on horseback inspecting the locality, considering plans\nsubmitted to him by his marshals, and personally giving commands to his\ngenerals.\n\nThe original line of the Russian forces along the river Koloch\xc3\xa1 had\nbeen dislocated by the capture of the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt on the\ntwenty-fourth, and part of the line\xe2\x80\x94the left flank\xe2\x80\x94had been drawn back.\nThat part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground\nwas more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to anyone,\nmilitary or not, that it was here the French should attack. It would\nseem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion,\nnor any particular care or trouble on the part of the Emperor and his\nmarshals, nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality\ncalled genius that people are so apt to ascribe to Napoleon; yet the\nhistorians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded\nNapoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.\n\nNapoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound\nair and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously,\nand without communicating to the generals around him the profound\ncourse of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final\nconclusions in the form of commands. Having listened to a suggestion\nfrom Davout, who was now called Prince d\xe2\x80\x99Eckm\xc3\xbchl, to turn the Russian\nleft wing, Napoleon said it should not be done, without explaining\nwhy not. To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to attack the\nfl\xc3\xa8ches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon agreed, though\nthe so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement\nthrough the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division.\n\nHaving inspected the country opposite the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt, Napoleon\npondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two\nbatteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the Russian\nentrenchments, and the places where, in line with them, the field\nartillery should be placed.\n\nAfter giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the\ndispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.\n\nThese dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm\nand other historians with profound respect, were as follows:\n\nAt dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the\nplain occupied by the Prince d\xe2\x80\x99Eckm\xc3\xbchl will open fire on the opposing\nbatteries of the enemy.\n\nAt the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps,\nGeneral Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan\xe2\x80\x99s division and all the\nhowitzers of Dessaix\xe2\x80\x99s and Friant\xe2\x80\x99s divisions, will move forward, open\nfire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s battery, against which\nwill operate:\n\n        24 guns of the artillery of the Guards\n        30 guns of Campan\xe2\x80\x99s division\n\n and     8 guns of Friant\xe2\x80\x99s and Dessaix\xe2\x80\x99s divisions\n        \xe2\x80\x94\n\n in all 62 guns.\n\nThe commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouch\xc3\xa9, will\nplace the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the\nflanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left,\nwhich will have forty guns in all directed against it.\n\nGeneral Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the\nhowitzers of the Guard\xe2\x80\x99s artillery against either one or other of the\nentrenchments.\n\nDuring the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the wood\non the village and turn the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s position.\n\nGeneral Campan will move through the wood to seize the first\nfortification.\n\nAfter the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given in\naccordance with the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s movements.\n\nThe cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the\nright wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morand\xe2\x80\x99s division and of\nthe vice-King\xe2\x80\x99s division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack\ncommence on the right wing.\n\nThe vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges,\nadvancing to the same heights as Morand\xe2\x80\x99s and Gibrard\xe2\x80\x99s divisions, which\nunder his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into\nline with the rest of the forces.\n\nAll this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et\nm\xc3\xa9thode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.\n\nThe Imperial Camp near Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk,\n\nSeptember, 6, 1812.\n\n\nThese dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one allows\noneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius,\nrelated to Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s orders to deal with four points\xe2\x80\x94four different\norders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.\n\nIn the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the\nspot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and Fouch\xc3\xa9; which\nwere to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and\nshower shells on the Russian fl\xc3\xa8ches and redoubts. This could not be\ndone, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not\ncarry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until\nthe nearest commander, contrary to Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, moved them\nforward.\n\nThe second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through the\nwood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done and\nwas not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village through the\nwood, met T\xc3\xbachkov there barring his way, and could not and did not turn\nthe Russian position.\n\nThe third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to seize\nthe first fortification. General Campan\xe2\x80\x99s division did not seize the\nfirst fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood\nit had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was unaware.\n\nThe fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village (Borodin\xc3\xb3)\nand cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as\nMorand\xe2\x80\x99s and G\xc3\xa9rard\xe2\x80\x99s divisions (for whose movements no directions are\ngiven), which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt\nand come into line with the rest of the forces.\n\nAs far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible\nsentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders\ngiven him, he was to advance from the left through Borodin\xc3\xb3 to the\nredoubt while the divisions of Morand and G\xc3\xa9rard were to advance\nsimultaneously from the front.\n\nAll this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could\nnot be executed. After passing through Borodin\xc3\xb3 the vice-King was driven\nback to the Koloch\xc3\xa1 and could get no farther; while the divisions of\nMorand and G\xc3\xa9rard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the\nredoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing\nprobably unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of\nthe orders in the disposition was, or could be, executed. But in the\ndisposition it is said that, after the fight has commenced in this\nmanner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s movements,\nand so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be\nmade by Napoleon during the battle. But this was not and could not be\ndone, for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as\nappeared later, he could not know the course of the battle and not one\nof his orders during the fight could be executed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nMany historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3\nbecause Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the\norders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more\nfull of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world\nhave been changed. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped\nby the will of one man\xe2\x80\x94Peter the Great\xe2\x80\x94and that France from a republic\nbecame an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one\nman\xe2\x80\x94Napoleon\xe2\x80\x94to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a\nbad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing.\n\nIf it had depended on Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s will to fight or not to fight the\nbattle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, and if this or that other arrangement depended on\nhis will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will\nmight have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring\nNapoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been\nthe savior of Russia. Along that line of thought such a deduction is\nindubitable, as indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest\n(without knowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre\nof St. Bartholomew was due to Charles IX\xe2\x80\x99s stomach being deranged. But\nto men who do not admit that Russia was formed by the will of one man,\nPeter I, or that the French Empire was formed and the war with Russia\nbegun by the will of one man, Napoleon, that argument seems not merely\nuntrue and irrational, but contrary to all human reality. To the\nquestion of what causes historic events another answer presents itself,\nnamely, that the course of human events is predetermined from on\nhigh\xe2\x80\x94depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the\nevents, and that a Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s influence on the course of these events is\npurely external and fictitious.\n\nStrange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of\nSt. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX\xe2\x80\x99s will, though he gave the\norder for it and thought it was done as a result of that order; and\nstrange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand\nmen at Borodin\xc3\xb3 was not due to Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s will, though he ordered the\ncommencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done\nbecause he ordered it; strange as these suppositions appear, yet human\ndignity\xe2\x80\x94which tells me that each of us is, if not more at least not less\na man than the great Napoleon\xe2\x80\x94demands the acceptance of that solution of\nthe question, and historic investigation abundantly confirms it.\n\nAt the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.\nThat was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who killed\npeople.\n\nThe French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3\nnot because of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s orders but by their own volition. The whole\narmy\xe2\x80\x94French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch\xe2\x80\x94hungry, ragged, and\nweary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road\nto Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon then\nforbidden them to fight the Russians, they would have killed him and\nhave proceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable.\n\nWhen they heard Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s proclamation offering them, as compensation\nfor mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their having been\nin the battle before Moscow, they cried \xe2\x80\x9cVive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!\xe2\x80\x9d just as they\nhad cried \xe2\x80\x9cVive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!\xe2\x80\x9d at the sight of the portrait of the boy\npiercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would\nhave cried \xe2\x80\x9cVive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!\xe2\x80\x9d at any nonsense that might be told them.\nThere was nothing left for them to do but cry \xe2\x80\x9cVive l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur!\xe2\x80\x9d and go\nto fight, in order to get food and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it\nwas not because of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s commands that they killed their fellow\nmen.\n\nAnd it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for none\nof his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what\nwas going on before him. So the way in which these people killed one\nanother was not decided by Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s will but occurred independently of\nhim, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took\npart in the common action. It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took\nplace by his will. And so the question whether he had or had not a\ncold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the\ntransport soldiers.\n\nMoreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was\nthe cause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former\noccasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as\npreviously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s cold on\nthe twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.\n\nThe dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even\nbetter, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories. His\npseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly, but\nmuch the same as usual. These dispositions and orders only seem worse\nthan previous ones because the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 was the first Napoleon\ndid not win. The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders\nseem very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks\nof importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the\nvery worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people\nfill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a\nbattle that has been won.\n\nThe dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were\na model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were\ncriticized\xe2\x80\x94criticized for their very perfection, for their excessive\nminuteness.\n\nNapoleon at the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 fulfilled his office as\nrepresentative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other\nbattles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he\ninclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not\ncontradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the field of\nbattle, but with his great tact and military experience carried out his\nrole of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nOn returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon remarked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to him\nabout Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empress\xe2\x80\x99\nhousehold, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details\nrelating to the court.\n\nHe showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beausset\xe2\x80\x99s love of\ntravel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who\nknows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron\nwhile a patient is being strapped to the operating table. \xe2\x80\x9cThe matter is\nin my hands and is clear and definite in my head. When the time comes to\nset to work I shall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and\nthe more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you\nought to be, and the more amazed at my genius.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest before\nthe serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day. He\nwas so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep, and\nin spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the\nevening, he went into the large division of the tent at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\nthe morning, loudly blowing his nose. He asked whether the Russians had\nnot withdrawn, and was told that the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fires were still in the\nsame places. He nodded approval.\n\nThe adjutant in attendance came into the tent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?\xe2\x80\x9d Napoleon\nasked him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt, sire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rapp.\n\nNapoleon looked at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk?\xe2\x80\x9d\ncontinued Rapp. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wine is drawn and must be drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNapoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his\nhand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis poor army!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has diminished greatly since\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always said so\nand I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards\nare intact?\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked interrogatively.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Rapp.\n\nNapoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his watch.\nHe was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was impossible\nto give further orders for the sake of killing time, for the orders had\nall been given and were now being executed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the\nGuards?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Napoleon sternly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rice too?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRapp replied that he had given the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s order about the rice, but\nNapoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that\nhis order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch. Napoleon\nordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently sipped his\nown.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have neither taste nor smell,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, sniffing at his glass.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine\xe2\x80\x94what is the good of\nmedicine when it can\xe2\x80\x99t cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t help at all. What can doctors cure? One can\xe2\x80\x99t cure anything.\nOur body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its\nnature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it\nwill do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies.\nOur body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the\nwatchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that\nblindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond,\nNapoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Rapp, what military art is?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the art of\nbeing stronger than the enemy at a given moment. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRapp made no reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTomorrow we shall have to deal with Kut\xc3\xbazov!\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall\nsee! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks\nand did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.... We shall\nsee!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked at his watch. It was still only four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He did not feel\nsleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do. He\nrose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went\nout of the tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible\nmoisture was descending from above. Near by, the campfires were dimly\nburning among the French Guards, and in the distance those of the\nRussian line shone through the smoke. The weather was calm, and the\nrustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to take\nup their positions were clearly audible.\n\nNapoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and\nlistened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in\na shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn\nhimself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon stopped\nin front of him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat year did you enter the service?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with that affectation\nof military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the\nsoldiers.\n\nThe man answered the question.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has, Your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNapoleon nodded and walked away.\n\n\nAt half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shev\xc3\xa1rdino.\n\nIt was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in\nthe east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the\nfaint morning light.\n\nOn the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in\nthe prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a third report\nshook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the\nright.\n\nThe first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out\nand yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.\n\nNapoleon with his suite rode up to the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt where he\ndismounted. The game had begun.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nOn returning to G\xc3\xb3rki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre ordered\nhis groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning,\nand then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner Bor\xc3\xads\nhad given up to him.\n\nBefore he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left\nthe hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was\nshaking him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d he kept repeating\npertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at\nhim, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Has it begun? Is it time?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre asked, waking up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear the firing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the groom, a discharged soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the\ngentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past long\nago.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was bright,\nfresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from behind a\ncloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still half broken\nby the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on the\ndew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on the\nwindows, the fence, and on Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s horses standing before the hut. The\nroar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant accompanied by a\nCossack passed by at a sharp trot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time, Count; it\xe2\x80\x99s time!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the adjutant.\n\nTelling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down the\nstreet to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the\nday before. A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the\nstaff could be heard conversing in French, and Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s gray head in\na white cap with a red band was visible, his gray nape sunk between his\nshoulders. He was looking through a field glass down the highroad before\nhim.\n\nMounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him,\nspellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired from that\nspot the day before, but now the whole place was full of troops and\ncovered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting rays of the\nbright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre, cast upon it\nthrough the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden-tinted\nlight and long dark shadows. The forest at the farthest extremity of\nthe panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green\ncolor; its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and\nwas pierced beyond Val\xc3\xbaevo by the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk highroad crowded with troops.\nNearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses.\nThere were troops to be seen everywhere, in front and to the right and\nleft. All this was vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed\nPierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodin\xc3\xb3\nand the hollows on both sides of the Koloch\xc3\xa1.\n\nAbove the Koloch\xc3\xa1, in Borodin\xc3\xb3 and on both sides of it, especially to\nthe left where the V\xc3\xb3yna flowing between its marshy banks falls into\nthe Koloch\xc3\xa1, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve, and to\nbecome translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored\nand outlined everything. The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist,\nand over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning\nsun were reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, from\nthe dew, and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the\nriverbanks and in Borodin\xc3\xb3. A white church could be seen through the\nmist, and here and there the roofs of huts in Borodin\xc3\xb3 as well as dense\nmasses of soldiers, or green ammunition chests and ordnance. And all\nthis moved, or seemed to move, as the smoke and mist spread out over\nthe whole space. Just as in the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodin\xc3\xb3, so\nalong the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods\nand fields to the left, in the valleys and on the summits of the high\nground, clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of\nnothing, now singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others\ndense, which, swelling, growing, rolling, and blending, extended over\nthe whole expanse.\n\nThese puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of the firing\nproduced the chief beauty of the spectacle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPuff!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from\nviolet into gray and milky white, and \xe2\x80\x9cboom!\xe2\x80\x9d came the report a second\nlater.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPuff! puff!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending\ntogether; and \xe2\x80\x9cboom, boom!\xe2\x80\x9d came the sounds confirming what the eye had\nseen.\n\nPierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a round\ncompact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating\nto one side, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpuff\xe2\x80\x9d (with a pause)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cpuff, puff!\xe2\x80\x9d three and then four\nmore appeared and then from each, with the same interval\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cboom\xe2\x80\x94boom,\nboom!\xe2\x80\x9d came the fine, firm, precise sounds in reply. It seemed as if\nthose smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods,\nfields, and glittering bayonets ran past them. From the left, over\nfields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were continually appearing\nfollowed by their solemn reports, while nearer still, in the hollows and\nwoods, there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time\nto become balls, but had their little echoes in just the same way.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrakh-ta-ta-takh!\xe2\x80\x9d came the frequent crackle of musketry, but it was\nirregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon.\n\nPierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, that\nmovement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kut\xc3\xbazov and his suite,\nto compare his impressions with those of others. They were all looking\nat the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the\nsame feelings. All their faces were now shining with that latent warmth\nof feeling Pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood\nafter his talk with Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov was\nsaying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the\nbattlefield.\n\nHaving received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down\nthe knoll.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the crossing!\xe2\x80\x9d said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one\nof the staff who asked where he was going.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go there too, I too!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, and followed the general.\n\nThe general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went to\nhis groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the quietest,\nclambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes\npressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles\nwere slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins, he\ngalloped after the general, causing the staff officers to smile as they\nwatched him from the knoll.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nHaving descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping\nturned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped\nin among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass\neither in front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers\neverywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with\nsome unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same\ndissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat,\nwho for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horse\xe2\x80\x99s\nhoofs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy ride into the middle of the battalion?\xe2\x80\x9d one of them shouted at him.\n\nAnother prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,\nbending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse,\ngalloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.\n\nThere was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood firing.\nPierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had come to the\nbridge across the Koloch\xc3\xa1 between G\xc3\xb3rki and Borodin\xc3\xb3, which the French\n(having occupied Borodin\xc3\xb3) were attacking in the first phase of the\nbattle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that\nsoldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow,\namong the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the\nsmoke of the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing\ngoing on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle. He did\nnot notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the\nprojectiles that flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side\nof the river, and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded,\nthough many fell near him. He looked about him with a smile which did\nnot leave his face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x99s that fellow in front of the line?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted somebody at him again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the left!... Keep to the right!\xe2\x80\x9d the men shouted to him.\n\nPierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of Ra\xc3\xa9vski\xe2\x80\x99s\nadjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently\nalso intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow have you got here?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and galloped on.\n\nPierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of\ngetting in someone\xe2\x80\x99s way again, galloped after the adjutant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happening here? May I come with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment, one moment!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout\ncolonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and\nthen addressed Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you come here, Count?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cStill\ninquisitive?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Pierre.\n\nBut the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it\xe2\x80\x99s tolerable,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut with Bagrati\xc3\xb3n on the left flank\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re getting it frightfully hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in\nour battery it is still bearable,\xe2\x80\x9d said the adjutant. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come with you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre, looking round for his groom.\n\nIt was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being\ncarried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over the day\nbefore, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his\nhead thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy haven\xe2\x80\x99t they carried him away?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre was about to ask, but seeing\nthe stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way, he\nchecked himself.\n\nPierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the\nadjutant to Ra\xc3\xa9vski\xe2\x80\x99s Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the adjutant\xe2\x80\x99s\nand jolted him at every step.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be used to riding, Count?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the adjutant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo it\xe2\x80\x99s not that, but her action seems so jerky,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre in a\npuzzled tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy... she\xe2\x80\x99s wounded!\xe2\x80\x9d said the adjutant. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the off foreleg above the\nknee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of\nfire!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery\nwhich had been moved forward and was in action, deafening them with the\nnoise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet,\nwith a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up\nthe hill on foot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the general here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,\xe2\x80\x9d someone told him,\npointing to the right.\n\nThe adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble about me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go up onto the knoll if I\nmay?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, do. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see everything from there and it\xe2\x80\x99s less dangerous, and\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll come for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet\nagain, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that\nday.\n\nThe knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known\nto the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Ra\xc3\xa9vski\xe2\x80\x99s Redoubt, and to the\nFrench as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre,\naround which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as\nthe key to the whole position.\n\nThis redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which trenches had\nbeen dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired\nthrough openings in the earthwork.\n\nIn line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired\nincessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When ascending\nthat knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches\nhad been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most\nimportant point of the battle.\n\nOn the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one\nof the least significant parts of the field.\n\nHaving reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench\nsurrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with\nan unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about the\nbattery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers\nwho were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running past\nhim with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being fired\ncontinually one after another with a deafening roar, enveloping the\nwhole neighborhood in powder smoke.\n\nIn contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support,\nhere in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were\nseparated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and\nas it were family feeling of animation.\n\nThe intrusion of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an\nunpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at him with\nsurprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior artillery\nofficer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if\nto see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity.\n\nA young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only just\nout of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two guns\nentrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cpermit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre.\nBut when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat\nwas doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench\nwith a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up\nand down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard,\ntheir feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a\nkindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs,\ncocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the\nregiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him,\ngave him a nickname (\xe2\x80\x9cour gentleman\xe2\x80\x9d), and made kindly fun of him among\nthemselves.\n\nA shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around\nwith a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\xe2\x80\x99s it you\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid, sir, really now?\xe2\x80\x9d a red-faced,\nbroad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set\nof sound, white teeth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else do you expect?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has no mercy, you\nknow! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards. One can\xe2\x80\x99t\nhelp being afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d he said laughing.\n\nSeveral of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre.\nThey seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the\ndiscovery that he did so delighted them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful!\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your places!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young officer to the men gathered round\nPierre.\n\nThe young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or\nsecond time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with\ngreat precision and formality.\n\nThe booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more\nintense over the whole field, especially to the left where Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s\nfl\xc3\xa8ches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it\nalmost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole\nattention was engrossed by watching the family circle\xe2\x80\x94separated from all\nelse\xe2\x80\x94formed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling of\njoyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield\nwas now replaced by another, especially since he had seen that soldier\nlying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he\nobserved the faces of those around him.\n\nBy ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the\nbattery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more\nfrequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around.\nBut the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices\nand jokes were heard on all sides.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA live one!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot this way! To the infantry!\xe2\x80\x9d added another with loud laughter,\nseeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you bowing to a friend, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked another, chaffing a peasant\nwho ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.\n\nSeveral soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see\nwhat was happening in front.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,\xe2\x80\x9d said they, pointing\nover the earthwork.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind your own business,\xe2\x80\x9d an old sergeant shouted at them. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they\xe2\x80\x99ve\nretired it\xe2\x80\x99s because there\xe2\x80\x99s work for them to do farther back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a\nshove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the fifth gun, wheel it up!\xe2\x80\x9d came shouts from one side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, all together, like bargees!\xe2\x80\x9d rose the merry voices of those\nwho were moving the gun.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she nearly knocked our gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s hat off!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the red-faced\nhumorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cAwkward baggage!\xe2\x80\x9d he added\nreproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man\xe2\x80\x99s\nleg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, you foxes!\xe2\x80\x9d said another, laughing at some militiamen who,\nstooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this gruel isn\xe2\x80\x99t to your taste? Oh, you crows! You\xe2\x80\x99re scared!\xe2\x80\x9d they\nshouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg\nhad been torn off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, lads... oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x9d they mimicked the peasants, \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\xe2\x80\x99t like it\nat all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after\nevery loss, the liveliness increased more and more.\n\nAs the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and\nrapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposition to\nwhat was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and\nmore intense glowed in the faces of these men.\n\nPierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know\nwhat was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire\nwhich burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the\nsame way in his own soul.\n\nAt ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of\nthe battery and along the K\xc3\xa1menka streamlet retreated. From the battery\nthey could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on\ntheir muskets. A general with his suite came to the battery, and after\nspeaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look and went away again\nhaving ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down,\nso as to be less exposed to fire. After this from amid the ranks of\ninfantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts\nof command, and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry\nmoved forward.\n\nPierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck\nby a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was walking\nbackwards and kept glancing uneasily around.\n\nThe ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their\nlong-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few\nminutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from\nthat direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the\nbattery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed. Around\nthe cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No one any\nlonger took notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted at for being\nin the way. The senior officer moved with big, rapid strides from one\ngun to another with a frowning face. The young officer, with his face\nstill more flushed, commanded the men more scrupulously than ever. The\nsoldiers handed up the charges, turned, loaded, and did their business\nwith strained smartness. They gave little jumps as they walked, as\nthough they were on springs.\n\nThe stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which\nPierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing beside the\ncommanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his shako, ran up to\nhis superior.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left. Are\nwe to continue firing?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrapeshot!\xe2\x80\x9d the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking\nover the wall of the trench.\n\nSuddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending\ndouble sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing. Everything\nbecame strange, confused, and misty in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\nOne cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a\nsoldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before,\nnow heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre.\n\nA cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was\nstanding, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes\nand at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were\nentering the battery ran back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll with grapeshot!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the officer.\n\nThe sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed\nhim (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of\nsome wine asked for) that there were no more charges.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe scoundrels! What are they doing?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the officer, turning to\nPierre.\n\nThe officer\xe2\x80\x99s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under\nhis frowning brow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!\xe2\x80\x9d he yelled,\nangrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\nThe officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fire.... Wait!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\n\nThe man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, sir, this is no place for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and ran down the slope.\n\nPierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer was\nsitting.\n\nOne cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in front,\nbeside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I going?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition\nwagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to return or go on.\nSuddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground. At the\nsame instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame, and immediately a\ndeafening roar, crackling, and whistling made his ears tingle.\n\nWhen he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his\nhands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed,\nonly charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass, and a\nhorse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it, galloped past, while\nanother horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and\npiercing cries.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nBeside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery,\nas to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.\n\nOn entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something\nthere but that no shots were being fired from the battery. He had no\ntime to realize who these men were. He saw the senior officer lying on\nthe earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something\ndown below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was\nstruggling forward shouting \xe2\x80\x9cBrothers!\xe2\x80\x9d and trying to free himself from\nsome men who were holding him by the arm. He also saw something else\nthat was strange.\n\nBut he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that\nthe soldier shouting \xe2\x80\x9cBrothers!\xe2\x80\x9d was a prisoner, and that another man\nhad been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run\ninto the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue\nuniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something. Instinctively\nguarding against the shock\xe2\x80\x94for they had been running together at full\nspeed before they saw one another\xe2\x80\x94Pierre put out his hands and seized\nthe man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one hand and by the\nthroat with the other. The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by\nhis collar.\n\nFor some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another\xe2\x80\x99s\nunfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and\nwhat they were to do next. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I taken prisoner or have I taken him\nprisoner?\xe2\x80\x9d each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently more\ninclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s strong\nhand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and\ntighter. The Frenchman was about to say something, when just above their\nheads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre\nthat the French officer\xe2\x80\x99s head had been torn off, so swiftly had he\nducked it.\n\nPierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further thought\nas to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to the battery\nand Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who,\nit seemed to him, caught at his feet. But before he reached the foot\nof the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who,\nstumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and wildly toward\nthe battery. (This was the attack for which Erm\xc3\xb3lov claimed the credit,\ndeclaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible:\nit was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some St. George\xe2\x80\x99s\nCrosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to\ntake who got there.)\n\nThe French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops shouting\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult\nto call them back.\n\nThe prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was\na wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds of\nwounded\xe2\x80\x94some known to Pierre and some unknown\xe2\x80\x94Russians and French,\nwith faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were carried on\nstretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto the knoll where\nhe had spent over an hour, and of that family circle which had received\nhim as a member he did not find a single one. There were many dead whom\nhe did not know, but some he recognized. The young officer still sat in\nthe same way, bent double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth\nwall. The red-faced man was still twitching, but they did not carry him\naway.\n\nPierre ran down the slope once more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have\ndone!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers\nmoving from the battlefield.\n\nBut behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front and\nespecially to the left, near Sem\xc3\xabnovsk, something seemed to be seething\nin the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish, but\neven increased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks\nwith all his remaining strength.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nThe chief action of the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 was fought within the seven\nthousand feet between Borodin\xc3\xb3 and Bagrati\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s fl\xc3\xa8ches. Beyond that\nspace there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the Russians\nwith Uv\xc3\xa1rov\xe2\x80\x99s cavalry at midday, and on the other side, beyond Ut\xc3\xadtsa,\nPoniatowski\xe2\x80\x99s collision with T\xc3\xbachkov; but these two were detached and\nfeeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the\nbattlefield. On the field between Borodin\xc3\xb3 and the fl\xc3\xa8ches, beside the\nwood, the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible\nfrom both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.\n\nThe battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred\nguns.\n\nThen when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions,\nCampan\xe2\x80\x99s and Dessaix\xe2\x80\x99s, advanced from the French right, while Murat\xe2\x80\x99s\ntroops advanced on Borodin\xc3\xb3 from their left.\n\nFrom the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the fl\xc3\xa8ches were\ntwo thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow flies\nto Borodin\xc3\xb3, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there,\nespecially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality.\nThe soldiers of Dessaix\xe2\x80\x99s division advancing against the fl\xc3\xa8ches could\nonly be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and\nthe fl\xc3\xa8ches. As soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke\nof the guns and musketry on the fl\xc3\xa8ches grew so dense that it covered\nthe whole approach on that side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could\nbe caught of something black\xe2\x80\x94probably men\xe2\x80\x94and at times the glint of\nbayonets. But whether they were moving or stationary, whether they were\nFrench or Russian, could not be discovered from the Shev\xc3\xa1rdino Redoubt.\n\nThe sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at the\nfl\xc3\xa8ches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if\nthe smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved. Sometimes shouts\nwere heard through the firing, but it was impossible to tell what was\nbeing done there.\n\nNapoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and in\nits small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes\nRussians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he could not tell\nwhere what he had seen was.\n\nHe descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.\n\nOccasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed intently at\nthe battlefield.\n\nBut not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where\nhe was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which some of his\ngenerals had taken their stand, but even from the fl\xc3\xa8ches themselves\xe2\x80\x94in\nwhich by this time there were now Russian and now French soldiers,\nalternately or together, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or\nmaddened\xe2\x80\x94even at those fl\xc3\xa8ches themselves it was impossible to make out\nwhat was taking place. There for several hours amid incessant cannon and\nmusketry fire, now Russians were seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now\ninfantry, and now cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not\nknowing what to do with one another, screamed, and ran back again.\n\nFrom the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his\nmarshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress\nof the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was\nimpossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given\nmoment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place\nof conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also\nbecause while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon\ncircumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming\nfalse. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings that\nBorodin\xc3\xb3 had been occupied and the bridge over the Koloch\xc3\xa1 was in the\nhands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the\ntroops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up\non the farther side and wait. But before that order was given\xe2\x80\x94almost\nas soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodin\xc3\xb3\xe2\x80\x94the bridge had been\nretaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at which Pierre\nhad been present at the beginning of the battle.\n\nAn adjutant galloped up from the fl\xc3\xa8ches with a pale and frightened face\nand reported to Napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, Campan\nwounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant had been\ntold that the French had been repulsed, the fl\xc3\xa8ches had in fact been\nrecaptured by other French troops, and Davout was alive and only\nslightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy\nreports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either been executed before\nhe gave them or could not be and were not executed.\n\nThe marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle\nbut, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only\noccasionally went within musket range, made their own arrangements\nwithout asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to\nfire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But even\ntheir orders, like Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s, were seldom carried out, and then but\npartially. For the most part things happened contrary to their orders.\nSoldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers\nordered to remain where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians\nunexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward,\nand the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians.\nIn this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the Sem\xc3\xabnovsk hollow\nand as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and\ngalloped full speed back again. The infantry moved in the same way,\nsometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to\ngo to. All orders as to where and when to move the guns, when to send\ninfantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantry\xe2\x80\x94all\nsuch orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the\nunits concerned, without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less\nNapoleon. They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling\norders or for acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at\nstake is what is dearest to man\xe2\x80\x94his own life\xe2\x80\x94and it sometimes seems that\nsafety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these men\nwho were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood\nof the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward and\nbackward did not improve or alter the position of the troops. All\ntheir rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the harm of\ndisablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over\nthe fields on which these men were floundering about. As soon as they\nleft the place where the balls and bullets were flying about, their\nsuperiors, located in the background, re-formed them and brought them\nunder discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them\nback to the zone of fire, where under the influence of fear of death\nthey lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance\npromptings of the throng.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s generals\xe2\x80\x94Davout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that region of\nfire and sometimes even entered it\xe2\x80\x94repeatedly led into it huge masses of\nwell-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always happened in their\nformer battles, instead of the news they expected of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s flight,\nthese orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs.\nThe generals re-formed them, but their numbers constantly decreased.\nIn the middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant to Napoleon to demand\nreinforcements.\n\nNapoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when Murat\xe2\x80\x99s\nadjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would be routed\nif His Majesty would let him have another division.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReinforcements?\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at\nthe adjutant\xe2\x80\x94a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like Murat\xe2\x80\x99s\nown\xe2\x80\x94as though he did not understand his words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReinforcements!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Napoleon to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can they need\nreinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a\nweak, unentrenched Russian wing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell the King of Naples,\xe2\x80\x9d said he sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is not noon yet,\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without\nremoving his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being\nslaughtered.\n\nNapoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began\ntalking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.\n\nIn the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest\nNapoleon, Berthier\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned to look at a general with a suite, who\nwas galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was Belliard.\nHaving dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in\na loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending\nreinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians were lost if the\nEmperor would give another division.\n\nNapoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down\nwithout replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the\ngenerals of the suite around him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very fiery, Belliard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon, when he again came up to\nthe general. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake. Go\nand have another look and then come back to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBefore Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of the\nbattlefield galloped up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Napoleon in the tone of a man\nirritated at being continually disturbed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, the prince...\xe2\x80\x9d began the adjutant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsks for reinforcements?\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon with an angry gesture.\n\nThe adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but the\nEmperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came back, and\ncalled Berthier.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must give reserves,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, moving his arms slightly apart.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho do you think should be sent there?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of Berthier (whom he\nsubsequently termed \xe2\x80\x9cthat gosling I have made an eagle\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend Clapar\xc3\xa8de\xe2\x80\x99s division, sire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Berthier, who knew all the\ndivision\xe2\x80\x99s regiments, and battalions by heart.\n\nNapoleon nodded assent.\n\nThe adjutant galloped to Clapar\xc3\xa8de\xe2\x80\x99s division and a few minutes later\nthe Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward. Napoleon\ngazed silently in that direction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly said to Berthier. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t send Clapar\xc3\xa8de. Send\nFriant\xe2\x80\x99s division.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough there was no advantage in sending Friant\xe2\x80\x99s division instead of\nClapar\xc3\xa8de\xe2\x80\x99s, and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping\nClapar\xc3\xa8de and sending Friant now, the order was carried out exactly.\nNapoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing\nthe part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines\xe2\x80\x94a role he so justly\nunderstood and condemned.\n\nFriant\xe2\x80\x99s division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke\nof the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a\ngallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all asked\nfor reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding their\npositions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the French army was\nmelting away.\n\nNapoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.\n\nM. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since morning,\ncame up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to His\nMajesty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nNapoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the negation to\nrefer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de Beausset ventured\nwith respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not\nhaving lunch when one can get it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away...\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned aside.\n\nA beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M. de\nBeausset\xe2\x80\x99s face and he glided away to the other generals.\n\nNapoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an\never-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and always\nwinning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the\ngame, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he\nloses.\n\nHis troops were the same, his generals the same, the same preparations\nhad been made, the same dispositions, and the same proclamation courte\net \xc3\xa9nergique, he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that\nhe was now even more experienced and skillful than before. Even the\nenemy was the same as at Austerlitz and Friedland\xe2\x80\x94yet the terrible\nstroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent.\n\nAll the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success: the\nconcentration of batteries on one point, an attack by reserves to break\nthe enemy\xe2\x80\x99s line, and a cavalry attack by \xe2\x80\x9cthe men of iron,\xe2\x80\x9d all these\nmethods had already been employed, yet not only was there no victory,\nbut from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded,\nof reinforcements needed, of the impossibility of driving back the\nRussians, and of disorganization among his own troops.\n\nFormerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a\nfew phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with\ncongratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the\ncorps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon and\nstores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather\nin the baggage wagons. So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena,\nAusterlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was happening\nto his troops.\n\nDespite news of the capture of the fl\xc3\xa8ches, Napoleon saw that this was\nnot the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former\nbattles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about\nhim experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked dejected, and\nthey all shunned one another\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\xe2\x80\x94only a de Beausset could fail to\ngrasp the meaning of what was happening.\n\nBut Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of\na battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all\nefforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that\nthe least accident might now\xe2\x80\x94with the fight balanced on such a strained\ncenter\xe2\x80\x94destroy him and his army.\n\nWhen he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in\nwhich not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon,\nor army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the\nconcealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the\nRussians still holding their ground\xe2\x80\x94a terrible feeling like a nightmare\ntook possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy\nhim occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall on his left wing,\nmight break through his center, he himself might be killed by a stray\ncannon ball. All this was possible. In former battles he had only\nconsidered the possibilities of success, but now innumerable unlucky\nchances presented themselves, and he expected them all. Yes, it was like\na dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him,\nand raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows\nshould annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and\nlimp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in\nhis helplessness.\n\nThe news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French\narmy aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a campstool\nbelow the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees. Berthier\napproached and suggested that they should ride along the line to\nascertain the position of affairs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Napoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, tell them to bring me my\nhorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe mounted and rode toward Sem\xc3\xabnovsk.\n\nAmid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space through\nwhich Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of blood, singly\nor in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before\nseen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area. The roar of\nguns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave\na peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux\nvivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at Sem\xc3\xabnovsk, and through the\nsmoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They\nwere Russians.\n\nThe Russians stood in serried ranks behind Sem\xc3\xabnovsk village and its\nknoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent\nforth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a continuous\nslaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the\nRussians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie\nfrom which Berthier had aroused him. He could not stop what was going on\nbefore him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to\ndepend on him, and from its lack of success this affair, for the first\ntime, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.\n\nOne of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to lead\nthe Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near Napoleon,\nexchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general\xe2\x80\x99s senseless\noffer.\n\nNapoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard\ndestroyed!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shev\xc3\xa1rdino.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nOn the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat\nKut\xc3\xbazov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no\norders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, do that,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied to various proposals. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes: go,\ndear boy, and have a look,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say to one or another of those\nabout him; or, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t, we\xe2\x80\x99d better wait!\xe2\x80\x9d He listened to the reports\nthat were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded\nthat of him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he\nwere not interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in\nsomething else\xe2\x80\x94in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who\nwere reporting. By long years of military experience he knew, and with\nthe wisdom of age understood, that it is impossible for one man to\ndirect hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death, and he\nknew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a\ncommander in chief, nor the place where the troops are stationed, nor by\nthe number of cannon or of slaughtered men, but by that intangible force\ncalled the spirit of the army, and he watched this force and guided it\nin as far as that was in his power.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention,\nand his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master\nthe fatigue of his old and feeble body.\n\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock they brought him news that the fl\xc3\xa8ches captured by the\nFrench had been retaken, but that Prince Bagrati\xc3\xb3n was wounded. Kut\xc3\xbazov\ngroaned and swayed his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRide over to Prince Peter Iv\xc3\xa1novich and find out about it exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of W\xc3\xbcrttemberg\nwho was standing behind him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Your Highness please take command of the first army?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSoon after the duke\xe2\x80\x99s departure\xe2\x80\x94before he could possibly have reached\nSem\xc3\xabnovsk\xe2\x80\x94his adjutant came back from him and told Kut\xc3\xbazov that the duke\nasked for more troops.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokht\xc3\xbarov to take over the\ncommand of the first army, and a request to the duke\xe2\x80\x94whom he said he\ncould not spare at such an important moment\xe2\x80\x94to return to him. When\nthey brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the staff\nofficers congratulated him, Kut\xc3\xbazov smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe battle is won, and there is\nnothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better to\nwait before we rejoice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.\n\nWhen Scherb\xc3\xadnin came galloping from the left flank with news that the\nFrench had captured the fl\xc3\xa8ches and the village of Sem\xc3\xabnovsk, Kut\xc3\xbazov,\nguessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherb\xc3\xadnin\xe2\x80\x99s looks that the\nnews was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking Scherb\xc3\xadnin\xe2\x80\x99s\narm, led him aside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Erm\xc3\xb3lov, \xe2\x80\x9cand see whether something\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov was in G\xc3\xb3rki, near the center of the Russian position. The\nattack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several\ntimes repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond Borodin\xc3\xb3,\nand on their left flank Uv\xc3\xa1rov\xe2\x80\x99s cavalry had put the French to flight.\n\nToward three o\xe2\x80\x99clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of all\nwho came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him,\nKut\xc3\xbazov noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was satisfied with\nthe day\xe2\x80\x99s success\xe2\x80\x94a success exceeding his expectations, but the old\nman\xe2\x80\x99s strength was failing him. Several times his head dropped low as if\nit were falling and he dozed off. Dinner was brought him.\n\nAdjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince Andrew\nhad said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe war should be extended widely,\xe2\x80\x9d and whom Bagrati\xc3\xb3n so\ndetested, rode up while Kut\xc3\xbazov was at dinner. Wolzogen had come from\nBarclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank.\nThe sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of wounded men running\nback and the disordered rear of the army, weighed all the circumstances,\nconcluded that the battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer to the\ncommander in chief with that news.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced\nat Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids.\n\nWolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kut\xc3\xbazov with a\nhalf-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak of his\ncap.\n\nHe treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance\nintended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left it to\nRussians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that he knew whom\nhe was dealing with. \xe2\x80\x9cDer alte Herr\xe2\x80\x9d (as in their own set the Germans\ncalled Kut\xc3\xbazov) \xe2\x80\x9cis making himself very comfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Wolzogen,\nand looking severely at the dishes in front of Kut\xc3\xbazov he began to\nreport to \xe2\x80\x9cthe old gentleman\xe2\x80\x9d the position of affairs on the left flank\nas Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood\nit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the points of our position are in the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s hands and we cannot\ndislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away and it is\nimpossible to stop them,\xe2\x80\x9d he reported.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, as\nif not understanding what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing \xe2\x80\x9cthe old\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d agitation, said with a smile:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness\nwhat I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen? You have seen?...\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov shouted. Frowning and rising\nquickly, he went up to Wolzogen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow... how dare you!...\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, choking and making a threatening\ngesture with his trembling arms: \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you, sir, say that to me? You\nknow nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me that his information\nis incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to\nme, the commander in chief, than to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kut\xc3\xbazov interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right\nflank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform\nhim of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov\nsternly.\n\nAll were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of\nthe panting old general.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave army!\nThe enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred\nsoil of Russia,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov crossing himself, and he suddenly sobbed\nas his eyes filled with tears.\n\nWolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped silently\naside, marveling at \xe2\x80\x9cthe old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d conceited stupidity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here he is, my hero!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov to a portly, handsome,\ndark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.\n\nThis was Ra\xc3\xa9vski, who had spent the whole day at the most important part\nof the field of Borodin\xc3\xb3.\n\nRa\xc3\xa9vski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and\nthat the French no longer ventured to attack.\n\nAfter hearing him, Kut\xc3\xbazov said in French:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you do not think, like some others, that we must retreat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is always\nthe most stubborn who remain victors,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ra\xc3\xa9vski, \xe2\x80\x9cand in my\nopinion...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKays\xc3\xa1rov!\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov called to his adjutant. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down and write out\nthe order of the day for tomorrow. And you,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, addressing\nanother, \xe2\x80\x9cride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile Kut\xc3\xbazov was talking to Ra\xc3\xa9vski and dictating the order of the day,\nWolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General Barclay wished to\nhave written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the order to\nbe written out which the former commander in chief, to avoid personal\nresponsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.\n\nAnd by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains\nthroughout an army one and the same temper, known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe spirit of\nthe army,\xe2\x80\x9d and which constitutes the sinew of war, Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s words, his\norder for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of\nthe army to the other.\n\nIt was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the\nfarthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at\ndifferent ends of the army did not even resemble what Kut\xc3\xbazov had said,\nbut the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was\nnot the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in\nthe commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s soul as in that of every Russian.\n\nAnd on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing\nfrom the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe,\nthe exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s regiment was among the reserves which till after one\no\xe2\x80\x99clock were stationed inactive behind Sem\xc3\xabnovsk, under heavy artillery\nfire. Toward two o\xe2\x80\x99clock the regiment, having already lost more than\ntwo hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap\nbetween Sem\xc3\xabnovsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men perished\nthat day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred\nenemy guns was directed between one and two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\n\nWithout moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here\nlost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the\nright, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious\ndomain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing\ncannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly. At times, as\nif to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed during which\nthe cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men\nwere torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually\nbeing dragged away and the wounded carried off.\n\nWith each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not\nyet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred\npaces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same\nmood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the\nranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful\nshot and the cry of \xe2\x80\x9cstretchers!\xe2\x80\x9d was heard. Most of the time, by their\nofficers\xe2\x80\x99 order, the men sat on the ground. One, having taken off his\nshako, carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight\nagain; another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished\nhis bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his\nbandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put\nhis boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed\nground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All seemed\nfully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when\nrows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated, and when great\nmasses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any\nattention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or\nsome of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval\nwere heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by\noccurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was\nas if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,\ncommonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of\nthe regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She\xe2\x80\x99ll fall.... Ah,\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t see it!\xe2\x80\x9d came identical shouts from the ranks all along the\nregiment. Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown\ndog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner\nin front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell\nclose by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted\naside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But\nsuch distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had\nbeen inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale\nand gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.\n\nPrince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up\nand down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the\nmeadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back.\nThere was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given. Everything\nwent on of itself. The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded\ncarried away, and the ranks closed up. If any soldiers ran to the\nrear they returned immediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew,\nconsidering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them\nan example, walked about among the ranks, but he soon became convinced\nthat this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach\nthem. All the powers of his soul, as of every soldier there, were\nunconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their\nsituation. He walked along the meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the\ngrass, and gazing at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big\nstrides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the\nmowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often he must walk\nfrom one strip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers\nfrom the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his\npalms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained\nof the previous day\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with\nweary ears to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle\nof flying projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the\ntiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and\nwaited. \xe2\x80\x9cHere it comes... this one is coming our way again!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought,\nlistening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. \xe2\x80\x9cOne,\nanother! Again! It has hit....\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped and looked at the ranks. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\nit has gone over. But this one has hit!\xe2\x80\x9d And again he started trying\nto reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five\npaces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A\nchill ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many\nhad been hit\xe2\x80\x94a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdjutant!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cOrder them not to crowd together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew.\nFrom the other side a battalion commander rode up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out!\xe2\x80\x9d came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird\nwhirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped\nwith little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the\nbattalion commander\xe2\x80\x99s horse. The horse first, regardless of whether it\nwas right or wrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the\nmajor, and galloped aside. The horse\xe2\x80\x99s terror infected the men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie down!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.\n\nPrince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between him\nand the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and\nthe meadow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan this be death?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new,\nenvious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke\nthat curled up from the rotating black ball. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot, I do not wish to\ndie. I love life\xe2\x80\x94I love this grass, this earth, this air....\xe2\x80\x9d He thought\nthis, and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s shameful, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the adjutant. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound of\nan explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame,\na suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started to one side,\nraising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several officers ran up to him.\nFrom the right side of his abdomen, blood was welling out making a large\nstain on the grass.\n\nThe militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the\nofficers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass,\nbreathing heavily and noisily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you waiting for? Come along!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but he\nmoaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPick him up, lift him, it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same!\xe2\x80\x9d cried someone.\n\nThey again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My\nGod!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94voices among the officers were heard saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt flew a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth past my ear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the adjutant.\n\nThe peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started\nhurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing station.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep in step! Ah... those peasants!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted an officer, seizing by\ntheir shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly and\njolting the stretcher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet into step, F\xc3\xabdor... I say, F\xc3\xabdor!\xe2\x80\x9d said the foremost peasant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that\xe2\x80\x99s right!\xe2\x80\x9d said the one behind joyfully, when he had got into\nstep.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency! Eh, Prince!\xe2\x80\x9d said the trembling voice of Tim\xc3\xb3khin, who\nhad run up and was looking down on the stretcher.\n\nPrince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the\nstretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids\ndrooped.\n\n\nThe militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the\nwood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of\nthree tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood.\nIn the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating\noats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the\ngrains that fell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among the birch\ntrees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than five acres,\nbloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded\nstood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive\nfaces, whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the\nspot. Disregarding the officers\xe2\x80\x99 orders, the soldiers stood leaning\nagainst their stretchers and gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend\nthe difficult problem of what was taking place before them. From the\ntents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans. Occasionally\ndressers ran out to fetch water, or to point out those who were to be\nbrought in next. The wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents\ngroaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for vodka. Some were\ndelirious. Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s bearers, stepping over the wounded who had\nnot yet been bandaged, took him, as a regimental commander, close up to\none of the tents and there stopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew\nopened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going\non around him. He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the\nwhirling black ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life.\nTwo steps from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and\nattracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired\nnoncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in the\nhead and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, a\ncrowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we grabbed\nthe King himself!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, looking around him with eyes that glittered\nwith fever. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only reserves had come up just then, lads, there\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLike all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him with\nshining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it all the\nsame now?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will be there, and what has there been\nhere? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was something in\nthis life I did not and do not understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nOne of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron,\nholding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small\nbloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head and looked\nabout him, but above the level of the wounded men. He evidently wanted a\nlittle respite. After turning his head from right to left for some time,\nhe sighed and looked down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince\nAndrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.\n\nMurmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a\nchance!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked one.\n\nPrince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been\ncleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince Andrew could not\nmake out distinctly what was in that tent. The pitiful groans from all\nsides and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted\nhim. All he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked,\nbleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as\na few weeks previously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled\nthe dirty pond beside the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk road. Yes, it was the same flesh,\nthe same chair \xc3\xa0 canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with\nhorror, as by a presentiment.\n\nThere were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied, and\non the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he was left\nalone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two\ntables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by\nthe uniform thrown down beside him. Four soldiers were holding him, and\na spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOoh, ooh, ooh!\xe2\x80\x9d grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy\nsnub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth,\nhe began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing,\nand prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many people were\ncrowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back.\nHis curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely\nfamiliar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his chest\nto hold him down. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all\nthe time with a feverish tremor. The man was sobbing and choking\nconvulsively. Two doctors\xe2\x80\x94one of whom was pale and trembling\xe2\x80\x94were\nsilently doing something to this man\xe2\x80\x99s other, gory leg. When he had\nfinished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, the\nspectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.\n\nHe glanced at Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s face and quickly turned away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndress him! What are you waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried angrily to the\ndressers.\n\nHis very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince\nAndrew\xe2\x80\x99s mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to\nundo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent\ndown over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign to\nsomeone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to\nlose consciousness. When he came to himself the splintered portions of\nhis thighbone had been extracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the\nwound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon as Prince\nAndrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on the\nlips, and hurried away.\n\nAfter the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a\nblissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All the\nbest and happiest moments of his life\xe2\x80\x94especially his earliest childhood,\nwhen he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when leaning over him\nhis nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head in the pillow,\nfelt happy in the mere consciousness of life\xe2\x80\x94returned to his memory, not\nmerely as something past but as something present.\n\nThe doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose\nhead seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and\ntrying to quiet him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!\xe2\x80\x9d his frightened moans could\nbe heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.\n\nHearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep. Whether because he\nwas dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life,\nor because of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or\nbecause he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him\nwas groaning so piteously\xe2\x80\x94he felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and\nalmost happy tears.\n\nThe wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood\nand with the boot still on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh, ooh!\xe2\x80\x9d he sobbed, like a woman.\n\nThe doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew\nfrom seeing his face, moved away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! What is this? Why is he here?\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew to himself.\n\nIn the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been\namputated, he recognized Anatole Kur\xc3\xa1gin. Men were supporting him in\ntheir arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, swollen\nlips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is\nhe! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the connection of that man with my childhood and life?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nasked himself without finding an answer. And suddenly a new unexpected\nmemory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to\nhim. He remembered Nat\xc3\xa1sha as he had seen her for the first time at the\nball in 1810, with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy\nface ready for rapture, and love and tenderness for her, stronger\nand more vivid than ever, awoke in his soul. He now remembered the\nconnection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly\ngazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes. He remembered\neverything, and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy\nheart.\n\nPrince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving\ntears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and their errors.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for those\nwho hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God preached on\nearth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not understand\xe2\x80\x94that is\nwhat made me sorry to part with life, that is what remained for me had I\nlived. But now it is too late. I know it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nThe terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded,\ntogether with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty\ngenerals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the\nconsciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an\nunexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to look at the\nkilled and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of\nmind. This day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame\nthat strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his\ngreatness. He rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the\nShev\xc3\xa1rdino knoll, where he sat on his campstool, his sallow face\nswollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his nose red, and his voice hoarse,\ninvoluntarily listening, with downcast eyes, to the sounds of firing.\nWith painful dejection he awaited the end of this action, in which he\nregarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest.\nA personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the\nartificial phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt in his own\nperson the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield.\nThe heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility\nof suffering and death for himself. At that moment he did not desire\nMoscow, or victory, or glory (what need had he for any more glory?). The\none thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he\nhad been on the Sem\xc3\xabnovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed\nto him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to\nstrengthen the fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazk\xc3\xb3vo.\nNapoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought\nto him of the effect those batteries produced.\n\nAn adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns\nhad been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they\nstill held their ground.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nadjutant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want more!...\xe2\x80\x9d said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want more!\xe2\x80\x9d croaked Napoleon frowning. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them have it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEven before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for\nwhich he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him,\nwas being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary\ngreatness, and again\xe2\x80\x94as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing\nsomething for itself\xe2\x80\x94he submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy,\nand inhuman role predestined for him.\n\nAnd not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience\ndarkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening\nlay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the end\nof his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the\nsignificance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and\ntruth, too remote from everything human, for him ever to be able to\ngrasp their meaning. He could not disavow his actions, belauded as they\nwere by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth, goodness, and\nall humanity.\n\nNot only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men\nkilled and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as he\nlooked at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and,\ndeceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that\nthere were five Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone\ndid he write in a letter to Paris that \xe2\x80\x9cthe battle field was superb,\xe2\x80\x9d\nbecause fifty thousand corpses lay there, but even on the island of St.\nHelena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his\nleisure to an account of the great deeds he had done, he wrote:\n\nThe Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times:\nit was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and\nsecurity of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.\n\nIt was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the\nbeginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening out,\nfull of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system was\nalready founded; all that remained was to organize it.\n\nSatisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I\ntoo should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were\nstolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have\ndiscussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account to\nthe peoples as clerk to master.\n\nEurope would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people, and\nanyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the\ncommon fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all navigable\nrivers for everybody, that the seas should be common to all, and that\nthe great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards\nfor the sovereigns.\n\nOn returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, magnificent,\npeaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have proclaimed\nher frontiers immutable; all future wars purely defensive, all\naggrandizement antinational. I should have associated my son in the\nEmpire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and his constitutional\nreign would have begun.\n\nParis would have been the capital of the world, and the French the envy\nof the nations!\n\nMy leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company\nwith the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to\nleisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country couple,\nevery corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing wrongs,\nand scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and\neverywhere.\n\nNapoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner\nof the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the\npeoples\xe2\x80\x99 welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by\nthe employment of power confer benefactions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote further\nof the Russian war, \xe2\x80\x9chalf were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles,\nBavarians, W\xc3\xbcrttembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and\nNeapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third\ncomposed of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine,\nPiedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the\nThirty-second Military Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on: it\nincluded scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French. The\nRussian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand men;\nthe Russian army in its retreat from V\xc3\xadlna to Moscow lost in the various\nbattles four times more men than the French army; the burning of Moscow\ncost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died of cold and want\nin the woods; finally, in its march from Moscow to the Oder the Russian\narmy also suffered from the severity of the season; so that by the time\nit reached V\xc3\xadlna it numbered only fifty thousand, and at K\xc3\xa1lisch less\nthan eighteen thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the\nhorrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the\nwhole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found\njustification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who\nperished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nSeveral tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and\nvarious uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the Dav\xc3\xbddov\nfamily and to the crown serfs\xe2\x80\x94those fields and meadows where for\nhundreds of years the peasants of Borodin\xc3\xb3, G\xc3\xb3rki, Shev\xc3\xa1rdino, and\nSem\xc3\xabnovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. At the\ndressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space\nof some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms, wounded and\nunwounded, with frightened faces, dragged themselves back to Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk\nfrom the one army and back to Val\xc3\xbaevo from the other. Other crowds,\nexhausted and hungry, went forward led by their officers. Others held\ntheir ground and continued to fire.\n\nOver the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of\nbayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now spread a\nmist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood.\nClouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded,\non the frightened, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: \xe2\x80\x9cEnough,\nmen! Enough! Cease... bethink yourselves! What are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTo the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest,\nit began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to\nslaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the\nquestion arose in every soul: \xe2\x80\x9cFor what, for whom, must I kill and be\nkilled?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do\nso any more!\xe2\x80\x9d By evening this thought had ripened in every soul. At any\nmoment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were\ndoing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere.\n\nBut though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of\nwhat they were doing, though they would have been glad to leave off,\nsome incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to control them, and\nthey still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match,\nthough only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though\nthey stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood\nand powder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both\nsides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done\nby the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds\ncontinued.\n\nAnyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would have\nsaid that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it would\ndisappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have\nsaid that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the\nFrench would be destroyed. But neither the French nor the Russians made\nthat effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly out.\n\nThe Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking\nthe French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the\nway to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the\nbeginning. But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French\nfrom their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all\nthe Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian\narmy that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their\npositions they had lost ONE HALF of their army.\n\nThe French, with the memory of all their former victories during\nfifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s invincibility, with the\nconsciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had\nlost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact,\ntwenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. The French\nwho had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its position\nought to have made that effort, for as long as the Russians continued to\nblock the road to Moscow as before, the aim of the French had not been\nattained and all their efforts and losses were in vain. But the French\ndid not make that effort. Some historians say that Napoleon need only\nhave used his Old Guards, who were intact, and the battle would have\nbeen won. To speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his\nGuards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring. It\ncould not be. Napoleon did not give his Guards, not because he did not\nwant to, but because it could not be done. All the generals, officers,\nand soldiers of the French army knew it could not be done, because the\nflagging spirit of the troops would not permit it.\n\nIt was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling\nof the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and\nsoldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not,\nafter all their experience of previous battles\xe2\x80\x94when after one tenth of\nsuch efforts the enemy had fled\xe2\x80\x94experienced a similar feeling of terror\nbefore an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as threateningly\nat the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral force of the\nattacking French army was exhausted. Not that sort of victory which is\ndefined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks, called\nstandards, and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were\nstanding, but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral\nsuperiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the\nRussians at Borodin\xc3\xb3. The French invaders, like an infuriated animal\nthat has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were\nperishing, but could not stop, any more than the Russian army, weaker\nby one half, could help swerving. By impetus gained, the French army was\nstill able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, without further effort\non the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal\nwound it had received at Borodin\xc3\xb3. The direct consequence of the battle\nof Borodin\xc3\xb3 was Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat\nalong the old Smol\xc3\xa9nsk road, the destruction of the invading army of\nfive hundred thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on\nwhich at Borodin\xc3\xb3 for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger\nspirit had been laid.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN: 1812\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nAbsolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind.\nLaws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he\nexamines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but at the\nsame time, a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary\ndivision of continuous motion into discontinuous elements. There is a\nwell-known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that\nAchilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following, in spite\nof the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise. By\nthe time Achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the\ntortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead\nof him: when Achilles has covered that tenth, the tortoise has covered\nanother one hundredth, and so on forever. This problem seemed to\nthe ancients insoluble. The absurd answer (that Achilles could never\novertake the tortoise) resulted from this: that motion was arbitrarily\ndivided into discontinuous elements, whereas the motion both of Achilles\nand of the tortoise was continuous.\n\nBy adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a\nsolution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we have admitted\nthe conception of the infinitely small, and the resulting geometrical\nprogression with a common ratio of one tenth, and have found the sum of\nthis progression to infinity, do we reach a solution of the problem.\n\nA modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with\nthe infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex\nproblems of motion which used to appear insoluble.\n\nThis modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when dealing\nwith problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small,\nand so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute continuity)\nand thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot\navoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of\nexamining continuous motion.\n\nIn seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens.\nThe movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary\nhuman wills, is continuous.\n\nTo understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of\nhistory. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all\nthose human wills, man\xe2\x80\x99s mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected\nunits. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected\nseries of continuous events and examine it apart from others, though\nthere is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event always\nflows uninterruptedly from another.\n\nThe second method is to consider the actions of some one man\xe2\x80\x94a king or a\ncommander\xe2\x80\x94as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills; whereas the\nsum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single\nhistoric personage.\n\nHistorical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually\ntakes smaller and smaller units for examination. But however small the\nunits it takes, we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others,\nor to assume a beginning of any phenomenon, or to say that the will of\nmany men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage, is\nin itself false.\n\nIt needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions\ndrawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some larger or\nsmaller unit as the subject of observation\xe2\x80\x94as criticism has every\nright to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be\narbitrarily selected.\n\nOnly by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the\ndifferential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men) and\nattaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum of\nthese infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.\n\nThe first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe present an\nextraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave their customary\npursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other, plunder and\nslaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair, and for some\nyears the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive\nmovement which first increases and then slackens. What was the cause of\nthis movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the mind of man.\n\nThe historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings and\ndoings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris, calling\nthese sayings and doings \xe2\x80\x9cthe Revolution\xe2\x80\x9d; then they give a detailed\nbiography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him;\ntell of the influence some of these people had on others, and say: that\nis why this movement took place and those are its laws.\n\nBut the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation, but\nplainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious, because in\nit a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger. The sum of\nhuman wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and only the sum of\nthose wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors;\nevery time there has been a revolution in any state there have been\ngreat men,\xe2\x80\x9d says history. And, indeed, human reason replies: every time\nconquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the\nconquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of\na war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my\nwatch and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring\nchurch; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock\nreach ten, I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is\ncaused by the position of the hands of the watch.\n\nWhenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and see\nthe valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to conclude\nthat the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the\nmovement of the engine.\n\nThe peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks\nare budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak\nis budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow\nwhen the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peasants that the\nunfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind, for the\nforce of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I see only a\ncoincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of\nlife, and I see that however much and however carefully I observe the\nhands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the engine, and the\noak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing, the engine\nmoving, or of the winds of spring. To that I must entirely change my\npoint of view and study the laws of the movement of steam, of the\nbells, and of the wind. History must do the same. And attempts in this\ndirection have already been made.\n\nTo study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of\nour observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and\nstudy the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are\nmoved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance\nin this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is\nevident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering\nthe laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much\nmental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has\nbeen devoted to describing the actions of various kings, commanders,\nand ministers and propounding the historians\xe2\x80\x99 own reflections concerning\nthese actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia. The Russian\narmy and people avoided a collision till Smol\xc3\xa9nsk was reached, and again\nfrom Smol\xc3\xa9nsk to Borodin\xc3\xb3. The French army pushed on to Moscow, its\ngoal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim, just as the\nvelocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth. Behind\nit were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead\nwere a few dozen miles separating it from its goal. Every soldier in\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.\n\nThe more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred\nof the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army increased and\nconsolidated. At Borodin\xc3\xb3 a collision took place. Neither army was\nbroken up, but the Russian army retreated immediately after the\ncollision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another\nhaving a greater momentum, and with equal inevitability the ball\nof invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some\ndistance, though the collision had deprived it of all its force.\n\nThe Russians retreated eighty miles\xe2\x80\x94to beyond Moscow\xe2\x80\x94and the French\nreached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For five weeks after that\nthere was not a single battle. The French did not move. As a bleeding,\nmortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained inert in Moscow\nfor five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh reason, fled back:\nthey made a dash for the Kal\xc3\xbaga road, and (after a victory\xe2\x80\x94for at\nM\xc3\xa1lo-Yarosl\xc3\xa1vets the field of conflict again remained theirs) without\nundertaking a single serious battle, they fled still more rapidly back\nto Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, beyond Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, beyond the Ber\xc3\xabzina, beyond V\xc3\xadlna, and\nfarther still.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, Kut\xc3\xbazov and the whole\nRussian army were convinced that the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 was a victory.\nKut\xc3\xbazov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare for a\nfresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone,\nbut because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who had taken\npart in the battle knew it.\n\nBut all that evening and next day reports came in one after another\nof unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a fresh battle\nproved physically impossible.\n\nIt was impossible to give battle before information had been collected,\nthe wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition replenished, the\nslain reckoned up, new officers appointed to replace those who had been\nkilled, and before the men had had food and sleep. And meanwhile, the\nvery next morning after the battle, the French army advanced of itself\nupon the Russians, carried forward by the force of its own momentum now\nseemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance\nfrom its aim. Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s wish was to attack next day, and the whole\narmy desired to do so. But to make an attack the wish to do so is not\nsufficient, there must also be a possibility of doing it, and that\npossibility did not exist. It was impossible not to retreat a day\xe2\x80\x99s\nmarch, and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another\nand a third day\xe2\x80\x99s march, and at last, on the first of September when\nthe army drew near Moscow\xe2\x80\x94despite the strength of the feeling that had\narisen in all ranks\xe2\x80\x94the force of circumstances compelled it to retire\nbeyond Moscow. And the troops retired one more, last, day\xe2\x80\x99s march, and\nabandoned Moscow to the enemy.\n\nFor people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are\nmade by generals\xe2\x80\x94as anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may\nimagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle\xe2\x80\x94the\nquestions present themselves: Why did Kut\xc3\xbazov during the retreat not do\nthis or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching Fil\xc3\xad?\nWhy did he not retire at once by the Kal\xc3\xbaga road, abandoning Moscow? and\nso on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know,\nthe inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any\ncommander in chief. The activity of a commander in chief does not at all\nresemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in\nour studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of\ntroops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our\nplans from some given moment. A commander in chief is never dealing with\nthe beginning of any event\xe2\x80\x94the position from which we always contemplate\nit. The commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of\nshifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole\nimport of an event that is occurring. Moment by moment the event is\nimperceptibly shaping itself, and at every moment of this continuous,\nuninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the\nmidst of a most complex play of intrigues, worries, contingencies,\nauthorities, projects, counsels, threats, and deceptions and is\ncontinually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him,\nwhich constantly conflict with one another.\n\nLearned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kut\xc3\xbazov should\nhave moved his army to the Kal\xc3\xbaga road long before reaching Fil\xc3\xad, and\nthat somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander\nin chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not\none proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based\non strategics and tactics, contradict each other.\n\nA commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s business, it would seem, is simply to choose one\nof these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and time do not\nwait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to\ncross to the Kal\xc3\xbaga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from\nMilor\xc3\xa1dovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire. An\norder must be given him at once, that instant. And the order to retreat\ncarries us past the turn to the Kal\xc3\xbaga road. And after the adjutant\ncomes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken,\nand the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go, and a\ncourier from Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does\nnot admit of the possibility of abandoning Moscow, and the commander in\nchief\xe2\x80\x99s rival, the man who is undermining him (and there are always\nnot merely one but several such), presents a new project diametrically\nopposed to that of turning to the Kal\xc3\xbaga road, and the commander in\nchief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and\na respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of\nrewards comes to complain, and the inhabitants of the district pray to\nbe defended, and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and\ngives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer\npreviously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, and a general who has been\non reconnaissance, all describe the position of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s army\ndifferently. People accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these\ninevitable conditions of a commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s actions describe to\nus, for instance, the position of the army at Fil\xc3\xad and assume that the\ncommander in chief could, on the first of September, quite freely decide\nwhether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army\nless than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had\nthat question been settled? At Drissa and at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk and most\npalpably of all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shev\xc3\xa1rdino and on\nthe twenty-sixth at Borodin\xc3\xb3, and each day and hour and minute of the\nretreat from Borodin\xc3\xb3 to Fil\xc3\xad.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWhen Erm\xc3\xb3lov, having been sent by Kut\xc3\xbazov to inspect the position, told\nthe field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before Moscow\nand that they must retreat, Kut\xc3\xbazov looked at him in silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said he and, turning it over so as to feel the\npulse, added: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not well, my dear fellow. Think what you are\nsaying!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond Moscow\nwithout a battle.\n\nOn the Pokl\xc3\xb3nny Hill, four miles from the Dorogom\xc3\xadlov gate of Moscow,\nKut\xc3\xbazov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside.\nA great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn, who\nhad come out from Moscow, joined them. This brilliant company separated\ninto several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages\nof the position, the state of the army, the plans suggested, the\nsituation of Moscow, and military questions generally. Though they had\nnot been summoned for the purpose, and though it was not so called, they\nall felt that this was really a council of war. The conversations all\ndealt with public questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal\nnews, it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general\nmatters. No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all\nthese men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the\nheight the situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking\namong themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose\nbench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might\noverhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being said\nand sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not himself\ntake part in the conversations or express any opinion. After hearing\nwhat was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned\naway with an air of disappointment, as though they were not speaking of\nanything he wished to hear. Some discussed the position that had been\nchosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental\ncapacity of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake had\nbeen made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days\nbefore. Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was\ndescribed by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform.\n(This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving with the Russian\narmy were discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering the\npossibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner.) Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nwas telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city\ntrain bands under the walls of the capital, but that he still could not\nhelp regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening, and\nthat had he known it sooner things would have been different.... A\nfifth group, displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions,\ndiscussed the direction the troops would now have to take. A sixth group\nwas talking absolute nonsense. Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s expression grew more and more\npreoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that\nto defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of\nthose words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any senseless\ncommander were to give orders to fight, confusion would result but the\nbattle would still not take place. It would not take place because the\ncommanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible, but\nin their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its\ninevitable abandonment. How could the commanders lead their troops to\na field of battle they considered impossible to hold? The lower-grade\nofficers and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered the\nposition impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced\nas they were of defeat. If Bennigsen insisted on the position being\ndefended and others still discussed it, the question was no longer\nimportant in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue.\nThis Kut\xc3\xbazov knew well.\n\nBennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian\npatriotism (Kut\xc3\xbazov could not listen to this without wincing) by\ninsisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as daylight\nto Kut\xc3\xbazov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on Kut\xc3\xbazov who had\nbrought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if\nit succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not\ngiven, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow. But this\nintrigue did not now occupy the old man\xe2\x80\x99s mind. One terrible question\nabsorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone. The\nquestion for him now was: \xe2\x80\x9cHave I really allowed Napoleon to reach\nMoscow, and when did I do so? When was it decided? Can it have been\nyesterday when I ordered Pl\xc3\xa1tov to retreat, or was it the evening\nbefore, when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it\nearlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair decided? Moscow\nmust be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order to do so must\nbe given.\xe2\x80\x9d To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to\nresigning the command of the army. And not only did he love power to\nwhich he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince Prozor\xc3\xb3vski,\nunder whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced\nthat he was destined to save Russia and that that was why, against\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen\ncommander in chief. He was convinced that he alone could maintain\ncommand of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all\nthe world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear,\nand he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But\nsomething had to be decided, and these conversations around him which\nwere assuming too free a character must be stopped.\n\nHe called the most important generals to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, rising\nfrom the bench, and he rode to Fil\xc3\xad where his carriages were waiting.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the\nbetter and roomier part of Andrew Savosty\xc3\xa1nov\xe2\x80\x99s hut. The men, women, and\nchildren of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across\nthe passage. Only Mal\xc3\xa1sha, Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s six-year-old granddaughter whom\nhis Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar\nwhile drinking his tea, remained on the top of the brick oven in the\nlarger room. Mal\xc3\xa1sha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the\nfaces, uniforms, and decorations of the generals, who one after another\ncame into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner\nunder the icons. \xe2\x80\x9cGranddad\xe2\x80\x9d himself, as Mal\xc3\xa1sha in her own mind called\nKut\xc3\xbazov, sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep\nin a folding armchair, and continually cleared his throat and pulled at\nthe collar of his coat which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed\nto pinch his neck. Those who entered went up one by one to the field\nmarshal; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant\nKays\xc3\xa1rov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing\nKut\xc3\xbazov, but the latter moved his hand angrily and Kays\xc3\xa1rov understood\nthat his Serene Highness did not wish his face to be seen.\n\nRound the peasant\xe2\x80\x99s deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils, and\npapers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another\nbench and put it beside the table. Erm\xc3\xb3lov, Kays\xc3\xa1rov, and Toll, who had\njust arrived, sat down on this bench. In the foremost place, immediately\nunder the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high forehead merging into\nhis bald crown. He had a St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Cross round his neck and looked\npale and ill. He had been feverish for two days and was now shivering\nand in pain. Beside him sat Uv\xc3\xa1rov, who with rapid gesticulations was\ngiving him some information, speaking in low tones as they all did.\nChubby little Dokht\xc3\xbarov was listening attentively with eyebrows\nraised and arms folded on his stomach. On the other side sat Count\nOstermann-Tolst\xc3\xb3y, seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts. His broad\nhead with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand.\nRa\xc3\xa9vski, twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his\nhabit, glanced now at Kut\xc3\xbazov and now at the door with a look of\nimpatience. Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn\xe2\x80\x99s firm, handsome, and kindly face was lit up by\na tender, sly smile. His glance met Mal\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s, and the expression of his\neyes caused the little girl to smile.\n\nThey were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of inspecting\nthe position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited for him from\nfour till six o\xe2\x80\x99clock and did not begin their deliberations all that\ntime but talked in low tones of other matters.\n\nOnly when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kut\xc3\xbazov leave his corner and\ndraw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had been\nplaced there to light up his face.\n\nBennigsen opened the council with the question: \xe2\x80\x9cAre we to abandon\nRussia\xe2\x80\x99s ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to\ndefend it?\xe2\x80\x9d A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a frown\non every face and only Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s angry grunts and occasional cough\nbroke the silence. All eyes were gazing at him. Mal\xc3\xa1sha too looked at\n\xe2\x80\x9cGranddad.\xe2\x80\x9d She was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered; he\nseemed about to cry, but this did not last long.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRussia\xe2\x80\x99s ancient and sacred capital!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly said, repeating\nBennigsen\xe2\x80\x99s words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the\nfalse note in them. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to tell you, your excellency, that that\nquestion has no meaning for a Russian.\xe2\x80\x9d (He lurched his heavy body\nforward.) \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question\nI have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one.\nThe question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up Moscow\nwithout a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well\nas Moscow? That is the question on which I want your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\nsank back in his chair.\n\nThe discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost.\nAdmitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at\nFil\xc3\xad was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love\nof Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank\nduring the night and attack the French right flank the following day.\nOpinions were divided, and arguments were advanced for and against that\nproject. Erm\xc3\xb3lov, Dokht\xc3\xbarov, and Ra\xc3\xa9vski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether\nfeeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital\nor guided by other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not\nto understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course\nof events and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other\ngenerals, however, understood it and, leaving aside the question of\nMoscow, spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat.\nMal\xc3\xa1sha, who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her,\nunderstood the meaning of the council differently. It seemed to her that\nit was only a personal struggle between \xe2\x80\x9cGranddad\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLong-coat\xe2\x80\x9d as\nshe termed Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to\none another, and in her heart she sided with \xe2\x80\x9cGranddad.\xe2\x80\x9d In the midst of\nthe conversation she noticed \xe2\x80\x9cGranddad\xe2\x80\x9d give Bennigsen a quick, subtle\nglance, and then to her joys she saw that \xe2\x80\x9cGranddad\xe2\x80\x9d said something to\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong-coat\xe2\x80\x9d which settled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced\nangrily up and down the room. What so affected him was Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s calm\nand quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen\xe2\x80\x99s\nproposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to\nattack the French right wing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot approve of the count\xe2\x80\x99s plan. Moving\ntroops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and military\nhistory supports that view. For instance...\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov seemed to reflect,\nsearching for an example, then with a clear, na\xc3\xafve look at Bennigsen he\nadded: \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count\nwell remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our\ntroops were rearranged too near the enemy....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all.\n\nThe discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all\nfelt that there was no more to be said.\n\nDuring one of these pauses Kut\xc3\xbazov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to\nspeak. They all looked at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken\ncrockery,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\nI have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with me. But I,\xe2\x80\x9d he\npaused, \xe2\x80\x9cby the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country,\norder a retreat.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and\ncircumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.\n\nSome of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different from\nthe way they had spoken during the council, communicated something to\ntheir commander in chief.\n\nMal\xc3\xa1sha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully\nbackwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its\nprojections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted\nout of the room.\n\nWhen he had dismissed the generals Kut\xc3\xbazov sat a long time with his\nelbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible question:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable? When was\nthat done which settled the matter? And who was to blame for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not expect this,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to his adjutant Schneider when the\nlatter came in late that night. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not expect this! I did not think\nthis would happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should take some rest, your Serene Highness,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Schneider.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\nKut\xc3\xbazov without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\nshall too, if only...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAt that very time, in circumstances even more important than retreating\nwithout a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of Moscow,\nRostopch\xc3\xadn, who is usually represented as being the instigator of that\nevent, acted in an altogether different manner from Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\nAfter the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 the abandonment and burning of Moscow was\nas inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without fighting.\n\nEvery Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the\nfeeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.\n\nThe same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the towns\nand villages on Russian soil beginning with Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, without the\nparticipation of Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn and his broadsheets. The people\nawaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited or tear\nanyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the strength to\nfind what it should do at that most difficult moment. And as soon as the\nenemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property,\nwhile the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left.\n\nThe consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and\nis present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of this,\nand a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian\nMoscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July\nand at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who\nwent away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half\ntheir belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses\nitself not by phrases or by giving one\xe2\x80\x99s children to save the fatherland\nand similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically,\nand therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running\naway from Moscow,\xe2\x80\x9d they were told. In his broadsheets Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nimpressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed\nto be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing\nit had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that\nRostopch\xc3\xadn had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had\ncommitted in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the\nrich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had\nremained intact and that during Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s occupation the inhabitants\nhad spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen\nwhom the Russians, and especially the Russian ladies, then liked so\nmuch.\n\nThey went away because for Russians there could be no question as to\nwhether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It was\nout of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst thing\nthat could happen. They went away even before the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 and\nstill more rapidly after it, despite Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s calls to defend Moscow\nor the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of\nthe Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were\nto destroy the French, and despite all the nonsense Rostopch\xc3\xadn wrote in\nhis broadsheets. They knew that it was for the army to fight, and that\nif it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house\nserfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that\nthey must go away, sorry as they were to abandon their property\nto destruction. They went away without thinking of the tremendous\nsignificance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to\ndestruction, for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when\nabandoned by its inhabitants to be burned. They went away each on his\nown account, and yet it was only in consequence of their going away\nthat the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the\ngreatest glory of the Russian people. The lady who, afraid of being\nstopped by Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s orders, had already in June moved with her\nNegroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her Sar\xc3\xa1tov estate, with\na vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s servant, was really,\nsimply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia. But\nCount Rostopch\xc3\xadn, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the\ngovernment offices removed; now distributed quite useless weapons to\nthe drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the icons, and now\nforbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints; now\nseized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and thirty-six\nof them removed the balloon that was being constructed by Leppich; now\nhinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his\nown house; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding\nthem for having destroyed his Orphanage; now claimed the glory of\nhaving hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed;\nnow ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him, and now\nreproached them for doing so; now expelled all the French residents from\nMoscow, and now allowed Madame Aubert-Chalm\xc3\xa9 (the center of the whole\nFrench colony in Moscow) to remain, but ordered the venerable old\npostmaster Klyuchar\xc3\xabv to be arrested and exiled for no particular\noffense; now assembled the people at the Three Hills to fight the French\nand now, to get rid of them, handed over to them a man to be killed\nand himself drove away by a back gate; now declared that he would\nnot survive the fall of Moscow, and now wrote French verses in albums\nconcerning his share in the affair\xe2\x80\x94this man did not understand the\nmeaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself\nthat would astonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic\nfeat; and like a child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable\nevent\xe2\x80\x94the abandonment and burning of Moscow\xe2\x80\x94and tried with his puny hand\nnow to speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him\nalong with it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, having returned with the court from V\xc3\xadlna to Petersburg, found\nherself in a difficult position.\n\nIn Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who\noccupied one of the highest posts in the Empire. In V\xc3\xadlna she had formed\nan intimacy with a young foreign prince. When she returned to Petersburg\nboth the magnate and the prince were there, and both claimed their\nrights. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne was faced by a new problem\xe2\x80\x94how to preserve her intimacy\nwith both without offending either.\n\nWhat would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did\nnot cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova, who evidently\ndeserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. Had she attempted\nconcealment, or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position\nby cunning, she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself\nguilty. But H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, like a really great man who can do whatever\nhe pleases, at once assumed her own position to be correct, as she\nsincerely believed it to be, and that everyone else was to blame.\n\nThe first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her, she\nlifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said firmly: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\njust like a man\xe2\x80\x94selfish and cruel! I expected nothing else. A woman\nsacrifices herself for you, she suffers, and this is her reward! What\nright have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and\nfriendships? He is a man who has been more than a father to me!\xe2\x80\x9d The\nprince was about to say something, but H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cit may be that he has other sentiments for me\nthan those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut my door\non him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with ingratitude!\nKnow, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my intimate feelings I\nrender account only to God and to my conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, laying\nher hand on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to\nheaven.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake listen to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry me, and I will be your slave!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you...\xe2\x80\x9d said H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne,\nbeginning to cry.\n\nThe prince tried to comfort her, but H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, as if quite distraught,\nsaid through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying,\nthat there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but\nshe mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she had\nnever been her husband\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and that she had been sacrificed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the law, religion...\xe2\x80\x9d said the prince, already yielding.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law, religion... What have they been invented for if they can\xe2\x80\x99t\narrange that?\xe2\x80\x9d said H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne.\n\nThe prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him,\nand he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the Society of Jesus,\nwith whom he was on intimate terms.\n\nA few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne gave at\nher country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur de Jobert,\na man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes,\na Jesuit \xc3\xa0 robe courte * was presented to her, and in the garden by the\nlight of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a\nlong time of the love of God, of Christ, of the Sacred Heart, and of the\nconsolations the one true Catholic religion affords in this world and\nthe next. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne was touched, and more than once tears rose to her eyes\nand to those of Monsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance,\nfor which her partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse with\nher future directeur de conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de\nJobert came to see H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne when she was alone, and after that often came\nagain.\n\n    * Lay member of the Society of Jesus.\n\nOne day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she knelt\ndown before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting, middle-aged\nFrenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself afterward\ndescribed it, she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her\nsoul. It was explained to her that this was la gr\xc3\xa2ce.\n\nAfter that a long-frocked abb\xc3\xa9 was brought to her. She confessed to\nhim, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box\ncontaining the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to\npartake of. A few days later H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne learned with pleasure that she had\nnow been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days the\nPope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document.\n\nAll that was done around her and to her at this time, all the attention\ndevoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant,\nrefined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was now in (she wore\nonly white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave her pleasure,\nbut her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim. And\nas it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets\nthe better of cleverer ones, H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x94having realized that the main object\nof all these words and all this trouble was, after converting her to\nCatholicism, to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to\nwhich she received indications)\xe2\x80\x94before parting with her money insisted\nthat the various operations necessary to free her from her husband\nshould be performed. In her view the aim of every religion was merely\nto preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to\nhuman desires. And with this aim, in one of her talks with her Father\nConfessor, she insisted on an answer to the question, in how far was she\nbound by her marriage?\n\nThey were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room.\nThe scent of flowers came in at the window. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne was wearing a white\ndress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abb\xc3\xa9, a well-fed\nman with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth, and white\nhands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne and, with a\nsubtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty,\noccasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the\nsubject. H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his\nplump, clean-shaven, blackish cheeks and every moment expected the\nconversation to take a fresh turn. But the abb\xc3\xa9, though he evidently\nenjoyed the beauty of his companion, was absorbed in his mastery of the\nmatter.\n\nThe course of the Father Confessor\xe2\x80\x99s arguments ran as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cIgnorant\nof the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow of conjugal\nfidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married state without\nfaith in the religious significance of marriage, committed an act of\nsacrilege. That marriage lacked the dual significance it should have\nhad. Yet in spite of this your vow was binding. You swerved from it.\nWhat did you commit by so acting? A venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial\nsin, for you acted without evil intention. If now you married again\nwith the object of bearing children, your sin might be forgiven. But the\nquestion is again a twofold one: firstly...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut suddenly H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, who was getting bored, said with one of her\nbewitching smiles: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think that having espoused the true religion I\ncannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe director of her conscience was astounded at having the case\npresented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus\xe2\x80\x99 egg. He was\ndelighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil\xe2\x80\x99s progress, but could\nnot abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us understand one another, Countess,\xe2\x80\x9d said he with a smile, and\nbegan refuting his spiritual daughter\xe2\x80\x99s arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne understood that the question was very simple and easy from\nthe ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making\ndifficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter\nwould be regarded by the secular authorities.\n\nSo she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society.\nShe provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she\nhad told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so that the only\nway for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her. The elderly\nmagnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage\nwith a woman whose husband was alive, as the younger man had been, but\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as\nmarrying a maiden had its effect on him too. Had H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne herself shown\nthe least sign of hesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would\ncertainly have been lost; but not only did she show no signs of secrecy\nor shame, on the contrary, with good-natured na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 she told her\nintimate friends (and these were all Petersburg) that both the prince\nand the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was\nafraid of grieving either.\n\nA rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne wanted to\nbe divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have\nopposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and\ninteresting H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne was in doubt which of the two men she should marry.\nThe question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was\nthe better match and how the matter would be regarded at court. There\nwere, it is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of\nsuch a question, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament\nof marriage, but there were not many such and they remained silent,\nwhile the majority were interested in H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune and in the\nquestion which match would be the more advantageous. Whether it was\nright or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not\ndiscuss, for that question had evidently been settled by people \xe2\x80\x9cwiser\nthan you or me,\xe2\x80\x9d as they said, and to doubt the correctness of that\ndecision would be to risk exposing one\xe2\x80\x99s stupidity and incapacity to\nlive in society.\n\nOnly M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna Akhros\xc3\xadmova, who had come to Petersburg that\nsummer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express\nan opinion contrary to the general one. Meeting H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne at a ball she\nstopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence, said\nin her gruff voice: \xe2\x80\x9cSo wives of living men have started marrying\nagain! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been\nforestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago. It is done in all the\nbrothels,\xe2\x80\x9d and with these words M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna, turning up her wide\nsleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round,\nmoved across the room.\n\nThough people were afraid of M\xc3\xa1rya Dm\xc3\xadtrievna she was regarded in\nPetersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only noticed,\nand repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had used, supposing\nthe whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli, who of late very often forgot what he had said and\nrepeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his\ndaughter whenever he chanced to see her:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, I have a word to say to you,\xe2\x80\x9d and he would lead her\naside, drawing her hand downward. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of certain projects\nconcerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your father\xe2\x80\x99s\nheart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much.... But, my\ndear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to say,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nconcealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s and move away.\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man,\nand who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne always has\xe2\x80\x94men friends who can never change into lovers\xe2\x80\x94once gave\nher his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Bil\xc3\xadbin,\xe2\x80\x9d said H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne (she always called friends of that sort\nby their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her white,\nberinged fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, as you would a sister, what I ought to do.\nWhich of the two?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with a\nsmile on his lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not taking me unawares, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a true friend,\nI have thought and thought again about your affair. You see, if you\nmarry the prince\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he meant the younger man\xe2\x80\x94and he crooked one finger,\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you will\ndisplease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of\nconnection.) But if you marry the old count you will make his last days\nhappy, and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be making\na m\xc3\xa9salliance by marrying you,\xe2\x80\x9d and Bil\xc3\xadbin smoothed out his forehead.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a true friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne beaming, and again touching\nBil\xc3\xadbin\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I love them, you know, and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to distress\neither of them. I would give my life for the happiness of them both.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he could\nhelp in that difficulty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUne ma\xc3\xaetresse-femme! * That\xe2\x80\x99s what is called putting things squarely.\nShe would like to be married to all three at the same time,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\n    * A masterly woman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d Bil\xc3\xadbin asked,\nhis reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so\nna\xc3\xafve a question. \xe2\x80\x9cWill he agree?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he loves me so!\xe2\x80\x9d said H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, who for some reason imagined that\nPierre too loved her. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will do anything for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven divorce you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nH\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne laughed.\n\nAmong those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed\nmarriage was H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Princess Kur\xc3\xa1gina. She was continually\ntormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned\na subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the\nidea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of divorce\nand remarriage during a husband\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime, and the priest told her that\nit was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel\nwhich (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage while the husband\nis alive.\n\nArmed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable, she\ndrove to her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s early one morning so as to find her alone.\n\nHaving listened to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s objections, H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne smiled blandly and\nironically.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it says plainly: \xe2\x80\x98Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced...\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the old princess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Maman, ne dites pas de b\xc3\xaatises. Vous ne comprenez rien. Dans ma\nposition j\xe2\x80\x99ai des devoirs,\xe2\x80\x9d * said H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne changing from Russian, in\nwhich language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear,\ninto French which suited it better.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mamma, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense! You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\n     anything. In my position I have obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mamma, how is it you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that the Holy Father, who has\nthe right to grant dispensations...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust then the lady companion who lived with H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne came in to announce\nthat His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNon, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse contre\nlui, parce qu\xe2\x80\x99il m\xe2\x80\x99a manqu\xc3\xa9 parole.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cNo, tell him I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to see him, I am furious with\n     him for not keeping his word to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cComtesse, \xc3\xa0 tout p\xc3\xa9ch\xc3\xa9 mis\xc3\xa9ricorde,\xe2\x80\x9d * said a fair-haired young man\nwith a long face and nose, as he entered the room.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cCountess, there is mercy for every sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who had\nentered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter and\nsidled out of the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is right,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the old princess, all her convictions\ndissipated by the appearance of His Highness. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is right, but how\nis it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so\nsimple,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought as she got into her carriage.\n\n\nBy the beginning of August H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s affairs were clearly defined and\nshe wrote a letter to her husband\xe2\x80\x94who, as she imagined, loved her very\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her having\nembraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all the\nformalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to him by\nthe bearer of the letter.\n\nAnd so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful\nkeeping\xe2\x80\x94Your friend H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne.\n\nThis letter was brought to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s house when he was on the field of\nBorodin\xc3\xb3.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nToward the end of the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, Pierre, having run down\nfrom Ra\xc3\xa9vski\xe2\x80\x99s battery a second time, made his way through a gully to\nKnyazk\xc3\xb3vo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station, and\nseeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still entangled in\nthe crowds of soldiers.\n\nThe one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly\nfrom the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return\nto ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own\nbed. He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he\nbe able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt. But such\nordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found.\n\nThough shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he\nwas going, still on all sides there was what there had been on the field\nof battle. There were still the same suffering, exhausted, and sometimes\nstrangely indifferent faces, the same blood, the same soldiers\xe2\x80\x99\novercoats, the same sounds of firing which, though distant now, still\naroused terror, and besides this there were the foul air and the dust.\n\nHaving gone a couple of miles along the Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk road, Pierre sat down\nby the roadside.\n\nDusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay leaning on\nhis elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in\nthe darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying\ntoward him with a terrific whizz, and then he shuddered and sat up. He\nhad no idea how long he had been there. In the middle of the night three\nsoldiers, having brought some firewood, settled down near him and began\nlighting a fire.\n\nThe soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire to burn\nand placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and\nput a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with\nthe smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were\neating and talking among themselves, taking no notice of him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who may you be?\xe2\x80\x9d one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently\nmeaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to eat\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, I...\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social\nposition as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and\nbetter understood by them. \xe2\x80\x9cBy rights I am a militia officer, but my men\nare not here. I came to the battle and have lost them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the soldiers.\n\nAnother shook his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like a little mash?\xe2\x80\x9d the first soldier asked, and handed\nPierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.\n\nPierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called\nthe food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any food\nhe had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping himself\nto large spoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was lit up by\nthe fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you to go to? Tell us!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a gentleman, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Kir\xc3\xadlych.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, Peter Kir\xc3\xadlych, come along with us, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take you there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk.\n\nBy the time they got near Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk and began ascending the steep hill\ninto the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on with the\nsoldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill\nand that he had already passed it. He would not soon have remembered\nthis, such was his state of forgetfulness, had he not halfway up the\nhill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to look for him in the\ntown and was returning to the inn. The groom recognized Pierre in the\ndarkness by his white hat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we were beginning to despair! How is\nit you are on foot? And where are you going, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\nThe soldiers stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve found your folk?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by, Peter\nKir\xc3\xadlych\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Peter Kir\xc3\xadlych!\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre heard the other voices repeat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by!\xe2\x80\x9d he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to give them something!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and felt in his pocket.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, better not!\xe2\x80\x9d said another, inner voice.\n\nThere was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied.\nPierre went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all, lay\ndown in his carriage.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nScarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself\nfalling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality,\nhe heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of projectiles, groans\nand cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and\ndread of death seized him. Filled with fright he opened his eyes and\nlifted his head from under his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only\nsomeone\xe2\x80\x99s orderly passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud,\nand talked to the innkeeper. Above Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s head some pigeons, disturbed\nby the movement he had made in sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof\nof the penthouse. The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful\nsmell of stable yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see\nthe clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God, there is no more of that!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, covering up his head\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I yielded\nto it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time, to the\nend...\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\nThey, in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the\nbattery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before\nthe icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out\nclearly and sharply from everyone else.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be a soldier, just a soldier!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre as he fell asleep,\n\xe2\x80\x9cto enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them what\nthey are. But how to cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my\nouter man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could have run\naway from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been sent to serve\nas a soldier after the duel with D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\xe2\x80\x9d And the memory of the dinner\nat the English Club when he had challenged D\xc3\xb3lokhov flashed through\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and then he remembered his benefactor at Torzh\xc3\xb3k. And now\na picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind.\nIt was taking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him\nsat at the end of the table. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is he! It is my benefactor.\nBut he died!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he died, and I did not know he was\nalive. How sorry I am that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive\nagain!\xe2\x80\x9d On one side of the table sat Anatole, D\xc3\xb3lokhov, Nesv\xc3\xadtski,\nDen\xc3\xadsov, and others like them (in his dream the category to which these\nmen belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of\nthose he termed they), and he heard those people, Anatole and D\xc3\xb3lokhov,\nshouting and singing loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his\nbenefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words\nwas as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but\npleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor\nwas saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite\ndistinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the\npossibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind,\nfirm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they were\nkindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him. Wishing to\nspeak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment his\nlegs grew cold and bare.\n\nHe felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak\nhad in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre\nopened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but\nnow they were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or dew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is dawn,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I want. I want to\nhear and understand my benefactor\xe2\x80\x99s words.\xe2\x80\x9d Again he covered himself up\nwith his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there.\nThere were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts that\nsomeone was uttering or that he himself was formulating.\n\nAfterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that\nsomeone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of that\nday had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to think\nand express his thoughts like that when awake.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo endure war is the most difficult subordination of man\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to\nthe law of God,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice had said. \xe2\x80\x9cSimplicity is submission to the\nwill of God; you cannot escape from Him. And they are simple. They do\nnot talk, but act. The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden.\nMan can be master of nothing while he fears death, but he who does not\nfear it possesses all. If there were no suffering, man would not know\nhis limitations, would not know himself. The hardest thing (Pierre went\non thinking, or hearing, in his dream) is to be able in your soul to\nunite the meaning of all. To unite all?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not\nto unite. Thoughts cannot be united, but to harness all these thoughts\ntogether is what we need! Yes, one must harness them, must harness\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated to himself with inward rapture, feeling that these\nwords and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the\nquestion that tormented him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, one must harness, it is time to harness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your excellency!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsome voice was repeating. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must harness, it is time to harness....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone\nstraight into Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the\nmiddle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump\nwhile carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with\nrepugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see and understand that. I want\nto understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream. One second\nmore and I should have understood it all! But what am I to do? Harness,\nbut how can I harness everything?\xe2\x80\x9d and Pierre felt with horror that the\nmeaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed.\n\nThe groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an officer\nhad come with news that the French were already near Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk and that\nour men were leaving it.\n\nPierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him, went on\nfoot through the town.\n\nThe troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind\nthem. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses, and\nthe streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts that\nwere to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and blows could\nbe heard. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken\nhim, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the\nway Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of\nthat of Prince Andrew.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOn the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the gates of\nthe city he was met by Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been looking for you everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the adjutant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe count\nwants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at once on a\nvery important matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWithout going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow\ncommander in chief.\n\nCount Rostopch\xc3\xadn had only that morning returned to town from his summer\nvilla at Sok\xc3\xb3lniki. The anteroom and reception room of his house\nwere full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders.\nVas\xc3\xadlchikov and Pl\xc3\xa1tov had already seen the count and explained to him\nthat it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be\nsurrendered. Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants,\nthe officials\xe2\x80\x94the heads of the various government departments\xe2\x80\x94knew that\nMoscow would soon be in the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s hands, just as Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nhimself knew it, and to escape personal responsibility they had all\ncome to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various\ndepartments.\n\nAs Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came\nout of Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s private room.\n\nIn answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a\ndespairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.\n\nWhile waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched the\nvarious officials, old and young, military and civilian, who were there.\nThey all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to a group of\nmen, one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they continued their\nconversation.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they\xe2\x80\x99re sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm,\nbut as things are now one can\xe2\x80\x99t answer for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you see what he writes...\xe2\x80\x9d said another, pointing to a printed\nsheet he held in his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another matter. That\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for the people,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nfirst.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fresh broadsheet.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre took it and began reading.\n\nHis Serene Highness has passed through Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk in order to join up with\nthe troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where\nthe enemy will not soon attack him. Forty-eight guns with ammunition\nhave been sent him from here, and his Serene Highness says he will\ndefend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in\nthe streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that the law courts are closed;\nthings have to be put in order, and we will deal with villains in our\nown way! When the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and\nwill raise the cry a day or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet\nso I hold my peace. An ax will be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a\nthree-pronged fork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a\nsheaf of rye. Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of\nthe Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will\nhave some water blessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I,\ntoo, am well now: one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout\nwith both.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the\ntown,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cand that the position...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course! That\xe2\x80\x99s what we were saying,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the first\nspeaker.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does he mean by \xe2\x80\x98One of my eyes was sore but now I am on the\nlookout with both\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe count had a sty,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the adjutant smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cand was very much\nupset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with\nhim. By the by, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a\nsmile, \xe2\x80\x9cwe heard that you have family troubles and that the countess,\nyour wife...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre replied unconcernedly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what have you\nheard?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I\nheard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they say,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the adjutant with the same smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\nthe countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect it\xe2\x80\x99s\nnonsense....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd who\nis that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant\novercoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe? That\xe2\x80\x99s a tradesman, that is to say, he\xe2\x80\x99s the restaurant\nkeeper, Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the\nproclamation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, so that is Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, looking at the firm, calm\nface of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not he himself, that\xe2\x80\x99s the father of the fellow who wrote the\nproclamation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the adjutant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe young man is in prison and I\nexpect it will go hard with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAn old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German wearing a\ncross round his neck, approached the speaker.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated story, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the adjutant. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\nproclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed of\nit. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Iv\xc3\xa1novich\nhere made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly\nsixty-three hands. He asked one, \xe2\x80\x98From whom did you get it?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98From\nso-and-so.\xe2\x80\x99 He went to the next one. \xe2\x80\x98From whom did you get it?\xe2\x80\x99 and so\non till he reached Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin, a half educated tradesman, you know, \xe2\x80\x98a\npet of a trader,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said the adjutant smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cThey asked him, \xe2\x80\x98Who gave\nit you?\xe2\x80\x99 And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could\nonly have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come to\nsome understanding. He replied: \xe2\x80\x98From no one; I made it up myself.\xe2\x80\x99\nThey threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: \xe2\x80\x98I made it\nup myself.\xe2\x80\x99 And so it was reported to the count, who sent for the man.\n\xe2\x80\x98From whom did you get the proclamation?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I wrote it myself.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, you\nknow the count,\xe2\x80\x9d said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride,\n\xe2\x80\x9che flared up dreadfully\xe2\x80\x94and just think of the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s audacity, lying,\nand obstinacy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the count wanted him to say it was from Klyuchar\xc3\xabv? I understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the adjutant in dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cKlyuchar\xc3\xabv had his own\nsins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished.\nBut the point is that the count was much annoyed. \xe2\x80\x98How could you have\nwritten it yourself?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that\nwas lying on the table. \xe2\x80\x98Here it is! You did not write it yourself but\ntranslated it, and translated it abominably, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know\nFrench, you fool.\xe2\x80\x99 And what do you think? \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I have not\nread any papers, I made it up myself.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If that\xe2\x80\x99s so, you\xe2\x80\x99re a traitor\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you tried, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanged! Say from whom you had\nit.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I have seen no papers, I made it up myself.\xe2\x80\x99 And that was the end\nof it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it.\nHe was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the\nfather has come to intercede for him. But he\xe2\x80\x99s a good-for-nothing lad!\nYou know that sort of tradesman\xe2\x80\x99s son, a dandy and lady-killer. He\nattended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match\nfor him. That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop\nhere by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God\nAlmighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other.\nWell, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?\nHe found some scoundrel of a painter...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nIn the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the commander in\nchief.\n\nWhen he entered the private room Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn, puckering his face,\nwas rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was saying\nsomething, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, how do you do, great warrior?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rostopch\xc3\xadn as soon as the short\nman had left the room. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have heard of your prowess. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not\nthe point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nwent on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which\nhe nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. \xe2\x80\x9cI am well\ninformed, my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and I hope\nthat you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to\nruin Russia.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am a Mason,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs. Sper\xc3\xa1nski and\nMagn\xc3\xadtski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. Klyuchar\xc3\xabv has\nbeen treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of\nbuilding up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of\ntheir fatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for this and\nthat I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful\nperson. It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage\nfor his removal from town, and that you have even accepted papers from\nhim for safe custody. I like you and don\xe2\x80\x99t wish you any harm and\xe2\x80\x94as\nyou are only half my age\xe2\x80\x94I advise you, as a father would, to cease\nall communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as\npossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did Klyuchar\xc3\xabv do wrong, Count?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is for me to know, but not for you to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Rostopch\xc3\xadn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he is accused of circulating Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s proclamation it is not\nproved that he did so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre without looking at Rostopch\xc3\xadn, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nVereshch\xc3\xa1gin...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere we are!\xe2\x80\x9d Rostopch\xc3\xadn shouted at Pierre louder than before,\nfrowning suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cVereshch\xc3\xa1gin is a renegade and a traitor who will\nbe punished as he deserves,\xe2\x80\x9d said he with the vindictive heat with which\npeople speak when recalling an insult. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I did not summon you to\ndiscuss my actions, but to give you advice\xe2\x80\x94or an order if you prefer it.\nI beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such\nmen as Klyuchar\xc3\xabv. And I will knock the nonsense out of anybody\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but\nprobably realizing that he was shouting at Bez\xc3\xbakhov who so far was not\nguilty of anything, he added, taking Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s hand in a friendly manner,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are on the eve of a public disaster and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t time to be polite\nto everybody who has business with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl.\nWell, mon cher, what are you doing personally?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing the\nthoughtful expression of his face.\n\nThe count frowned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon as you can, that\xe2\x80\x99s\nall I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by, my dear\nfellow. Oh, by the by!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted through the doorway after Pierre,\n\xe2\x80\x9cis it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy\nfathers of the Society of Jesus?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre did not answer and left Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s room more sullen and angry\nthan he had ever before shown himself.\n\nWhen he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people had\ncome to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel\nof his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners.\nThey all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre\ndid not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and\nonly answered them in order to get rid of these people. When left alone\nat last he opened and read his wife\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old\nman... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary... the\nmeaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting married... One\nmust forget and understand...\xe2\x80\x9d And going to his bed he threw himself on\nit without undressing and immediately fell asleep.\n\nWhen he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a\nspecial messenger, a police officer, had come from Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn to\nknow whether Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov had left or was leaving the town.\n\nA dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in the\ndrawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to see\nthem, went to the back porch and out through the gate.\n\nFrom that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of\nBez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again\nor knew where he was.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Rost\xc3\xb3vs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is,\ntill the eve of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s entry into the city.\n\nAfter P\xc3\xa9tya had joined Obol\xc3\xa9nski\xe2\x80\x99s regiment of Cossacks and left for\nB\xc3\xa9laya Ts\xc3\xa9rkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized\nwith terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war, had both\ngone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or both of them\nmight be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck\nher that summer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to\nget Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join P\xc3\xa9tya, or to get\nhim an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved\npossible. P\xc3\xa9tya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless\nhe was transferred to another regiment on active service. Nicholas was\nsomewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter,\nin which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with Princess\nMary. The countess did not sleep at night, or when she did fall asleep\ndreamed that she saw her sons lying dead. After many consultations and\nconversations, the count at last devised means to tranquillize her. He\ngot P\xc3\xa9tya transferred from Obol\xc3\xa9nski\xe2\x80\x99s regiment to Bez\xc3\xbakhov\xe2\x80\x99s, which was\nin training near Moscow. Though P\xc3\xa9tya would remain in the service, this\ntransfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one\nof her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her\nP\xc3\xa9tya so as not to let him go again, but always get him appointed to\nplaces where he could not possibly take part in a battle. As long as\nNicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her\nfirst-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself\nfor it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at\nlessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself a\nnuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed P\xc3\xa9tya with his merry black eyes\nand fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show\xe2\x80\x94when\nhe was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting\nsomewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it\xe2\x80\x94then\nhis mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other\nchildren. The nearer the time came for P\xc3\xa9tya to return, the more uneasy\ngrew the countess. She began to think she would never live to see such\nhappiness. The presence of S\xc3\xb3nya, of her beloved Nat\xc3\xa1sha, or even of\nher husband irritated her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I want with them? I want no one but\nP\xc3\xa9tya,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\n\nAt the end of August the Rost\xc3\xb3vs received another letter from Nicholas.\nHe wrote from the province of Vor\xc3\xb3nezh where he had been sent to procure\nremounts, but that letter did not set the countess at ease. Knowing that\none son was out of danger she became the more anxious about P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\nThough by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 acquaintances\nhad left Moscow, and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to\nget away as quickly as possible, she would not hear of leaving before\nher treasure, her adored P\xc3\xa9tya, returned. On the twenty-eighth of August\nhe arrived. The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him\ndid not please the sixteen-year-old officer. Though she concealed from\nhim her intention of keeping him under her wing, P\xc3\xa9tya guessed her\ndesigns, and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion\nwhen with her\xe2\x80\x94might \xe2\x80\x9cbecome womanish\xe2\x80\x9d as he termed it to himself\xe2\x80\x94he\ntreated her coldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached\nhimself exclusively to Nat\xc3\xa1sha for whom he had always had a particularly\nbrotherly tenderness, almost lover-like.\n\nOwing to the count\xe2\x80\x99s customary carelessness nothing was ready for their\ndeparture by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to\ncome from their Ryaz\xc3\xa1n and Moscow estates to remove their household\nbelongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.\n\nFrom the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle\nand commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodin\xc3\xb3 were\nbrought in by the Dorogom\xc3\xadlov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow,\nand thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions\nout by the other gates. In spite of Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s broadsheets, or because\nof them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory\nrumors were current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed\nto leave the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had\nbeen taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave.\nSome said there had been another battle after Borodin\xc3\xb3 at which the\nFrench had been routed, while others on the contrary reported that the\nRussian army had been destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia\nwhich, preceded by the clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others\nwhispered that Augustin had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had\nbeen seized, that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their\nway from Moscow, and so on. But all this was only talk; in reality\n(though the Council of Fil\xc3\xad, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow,\nhad not yet been held) both those who went away and those who remained\nbehind felt, though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly\nbe abandoned, and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and\nsave their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break\nup and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so.\nAs a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die\nimmediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is\nawry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life,\nthough it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the\nconditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would\nbe completely upset.\n\nDuring the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole\nRost\xc3\xb3v family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the\nfamily, Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v, continually drove about the city collecting\nthe current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders\nat home about the preparations for their departure.\n\nThe countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with\neverything, was constantly in pursuit of P\xc3\xa9tya who was always running\naway from her, and was jealous of Nat\xc3\xa1sha with whom he spent all his\ntime. S\xc3\xb3nya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting\nthings packed. But of late S\xc3\xb3nya had been particularly sad and silent.\nNicholas\xe2\x80\x99 letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in\nher presence, joyous comments from the countess, who saw an intervention\nof Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was never pleased at Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s engagement to Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncountess, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a\npresentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving\nthe Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that the\nprincess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite\nher grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the\ndifficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and\nwas busy for whole days. The count and countess turned to her when they\nhad any orders to give. P\xc3\xa9tya and Nat\xc3\xa1sha on the contrary, far from\nhelping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to\neveryone. Almost all day long the house resounded with their running\nfeet, their cries, and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were\ngay not because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and\nmirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause\nfor gaiety and laughter to them. P\xc3\xa9tya was in high spirits because\nhaving left home a boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine\nyoung man, because he was at home, because he had left B\xc3\xa9laya Ts\xc3\xa9rkov\nwhere there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to\nMoscow where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was\ngay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of\nthe cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was also\nhappy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of others was\na lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freely\xe2\x80\x94and\nP\xc3\xa9tya adored her. Above all, they were gay because there was a war near\nMoscow, there would be fighting at the town gates, arms were being\ngiven out, everybody was escaping\xe2\x80\x94going away somewhere, and in general\nsomething extraordinary was happening, and that is always exciting,\nespecially to the young.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nOn Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99\nhouse seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the furniture was\nbeing carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been\ntaken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay, wrapping paper, and\nropes were scattered about. The peasants and house serfs carrying out\nthe things were treading heavily on the parquet floors. The yard was\ncrowded with peasant carts, some loaded high and already corded up,\nothers still empty.\n\nThe voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who\nhad come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in\nthe yard and in the house. The count had been out since morning. The\ncountess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was\nlying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head.\nP\xc3\xa9tya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant\nto obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army. S\xc3\xb3nya was in\nthe ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nwas sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons,\nand scarves strewn all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and\nholding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which\nshe had worn at her first Petersburg ball.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy, and\nseveral times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart was\nnot in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything except\nwith all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood beside\nS\xc3\xb3nya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but soon gave\nit up and went to her room to pack her own things. At first she found it\namusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was\ndone and what was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuny\xc3\xa1sha, you pack! You will, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d And when Duny\xc3\xa1sha\nwillingly promised to do it all for her, Nat\xc3\xa1sha sat down on the floor,\ntook her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what\nought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was roused from her reverie\nby the talk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the\nsound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch. Nat\xc3\xa1sha got\nup and looked out of the window. An enormously long row of carts full of\nwounded men had stopped in the street.\n\nThe housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,\npostilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding\nan end of it in each hand, went out into the street.\n\nThe former housekeeper, old M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna, had stepped out of the\ncrowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast\nmats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her\nhandkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have nobody in Moscow?\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would be more\ncomfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family\nare leaving.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it would be allowed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer in a weak\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is our commanding officer... ask him,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed to a\nstout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer\nand at once went to meet the major.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay the wounded men stay in our house?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\nThe major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich one do you want, Ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x99selle?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, screwing up his eyes and\nsmiling.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole\nmanner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her\nhandkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection\xe2\x80\x94as\nif considering in how far the thing was possible\xe2\x80\x94replied in the\naffirmative.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, why not? They may,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nWith a slight inclination of her head, Nat\xc3\xa1sha stepped back quickly to\nM\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey may. He says they may!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nThe cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 yard,\nand dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the\ntownsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the\nhouses in Povarsk\xc3\xa1ya Street. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was evidently pleased to be dealing\nwith new people outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and M\xc3\xa1vra\nKuzm\xc3\xadnichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their\nyard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Papa must be told, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move\ninto the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we\nput them into the wing, the men\xe2\x80\x99s room, or the nurse\xe2\x80\x99s room, we must ask\npermission.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door\ninto the sitting room, where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffman\xe2\x80\x99s\ndrops.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you asleep, Mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what sleep\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, waking up just as she was dropping\ninto a doze.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma darling!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, kneeling by her mother and bringing her\nface close to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s, \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, forgive me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never do it\nagain; I woke you up! M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna has sent me: they have brought\nsome wounded here\xe2\x80\x94officers. Will you let them come? They have nowhere to\ngo. I knew you\xe2\x80\x99d let them come!\xe2\x80\x9d she said quickly all in one breath.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat officers? Whom have they brought? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand anything\nabout it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you\xe2\x80\x99d give permission... so I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them,\xe2\x80\x9d and, having kissed\nher mother, Nat\xc3\xa1sha got up and went to the door.\n\nIn the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed too long!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count with involuntary vexation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nClub is closed and the police are leaving.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, is it all right\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve invited some of the wounded into the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered absently. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. I beg\nyou not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomorrow we\nmust go, go, go!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants.\n\nAt dinner P\xc3\xa9tya having returned home told them the news he had heard.\nHe said the people had been getting arms in the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin, and that though\nRostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three\ndays in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone\nto go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big\nbattle there.\n\nThe countess looked with timid horror at her son\xe2\x80\x99s eager, excited face\nas he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his not\ngoing to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending\nengagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the\nfatherland\xe2\x80\x94something senseless, masculine, and obstinate which there\nwould be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and so,\nhoping to arrange to leave before then and take P\xc3\xa9tya with her as their\nprotector and defender, she did not answer him, but after dinner called\nthe count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly,\nthat very night if possible. With a woman\xe2\x80\x99s involuntary loving cunning\nshe, who till then had not shown any alarm, said that she would die of\nfright if they did not leave that very night. Without any pretense she\nwas now afraid of everything.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nMadame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the\ncountess\xe2\x80\x99 fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit\ndealer\xe2\x80\x99s in Myasn\xc3\xadtski Street. When returning by that street she had\nbeen unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of\nthe shop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the\ncabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at\nthe drink store, having received orders to do so.\n\nAfter dinner the whole Rost\xc3\xb3v household set to work with enthusiastic\nhaste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. The\nold count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the\nhouse and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying\npeople, and flurrying them still more. P\xc3\xa9tya directed things in the\nyard. S\xc3\xb3nya, owing to the count\xe2\x80\x99s contradictory orders, lost her head\nand did not know what to do. The servants ran noisily about the house\nand yard, shouting and disputing. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, with the ardor characteristic\nof all she did suddenly set to work too. At first her intervention in\nthe business of packing was received skeptically. Everybody expected\nsome prank from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely\nand passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because\nthey did not heed her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her.\nHer first exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her\nauthority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable\nGobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Nat\xc3\xa1sha set\nto work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost full\nup with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much china\nstanding on the tables, and still more was being brought in from the\nstoreroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, wait a bit\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ll pack everything into these,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t, Miss, we have tried to,\xe2\x80\x9d said the butler\xe2\x80\x99s assistant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, wait a minute, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Nat\xc3\xa1sha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates\nwrapped in paper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dishes must go in here among the carpets,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the butler\xe2\x80\x99s assistant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, wait, please!\xe2\x80\x9d And Nat\xc3\xa1sha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the\nthings. \xe2\x80\x9cThese aren\xe2\x80\x99t needed,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, putting aside some plates\nof Kiev ware. \xe2\x80\x9cThese\xe2\x80\x94yes, these must go among the carpets,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\nreferring to the Saxony china dishes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Nat\xc3\xa1sha! Leave it alone! We\xe2\x80\x99ll get it all packed,\xe2\x80\x9d urged S\xc3\xb3nya\nreproachfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a young lady she is!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the major-domo.\n\nBut Nat\xc3\xa1sha would not give in. She turned everything out and began\nquickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and\nunnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had\nbeen taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned\nout that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been\nrejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases. Only\nthe lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A few\nmore things might have been taken out, but Nat\xc3\xa1sha insisted on having\nher own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler\xe2\x80\x99s assistant\nand P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x94whom she had drawn into the business of packing\xe2\x80\x94press on the\nlid, and made desperate efforts herself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough, Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya. \xe2\x80\x9cI see you were right, but just\ntake out the top one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung\nover her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the\ncarpets. \xe2\x80\x9cNow press, P\xc3\xa9tya! Press, Vas\xc3\xadlich, press hard!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\n\nThe carpets yielded and the lid closed; Nat\xc3\xa1sha, clapping her hands,\nscreamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only\nlasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her\ncompletely. The count was not angry even when they told him that Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nhad countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her\nto ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might\nbe corded up. Thanks to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s directions the work now went on\nexpeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most valuable\npacked as compactly as possible.\n\nBut hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not\nget everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count,\nhaving put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya and Nat\xc3\xa1sha slept in the sitting room without undressing.\n\nThat night another wounded man was driven down the Povarsk\xc3\xa1ya, and M\xc3\xa1vra\nKuzm\xc3\xadnichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 yard. M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna concluded that he was a very important\nman. He was being conveyed in a cal\xc3\xa8che with a raised hood, and was\nquite covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable\nold attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a\ncart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house\nwill be empty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old woman to the old attendant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said he with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to get him home\nalive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a long way from\nhere, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody living in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo us the honor to come in, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of everything in the\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s house. Come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he very ill?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nasked.\n\nThe attendant made a hopeless gesture.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\n\nThe old servant returned to the cal\xc3\xa8che, looked into it, shook his\nhead disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped\nbeside M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Lord Jesus Christ!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\n\nShe invited them to take the wounded man into the house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe masters won\xe2\x80\x99t object...\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nBut they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him\ninto the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schoss\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nThis wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolk\xc3\xb3nski.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nMoscow\xe2\x80\x99s last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday.\nThe church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on\nSundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.\n\nOnly two things indicated the social condition of Moscow\xe2\x80\x94the rabble,\nthat is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd\nof factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some officials,\nseminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone early that morning to\nthe Three Hills. Having waited there for Rostopch\xc3\xadn who did not turn\nup, they became convinced that Moscow would be surrendered, and then\ndispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices\ntoo that day indicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of\ngold, of carts and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and\ncity articles kept falling, so that by midday there were instances of\ncarters removing valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment\na half of what they carted, while peasant horses were fetching five\nhundred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being\ngiven away for nothing.\n\nIn the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former\nconditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only\nindication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared\nduring the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their\npossessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their\nestates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and\nthey were offered enormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge\nsums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and\nearly in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants\nsent by wounded officers came to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 and wounded men dragged\nthemselves there from the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 and from neighboring houses where\nthey were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them\na lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were\naddressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused,\nsaying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count. Pity these\nwounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one\ncart there would be no reason to refuse another, or all the carts and\none\xe2\x80\x99s own carriages as well. Thirty carts could not save all the wounded\nand in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one\xe2\x80\x99s\nown family. So thought the major-domo on his master\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.\n\nOn waking up that morning Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v left his bedroom softly, so\nas not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning,\nand came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In the yard\nstood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front porch.\nThe major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to\na pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count the\nmajor-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Vas\xc3\xadlich, is everything ready?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the count, and stroking his\nbald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and\nnodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can harness at once, your excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. As soon as the countess wakes we\xe2\x80\x99ll be off, God\nwilling! What is it, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning to the officer. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\nyou staying in my house?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount, be so good as to allow me... for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, to get into some\ncorner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I shall be\nall right on a loaded cart....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBefore the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same\nrequest on behalf of his master.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, yes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very pleased,\nvery pleased. Vas\xc3\xadlich, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see to it. Just unload one or two carts.\nWell, what of it... do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary...\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, muttering\nsome indefinite order.\n\nBut at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer\xe2\x80\x99s\nface had already sealed the order. The count looked around him. In the\nyard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officers and\ntheir orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at the count and\nmoving toward the porch.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease step into the gallery, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d said the major-domo.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are your orders about the pictures?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to\nrefuse the wounded who asked for a lift.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded,\xe2\x80\x9d he added in a\nsoft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.\n\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the countess woke up, and Matr\xc3\xabna Timof\xc3\xa9evna, who had\nbeen her lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of\nchief gendarme\xe2\x80\x99s duty for her, came to say that Madame Schoss was much\noffended and the young ladies\xe2\x80\x99 summer dresses could not be left behind.\nOn inquiry, the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because\nher trunk had been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were\nbeing uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for\nwounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered\nthat they should take with them. The countess sent for her husband.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer\ncame to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are\nthings that can be bought but think what being left behind means to\nthem!... Really now, in our own yard\xe2\x80\x94we asked them in ourselves and\nthere are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them\nbe taken... where\xe2\x80\x99s the hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters.\nThe countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of\nsomething detrimental to the children\xe2\x80\x99s interests, such as the building\nof a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a private theater\nor an orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced\nin that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so.\n\nShe assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband:\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting\nnothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our\xe2\x80\x94all the\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand\nrubles\xe2\x80\x99 worth of things in the house. I don\xe2\x80\x99t consent, my dear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t!\nDo as you please! It\xe2\x80\x99s the government\xe2\x80\x99s business to look after the\nwounded; they know that. Look at the Lopukh\xc3\xadns opposite, they cleared\nout everything two days ago. That\xe2\x80\x99s what other people do. It\xe2\x80\x99s only\nwe who are such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for the\nchildren.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFlourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without\nreplying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, what are you doing that for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who had followed him\ninto her mother\xe2\x80\x99s room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing! What business is it of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the count angrily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy does Mamma object?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat business is it of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the count.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha stepped up to the window and pondered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! Here\xe2\x80\x99s Berg coming to see us,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, looking out of the\nwindow.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nBerg, the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders\nof Vlad\xc3\xadmir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post\nof assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the\nfirst division of the Second Army.\n\nOn the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.\n\nHe had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the\narmy was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there.\nSo he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and\ndomestic reasons.\n\nBerg drove up to his father-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s house in his spruce little trap\nwith a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He\nlooked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the\nporch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.\n\nFrom the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the\ndrawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nand S\xc3\xb3nya, and hastened to inquire after \xe2\x80\x9cMamma\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d health.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHealth, at a time like this?\xe2\x80\x9d said the count. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, tell us the news!\nIs the army retreating or will there be another battle?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nBerg. \xe2\x80\x9cThe army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so\nto say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But\nin general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly\nantique valor of the Russian army, which they\xe2\x80\x94which it\xe2\x80\x9d (he corrected\nhimself) \xe2\x80\x9chas shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixth\xe2\x80\x94there\nare no words worthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papa\xe2\x80\x9d (he smote\nhimself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done, but\nBerg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the\nwords \xe2\x80\x9cRussian army\xe2\x80\x9d), \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you frankly that we, the commanders, far\nfrom having to urge the men on or anything of that kind, could hardly\nrestrain those... those... yes, those exploits of antique valor,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nwent on rapidly. \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at\nthe head of the troops, I can assure you. Our corps was stationed on a\nhillside. You can imagine!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had\nheard those days. Nat\xc3\xa1sha watched him with an intent gaze that confused\nhim, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some\nquestion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAltogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors\ncannot be imagined or adequately praised!\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg, glancing round\nat Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent\nlook with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of\nher sons!\xe2\x80\x99 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it so, Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nJust then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and\ndissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand,\nasked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to\nexpress sympathy, remained standing beside her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for\nevery Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get\naway....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think what the servants are about,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, turning\nto her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cI have just been told that nothing is ready yet.\nSomebody after all must see to things. One misses M\xc3\xadtenka at such times.\nThere won\xe2\x80\x99t be any end to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe count was about to say something, but evidently restrained himself.\nHe got up from his chair and went to the door.\n\nAt that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose\nand, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and\nsignificantly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHm...\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, and stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was driving past Yus\xc3\xbapov\xe2\x80\x99s house just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg with a laugh,\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\nbuy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a\nsmall chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear V\xc3\xa9ra wanted a\nchiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.\xe2\x80\x9d (At the mention\nof the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone\nto one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s\nsuch a beauty! It pulls out and has a secret English drawer, you know!\nAnd dear V\xc3\xa9ra has long wanted one. I wish to give her a surprise, you\nsee. I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard. Please let me\nhave one, I will pay the man well, and...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe count frowned and coughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk the countess, I don\xe2\x80\x99t give orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s inconvenient, please don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I so wanted it,\nfor dear V\xc3\xa9ra\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the devil...\xe2\x80\x9d\ncried the old count. \xe2\x80\x9cMy head\xe2\x80\x99s in a whirl!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd he left the room. The countess began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!\xe2\x80\x9d said Berg.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha left the room with her father and, as if finding it difficult to\nreach some decision, first followed him and then ran downstairs.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the servants\nwho were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still standing in the\nyard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing\ninto one of them helped by an orderly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what it\xe2\x80\x99s about?\xe2\x80\x9d P\xc3\xa9tya asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nShe understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about.\nShe did not answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nP\xc3\xa9tya. \xe2\x80\x9cVas\xc3\xadlich told me. I consider...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI consider,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to\nP\xc3\xa9tya, \xe2\x80\x9cI consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what.\nAre we despicable Germans?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHer throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and\nletting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed\nheadlong up the stairs.\n\nBerg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful\nattention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down\nthe room, when Nat\xc3\xa1sha, her face distorted by anger, burst in like a\ntempest and approached her mother with rapid steps.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s horrid! It\xe2\x80\x99s abominable!\xe2\x80\x9d she screamed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have\nordered it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBerg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The count\nstood still at the window and listened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible: see what is going on in the yard!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will be left!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you? Who are \xe2\x80\x98they\xe2\x80\x99? What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the wounded! It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, Mamma. It\xe2\x80\x99s monstrous!... No, Mamma\ndarling, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the thing. Please forgive me, darling.... Mamma, what\ndoes it matter what we take away? Only look what is going on in the\nyard... Mamma!... It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe count stood by the window and listened without turning round.\nSuddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.\n\nThe countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for her\nmother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did not turn\nto look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, not surrendering\nat once.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, darling, forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, you order what is right.... You know I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand about\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the count through\ntears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of\nshame on his breast.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will still\ntake all the most necessary things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe count nodded affirmatively, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha, at the rapid pace at which\nshe used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the\nanteroom and downstairs into the yard.\n\nThe servants gathered round Nat\xc3\xa1sha, but could not believe the strange\norder she brought them until the count himself, in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s name,\nconfirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the\ntrunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants\nset to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed\nstrange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could\nbe done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange\nto anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted\naway but that had seemed the only thing to do.\n\nThe whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set\neagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The\nwounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but\nhappy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread\nto the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts\nbut only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of\nunloading, once started, could not be arrested. It seemed not to matter\nwhether all or only half the things were left behind. Cases full of\nchina, bronzes, pictures, and mirrors that had been so carefully\npacked the night before now lay about the yard, and still they went on\nsearching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and\nletting the wounded have another and yet another cart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can take four more men,\xe2\x80\x9d said the steward. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can have my trap,\nor else what is to become of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them have my wardrobe cart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess. \xe2\x80\x9cDuny\xc3\xa1sha can go\nwith me in the carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a\nhouse two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was bright\nand animated. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she\nhad not known for a long time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could we fasten this onto?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the servants, trying to fix a\ntrunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must keep at least\none cart.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe count\xe2\x80\x99s books.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it, Vas\xc3\xadlich will put it away. It\xe2\x80\x99s not wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where Count\nPeter could sit.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the box. You\xe2\x80\x99ll sit on the box, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, P\xc3\xa9tya?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was quite\ndifferent from Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s. She was putting away the things that had to\nbe left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished, and she\ntried to get as much taken away with them as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nBefore two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 four carriages, packed\nfull and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door. One by one\nthe carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.\n\nThe cal\xc3\xa8che in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s\nattention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she was\narranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at\nthe entrance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose cal\xc3\xa8che is that?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, leaning out of the carriage\nwindow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know, Miss?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the maid. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wounded prince: he\nspent the night in our house and is going with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who is it? What\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s our intended that was\xe2\x80\x94Prince Bolk\xc3\xb3nski himself! They say he is\ndying,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the maid with a sigh.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess,\ntired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey,\nwas pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to\nassemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was not in the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya, \xe2\x80\x9cPrince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is\ngoing with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s arm, glanced\naround.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha?\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\n\nAt that moment this news had only one significance for both of them.\nThey knew their Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and alarm as to what would happen if she heard\nthis news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha does not know yet, but he is going with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say he is dying?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya nodded.\n\nThe countess put her arms around S\xc3\xb3nya and began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ways of God are past finding out!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, feeling that the\nAlmighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all that was\nnow taking place.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mamma? Everything is ready. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha, as\nwith animated face she ran into the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the countess. \xe2\x80\x9cIf everything is ready let us start.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face. S\xc3\xb3nya\nembraced Nat\xc3\xa1sha and kissed her.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked at her inquiringly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing... No...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it something very bad for me? What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Nat\xc3\xa1sha with\nher quick intuition.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya sighed and made no reply. The count, P\xc3\xa9tya, Madame Schoss, M\xc3\xa1vra\nKuzm\xc3\xadnichna, and Vas\xc3\xadlich came into the drawing room and, having closed\nthe doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently\nseated without looking at one another.\n\nThe count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed himself\nbefore the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count embraced\nM\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna and Vas\xc3\xadlich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while\nthey caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs\nlightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words. The\ncountess went into the oratory and there S\xc3\xb3nya found her on her knees\nbefore the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall.\n(The most precious ones, with which some family tradition was connected,\nwere being taken with them.)\n\nIn the porch and in the yard the men whom P\xc3\xa9tya had armed with swords\nand daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts\nand girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind.\n\nAs is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put in\nthe wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on\neach side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the\ncountess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house\nto the carriages, the cal\xc3\xa8che, the phaeton, and back again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey always will forget everything!\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t sit like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Duny\xc3\xa1sha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an\naggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the\nseat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, those servants!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, swaying his head.\n\nEf\xc3\xadm, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to\ndrive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance\nround at what was going on behind him. From thirty years\xe2\x80\x99 experience\nhe knew it would be some time yet before the order, \xe2\x80\x9cBe off, in God\xe2\x80\x99s\nname!\xe2\x80\x9d would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said\nhe would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch\nsomething that had been forgotten, and even after that he would again\nbe stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg\nhim for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill. He knew\nall this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen, with more\npatience than the horses, especially the near one, the chestnut Falcon,\nwho was pawing the ground and champing his bit. At last all were\nseated, the carriage steps were folded and pulled up, the door was shut,\nsomebody was sent for a traveling case, and the countess leaned out\nand said what she had to say. Then Ef\xc3\xadm deliberately doffed his hat and\nbegan crossing himself. The postilion and all the other servants did the\nsame. \xe2\x80\x9cOff, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ef\xc3\xadm, putting on his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cStart!\xe2\x80\x9d The\npostilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar,\nthe high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman\nsprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out\nof the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted in\ntheir turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In the\ncarriages, the cal\xc3\xa8che, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as they\npassed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in Moscow\nwalked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.\n\nRarely had Nat\xc3\xa1sha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting in\nthe carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding\nwalls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned out of the\ncarriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of\nwounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line she could see\nthe raised hood of Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s cal\xc3\xa8che. She did not know who was\nin it, but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that\ncal\xc3\xa8che. She knew it was right in front.\n\nIn K\xc3\xbadrino, from the Nik\xc3\xadtski, Pr\xc3\xa9snya, and Podnov\xc3\xadnsk Streets came\nseveral other trains of vehicles similar to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99, and as they\npassed along the Sad\xc3\xb3vaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows\nabreast.\n\nAs they were going round the S\xc3\xbakharev water tower Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who was\ninquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking\npast, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! Mamma, S\xc3\xb3nya, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s he!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? Who?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook! Yes, on my word, it\xe2\x80\x99s Bez\xc3\xbakhov!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, putting her head\nout of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachman\xe2\x80\x99s\nlong coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently\na gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the\nS\xc3\xbakharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man\nin a frieze coat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it really is Bez\xc3\xbakhov in a coachman\xe2\x80\x99s coat, with a queer-looking\nold boy. Really,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9clook, look!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s not he. How can you talk such nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma,\xe2\x80\x9d screamed Nat\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stake my head it\xe2\x80\x99s he! I assure you!\nStop, stop!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried to the coachman.\n\nBut the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshch\xc3\xa1nski Street came\nmore carts and carriages, and the Rost\xc3\xb3vs were being shouted at to move\non and not block the way.\n\nIn fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\nall saw Pierre\xe2\x80\x94or someone extraordinarily like him\xe2\x80\x94in a coachman\xe2\x80\x99s coat,\ngoing down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small,\nbeardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man noticed a\nface thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and respectfully\ntouching Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s elbow said something to him and pointed to the\ncarriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at first\nunderstand him. At length when he had understood and looked in the\ndirection the old man indicated, he recognized Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and following\nhis first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But\nhaving taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical\nkindliness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Kir\xc3\xadlovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is\nwonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, holding out her hand to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\nWhy are you like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked\nalong beside her while the coach still moved on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Count?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the countess in a surprised and\ncommiserating tone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What? Why? Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, and looked round at\nNat\xc3\xa1sha whose radiant, happy expression\xe2\x80\x94of which he was conscious\nwithout looking at her\xe2\x80\x94filled him with enchantment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you remaining in Moscow, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre hesitated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Moscow?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a questioning tone. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, in Moscow. Good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if only I were a man! I\xe2\x80\x99d certainly stay with you. How splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cMamma, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre glanced absently at Nat\xc3\xa1sha and was about to say something, but\nthe countess interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were at the battle, we heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be another battle\ntomorrow...\xe2\x80\x9d he began, but Nat\xc3\xa1sha interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like yourself....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know myself. Tomorrow... But\nno! Good-by, good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an awful time!\xe2\x80\x9d and dropping\nbehind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming at\nhim with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nFor the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been living\nin the empty house of his deceased benefactor, Bazd\xc3\xa9ev. This is how it\nhappened.\n\nWhen he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his\ninterview with Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn, he could not for some time make out\nwhere he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that\namong others awaiting him in his reception room there was a Frenchman\nwho had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, he felt\nsuddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which\nhe was apt to succumb. He felt that everything was now at an end, all\nwas in confusion and crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or\nwrong, the future held nothing, and there was no escape from this\nposition. Smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat\ndown on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then rose, went to the door\nof the reception room and peeped through the crack, returned flourishing\nhis arms, and took up a book. His major-domo came in a second time to\nsay that the Frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess\nwas very anxious to see him if only for a minute, and that someone from\nBazd\xc3\xa9ev\xe2\x80\x99s widow had called to ask Pierre to take charge of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\nbooks, as she herself was leaving for the country.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say I will\ncome directly,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre replied to the major-domo.\n\nBut as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat which\nwas lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door.\nThere was no one in the passage. He went along the whole length of this\npassage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forehead with\nboth hands, went down as far as the first landing. The hall porter was\nstanding at the front door. From the landing where Pierre stood there\nwas a second staircase leading to the back entrance. He went down that\nstaircase and out into the yard. No one had seen him. But there were\nsome carriages waiting, and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate\nthe coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to\nhim. When he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich\nwhich hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen: he hung his head\nand quickening his pace went down the street.\n\nOf all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph\nBazd\xc3\xa9ev\xe2\x80\x99s books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.\n\nHe hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the\nPatriarch\xe2\x80\x99s Ponds, where the widow Bazd\xc3\xa9ev\xe2\x80\x99s house was.\n\nContinually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were\nmaking their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing his bulky\nbody so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle, Pierre,\nexperiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school, began to\ntalk to his driver.\n\nThe man told him that arms were being distributed today at the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin\nand that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the Three Hills\ngates and a great battle would be fought there.\n\nHaving reached the Patriarch\xe2\x80\x99s Ponds Pierre found the Bazd\xc3\xa9evs\xe2\x80\x99 house,\nwhere he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the gate.\nGer\xc3\xa1sim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at Torzh\xc3\xb3k five\nyears before with Joseph Bazd\xc3\xa9ev, came out in answer to his knock.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt home?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOwing to the present state of things Sophia Dan\xc3\xadlovna has gone to the\nTorzh\xc3\xb3k estate with the children, your excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to step in. Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich, the brother of my late\nmaster\xe2\x80\x94may the kingdom of heaven be his\xe2\x80\x94has remained here, but he is in\na weak state as you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old servant.\n\nPierre knew that Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich was Joseph Bazd\xc3\xa9ev\xe2\x80\x99s half-insane\nbrother and a hard drinker.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I know. Let us go in...\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre and entered the house.\n\nA tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown and\nwith galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing Pierre\nhe muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your honor\nsees,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ger\xc3\xa1sim. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you step into the study?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cAs\nit was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia Dan\xc3\xadlovna gave orders\nthat if anyone should come from you they were to have the books.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such\ntrepidation in his benefactor\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime. The room, dusty and untouched\nsince the death of Joseph Bazd\xc3\xa9ev was now even gloomier.\n\nGer\xc3\xa1sim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe. Pierre\nwent round the study, approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts\nwere kept, and took out what had once been one of the most important,\nthe holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic Scotch Acts\nwith Bazd\xc3\xa9ev\xe2\x80\x99s notes and explanations. He sat down at the dusty writing\ntable, and, having laid the manuscripts before him, opened them out,\nclosed them, finally pushed them away, and resting his head on his hand\nsank into meditation.\n\nGer\xc3\xa1sim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre\nalways sitting in the same attitude.\n\nMore than two hours passed and Ger\xc3\xa1sim took the liberty of making a\nslight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did not\nhear him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the cabman to be discharged, your honor?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cLook\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, taking Ger\xc3\xa1sim by a button of his coat and looking down\nat the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cI say, do you\nknow that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe heard so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ger\xc3\xa1sim. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you have something to\neat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a pistol,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ger\xc3\xa1sim after thinking for a moment.\n\nAll the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor\xe2\x80\x99s study,\nand Ger\xc3\xa1sim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and\ntalking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made up for him\nthere.\n\nGer\xc3\xa1sim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things,\naccepted Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s taking up his residence in the house without surprise,\nand seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same evening\xe2\x80\x94without\neven asking himself what they were wanted for\xe2\x80\x94he procured a coachman\xe2\x80\x99s\ncoat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him the pistol next day.\nMak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes\nas far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But\nas soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around\nhim with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away. It was when\nPierre (wearing the coachman\xe2\x80\x99s coat which Ger\xc3\xa1sim had procured for him\nand had disinfected by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the\npistol at the S\xc3\xbakharev market that he met the Rost\xc3\xb3vs.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s order to retreat through Moscow to the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n road was issued\nat night on the first of September.\n\nThe first troops started at once, and during the night they marched\nslowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those nearing\nthe town at the Dorogom\xc3\xadlov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers\ncrowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the opposite side\nand blocking the streets and alleys, while endless masses of troops were\nbearing down on them from behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm\novercame them. They all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and\nto the fords and the boats. Kut\xc3\xbazov himself had driven round by side\nstreets to the other side of Moscow.\n\nBy ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning of the second of September, only the rear\nguard remained in the Dorogom\xc3\xadlov suburb, where they had ample room. The\nmain army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.\n\nAt that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,\nNapoleon was standing among his troops on the Pokl\xc3\xb3nny Hill looking at\nthe panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August\nto the second of September, that is from the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 to the\nentry of the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating,\nmemorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that\nalways comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat\nthan in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear\natmosphere that the eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and\nrefreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air, when even the nights\nare warm, and when in those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and\ndelight us continually by falling from the sky.\n\nAt ten in the morning of the second of September this weather still\nheld.\n\nThe brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the Pokl\xc3\xb3nny\nHill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her\nchurches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas\nglittering like stars in the sunlight.\n\nThe view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as\nhe had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious and\nuneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has\nno knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full force\nof its own life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance,\ndistinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the Pokl\xc3\xb3nny\nHill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the\nbreathing of that great and beautiful body.\n\nEvery Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every\nforeigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the\nmother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCette ville asiatique aux innombrables \xc3\xa9glises, Moscou la sainte. La\nvoil\xc3\xa0 donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il \xc3\xa9tait temps,\xe2\x80\x9d * said he, and\ndismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and\nsummoned Lelorgne d\xe2\x80\x99Ideville, the interpreter.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cThat Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy\n     Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city. It was\n     high time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthought he (he had said so to T\xc3\xbachkov at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk). From that point of\nview he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed\nstrange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable,\nhad at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at\nthe city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance\nof possessing it agitated and awed him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut could it be otherwise?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is this capital at my\nfeet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange,\nbeautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what\nlight must I appear to them!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, thinking of his troops.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflected,\nglancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and\nforming up. \xe2\x80\x9cOne word from me, one movement of my hand, and that ancient\ncapital of the Tsars would perish. But my clemency is always ready to\ndescend upon the vanquished. I must be magnanimous and truly great. But\nno, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be true that I am in Moscow,\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly thought.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet here she is lying at my feet, with her golden domes and crosses\nscintillating and twinkling in the sunshine. But I shall spare her. On\nthe ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism I will inscribe great\nwords of justice and mercy.... It is just this which Alexander will\nfeel most painfully, I know him.\xe2\x80\x9d (It seemed to Napoleon that the chief\nimport of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between\nhimself and Alexander.) \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the height of the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin\xe2\x80\x94yes, there\nis the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin, yes\xe2\x80\x94I will give them just laws; I will teach them the\nmeaning of true civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember\ntheir conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not,\nand do not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false\npolicy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in\nMoscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people.\nI do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored\nmonarch. \xe2\x80\x98Boyars,\xe2\x80\x99 I will say to them, \xe2\x80\x98I do not desire war, I desire\nthe peace and welfare of all my subjects.\xe2\x80\x99 However, I know their\npresence will inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do:\nclearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in\nMoscow? Yes, there she lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQu\xe2\x80\x99on m\xe2\x80\x99am\xc3\xa8ne les boyars,\xe2\x80\x9d * said he to his suite.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cBring the boyars to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nA general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the\nboyars.\n\nTwo hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the\nsame place on the Pokl\xc3\xb3nny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to\nthe boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That\nspeech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.\n\nHe was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to\nadopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for assemblies\nat the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and his own would\nmingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who would win the\nhearts of the people. Having learned that there were many charitable\ninstitutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors\non them all. He thought that, as in Africa he had to put on a burnoose\nand sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must be beneficent like the Tsars.\nAnd in order finally to touch the hearts of the Russians\xe2\x80\x94and being like\nall Frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference\nto ma ch\xc3\xa8re, ma tendre, ma pauvre m\xc3\xa8re * \xe2\x80\x94he decided that he would\nplace an inscription on all these establishments in large letters:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis establishment is dedicated to my dear mother.\xe2\x80\x9d Or no, it should\nbe simply: Maison de ma M\xc3\xa8re, *(2) he concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut am I really in\nMoscow? Yes, here it lies before me, but why is the deputation from the\ncity so long in appearing?\xe2\x80\x9d he wondered.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, my tender, my poor mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * (2) \xe2\x80\x9cHouse of my Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nMeanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers\namong his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite. Those sent to\nfetch the deputation had returned with the news that Moscow was empty,\nthat everyone had left it. The faces of those who were not conferring\ntogether were pale and perturbed. They were not alarmed by the fact\nthat Moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact\nseemed), but by the question how to tell the Emperor\xe2\x80\x94without putting\nhim in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous\xe2\x80\x94that he had been\nawaiting the boyars so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left\nin Moscow but no one else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must\nbe scraped together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that\nthe Emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then\ntold the truth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will have to be told, all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said some gentlemen of the\nsuite. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, gentlemen...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating upon\nhis magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before the\noutspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from under\nhis lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible...\xe2\x80\x9d declared the gentlemen of the suite, shrugging\ntheir shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word\xe2\x80\x94le\nridicule....\n\nAt last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actor\xe2\x80\x99s instinct\nsuggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out\nwas beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with his hand. A single\nreport of a signaling gun followed, and the troops, who were already\nspread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into the city through the\nTver, Kal\xc3\xbaga, and Dorogom\xc3\xadlov gates. Faster and faster, vying with\none another, they moved at the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the\nclouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar\nof mingling shouts.\n\nDrawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as far as\nthe Dorogom\xc3\xadlov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his\nhorse, paced for a long time by the K\xc3\xa1mmer-Koll\xc3\xa9zski rampart, awaiting\nthe deputation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nMeanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a\nfiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty.\nIt was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.\n\nIn a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it\nseems as much alive as other hives.\n\nThe bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday\nsun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it smells of\nhoney like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same way. But one\nhas only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any\nlife in it. The bees do not fly in the same way, the smell and the sound\nthat meet the beekeeper are not the same. To the beekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s tap on the\nwall of the sick hive, instead of the former instant unanimous\nhumming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly\ncompressed, and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an\naerial living sound, the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from\ndifferent parts of the deserted hive. From the alighting board, instead\nof the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom, and the warm\nwhiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling\nwith the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels sounding the\nalarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in defense of the\nhive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity,\nlike the sound of boiling water, but diverse discordant sounds of\ndisorder. In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with\nhoney fly timidly and shiftily. They do not sting, but crawl away from\ndanger. Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive, and they\nflew out empty; now they fly out laden. The beekeeper opens the lower\npart of the hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy bees\xe2\x80\x94tamed by\ntoil, clinging to one another\xe2\x80\x99s legs and drawing out the wax, with a\nceaseless hum of labor\xe2\x80\x94that used to hang in long clusters down to the\nfloor of the hive, drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in\nvarious directions on the floor and walls of the hive. Instead of a\nneatly glued floor, swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings,\nthere is a floor littered with bits of wax, excrement, dying bees\nscarcely moving their legs, and dead ones that have not been cleared\naway.\n\nThe beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super.\nInstead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and\nkeeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex structures of the\ncombs, but no longer in their former state of purity. All is neglected\nand foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about\nthe combs, and the short home bees, shriveled and listless as if they\nwere old, creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers,\nhaving lost all motive and all sense of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps,\nand butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their\nflight. Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey\nan angry buzzing can sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of\nbees, by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells, with\nefforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or\nbumblebee without knowing why they do it. In another corner two old bees\nare languidly fighting, or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another,\nwithout themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile\nintent. In a third place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack\nsome victim and fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or\nkilled, drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap\nof corpses. The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine\nthe brood cells. In place of the former close dark circles formed by\nthousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery\nof generation, he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of\nbees. They have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they\nhad guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. Only\na few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\nhand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are dead and fall\nas lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the hive, chalks a mark\non it, and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean.\n\nSo in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy, and\nmorose, paced up and down in front of the K\xc3\xa1mmer-Koll\xc3\xa9zski rampart,\nawaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, observance of\nthe proprieties\xe2\x80\x94a deputation.\n\nIn various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly\nmoving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of what they\nwere doing.\n\nWhen with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was\nempty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently\ncontinued to walk to and fro.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy carriage!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nHe took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into the\nsuburb. \xe2\x80\x9cMoscow deserted!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an incredible\nevent!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the Dorogom\xc3\xadlov\nsuburb.\n\nThe coup de th\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa2tre had not come off.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nThe Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night\ntill two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the\nlast of the inhabitants who were leaving.\n\nThe greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the\nStone, Moskv\xc3\xa1, and Ya\xc3\xbaza bridges.\n\nWhile the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the\nKr\xc3\xa9mlin, were thronging the Moskv\xc3\xa1 and the Stone bridges, a great many\nsoldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back\nfrom the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of\nVas\xc3\xadli the Beatified and under the Borov\xc3\xadtski gate, back up the hill\nto the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily take\nthings not belonging to them. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales\nfilled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar. But there were no\ndealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to\nenter; there were no hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of female\npurchasers\xe2\x80\x94but only soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though without\nmuskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way\nout through its passages with bundles. Tradesmen and their assistants\n(of whom there were but few) moved about among the soldiers quite\nbewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked them up again, and\nthemselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants. On the\nsquare in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the muster call.\nBut the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the\ndirection of the drum as formerly, but made them, on the contrary, run\nfarther away. Among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were\nto be seen in gray coats, with closely shaven heads. Two officers, one\nwith a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse,\nthe other in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ily\xc3\xadnka\nStreet, talking. A third officer galloped up to them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail.\nThis is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you off to?... Where?...\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to three infantrymen\nwithout muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were\nslipping past him into the Bazaar passage. \xe2\x80\x9cStop, you rascals!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how are you going to stop them?\xe2\x80\x9d replied another officer. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\nno getting them together. The army should push on before the rest bolt,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge, and\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t move. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from\nrunning away?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, go in there and drive them out!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the senior officer.\n\nThe officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with\nhim into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a group. A\nshopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm,\npersistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and\nostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to protect us! We won\xe2\x80\x99t grudge\ntrifles, you are welcome to anything\xe2\x80\x94we shall be delighted! Pray!...\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman,\nor even two pieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is; but what\xe2\x80\x99s all\nthis\xe2\x80\x94sheer robbery! If you please, could not guards be placed if only to\nlet us close the shop....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSeveral shopkeepers crowded round the officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, what twaddle!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\none\xe2\x80\x99s head is gone one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t weep for one\xe2\x80\x99s hair! Take what any of you\nlike!\xe2\x80\x9d And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the\nofficer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for you, Iv\xc3\xa1n Sid\xc3\xb3rych, to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first\ntradesman angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease step inside, your honor!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the thin one. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my three shops here I have a\nhundred thousand rubles\xe2\x80\x99 worth of goods. Can they be saved when the army\nhas gone? Eh, what people! \xe2\x80\x98Against God\xe2\x80\x99s might our hands can\xe2\x80\x99t fight.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome inside, your honor!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the tradesman, bowing.\n\nThe officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my business!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one of\nthe passages.\n\nFrom one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and just\nas the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was\nflung out violently.\n\nThis man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer. The\nofficer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that\nmoment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the Moskv\xc3\xa1\nbridge and the officer ran out into the square.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, but his comrade was already\ngalloping off past Vas\xc3\xadli the Beatified in the direction from which the\nscreams came.\n\nThe officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached the\nbridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the bridge,\nseveral overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces among the\ntroops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were\nharnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels.\nThe cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a child\xe2\x80\x99s chair\nwith its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and\ndesperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers that the screams\nof the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that\nGeneral Erm\xc3\xb3lov, coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were\ndispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge,\nhad ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the\nbridge. The crowd, crushing one another, upsetting carts, and shouting\nand squeezing desperately, had cleared off the bridge and the troops\nwere now moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nMeanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone in the\nstreets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and there round\nthe taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard. Nobody\ndrove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard. The\nPovarsk\xc3\xa1ya was quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard of the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the\nhorses, and not a soul was to be seen there. In the great drawing\nroom of the house, which had been left with all it contained, were\ntwo people. They were the yard porter Ign\xc3\xa1t, and the page boy M\xc3\xadshka,\nVas\xc3\xadlich\xe2\x80\x99s grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his grandfather.\nM\xc3\xadshka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with\none finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling with\nsatisfaction before the large mirror.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it fine, eh, Uncle Ign\xc3\xa1t?\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, suddenly beginning to\nstrike the keyboard with both hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly fancy!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ign\xc3\xa1t, surprised at the broadening grin on his\nface in the mirror.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpudence! Impudence!\xe2\x80\x9d they heard behind them the voice of M\xc3\xa1vra\nKuzm\xc3\xadnichna who had entered silently. \xe2\x80\x9cHow he\xe2\x80\x99s grinning, the fat mug!\nIs that what you\xe2\x80\x99re here for? Nothing\xe2\x80\x99s cleared away down there and\nVas\xc3\xadlich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIgn\xc3\xa1t left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of the room with\nmeekly downcast eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt, I did it gently,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you something gently, you monkey you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried M\xc3\xa1vra\nKuzm\xc3\xadnichna, raising her arm threateningly. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and get the samovar to\nboil for your grandfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nM\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it, and\nwith a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.\n\nGoing out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go\nnext\xe2\x80\x94to drink tea in the servants\xe2\x80\x99 wing with Vas\xc3\xadlich, or into the\nstoreroom to put away what still lay about.\n\nShe heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street. Someone\nstopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it.\nM\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna went to the gate.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe count\xe2\x80\x94Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Andr\xc3\xa9evich Rost\xc3\xb3v.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn officer, I have to see him,\xe2\x80\x9d came the reply in a pleasant, well-bred\nRussian voice.\n\nM\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, with the\nround face of a Rost\xc3\xb3v, entered the yard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nM\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna cordially.\n\nThe young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating whether to\nenter or not, clicked his tongue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, how annoying!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have come yesterday.... Ah,\nwhat a pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMeanwhile, M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna was attentively and sympathetically\nexamining the familiar Rost\xc3\xb3v features of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s face, his\ntattered coat and trodden-down boots.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you want to see the count for?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh well... it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped!\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a tone of vexation and\nplaced his hand on the gate as if to leave.\n\nHe again paused in indecision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a kinsman of the count\xe2\x80\x99s and he has\nbeen very kind to me. As you see\xe2\x80\x9d (he glanced with an amused air and\ngood-natured smile at his coat and boots) \xe2\x80\x9cmy things are worn out and I\nhave no money, so I was going to ask the count...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nM\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna did not let him finish.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust wait a minute, sir. One little moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\nAnd as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and,\nhurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the\nservants\xe2\x80\x99 quarters.\n\nWhile M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna was running to her room the officer walked about\nthe yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a faint\nsmile on his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed Uncle! What a nice old\nwoman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the nearest way\nto overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near the Rog\xc3\xb3zhski\ngate?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. Just then M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna appeared from behind\nthe corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look, carrying a\nrolled-up check kerchief in her hand. While still a few steps from\nthe officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white\ntwenty-five-ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he would of course...\nbut as it is...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nM\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did not\ndecline, but took the note quietly and thanked her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the count had been at home...\xe2\x80\x9d M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna went on\napologetically. \xe2\x80\x9cChrist be with you, sir! May God preserve you!\xe2\x80\x9d said\nshe, bowing as she saw him out.\n\nSwaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer ran\nalmost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Ya\xc3\xbaza bridge to\novertake his regiment.\n\nBut M\xc3\xa1vra Kuzm\xc3\xadnichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist\neyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of\nmotherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nFrom an unfinished house on the Varv\xc3\xa1rka, the ground floor of which was\na dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches round the tables\nin a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands. Tipsy and perspiring,\nwith dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were all laboriously singing\nsome song or other. They were singing discordantly, arduously, and with\ngreat effort, evidently not because they wished to sing, but because\nthey wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall,\nfair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others. His\nface with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not\nbeen for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed\neyes. Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were\nsinging, and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white\narm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread\nout his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he\nalways carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were\nmost important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be\nbare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and fighting and blows\nin the passage and porch. The tall lad waved his arm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop it!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed peremptorily. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a fight, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d And,\nstill rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.\n\nThe factory hands followed him. These men, who under the leadership of\nthe tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning, had brought the\npublican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served\nthem. The blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy, hearing the sounds of\nrevelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into, wished\nto force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted.\n\nThe publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when the\nworkmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern\nkeeper, fell face downward on the pavement.\n\nAnother smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the publican\nwith his chest.\n\nThe lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and\ncried wildly: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re fighting us, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised\nface to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: \xe2\x80\x9cPolice! Murder!...\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve killed a man, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, gracious me, a man beaten to death\xe2\x80\x94killed!...\xe2\x80\x9d screamed a woman\ncoming out of a gate close by.\n\nA crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you robbed people enough\xe2\x80\x94taking their last shirts?\xe2\x80\x9d said a\nvoice addressing the publican. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you killed a man for, you\nthief?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from the\npublican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to\nfight now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMurderer!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted suddenly to the publican. \xe2\x80\x9cBind him, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you would like to bind me!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the publican, pushing\naway the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head he\nflung it on the ground.\n\nAs if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the\nworkmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the law very well, mates! I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the matter to the captain\nof police. You think I won\xe2\x80\x99t get to him? Robbery is not permitted to\nanybody nowadays!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the publican, picking up his cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along then! Come along then!\xe2\x80\x9d the publican and the tall young\nfellow repeated one after the other, and they moved up the street\ntogether.\n\nThe bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and others\nfollowed behind, talking and shouting.\n\nAt the corner of the Moros\xc3\xa9yka, opposite a large house with closed\nshutters and bearing a bootmaker\xe2\x80\x99s signboard, stood a score of thin,\nworn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long tattered\ncoats.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe should pay folks off properly,\xe2\x80\x9d a thin workingman, with frowning\nbrows and a straggly beard, was saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he\xe2\x80\x99s sucked our blood and now he thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s quit of us. He\xe2\x80\x99s been\nmisleading us all the week and now that he\xe2\x80\x99s brought us to this pass\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s made off.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased\nspeaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving\ncrowd.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are all the folks going?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to the police, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, is it true that we have been beaten?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you think?\nLook what folks are saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nQuestions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage of the\nincreased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.\n\nThe tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his\nbare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention\nto himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded, expecting\nanswers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must keep order, keep the law, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the government is there\nfor. Am I not right, good Christians?\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall youth, with a\nscarcely perceptible smile. \xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks there\xe2\x80\x99s no government! How can\none do without government? Or else there would be plenty who\xe2\x80\x99d rob us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy talk nonsense?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined voices in the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cWill they give\nup Moscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed it!\nAren\xe2\x80\x99t there plenty of troops on the march? Let him in, indeed! That\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat the government is for. You\xe2\x80\x99d better listen to what people are\nsaying,\xe2\x80\x9d said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.\n\nBy the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered round\na man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn uk\xc3\xa1se, they are reading an uk\xc3\xa1se! Reading an uk\xc3\xa1se!\xe2\x80\x9d cried voices in\nthe crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.\n\nThe man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31. When\nthe crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the demand\nof the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a rather\ntremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEarly tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness,\xe2\x80\x9d he read (\xe2\x80\x9cSirin\nHighness,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and\na frown on his brow), \xe2\x80\x9cto consult with him to act, and to aid the army\nto exterminate these scoundrels. We too will take part...\xe2\x80\x9d the reader\nwent on, and then paused (\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the youth victoriously,\n\xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s going to clear up the whole affair for you....\xe2\x80\x9d), \xe2\x80\x9cin destroying\nthem, and will send these visitors to the devil. I will come back to\ndinner, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll set to work. We will do, completely do, and undo these\nscoundrels.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The tall\nlad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had understood\nthe last part. In particular, the words \xe2\x80\x9cI will come back to dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d\nevidently displeased both reader and audience. The people\xe2\x80\x99s minds\nwere tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly\ncomprehensible\xe2\x80\x94it was what any one of them might have said and therefore\nwas what an uk\xc3\xa1se emanating from the highest authority should not say.\n\nThey all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his lips and\nswayed from side to side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe should ask him... that\xe2\x80\x99s he himself?\xe2\x80\x9d... \xe2\x80\x9cYes, ask him indeed!...\nWhy not? He\xe2\x80\x99ll explain\xe2\x80\x9d... voices in the rear of the crowd were\nsuddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned to the police\nsuperintendent\xe2\x80\x99s trap which drove into the square attended by two\nmounted dragoons.\n\nThe superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count\nRostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that\nmatter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his\npocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to\nstop.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat people are these?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted to the men, who were moving singly\nand timidly in the direction of his trap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat people are these?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted again, receiving no answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor...\xe2\x80\x9d replied the shopman in the frieze coat, \xe2\x80\x9cyour honor, in\naccord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count, they\ndesire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any kind of\nriot, but as his highest excellence said...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued\nconcerning you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the superintendent of police. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on!\xe2\x80\x9d he ordered\nhis coachman.\n\nThe crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the\nsuperintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.\n\nThe superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared\nlook, said something to his coachman, and his horses increased their\nspeed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the tall\nyouth. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted\ndifferent people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.\n\nFollowing the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went\nin the direction of the Luby\xc3\xa1nka Street.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to\nperish. Do they think we\xe2\x80\x99re dogs?\xe2\x80\x9d voices in the crowd were heard saying\nmore and more frequently.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nOn the evening of the first of September, after his interview with\nKut\xc3\xbazov, Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn had returned to Moscow mortified and offended\nbecause he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and\nbecause Kut\xc3\xbazov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the\ndefense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him\nat the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its\npatriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and\nunimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and surprised by all this,\nRostopch\xc3\xadn had returned to Moscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa\nwithout undressing, and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier\nbringing him a letter from Kut\xc3\xbazov. This letter requested the count to\nsend police officers to guide the troops through the town, as the army\nwas retreating to the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n road beyond Moscow. This was not news to\nRostopch\xc3\xadn. He had known that Moscow would be abandoned not merely since\nhis interview the previous day with Kut\xc3\xbazov on the Pokl\xc3\xb3nny Hill but\never since the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, for all the generals who came to\nMoscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to\nfight another battle, and since then the government property had been\nremoved every night, and half the inhabitants had left the city\nwith Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s own permission. Yet all the same this information\nastonished and irritated the count, coming as it did in the form of a\nsimple note with an order from Kut\xc3\xbazov, and received at night, breaking\nin on his beauty sleep.\n\nWhen later on in his memoirs Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn explained his actions at\nthis time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important\nconsiderations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the\ndeparture of the inhabitants. If one accepts this twofold aim all\nRostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s actions appear irreproachable. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy were the holy relics,\nthe arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed? Why\nwere thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow would\nnot be given up\xe2\x80\x94and thereby ruined?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo preserve the tranquillity\nof the city,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy were bundles of useless\npapers from the government offices, and Leppich\xe2\x80\x99s balloon and other\narticles removed?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo leave the town empty,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn.\nOne need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action\nfinds a justification.\n\nAll the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for\npublic tranquillity.\n\nOn what, then, was Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s fear for the tranquillity of\nMoscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability\nof an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the\nretreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause the masses to\nriot?\n\nNeither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an\ninsurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than\nten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of\nSeptember, and except for a mob in the governor\xe2\x80\x99s courtyard, assembled\nthere at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would\nhave been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people\nif after the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, when the surrender of Moscow became\ncertain or at least probable, Rostopch\xc3\xadn instead of exciting the people\nby distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all\nthe holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the\npopulation plainly that the town would be abandoned.\n\nRostopch\xc3\xadn, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and\nimpulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles\nand had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to\nbe guiding. Ever since the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s entry into Smol\xc3\xa9nsk he had in\nimagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling\nof \xe2\x80\x9cthe heart of Russia.\xe2\x80\x9d Not only did it seem to him (as to all\nadministrators) that he controlled the external actions of Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s\ninhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by\nmeans of his broadsheets and posters, written in a coarse tone which the\npeople despise in their own class and do not understand from those in\nauthority. Rostopch\xc3\xadn was so pleased with the fine role of leader of\npopular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of\nrelinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display\ntook him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under\nhis feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though he knew\nit was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe\nthat Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for it. The\ninhabitants left against his wishes. If the government offices were\nremoved, this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count\nyielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had created\nfor himself. As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent\nimagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he\nknew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and\ndid not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs.\n\nAll his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful\nand had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply\ndirected toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic\nhatred of the French.\n\nBut when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing\nhatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not\neven possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when\nself-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before\nMoscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man,\nabandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all\nthe depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nsuddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous,\nweak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.\n\nWhen, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory note\nfrom Kut\xc3\xbazov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself\nto blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state\nproperty which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no\nlonger possible to take the whole of it away.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nruminated. \xe2\x80\x9cNot I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow\nfirmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains!\nTraitors!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and\ntraitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever\nthey might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in\nwhich he found himself.\n\nAll that night Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn issued orders, for which people came to\nhim from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the count\nso morose and irritable.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency, the Director of the Registrar\xe2\x80\x99s Department has sent\nfor instructions.... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from the\nUniversity, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent...\nasking for information.... What are your orders about the Fire Brigade?\nFrom the governor of the prison... from the superintendent of the\nlunatic asylum...\xe2\x80\x9d All night long such announcements were continually\nbeing received by the count.\n\nTo all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that\norders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, carefully\nprepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that that somebody\nwould have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, tell that blockhead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in reply to the question from the\nRegistrar\xe2\x80\x99s Department, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he should remain to guard his documents.\nNow why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They have\nhorses, let them be off to Vlad\xc3\xadmir, and not leave them to the French.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come:\nwhat are your commands?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy commands? Let them go away, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.... And let the lunatics\nout into the town. When lunatics command our armies God evidently means\nthese other madmen to be free.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count\nRostopch\xc3\xadn shouted angrily at the governor:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you expect me to give you two battalions\xe2\x80\x94which we have not got\xe2\x80\x94for a\nconvoy? Release them, that\xe2\x80\x99s all about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency, there are some political prisoners, Meshk\xc3\xb3v,\nVereshch\xc3\xa1gin...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVereshch\xc3\xa1gin! Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he been hanged yet?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Rostopch\xc3\xadn. \xe2\x80\x9cBring\nhim to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nToward nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, when the troops were already moving\nthrough Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for instructions.\nThose who were able to get away were going of their own accord, those\nwho remained behind decided for themselves what they must do.\n\nThe count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sok\xc3\xb3lniki, and sat\nin his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.\n\nIn quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it\nis only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is\nkept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every\nadministrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts. While the\nsea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark,\nholding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself\nmoving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding\non to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and\nthe ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves\nindependently with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer\nreaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead\nof appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant,\nuseless, feeble man.\n\nRostopch\xc3\xadn felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.\n\nThe superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to\nsee him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the\nhorses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent of\npolice, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had\nreceived, informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the\ncourtyard and wished to see him.\n\nWithout saying a word Rostopch\xc3\xadn rose and walked hastily to his light,\nluxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the\nhandle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a\nbetter view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in front,\nflourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look. The\nblood-stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of\nvoices was audible through the closed window.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my carriage ready?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rostopch\xc3\xadn, stepping back from the window.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, your excellency,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the adjutant.\n\nRostopch\xc3\xadn went again to the balcony door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do they want?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the superintendent of police.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your\norders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about\ntreachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency\xe2\x80\x94I hardly managed\nto get away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may go. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need you to tell me what to do!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\nRostopch\xc3\xadn angrily.\n\nHe stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have done\nwith me!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up\nwithin him against the someone to whom what was happening might be\nattributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was mastered by\nanger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is\nthat mob, the dregs of the people,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought as he gazed at the crowd:\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a victim,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And this\nthought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim,\nsomething on which to vent his rage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the carriage ready?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin? He is\nwaiting at the porch,\xe2\x80\x9d said the adjutant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rostopch\xc3\xadn, as if struck by an unexpected recollection.\n\nAnd rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony.\nThe talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, and all eyes\nwere raised to the count.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d said the count briskly and loudly. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for\ncoming. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come out to you in a moment, but we must first settle\nwith the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of\nMoscow. Wait for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door\nbehind him.\n\nA murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll\nsettle with all the villains, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see! And you said the French...\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll show you what law is!\xe2\x80\x9d the mob were saying as if reproving one\nanother for their lack of confidence.\n\nA few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door,\ngave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved\neagerly from the balcony toward the porch. Rostopch\xc3\xadn, coming out there\nwith quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking someone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man coming\nround the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a long thin\nneck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again covered by\nshort hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat\nlined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict\ntrousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots.\nOn his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute\nmovements.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rostopch\xc3\xadn, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young\nman in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut him there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot\nindicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed\nhis neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and\nsubmissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.\n\nFor several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step\nthe silence continued. Only among the back rows of the people, who were\nall pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling\nof feet be heard.\n\nWhile waiting for the young man to take his place on the step Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nstood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLads!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThis man,\nVereshch\xc3\xa1gin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a\nsubmissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated young\nface, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At\nthe count\xe2\x80\x99s first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if\nwishing to say something or at least to meet his eye. But Rostopch\xc3\xadn did\nnot look at him. A vein in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s long thin neck swelled like a\ncord and went blue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed.\n\nAll eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more\nhopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly\nand timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to\nBonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name,\nhe has caused Moscow to perish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rostopch\xc3\xadn in a sharp, even voice,\nbut suddenly he glanced down at Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin who continued to stand in\nthe same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight, he raised his\narm and addressed the people, almost shouting:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to\none another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling\natmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown,\nuncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing\nin front, who had seen and heard what had taken place before them, all\nstood with wide-open eyes and mouths, straining with all their strength,\nand held back the crowd that was pushing behind them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian name!\xe2\x80\x9d\nshouted Rostopch\xc3\xadn. \xe2\x80\x9cCut him down. I command it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\nthe crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin in the\nmidst of the momentary silence that ensued, \xe2\x80\x9cCount! One God is above us\nboth....\xe2\x80\x9d He lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck\nfilled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face.\n\nHe did not finish what he wished to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut him down! I command it...\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Rostopch\xc3\xadn, suddenly growing\npale like Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDraw sabers!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.\n\nAnother still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the\nfront ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The tall\nyouth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood\nbeside Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaber him!\xe2\x80\x9d the dragoon officer almost whispered.\n\nAnd one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,\nstruck Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin in meek surprise, looking round with a\nfrightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him. A\nsimilar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\nexclaimed a sorrowful voice.\n\nBut after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin\nhe uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. The barrier\nof human feeling, strained to the utmost, that had held the crowd in\ncheck suddenly broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. The\nplaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar\nof the crowd. Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that\nlast irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks,\ncarrying them off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was\nabout to repeat his blow. Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin with a cry of horror, covering\nhis head with his hands, rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth,\nagainst whom he stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands and,\nyelling wildly, fell with him under the feet of the pressing, struggling\ncrowd.\n\nSome beat and tore at Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin, others at the tall youth. And the\nscreams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to\nrescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd. It was a long\ntime before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth, beaten\nalmost to death. And for a long time, despite the feverish haste with\nwhich the mob tried to end the work that had been begun, those who were\nhitting, throttling, and tearing at Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin were unable to kill\nhim, for the crowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them\nin the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or\nlet him go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold Christ....\nStill alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture serves a thief\nright. Use the hatchet!... What\xe2\x80\x94still alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOnly when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a\nlong-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate,\nbleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one came\nup, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and\nastonishment pushed back again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?\xe2\x80\x9d voices\nin the crowd could be heard saying. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite a young fellow too... must\nhave been a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s son. What men!... and they say he\xe2\x80\x99s not the right\none.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there\xe2\x80\x99s another has been\nbeaten too\xe2\x80\x94they say he\xe2\x80\x99s nearly done for.... Oh, the people... Aren\xe2\x80\x99t\nthey afraid of sinning?...\xe2\x80\x9d said the same mob now, looking with pained\ndistress at the dead body with its long, thin, half-severed neck and its\nlivid face stained with blood and dust.\n\nA painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse in\nhis excellency\xe2\x80\x99s courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it away.\nTwo dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the\nground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its long neck\ntrailed twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back from it.\n\nAt the moment when Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin fell and the crowd closed in with savage\nyells and swayed about him, Rostopch\xc3\xadn suddenly turned pale and, instead\nof going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him, went\nwith hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and why, along the\npassage leading to the rooms on the ground floor. The count\xe2\x80\x99s face was\nwhite and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way,\nplease...\xe2\x80\x9d said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.\n\nCount Rostopch\xc3\xadn was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in\nthe direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his cal\xc3\xa8che. The\ndistant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He hastily\ntook his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in\nSok\xc3\xb3lniki.\n\nWhen they reached the Myasn\xc3\xadtski Street and could no longer hear\nthe shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with\ndissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his\nsubordinates. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mob is terrible\xe2\x80\x94disgusting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself\nin French. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount! One God is above us both!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin\xe2\x80\x99s words suddenly\nrecurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this\nwas only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn smiled disdainfully\nat himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI had other duties,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people had to be\nappeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the\npublic good\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he began thinking of his social duties to his family\nand to the city entrusted to him, and of himself\xe2\x80\x94not himself as Theodore\nVas\xc3\xadlyevich Rostopch\xc3\xadn (he fancied that Theodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nwas sacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as governor,\nthe representative of authority and of the Tsar. \xe2\x80\x9cHad I been simply\nTheodore Vas\xc3\xadlyevich my course of action would have been quite\ndifferent, but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as\ncommander in chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer\nhearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopch\xc3\xadn grew physically\ncalm and, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil\nhis mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too. The\nthought which tranquillized Rostopch\xc3\xadn was not a new one. Since the\nworld began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed\nsuch a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with\nthis same idea. This idea is le bien public, the hypothetical welfare of\nother people.\n\nTo a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he\nwho commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies. And\nRostopch\xc3\xadn now knew it.\n\nNot only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but\nhe even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully\ncontrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a\ncriminal and at the same time pacify the mob.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVereshch\xc3\xa1gin was tried and condemned to death,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Rostopch\xc3\xadn\n(though the Senate had only condemned Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin to hard labor), \xe2\x80\x9che\nwas a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go unpunished and so I have\nkilled two birds with one stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim\nand at the same time punished a miscreant.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic\narrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.\n\nHalf an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the\nSok\xc3\xb3lniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering\nwhat was to come. He was driving to the Ya\xc3\xbaza bridge where he had heard\nthat Kut\xc3\xbazov was. Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn was mentally preparing the angry and\nstinging reproaches he meant to address to Kut\xc3\xbazov for his deception. He\nwould make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all\nthe calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the\nruin of Russia (as Rostopch\xc3\xadn regarded it) would fall upon his doting\nold head. Planning beforehand what he would say to Kut\xc3\xbazov, Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nturned angrily in his cal\xc3\xa8che and gazed sternly from side to side.\n\nThe Sok\xc3\xb3lniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of the\nalmshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white\nand others like them walking singly across the field shouting and\ngesticulating.\n\nOne of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s\ncarriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons\nlooked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and\nespecially at the one running toward them.\n\nSwaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering\ndressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on\nRostopch\xc3\xadn, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him\nto stop. The lunatic\xe2\x80\x99s solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow, with\nits beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with\nsaffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop! Pull up, I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in a piercing voice, and again\nshouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.\n\nComing abreast of the cal\xc3\xa8che he ran beside it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead. They\nstoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall rise.\nThey have torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown... Thrice\nwill I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, raising his\nvoice higher and higher.\n\nCount Rostopch\xc3\xadn suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed\nin on Vereshch\xc3\xa1gin. He turned away. \xe2\x80\x9cGo fas... faster!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried in a\ntrembling voice to his coachman. The cal\xc3\xa8che flew over the ground as\nfast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nstill heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the\ndistance, while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened,\nbloodstained face of \xe2\x80\x9cthe traitor\xe2\x80\x9d in the fur-lined coat.\n\nRecent as that mental picture was, Rostopch\xc3\xadn already felt that it had\ncut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt clearly that\nthe gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time, but that\nthe terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in his heart ever more\ncruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He seemed still to hear\nthe sound of his own words: \xe2\x80\x9cCut him down! I command it....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said them....\nI need not have said them,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then nothing would have\nhappened.\xe2\x80\x9d He saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon\nwho dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the\nfur-lined coat had turned upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I did not do it for my own\nsake. I was bound to act that way.... The mob, the traitor... the public\nwelfare,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\nTroops were still crowding at the Ya\xc3\xbaza bridge. It was hot. Kut\xc3\xbazov,\ndejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his\nwhip in the sand when a cal\xc3\xa8che dashed up noisily. A man in a general\xe2\x80\x99s\nuniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kut\xc3\xbazov and said something\nin French. It was Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn. He told Kut\xc3\xbazov that he had come\nbecause Moscow, the capital, was no more and only the army remained.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told\nme that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle; all this\nwould not have happened,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov looked at Rostopch\xc3\xadn as if, not grasping what was said to him,\nhe was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the\nface of the man addressing him. Rostopch\xc3\xadn grew confused and became\nsilent. Kut\xc3\xbazov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating\ngaze from Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s face muttered softly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhether Kut\xc3\xbazov was thinking of something entirely different when\nhe spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be\nmeaningless, at any rate Rostopch\xc3\xadn made no reply and hastily left him.\nAnd strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn,\ntook up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts\nto drive on the carts that blocked the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nToward four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon Murat\xe2\x80\x99s troops were entering\nMoscow. In front rode a detachment of W\xc3\xbcrttemberg hussars and behind\nthem rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.\n\nAbout the middle of the Arb\xc3\xa1t Street, near the Church of the Miraculous\nIcon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the advanced\ndetachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel, le\nKremlin.\n\nAround Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow. They\nall stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired commander\ndressed up in feathers and gold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that their Tsar himself? He\xe2\x80\x99s not bad!\xe2\x80\x9d low voices could be heard\nsaying.\n\nAn interpreter rode up to the group.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake off your cap... your caps!\xe2\x80\x9d These words went from one to another\nin the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if\nit was far to the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin. The porter, listening in perplexity to the\nunfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was\nspeaking Russian, did not understand what was being said to him and\nslipped behind the others.\n\nMurat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian\narmy was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and several\nvoices at once began answering the interpreter. A French officer,\nreturning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat and reported\nthat the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was\nprobably an ambuscade there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite,\nordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.\n\nThe guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced\nup the Arb\xc3\xa1t. When they reached the end of the Vozdv\xc3\xadzhenka Street they\nhalted and drew in the Square. Several French officers superintended the\nplacing of the guns and looked at the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin through field glasses.\n\nThe bells in the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound\ntroubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few\ninfantrymen ran to the Kut\xc3\xa1fyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had been\nput there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as\nan officer and men began to run toward it. A general who was standing\nby the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and the latter\nran back again with his men.\n\nThe sound of three more shots came from the gate.\n\nOne shot struck a French soldier\xe2\x80\x99s foot, and from behind the screens\ncame the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a\nword of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of\nthe French general, officers, and men changed to one of determined\nconcentrated readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from\nthe marshal to the least soldier, that place was not the Vozdv\xc3\xadzhenka,\nMokhav\xc3\xa1ya, or Kut\xc3\xa1fyev Street, nor the Tr\xc3\xb3itsa Gate (places familiar in\nMoscow), but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary.\nAnd all made ready for that battle. The cries from the gates ceased. The\nguns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks,\nand an officer gave the word \xe2\x80\x9cFire!\xe2\x80\x9d This was followed by two whistling\nsounds of canister shot, one after another. The shot rattled against\nthe stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens, and two\nwavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square.\n\nA few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the\nstone-built Kr\xc3\xa9mlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above\ntheir head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the\nair, cawing and noisily flapping their wings. Together with that sound\ncame a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared\nthe figure of a bareheaded man in a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s coat. He grasped a musket\nand took aim at the French. \xe2\x80\x9cFire!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the officer once more,\nand the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard\nsimultaneously. The gate was again hidden by smoke.\n\nNothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers\nand officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and\nfour dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall,\ntoward the Zn\xc3\xa1menka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear that away!\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, pointing to the beams and the\ncorpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw\nthe corpses over the parapet.\n\nWho these men were nobody knew. \xe2\x80\x9cClear that away!\xe2\x80\x9d was all that was said\nof them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that\nthey might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to\ntheir memory: \xe2\x80\x9cThese wretches had occupied the sacred citadel, having\nsupplied themselves with guns from the arsenal, and fired\xe2\x80\x9d (the\nwretches) \xe2\x80\x9cat the French. Some of them were sabered and the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin was\npurged of their presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMurat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered\nthe gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of the\nwindows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square\nfor fuel and kindled fires there.\n\nOther detachments passed through the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin and encamped along\nthe Moros\xc3\xa9yka, the Luby\xc3\xa1nka, and Pokr\xc3\xb3vka Streets. Others quartered\nthemselves along the Vozdv\xc3\xadzhenka, the Nik\xc3\xb3lski, and the Tversk\xc3\xb3y\nStreets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French were\nnot billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as\nin a camp.\n\nThough tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their\noriginal number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order. It\nwas a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army. But\nit remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their\ndifferent lodgings. As soon as the men of the various regiments began\nto disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost\nforever and there came into being something nondescript, neither\ncitizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When five weeks\nlater these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed an army. They\nwere a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of articles which\nseemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man when he left\nMoscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but merely to keep\nwhat he had acquired. Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow\nneck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its\nfist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, the\nFrench when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they\ncarried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had stolen was as\nimpossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let\ngo of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow\ndistrict, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military uniforms\nand Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, laughing and\nwalking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms similar men were\nbusy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open\ncoach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading\nand baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening,\namusing, or caressing women and children. There were many such men both\nin the shops and houses\xe2\x80\x94but there was no army.\n\nOrder after order was issued by the French commanders that day\nforbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any\nviolence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call\nfor that very evening. But despite all these measures the men, who had\ntill then constituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted\ncity with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of\ncattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field, but gets out\nof hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich\npastures, so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city.\n\nNo residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers\xe2\x80\x94like water\npercolating through sand\xe2\x80\x94spread irresistibly through the city in all\ndirections from the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin into which they had first marched. The\ncavalry, on entering a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s house that had been abandoned and\nfinding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on,\nall the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of\nthem appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and\nquarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had\nhad time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to\nsee the city and, hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed\nto places where valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers\nfollowed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing\nthe same. In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops, and\ngenerals flocked there to select cal\xc3\xa8ches and coaches for themselves.\nThe few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to\ntheir houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered.\nThere were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around\nthe quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored\nand unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found.\nAnd Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is\nspilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and\nmud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the\nrich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction\nof both the army and the wealthy city.\n\n\nThe French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme f\xc3\xa9roce de\nRostopch\xc3\xadne, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality,\nhowever, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning\nof Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible\nfor it. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which\nany town built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it\nhad, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted\nMoscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on\nwhich sparks continually fall for several days. A town built of wood,\nwhere scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners\nare in residence and a police force is present, cannot help burning when\nits inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke\npipes, make campfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and\ncook themselves meals twice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to\nbillet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in\nthat district immediately increases. How much then must the probability\nof fire be increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops\nare quartered. \xe2\x80\x9cLe patriotisme f\xc3\xa9roce de Rostopch\xc3\xadne\xe2\x80\x9d and the barbarity\nof the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire by\nthe soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the carelessness of\nenemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even if there was any\narson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any reason to burn the\nhouses\xe2\x80\x94in any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do), arson\ncannot be regarded as the cause, for the same thing would have happened\nwithout any incendiarism.\n\n    * To Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s ferocious patriotism.\n\nHowever tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopch\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s\nferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later\non to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is\nimpossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the\nfire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house must\nburn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to\nlive and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, it\nis true, but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained\nin it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like\nBerlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its inhabitants\nabandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and salt, nor\nbring them the keys of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nThe absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise as it did,\nonly reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the evening of the\nsecond of September.\n\nAfter the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances,\nPierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely obsessed\nby one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had\ntaken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past,\nunderstood nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to\nhim like a dream.\n\nHe had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life\xe2\x80\x99s demands\nthat enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was unable\nto unravel. He had gone to Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich\xe2\x80\x99s house, on the plea of\nsorting the deceased\xe2\x80\x99s books and papers, only in search of rest from\nlife\xe2\x80\x99s turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich was\nconnected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm thoughts, quite\ncontrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being\ndrawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph Alex\xc3\xa9evich\xe2\x80\x99s study he\nreally found it. When he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table\nin the deathlike stillness of the study, calm and significant memories\nof the last few days rose one after another in his imagination,\nparticularly of the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 and of that vague sense of his\nown insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth, simplicity,\nand strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they. When\nGer\xc3\xa1sim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking\npart in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected. And\nwith that object he had asked Ger\xc3\xa1sim to get him a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s coat and\na pistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining in Joseph\nAlex\xc3\xa9evich\xe2\x80\x99s house and keeping his name secret. Then during the first\nday spent in inaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix his\nattention on the Masonic manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea\nthat had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of\nhis name in connection with Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s more than once vaguely presented\nitself. But the idea that he, L\xe2\x80\x99russe Besuhof, was destined to set a\nlimit to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that\noften passed through his mind and left no trace behind.\n\nWhen, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among\nthe people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the Rost\xc3\xb3vs and\nNat\xc3\xa1sha had said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing,\neven if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was\npredestined to do.\n\nNext day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in\nany way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he\nreturned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he\nsuddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility\nhad now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in\nMoscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and\neither perish or put an end to the misery of all Europe\xe2\x80\x94which it seemed\nto him was solely due to Napoleon.\n\nPierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s life in 1809\nby a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been shot.\nAnd the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his\ndesign excited him still more.\n\nTwo equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose.\nThe first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in\nview of the common calamity, the same feeling that had caused him to go\nto Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick\nof the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and, in\nplace of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed, to sleep\non a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as Ger\xc3\xa1sim.\nThe other was that vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for\neverything conventional, artificial, and human\xe2\x80\x94for everything the\nmajority of men regard as the greatest good in the world. Pierre had\nfirst experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the Slob\xc3\xb3da\nPalace, when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and life\xe2\x80\x94all that\nmen so painstakingly acquire and guard\xe2\x80\x94if it has any worth has so only\nby reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced.\n\nIt was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last\npenny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no\napparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he\npossesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from\nan ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it were, his personal\npower and strength, affirming the existence of a higher, nonhuman\ncriterion of life.\n\nFrom the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time\nat the Slob\xc3\xb3da Palace he had been continuously under its influence, but\nonly now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre\nwas supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he\nhad already done in that direction. If he were now to leave Moscow like\neveryone else, his flight from home, the peasant coat, the pistol, and\nhis announcement to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs that he would remain in Moscow would all\nbecome not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and to\nthis Pierre was very sensitive.\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded to his\nmental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he drank during\nthose days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty unchanged linen,\ntwo almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding\xe2\x80\x94all\nthis kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity.\n\nIt was two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon. The French had already entered\nMoscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about\nhis undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. In his\nfancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the\nblow or the death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and\nmelancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol or dagger?\nBut that is all the same! \xe2\x80\x98It is not I but the hand of Providence that\npunishes thee,\xe2\x80\x99 I shall say,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, imagining what he would say\nwhen killing Napoleon. \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, take me and execute me!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\nspeaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression.\n\nWhile Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself\nin this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared\nthe figure of Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich, always so timid before but now quite\ntransformed.\n\nHis dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He\nwas obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but\nnoticing embarrassment on Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s face immediately grew bold and,\nstaggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI say I\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it\nwith unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.\n\nGer\xc3\xa1sim and the porter, who had followed Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich, stopped him\nin the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre, coming\nout into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the half-crazy\nold man. Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich, frowning with exertion, held on to the pistol\nand screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic fancy in his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo arms! Board them! No, you shan\xe2\x80\x99t get it,\xe2\x80\x9d he yelled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness\xe2\x80\x94please, sir, to\nlet go! Please, sir...\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Ger\xc3\xa1sim, trying carefully to steer Mak\xc3\xa1r\nAlex\xc3\xa9evich by the elbows back to the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you? Bonaparte!...\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow me to\nhave the pistol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Mak\xc3\xa1r\nAlex\xc3\xa9evich, brandishing the pistol. \xe2\x80\x9cBoard them!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch hold!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Ger\xc3\xa1sim to the porter.\n\nThey seized Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich by the arms and dragged him to the door.\n\nThe vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of\na tipsy, hoarse voice.\n\nSuddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated from\nthe porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!\xe2\x80\x9d she\ncried.\n\nGer\xc3\xa1sim and the porter let Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich go, and in the now silent\ncorridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be\nheard.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nPierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he would\ndisclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood at the\nhalf-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as soon\nas the French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre did not\nretire\xe2\x80\x94an irresistible curiosity kept him there.\n\nThere were two of them. One was an officer\xe2\x80\x94a tall, soldierly, handsome\nman\xe2\x80\x94the other evidently a private or an orderly, sunburned, short, and\nthin, with sunken cheeks and a dull expression. The officer walked in\nfront, leaning on a stick and slightly limping. When he had advanced\na few steps he stopped, having apparently decided that these were good\nquarters, turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in\na loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses. Having done\nthat, the officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his\nmustache and lightly touched his hat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBonjour, la compagnie!\xe2\x80\x9d * said he gaily, smiling and looking about him.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cGood day, everybody!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nNo one gave any reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVous \xc3\xaates le bourgeois?\xe2\x80\x9d * the officer asked Ger\xc3\xa1sim.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cAre you the master here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nGer\xc3\xa1sim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuartier, quartier, logement!\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, looking down at the\nlittle man with a condescending and good-natured smile. \xe2\x80\x9cLes fran\xc3\xa7ais\nsont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous f\xc3\xa2chons pas, mon\nvieux!\xe2\x80\x9d * added he, clapping the scared and silent Ger\xc3\xa1sim on the\nshoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, does no one speak French in this establishment?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nasked again in French, looking around and meeting Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Pierre\nmoved away from the door.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cQuarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good\n     fellows. What the devil! There, don\xe2\x80\x99t let us be cross, old\n     fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAgain the officer turned to Ger\xc3\xa1sim and asked him to show him the rooms\nin the house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster, not here\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t understand... me, you...\xe2\x80\x9d said Ger\xc3\xa1sim, trying\nto render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.\n\nStill smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before Ger\xc3\xa1sim\xe2\x80\x99s\nnose, intimating that he did not understand him either, and moved,\nlimping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre wished to go\naway and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich\nappearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand. With\na madman\xe2\x80\x99s cunning, Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich eyed the Frenchman, raised his\npistol, and took aim.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoard them!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger. Hearing\nthe yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment Pierre threw\nhimself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the\npistol Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there\nwas a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The\nFrenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.\n\nForgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre,\nsnatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the officer\nand addressed him in French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have\nhad a lucky escape this time,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing to the damaged plaster\nof the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is that man?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking sternly at Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I am really in despair at what has occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre rapidly,\nquite forgetting the part he had intended to play. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is an unfortunate\nmadman who did not know what he was doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officer went up to Mak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich and took him by the collar.\n\nMak\xc3\xa1r Alex\xc3\xa9evich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about to\nfall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrigand! You shall pay for this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frenchman, letting go\nof him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon\ntraitors,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic\ngesture.\n\nPierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold that\ndrunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence with the\nsame gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with a smile. For\na few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome face assumed a\nmelodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have saved my life. You are French,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nFor a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman could\nperform a great deed, and to save his life\xe2\x80\x94the life of M. Ramballe,\ncaptain of the 13th Light Regiment\xe2\x80\x94was undoubtedly a very great deed.\n\nBut however indubitable that conclusion and the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conviction\nbased upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Russian,\xe2\x80\x9d he said quickly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, waving his\nfinger before his nose and smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall tell me all about that\npresently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what are we\nto do with this man?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a\nbrother.\n\nEven if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that loftiest\nof human appellations he could not renounce it, said the officer\xe2\x80\x99s look\nand tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again explained who Mak\xc3\xa1r\nAlex\xc3\xa9evich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile\nhad seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from\nhim, and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.\n\nThe Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his\narm.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant it\nyou. Lead that man away!\xe2\x80\x9d said he quickly and energetically, and taking\nthe arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his\nlife, he went with him into the room.\n\nThe soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage asking\nwhat had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits,\nbut the officer sternly checked them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be called in when you are wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile had time\nto visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I serve them up?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and some wine,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the captain.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nWhen the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again\nthought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to\ngo away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite,\namiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his\nlife that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in\nthe parlor\xe2\x80\x94the first room they entered. To Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that he\nwas not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone\ncould decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and\nsaid that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it\nbe so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude\nfor saving his life.\n\nHad this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the\nfeelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s feelings\nwere, the latter would probably have left him, but the man\xe2\x80\x99s animated\nobtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, looking\nat Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never\nforgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That\nis all I can say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the\nword) in the officer\xe2\x80\x99s voice, in the expression of his face and in\nhis gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the\nFrenchman\xe2\x80\x99s smile, pressed the hand held out to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion\nof Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,\xe2\x80\x9d he introduced\nhimself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under\nhis mustache. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have\nthe honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance\nwith that maniac\xe2\x80\x99s bullet in my body?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing,\nbegan to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for\nconcealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand your reasons. You are an officer...\na superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us. That\xe2\x80\x99s not\nmy business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am quite at\nyour service. You belong to the gentry?\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded with a shade of\ninquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. \xe2\x80\x9cYour baptismal name, if you\nplease. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... That\xe2\x80\x99s all I\nwant to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka\nbrought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian cellar\nand brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and\nhimself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man,\nmunching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking\nhis lips, and repeating\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent! Delicious!\xe2\x80\x9d His face grew red and\nwas covered with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner\nwith pleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan\nand placed a bottle of claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass,\ntaken from the kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known\nto the French and had been given a special name. They called it limonade\nde cochon (pig\xe2\x80\x99s lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de\ncochon he had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they\nhad taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and\napplied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up\nto its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for\nPierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain\nstill more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for\nsaving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my\nbody already. Here is one I got at Wagram\xe2\x80\x9d (he touched his side) \xe2\x80\x9cand a\nsecond at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he showed a scar on his cheek\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand this leg which as\nyou see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the great\nbattle of la Moskowa. Sacr\xc3\xa9 Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of fire\nwas worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word! You may\nbe proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught there, I\nshould be ready to begin again. I pity those who did not see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes. The\ngreat redoubt held out well, by my pipe!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Frenchman. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nyou made us pay dear for it. I was at it three times\xe2\x80\x94sure as I sit here.\nThree times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back\nlike cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your\ngrenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six\ntimes in succession and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of\nNaples, who knows what\xe2\x80\x99s what, cried \xe2\x80\x98Bravo!\xe2\x80\x99 Ha, ha! So you are one of\nus soldiers!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much\nthe better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle...\ngallant... with the fair\xe2\x80\x9d (he winked and smiled), \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what the\nFrench are, Monsieur Pierre, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe captain was so na\xc3\xafvely and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so\npleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily\nat him. Probably the word \xe2\x80\x9cgallant\xe2\x80\x9d turned the captain\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts to the\nstate of Moscow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cApropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left\nMoscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?\xe2\x80\x9d\nasked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting\nPierre on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a thing to say!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cParis?...\nBut Paris, Paris...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cParis\xe2\x80\x94the capital of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre finished his remark for him.\n\nThe captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in the\nmiddle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told me you were Russian, I should have wagered\nthat you were Parisian! You have that... I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what, that...\xe2\x80\x9d and\nhaving uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in Paris. I spent years there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know Paris\nis a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la\nDuch\xc3\xa9nois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,\xe2\x80\x9d and noticing that\nhis conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have\nremained Russian. Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t esteem you the less for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnder the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had\nspent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed\ntalking with this cheerful and good-natured man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo return to your ladies\xe2\x80\x94I hear they are lovely. What a wretched idea\nto go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is in\nMoscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants, now\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\nanother thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know us better\nthan that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s capitals.... We are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to\nknow. And then the Emperor...\xe2\x80\x9d he began, but Pierre interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and\nembarrassed, \xe2\x80\x9cis the Emperor...?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you\nI was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But\nthat man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist\nthe sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France.\nWhen I understood what he wanted\xe2\x80\x94when I saw that he was preparing a bed\nof laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98That is a monarch,\xe2\x80\x99 and\nI devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest\nman of the ages past or future.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in Moscow?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre stammered with a guilty look.\n\nThe Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he will make his entry tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and continued his\ntalk.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at\nthe gate and by Morel, who came to say that some W\xc3\xbcrttemberg hussars had\ncome and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\nhorses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did\nnot understand what was said to them in French.\n\nThe captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice\nasked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer,\nand by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already\noccupied. The German who knew little French, answered the two first\nquestions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding\nofficer, but in reply to the third question which he did not understand\nsaid, introducing broken French into his own German, that he was the\nquartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to\noccupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German,\ntranslated what the German said to the captain and gave the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\nreply to the W\xc3\xbcrttemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what\nwas said to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The\ncaptain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.\n\nWhen he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as\nbefore, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He\nreally was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and he\nwas left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the position\nhe was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy\nconquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him. Painful as\nthat was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the moment. He was\ntormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of\nwine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-natured man had\ndestroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last\nfew days and which was essential for the execution of his design. The\npistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the\ntown next day. Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and\nworthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he would not\ndo it. He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not\ncarry out his intention. He struggled against the confession of his\nweakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his\nformer gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and\nself-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first\nman he met.\n\nThe captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a tune.\n\nThe Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled\nhim. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with which\nhe twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go away\nimmediately. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say another word to him,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. He\nthought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of\nweakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but\ncould not do so.\n\nThe captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up and\ndown the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he\nwere smiling to himself at some amusing thought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe colonel of those W\xc3\xbcrttembergers is delightful,\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he\xe2\x80\x99s a German.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe sat down facing Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, you know German, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre looked at him in silence.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the German for \xe2\x80\x98shelter\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShelter?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cThe German for shelter is Unterkunft.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you say it?\xe2\x80\x9d the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnterkunft,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre repeated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnterkoff,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with\nlaughing eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cThese Germans are first-rate fools, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so,\nMonsieur Pierre?\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall we?\nMorel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out\ngaily.\n\nMorel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at Pierre\nby the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression\non his companion\xe2\x80\x99s face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in\nhis face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, we\xe2\x80\x99re sad,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, touching Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I\nupset you? No, really, have you anything against me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Pierre.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s the state of affairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\nwhose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for\nyou. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death.\nI say it with my hand on my heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, striking his chest.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\nThe captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that\n\xe2\x80\x9cshelter\xe2\x80\x9d was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly brightened.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in that case, I drink to our friendship!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried gaily, filling\ntwo glasses with wine.\n\nPierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied his too,\nagain pressed Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and leaned his elbows on the table in a\npensive attitude.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9csuch is fortune\xe2\x80\x99s caprice. Who would\nhave said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the\nservice of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow\nwith him. I must tell you, mon cher,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued in the sad and\nmeasured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, \xe2\x80\x9cthat our name\nis one of the most ancient in France.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd with a Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s easy and na\xc3\xafve frankness the captain told Pierre\nthe story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all\nabout his relations and his financial and family affairs, \xe2\x80\x9cma pauvre\nm\xc3\xa8re\xe2\x80\x9d playing of course an important part in the story.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all that is only life\xe2\x80\x99s setting, the real thing is love\xe2\x80\x94love! Am I\nnot right, Monsieur Pierre?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, growing animated. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother glass?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, women, women!\xe2\x80\x9d and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at\nPierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.\n\nThere were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking\nat the officer\xe2\x80\x99s handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager\nenthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe\xe2\x80\x99s love\nstories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special\ncharm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such sincere\nconviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love\nand he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him with\ncuriosity.\n\nIt was plain that l\xe2\x80\x99amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not\nthat low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor\nwas it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one\nhe considered the \xe2\x80\x9clove of clodhoppers\xe2\x80\x9d and the other the \xe2\x80\x9clove\nof simpletons.\xe2\x80\x9d) L\xe2\x80\x99amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted\nprincipally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a\ncombination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.\n\nThus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a\nfascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming,\ninnocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching marquise. The\nconflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, ending in\nthe mother\xe2\x80\x99s sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage\nto her lover, even now agitated the captain, though it was the memory of\na distant past. Then he recounted an episode in which the husband played\nthe part of the lover, and he\xe2\x80\x94the lover\xe2\x80\x94assumed the role of the husband,\nas well as several droll incidents from his recollections of Germany,\nwhere \xe2\x80\x9cshelter\xe2\x80\x9d is called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat\nsauerkraut and the young girls are \xe2\x80\x9ctoo blonde.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFinally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\nmemory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was\nof how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of\nlife continually occurred in the captain\xe2\x80\x99s stories) and the Pole had\nentrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de c\xc5\x93ur) while himself\nentering the French service. The captain was happy, the enchanting\nPolish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the\ncaptain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: \xe2\x80\x9cI have\nsaved your life, and I save your honor!\xe2\x80\x9d Having repeated these words the\ncaptain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the\nweakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.\n\nListening to the captain\xe2\x80\x99s tales, Pierre\xe2\x80\x94as often happens late in the\nevening and under the influence of wine\xe2\x80\x94followed all that was told him,\nunderstood it all, and at the same time followed a train of personal\nmemories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his mind. While\nlistening to these love stories his own love for Nat\xc3\xa1sha unexpectedly\nrose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that love in his\nimagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe\xe2\x80\x99s tales. Listening\nto the story of the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before\nhis eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of\nhis love at the S\xc3\xbakharev water tower. At the time of that meeting it had\nnot produced an effect upon him\xe2\x80\x94he had not even once recalled it. But\nnow it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very\nimportant and poetic.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Kir\xc3\xadlovich, come here! We have recognized you,\xe2\x80\x9d he now seemed\nto hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her\nsmile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and there\nseemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.\n\nHaving finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain\nasked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice\nhimself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.\n\nChallenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to\nexpress the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he\nunderstood love for a woman somewhat differently. He said that in all\nhis life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could\nnever be his.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTiens!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain.\n\nPierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest\nyears, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too\nyoung, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name.\nAfterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of\nher because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in\nthe world, and especially therefore above himself.\n\nWhen he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he\nunderstood that.\n\nThe captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand\nit he begged Pierre to continue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlat\xc3\xb3nic love, clouds...\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered.\n\nWhether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the\nthought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who\nplayed a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together,\nsomething loosened Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s tongue. Speaking thickly and with a faraway\nlook in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his\nmarriage, Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and\nall his own simple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe\xe2\x80\x99s questions\nhe also told what he had at first concealed\xe2\x80\x94his own position and even\nhis name.\n\nMore than anything else in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s story the captain was impressed by\nthe fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that\nhe had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there\nconcealing his name and station.\n\nWhen it was late at night they went out together into the street. The\nnight was warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokr\xc3\xb3vka a\nfire glowed\xe2\x80\x94the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To the\nright and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and\nopposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nheart with his love. At the gate stood Ger\xc3\xa1sim, the cook, and two\nFrenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in\ntwo languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow seen in the\ntown.\n\nThere was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense\ncity.\n\nGazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the\nglow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cThere now,\nhow good it is, what more does one need?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. And suddenly\nremembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned\nagainst the fence to save himself from falling.\n\nWithout taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with\nunsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and\nimmediately fell asleep.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nThe glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was\nwatched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the\nretreating troops, with many different feelings.\n\nThe Rost\xc3\xb3v party spent the night at Myt\xc3\xadshchi, fourteen miles from\nMoscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road\nhad been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been\nforgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided to\nspend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next morning\nthey woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far\nas Great Myt\xc3\xadshchi. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening the Rost\xc3\xb3v family and\nthe wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and\nhuts of that large village. The Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 servants and coachmen and the\norderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to their masters, had\nsupper, fed the horses, and came out into the porches.\n\nIn a neighboring hut lay Ra\xc3\xa9vski\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant with a fractured wrist. The\nawful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his\nmoaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night. He had\nspent the first night in the same yard as the Rost\xc3\xb3vs. The countess said\nshe had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at\nMyt\xc3\xadshchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the\nwounded man.\n\nIn the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high\nbody of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another\nfire. One glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was\nLittle Myt\xc3\xadshchi burning\xe2\x80\x94set on fire by Mam\xc3\xb3nov\xe2\x80\x99s Cossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut look here, brothers, there\xe2\x80\x99s another fire!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked an orderly.\n\nAll turned their attention to the glow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they told us Little Myt\xc3\xadshchi had been set on fire by Mam\xc3\xb3nov\xe2\x80\x99s\nCossacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not Myt\xc3\xadshchi, it\xe2\x80\x99s farther away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, it must be in Moscow!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTwo of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down\non its steps.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more to the left, why, Little Myt\xc3\xadshchi is over there, and this is\nright on the other side.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSeveral men joined the first two.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how it\xe2\x80\x99s flaring,\xe2\x80\x9d said one. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fire in Moscow: either in\nthe Sushch\xc3\xa9vski or the Rog\xc3\xb3zhski quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNo one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently\nat the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.\n\nOld Daniel Ter\xc3\xa9ntich, the count\xe2\x80\x99s valet (as he was called), came up to\nthe group and shouted at M\xc3\xadshka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be\ncalling and there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody there; go and gather the clothes together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only ran out to get some water,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xadshka.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you think, Daniel Ter\xc3\xa9ntich? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it look as if that\nglow were in Moscow?\xe2\x80\x9d remarked one of the footmen.\n\nDaniel Ter\xc3\xa9ntich made no reply, and again for a long time they were all\nsilent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod have mercy.... It\xe2\x80\x99s windy and dry...\xe2\x80\x9d said another voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look! See what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing now. O Lord! You can even see the crows\nflying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll put it out, no fear!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s to put it out?\xe2\x80\x9d Daniel Ter\xc3\xa9ntich, who had hitherto been silent,\nwas heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. \xe2\x80\x9cMoscow it is,\nbrothers,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cMother Moscow, the white...\xe2\x80\x9d his voice faltered,\nand he gave way to an old man\xe2\x80\x99s sob.\n\nAnd it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the\nsignificance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were heard,\nwords of prayer, and the sobbing of the count\xe2\x80\x99s old valet.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nThe valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that Moscow was\nburning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to look. S\xc3\xb3nya\nand Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out with him. Only\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and the countess remained in the room. P\xc3\xa9tya was no longer\nwith the family, he had gone on with his regiment which was making for\nTr\xc3\xb3itsa.\n\nThe countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry. Nat\xc3\xa1sha,\npale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the icons just\nwhere she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father\xe2\x80\x99s\nwords. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant, three\nhouses off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya returning from the yard chilled and\nfrightened. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the whole of Moscow will burn, there\xe2\x80\x99s an awful\nglow! Nat\xc3\xa1sha, do look! You can see it from the window,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her\ncousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.\n\nBut Nat\xc3\xa1sha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her\nand again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in\nthis condition of stupor since the morning, when S\xc3\xb3nya, to the surprise\nand annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found\nit necessary to tell Nat\xc3\xa1sha of Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s wound and of his being\nwith their party. The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as\nshe was with S\xc3\xb3nya. S\xc3\xb3nya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now,\nas if trying to atone for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her\ncousin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, how dreadfully it is burning!\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s burning?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, Moscow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd as if in order not to offend S\xc3\xb3nya and to get rid of her, she turned\nher face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident\nthat she could not see anything, and again settled down in her former\nattitude.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, really I did,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left\nin peace.\n\nBoth the countess and S\xc3\xb3nya understood that, naturally, neither Moscow\nnor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to\nNat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nThe count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess went\nup to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she\nwas wont to do when Nat\xc3\xa1sha was ill, then touched her forehead with her\nlips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are cold. You are trembling all over. You\xe2\x80\x99d better lie down,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe countess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie down? All right, I will. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lie down at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nWhen Nat\xc3\xa1sha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously\nwounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many\nquestions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And\ncould she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see\nhim, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger,\nshe ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving\nwhat they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would\nstill be told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner\nof the coach with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the\ncountess knew so well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same\nway on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving. She was\nplanning something and either deciding or had already decided something\nin her mind. The countess knew this, but what it might be she did not\nknow, and this alarmed and tormented her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame Schoss\nand the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha replied\nirritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open\nwindow the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put\nher head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck\nshaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame. Nat\xc3\xa1sha knew\nit was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in\nthe same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage;\nbut this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged\na look with S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie down, darling; lie down, my pet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, softly\ntouching Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, lie down.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes... I\xe2\x80\x99ll lie down at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and began hurriedly\nundressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.\n\nWhen she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat\ndown with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the\nfloor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front,\nand began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers rapidly\nunplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved from side\nto side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before\nher. When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the\nsheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, you\xe2\x80\x99d better lie in the middle,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cDo lie down,\xe2\x80\x9d she added crossly,\nand buried her face in the pillow.\n\nThe countess, Madame Schoss, and S\xc3\xb3nya undressed hastily and lay down.\nThe small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in\nthe room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little\nMyt\xc3\xadshchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise\nof people shouting at a tavern Mam\xc3\xb3nov\xe2\x80\x99s Cossacks had set up across the\nstreet, and the adjutant\xe2\x80\x99s unceasing moans could still be heard.\n\nFor a long time Nat\xc3\xa1sha listened attentively to the sounds that reached\nher from inside and outside the room and did not move. First she heard\nher mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under\nher, then Madame Schoss\xe2\x80\x99 familiar whistling snore and S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s gentle\nbreathing. Then the countess called to Nat\xc3\xa1sha. Nat\xc3\xa1sha did not answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s asleep, Mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya softly.\n\nAfter a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one\nreplied.\n\nSoon after that Nat\xc3\xa1sha heard her mother\xe2\x80\x99s even breathing. Nat\xc3\xa1sha did\nnot move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt,\nwas growing cold on the bare floor.\n\nAs if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a\ncrack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near\nby. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the\nadjutant was heard. Nat\xc3\xa1sha sat up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, are you asleep? Mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\n\nNo one replied. Nat\xc3\xa1sha rose slowly and carefully, crossed herself, and\nstepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim, supple,\nbare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping cautiously from one\nfoot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and\ngrasped the cold door handle.\n\nIt seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against\nall the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and\nterror and overflowing with love.\n\nShe opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold,\ndamp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed her. With\nher bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened\nthe door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark\nin there. In the farthest corner, on a bench beside a bed on which\nsomething was lying, stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and\nsmoldering wick.\n\nFrom the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s wound\nand his presence there, Nat\xc3\xa1sha had resolved to see him. She did not\nknow why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the\nmore convinced that it was necessary.\n\nAll day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now\nthat the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might\nsee. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that incessant\nmoaning of the adjutant\xe2\x80\x99s? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her\nimagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she saw an\nindistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised under the\nquilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there, and stood\nstill in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She\ncautiously took one step and then another, and found herself in the\nmiddle of a small room containing baggage. Another man\xe2\x80\x94Tim\xc3\xb3khin\xe2\x80\x94was\nlying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons, and two others\xe2\x80\x94the\ndoctor and a valet\xe2\x80\x94lay on the floor.\n\nThe valet sat up and whispered something. Tim\xc3\xb3khin, kept awake by the\npain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange\napparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap.\nThe valet\xe2\x80\x99s sleepy, frightened exclamation, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want? What\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe matter?\xe2\x80\x9d made Nat\xc3\xa1sha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the\ncorner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him.\nShe passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw\nPrince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she\nhad always seen him.\n\nHe was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his\nglittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his neck,\ndelicate as a child\xe2\x80\x99s, revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt,\ngave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had never\nseen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift, flexible,\nyouthful movement dropped on her knees.\n\nHe smiled and held out his hand to her.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nSeven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the\nambulance station on the field of Borodin\xc3\xb3. His feverish state and the\ninflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\nopinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with\npleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that his\ntemperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning.\nThe first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had\nremained in the cal\xc3\xa8che, but at Myt\xc3\xadshchi the wounded man himself asked\nto be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his removal into\nthe hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he\nhad been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with\nclosed eyes. Then he opened them and whispered softly: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\nHis remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished\nthe doctor. He felt Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s pulse, and to his surprise and\ndissatisfaction found it had improved. He was dissatisfied because he\nknew by experience that if his patient did not die now, he would do so\na little later with greater suffering. Tim\xc3\xb3khin, the red-nosed major of\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s regiment, had joined him in Moscow and was being\ntaken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of\nBorodin\xc3\xb3. They were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s valet, his\ncoachman, and two orderlies.\n\nThey gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking with\nfeverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and\nremember something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any more. Is Tim\xc3\xb3khin here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nTim\xc3\xb3khin crept along the bench to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here, your excellency.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s your wound?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine, sir? All right. But how about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t one get a book?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat book?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Gospels. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he\nwas feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but\nreasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was\nuncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted the cloak\nwith which he was covered and, making wry faces at the noisome smell of\nmortifying flesh that came from the wound, began examining that dreadful\nplace. The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a\nchange in the dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned\nagain and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking\nthem to get him the book and put it under him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat trouble would it be to you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not got one. Please\nget it for me and put it under for a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded in a piteous\nvoice.\n\nThe doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fellows have no conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the valet who was pouring\nwater over his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cFor just one moment I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look after you...\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under him!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the valet.\n\nThe first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the\nmatter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked\nto be carried into the hut after his cal\xc3\xa8che had stopped at Myt\xc3\xadshchi.\nAfter growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he\nagain regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once more recalled\nall that had happened to him, and above all vividly remembered the\nmoment at the ambulance station when, at the sight of the sufferings of\na man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to him which promised him\nhappiness. And those thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again\npossessed his soul. He remembered that he had now a new source of\nhappiness and that this happiness had something to do with the Gospels.\nThat was why he asked for a copy of them. The uncomfortable position in\nwhich they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts,\nand when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete\nstillness of the night. Everybody near him was sleeping. A cricket\nchirped from across the passage; someone was shouting and singing in\nthe street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, and on\nthe walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the\ncandle beside him, the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself\nlike a mushroom.\n\nHis mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of,\nfeels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the\npower and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to\nfix his whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from the\ndeepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can\nthen return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s mind was not\nin a normal state in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more\nactive and clearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will. Most\ndiverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously. At times his\nbrain suddenly began to work with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had\nnever reached when he was in health, but suddenly in the midst of its\nwork it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength\nto turn it back again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be\ndeprived,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut,\ngazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cA happiness\nlying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act\non man\xe2\x80\x94a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving. Every man\ncan understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only\nfor God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrew\nheard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a\nsoft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating\n\xe2\x80\x9cpiti-piti-piti,\xe2\x80\x9d and then \xe2\x80\x9ctiti,\xe2\x80\x9d and then again \xe2\x80\x9cpiti-piti-piti,\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9cti-ti\xe2\x80\x9d once more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above\nthe very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected out\nof slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispered music.\nHe felt that he had to balance carefully (though it was difficult) so\nthat this airy structure should not collapse; but nevertheless it kept\ncollapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic\nmusic\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cit stretches, stretches, spreading out and stretching,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPrince Andrew to himself. While listening to this whispering and feeling\nthe sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice\nof needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and\nheard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that\nflopped against his pillow and his face. Each time the fly touched his\nface it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not\ndestroy the structure, though it knocked against the very region of his\nface where it was rising. But besides this there was something else of\nimportance. It was something white by the door\xe2\x80\x94the statue of a sphinx,\nwhich also oppressed him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s my shirt on the table,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand that\xe2\x80\x99s my\nlegs, and that is the door, but why is it always stretching and drawing\nitself out, and \xe2\x80\x98piti-piti-piti\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98ti-ti\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98piti-piti-piti\xe2\x80\x99...?\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough, please leave off!\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew painfully entreated\nsomeone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of\nhis mind with peculiar clearness and force.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94love,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought again quite clearly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut not love which loves\nfor something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some reason,\nbut the love which I\xe2\x80\x94while dying\xe2\x80\x94first experienced when I saw my enemy\nand yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is the very\nessence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel\nthat bliss. To love one\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors, to love one\xe2\x80\x99s enemies, to love\neverything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to\nlove someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved\nby divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I\nloved that man. What has become of him? Is he alive?...\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but\ndivine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can\ndestroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people have\nI hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d And he vividly pictured to himself Nat\xc3\xa1sha, not as he had done in\nthe past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for\nthe first time picturing to himself her soul. And he understood her\nfeelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now understood for the\nfirst time all the cruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his\nrupture with her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only it were possible for me to see her once more!\nJust once, looking into those eyes to say...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPiti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!\xe2\x80\x9d flopped the fly....\nAnd his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a world of\nreality and delirium in which something particular was happening. In\nthat world some structure was still being erected and did not fall,\nsomething was still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo\nwas still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but\nbesides all this something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and\na new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door. And that sphinx had\nthe pale face and shining eyes of the very Nat\xc3\xa1sha of whom he had just\nbeen thinking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Prince Andrew,\ntrying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face remained\nbefore him with the force of reality and drew nearer. Prince Andrew\nwished to return to that former world of pure thought, but he could not,\nand delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft whispering voice\ncontinued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed him and stretched\nout, and the strange face was before him. Prince Andrew collected all\nhis strength in an effort to recover his senses, he moved a little, and\nsuddenly there was a ringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and\nlike a man plunged into water he lost consciousness. When he came to\nhimself, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, that same living Nat\xc3\xa1sha whom of all people he most\nlonged to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to\nhim, was kneeling before him. He realized that it was the real living\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, and he was not surprised but quietly happy. Nat\xc3\xa1sha, motionless\non her knees (she was unable to stir), with frightened eyes riveted on\nhim, was restraining her sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the\nlower part of it something quivered.\n\nPrince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow fortunate!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith a rapid but careful movement Nat\xc3\xa1sha drew nearer to him on her\nknees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and began\nkissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive...!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive what?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Nat\xc3\xa1sha in a scarcely\naudible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just\ntouching it with her lips.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you more, better than before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prince Andrew, lifting her\nface with his hand so as to look into her eyes.\n\nThose eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,\ncompassionately, and with joyous love. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s thin pale face, with\nits swollen lips, was more than plain\xe2\x80\x94it was dreadful. But Prince Andrew\ndid not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful. They\nheard the sound of voices behind them.\n\nPeter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor.\nTim\xc3\xb3khin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had\nlong been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his bare\nbody with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, rising from his bed. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease go away,\nmadam!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s absence, knocked at the door.\n\nLike a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Nat\xc3\xa1sha went out of the room\nand, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.\n\nFrom that time, during all the rest of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 journey, at every\nhalting place and wherever they spent a night, Nat\xc3\xa1sha never left the\nwounded Bolk\xc3\xb3nski, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected\nfrom a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a\nwounded man.\n\nDreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew die\nin her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s arms during the journey\xe2\x80\x94as, judging by what the doctor\nsaid, it seemed might easily happen\xe2\x80\x94she could not oppose Nat\xc3\xa1sha. Though\nwith the intimacy now established between the wounded man and Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nthe thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement\nwould be renewed, no one\xe2\x80\x94least of all Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x94spoke of\nthis: the unsettled question of life and death, which hung not only over\nBolk\xc3\xb3nski but over all Russia, shut out all other considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nOn the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching, the\nclothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on\nhis body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful\nhe had done the day before. That something shameful was his yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\nconversation with Captain Ramballe.\n\nIt was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors.\nPierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved\nstock which Ger\xc3\xa1sim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered\nwhere he was and what lay before him that very day.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I not too late?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, probably he won\xe2\x80\x99t make his entry\ninto Moscow before noon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him, but\nhastened to act.\n\nAfter arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to go out.\nBut it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could\nnot carry the weapon in his hand through the streets. It was difficult\nto hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat. He could not\ncarry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm. Besides, it had been\ndischarged, and he had not had time to reload it. \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter, the dagger\nwill do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, though when planning his design he had\nmore than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the\nstudent in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as\nhis chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving\nto himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he\ncould to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a\ngreen sheath which he had bought at the S\xc3\xbakharev market with the pistol,\nand hid it under his waistcoat.\n\nHaving tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head,\nPierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting\nthe captain, and passed out into the street.\n\nThe conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference the\nevening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow was on\nfire in several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river,\nin the Bazaar and the Povarsk\xc3\xb3y, as well as the barges on the Moskv\xc3\xa1\nRiver and the timber yards by the Dorogom\xc3\xadlov Bridge, were all ablaze.\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s way led through side streets to the Povarsk\xc3\xb3y and from there\nto the church of St. Nicholas on the Arb\xc3\xa1t, where he had long before\ndecided that the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses\nwere locked and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted.\nThe air was full of smoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he met\nRussians with anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of\nthe city but of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both\nthe Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his\nheight and stoutness, and the strange morose look of suffering in his\nface and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre because they could\nnot make out to what class he could belong. The French followed him with\nastonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the\nother Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, paid no\nattention to them. At the gate of one house three Frenchmen, who were\nexplaining something to some Russians who did not understand them,\nstopped Pierre asking if he did not know French.\n\nPierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel\nstanding beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout\nwas threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man\xe2\x80\x99s musket as\nhe raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side\nof the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around\nhim. He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like\nsomething dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night\xe2\x80\x99s\nexperience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring\nhis mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by\nanything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out,\nfor Napoleon had passed the Arb\xc3\xa1t more than four hours previously on his\nway from the Dorogom\xc3\xadlov suburb to the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin, and was now sitting in\na very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin, giving\ndetailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately\nto extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the\ninhabitants. But Pierre did not know this; he was entirely absorbed\nin what lay before him, and was tortured\xe2\x80\x94as those are who obstinately\nundertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its\ndifficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures\xe2\x80\x94by the\nfear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.\n\nThough he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct\nand did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarsk\xc3\xb3y.\n\nAs Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser\xe2\x80\x94he\neven felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose\nfrom under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets\nand they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt that something\nunusual was happening around him, did not realize that he was\napproaching the fire. As he was going along a footpath across a\nwide-open space adjoining the Povarsk\xc3\xb3y on one side and the gardens\nof Prince Gruz\xc3\xadnski\xe2\x80\x99s house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the\ndesperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if awakening\nfrom a dream and lifted his head.\n\nBy the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household\ngoods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On the\nground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long,\nprominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman,\nswaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking with sobs. Two\ngirls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks,\nwere staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale\nfrightened faces. The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an\novercoat and an immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his\nold nurse\xe2\x80\x99s arms. A dirty, barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk,\nand, having undone her pale-colored plait, was pulling it straight\nand sniffing at her singed hair. The woman\xe2\x80\x99s husband, a short,\nround-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official, with\nsausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set cap the hair\nsmoothly brushed forward over his temples, with expressionless face was\nmoving the trunks, which were placed one on another, and was dragging\nsome garments from under them.\n\nAs soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his feet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends... help\nus, somebody,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered between her sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cMy girl... My daughter!\nMy youngest daughter is left behind. She\xe2\x80\x99s burned! Ooh! Was it for this\nI nursed you.... Ooh!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, Mary Nikol\xc3\xa1evna!\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband to her in a low voice,\nevidently only to justify himself before the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cSister must have\ntaken her, or else where can she be?\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonster! Villain!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to weep.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no heart, you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel for your own child! Another man would\nhave rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a\nman nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on,\naddressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fire broke out\nalongside, and blew our way, the maid called out \xe2\x80\x98Fire!\xe2\x80\x99 and we rushed\nto collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we\nhave brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost.\nWe seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...\xe2\x80\x9d and again she\nbegan to sob. \xe2\x80\x9cMy child, my dear one! Burned, burned!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where was she left?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\nFrom the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man\nmight help her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear sir!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, seizing him by the legs. \xe2\x80\x9cMy benefactor, set\nmy heart at ease.... An\xc3\xadska, go, you horrid girl, show him the way!\xe2\x80\x9d she\ncried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing\nher long teeth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me the way, show me, I... I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Pierre rapidly.\n\nThe dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her plait,\nsighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre felt\nas if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his head\nhigher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift steps\nhe followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the Povarsk\xc3\xb3y. The\nwhole street was full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues of flame here\nand there broke through that cloud. A great number of people crowded in\nfront of the conflagration. In the middle of the street stood a French\ngeneral saying something to those around him. Pierre, accompanied by the\nmaid, was advancing to the spot where the general stood, but the French\nsoldiers stopped him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn ne passe pas!\xe2\x80\x9d * cried a voice.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t pass!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll pass through the side street,\nby the Nik\xc3\xbalins\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her.\nShe ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left, and,\npassing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s here, close by,\xe2\x80\x9d said she and, running across the yard, opened a\ngate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden\nwing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One of its\nsides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames issued from\nthe openings of the windows and from under the roof.\n\nAs Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air and\ninvoluntarily stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is it? Which is your house?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOoh!\xe2\x80\x9d wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, that was our\nlodging. You\xe2\x80\x99ve burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my precious little\nmissy! Ooh!\xe2\x80\x9d lamented An\xc3\xadska, who at the sight of the fire felt that she\ntoo must give expression to her feelings.\n\nPierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he\ninvoluntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house\nthat was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and around\nwhich swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not realize\nwhat these men, who were dragging something out, were about; but seeing\nbefore him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying\nto take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that looting was\ngoing on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.\n\nThe sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the\nwhistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and\nthe sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds\nand now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense\nsheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along\nthe walls), and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced\non Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration. It had a\npeculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt\nhimself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down. He felt\nyoung, bright, adroit, and resolute. He ran round to the other side of\nthe lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still\nstanding, when just above his head he heard several voices shouting\nand then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close\nbeside him.\n\nPierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen\nwho had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with metal\narticles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this fellow want?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted one of them referring to Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a child in that house. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you seen a child?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he talking about? Get along!\xe2\x80\x9d said several voices, and one of\nthe soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from\nthem some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved\nthreateningly toward him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA child?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a Frenchman from above. \xe2\x80\x9cI did hear something\nsquealing in the garden. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s his brat that the fellow is\nlooking for. After all, one must be human, you know....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it? Where?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! There!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the\ngarden at the back of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m coming down.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a spot\non his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the\nground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the\ngarden.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry up, you others!\xe2\x80\x9d he called out to his comrades. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s getting\nhot.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled\nPierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a\nthree-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nFrenchman. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9d and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his\ncomrades.\n\nBreathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take\nher in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly, scrofulous-looking\nchild, unattractively like her mother, began to yell and run away.\nPierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his arms. She screamed\ndesperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nhands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was seized\nby a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when\ntouching some nasty little animal. But he made an effort not to throw\nthe child down and ran with her to the large house. It was now, however,\nimpossible to get back the way he had come; the maid, An\xc3\xadska, was no\nlonger there, and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the\nwet, painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran\nwith her through the garden seeking another way out.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nHaving run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back\nwith his little burden to the Gruz\xc3\xadnski garden at the corner of the\nPovarsk\xc3\xb3y. He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set\nout to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and goods\nthat had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian families who\nhad taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings, there were\nseveral French soldiers in a variety of clothing. Pierre took no notice\nof them. He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to\nrestore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre\nfelt that he had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the\nheat and from running, he felt at that moment more strongly than ever\nthe sense of youth, animation, and determination that had come on him\nwhen he ran to save the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging\nwith her little hands to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s coat, sat on his arm gazing about\nher like some little wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a\nslight smile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that\nfrightened, sickly little face.\n\nHe did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them. He\nwalked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various faces he\nmet. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family\nconsisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new,\ncloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar\ntype, and a young woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the\nperfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched,\nblack eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long,\nbeautiful, expressionless face. Amid the scattered property and the\ncrowd on the open space, she, in her rich satin cloak with a bright\nlilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out\nonto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old\nwoman, and looked from under her long lashes with motionless, large,\nalmond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she was aware\nof her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck Pierre and,\nhurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to look at her.\nWhen he had reached the fence, still without finding those he sought, he\nstopped and looked about him.\n\nWith the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than\nbefore, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered about him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You\xe2\x80\x99re of the gentry yourself,\naren\xe2\x80\x99t you? Whose child is it?\xe2\x80\x9d they asked him.\n\nPierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who\nhad been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether\nanyone knew where she had gone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that must be the Anf\xc3\xa9rovs,\xe2\x80\x9d said an old deacon, addressing a\npockmarked peasant woman. \xe2\x80\x9cLord have mercy, Lord have mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d he added\nin his customary bass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Anf\xc3\xa9rovs? No,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cThey left in the morning. That must\nbe either Mary Nikol\xc3\xa1evna\xe2\x80\x99s or the Iv\xc3\xa1novs\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says \xe2\x80\x98a woman,\xe2\x80\x99 and Mary Nikol\xc3\xa1evna is a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked a house\nserf.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know her? She\xe2\x80\x99s thin, with long teeth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Mary Nikol\xc3\xa1evna! They went inside the garden when these wolves\nswooped down,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, have mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d added the deacon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo over that way, they\xe2\x80\x99re there. It\xe2\x80\x99s she! She kept on lamenting and\ncrying,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s she. Here, this way!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds been\nintently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was looking at\nthe Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them.\nOne of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round\nthe waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were\nbare. The other, whose appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a\nlong, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements\nand with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a woman\xe2\x80\x99s loose gown\nof frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian boots. The little\nbarefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and,\nsaying something, immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old\nman at once began pulling off his boots. The other in the frieze gown\nstopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in\nhis pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, take the child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the\nwoman, handing the little girl to her. \xe2\x80\x9cGive her back to them, give her\nback!\xe2\x80\x9d he almost shouted, putting the child, who began screaming, on the\nground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family.\n\nThe old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had\nsecured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other.\nThe old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre\ncaught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to the\nFrenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to\nside, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his\npockets had seized her by the neck.\n\nThe beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude,\nwith her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the\nsoldier was doing to her.\n\nWhile Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the\nFrenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing\nfrom her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the young\nwoman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet that woman alone!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice,\nseizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside.\n\nThe soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing down\nthe boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoyons, pas de b\xc3\xaatises!\xe2\x80\x9d * he cried.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, no nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nPierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and\nhis strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman\nand, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his\nfeet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval were heard\nfrom the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French\nUhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to\nPierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing\nof what happened after that. He only remembered beating someone and\nbeing beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a\ncrowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant, he has a dagger,\xe2\x80\x9d were the first words Pierre understood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, a weapon?\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier\nwho had been arrested with Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, you can tell all about it\nat the court-martial.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he turned to Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you speak French?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His\nface probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in\na whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on\nboth sides of Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you speak French?\xe2\x80\x9d the officer asked again, keeping at a distance\nfrom Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cCall the interpreter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and\nby his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a\nFrench salesman from one of the Moscow shops.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does not look like a common man,\xe2\x80\x9d said the interpreter, after a\nsearching look at Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he looks very much like an incendiary,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the officer. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nask him who he is,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the interpreter in poor Russian. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must answer\nthe chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner\xe2\x80\x94take me!\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre\nsuddenly replied in French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, ah!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the officer with a frown. \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, march!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood the\npockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol\nstarted she moved forward.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they taking you to, you poor dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the little\ngirl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if she\xe2\x80\x99s not theirs?\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the woman.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that woman want?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the officer.\n\nPierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight of the\nlittle girl he had saved.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she want?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is bringing me my daughter whom\nI have just saved from the flames,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-by!\xe2\x80\x9d And without\nknowing how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along with\nresolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers.\n\nThe French patrol was one of those sent out through the various\nstreets of Moscow by Durosnel\xe2\x80\x99s order to put a stop to the pillage,\nand especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general\nopinion which had that day originated among the higher French officers,\nwere the cause of the conflagrations. After marching through a number\nof streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects: a small\nshopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, and a house serf, besides\nseveral looters. But of all these various suspected characters, Pierre\nwas considered to be the most suspicious of all. When they had all been\nbrought for the night to a large house on the Z\xc3\xbabov Rampart that was\nbeing used as a guardhouse, Pierre was placed apart under strict guard.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE: 1812\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIn Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on\nwith greater heat than ever in the highest circles, between the parties\nof Rumy\xc3\xa1ntsev, the French, M\xc3\xa1rya F\xc3\xabdorovna, the Tsar\xc3\xa9vich, and others,\ndrowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But the calm,\nluxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about phantoms and\nreflections of real life, went on in its old way and made it hard,\nexcept by a great effort, to realize the danger and the difficult\nposition of the Russian people. There were the same receptions and\nballs, the same French theater, the same court interests and service\ninterests and intrigues as usual. Only in the very highest circles were\nattempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position.\nStories were whispered of how differently the two Empresses behaved\nin these difficult circumstances. The Empress M\xc3\xa1rya, concerned for\nthe welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her\npatronage, had given directions that they should all be removed to\nKaz\xc3\xa1n, and the things belonging to these institutions had already been\npacked up. The Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions\nshe would be pleased to give\xe2\x80\x94with her characteristic Russian patriotism\nhad replied that she could give no directions about state institutions\nfor that was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally\nwas concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg.\n\nAt Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of the\nbattle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which was\nto be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending\nthe Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was regarded as a model\nof ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli himself, famed for\nhis elocution, was to read it. (He used to read at the Empress\xe2\x80\x99.) The\nart of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite\nindependently of their meaning, in a loud and singsong voice alternating\nbetween a despairing wail and a tender murmur, so that the wail fell\nquite at random on one word and the murmur on another. This reading,\nas was always the case at Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s soirees, had a political\nsignificance. That evening she expected several important personages who\nhad to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused\nto a patriotic temper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna, not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room,\ndid not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general\nconversation.\n\nThe news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova.\nShe had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had missed\nseveral gatherings of which she was usually the ornament, and was said\nto be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors\nwho usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor\nwho was treating her in some new and unusual way.\n\nThey all knew very well that the enchanting countess\xe2\x80\x99 illness arose from\nan inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time,\nand that the Italian\xe2\x80\x99s cure consisted in removing such inconvenience;\nbut in Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s presence no one dared to think of this or even\nappear to know it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is angina\npectoris.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngina? Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible illness!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...\xe2\x80\x9d and\nthe word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the doctor\ntold him the case was dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are speaking of the poor countess?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, coming\nup just then. \xe2\x80\x9cI sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little\nbetter. Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nwent on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. \xe2\x80\x9cWe belong to different\ncamps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves. She\nis very unfortunate!\xe2\x80\x9d added Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nSupposing that by these words Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna was somewhat lifting the\nveil from the secret of the countess\xe2\x80\x99 malady, an unwary young man\nventured to express surprise that well-known doctors had not been called\nin and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might\nemploy dangerous remedies.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour information may be better than mine,\xe2\x80\x9d Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna suddenly and\nvenomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I know on good\nauthority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He is private\nphysician to the Queen of Spain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd having thus demolished the young man, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna turned to\nanother group where Bil\xc3\xadbin was talking about the Austrians: having\nwrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again\nand utter one of his mots.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is delightful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to a diplomatic note that\nhad been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the\nFrench by Wittgenstein, \xe2\x80\x9cthe hero of Petropol\xe2\x80\x9d as he was then called in\nPetersburg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, securing silence for the mot,\nwhich she had heard before.\n\nAnd Bil\xc3\xadbin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch, which\nhe had himself composed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor returns these Austrian banners,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bil\xc3\xadbin, \xe2\x80\x9cfriendly\nbanners gone astray and found on a wrong path,\xe2\x80\x9d and his brow became\nsmooth again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming, charming!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Prince Vas\xc3\xadli.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe path to Warsaw, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly and\nunexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he meant.\nPrince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise. He knew no\nmore than the others what his words meant. During his diplomatic career\nhe had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very\nwitty, and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words\nthat entered his head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may turn out very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\nif not, they\xe2\x80\x99ll know how to arrange matters.\xe2\x80\x9d And really, during the\nawkward silence that ensued, that insufficiently patriotic person\nentered whom Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert,\nand she, smiling and shaking a finger at Hippolyte, invited Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript\nbegged him to begin. Everyone became silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Vas\xc3\xadli sternly declaimed,\nlooking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had\nanything to say to the contrary. But no one said anything. \xe2\x80\x9cMoscow, our\nancient capital, the New Jerusalem, receives her Christ\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he placed a\nsudden emphasis on the word her\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cas a mother receives her zealous sons\ninto her arms, and through the gathering mists, foreseeing the brilliant\nglory of thy rule, sings in exultation, \xe2\x80\x98Hosanna, blessed is he that\ncometh!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.\n\nBil\xc3\xadbin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present\nappeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman\nmuttering the prayer at Communion: \xe2\x80\x9cLet the bold and insolent\nGoliath...\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\n\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli continued.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass\nthe realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble Faith, the sling\nof the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty\npride. This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the servant of God and\nzealous champion of old of our country\xe2\x80\x99s weal, is offered to Your\nImperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing\nin the sight of your most gracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to\nHeaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just, and mercifully\nfulfill the desires of Your Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat force! What a style!\xe2\x80\x9d was uttered in approval both of reader and\nof author.\n\nAnimated by that address Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s guests talked for a long time\nof the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the\nresult of the battle to be fought in a few days.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, \xe2\x80\x9cthat tomorrow, on the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nbirthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day during the\nservice at the palace church in honor of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, Prince\nVolk\xc3\xb3nski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from\nPrince Kut\xc3\xbazov. It was Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s report, written from Tat\xc3\xa1rinova on the\nday of the battle. Kut\xc3\xbazov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a\nstep, that the French losses were much heavier than ours, and that he\nwas writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full\ninformation. It followed that there must have been a victory. And at\nonce, without leaving the church, thanks were rendered to the Creator\nfor His help and for the victory.\n\nAnna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s presentiment was justified, and all that morning a\njoyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the victory\nto have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s having been\ncaptured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler for\nFrance.\n\nIt is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength\nand completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the\nscene of action. General events involuntarily group themselves around\nsome particular incident. So now the courtiers\xe2\x80\x99 pleasure was based as\nmuch on the fact that the news had arrived on the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s birthday as\non the fact of the victory itself. It was like a successfully arranged\nsurprise. Mention was made in Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s report of the Russian losses,\namong which figured the names of T\xc3\xbachkov, Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, and Kut\xc3\xa1ysov. In\nthe Petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily\ncentered round a single incident: Kut\xc3\xa1ysov\xe2\x80\x99s death. Everybody knew\nhim, the Emperor liked him, and he was young and interesting. That day\neveryone met with the words:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a loss\nKut\xc3\xa1ysov is! How sorry I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I tell about Kut\xc3\xbazov?\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Vas\xc3\xadli now said with a\nprophet\xe2\x80\x99s pride. \xe2\x80\x9cI always said he was the only man capable of defeating\nNapoleon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew\nanxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense\noccasioned the Emperor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s position!\xe2\x80\x9d said they, and instead of extolling\nKut\xc3\xbazov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause\nof the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety. That day Prince Vas\xc3\xadli no longer boasted of\nhis prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 Kut\xc3\xbazov, but remained silent when the commander in chief was\nmentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if everything conspired to make\nPetersburg society anxious and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was\nadded. Countess H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne Bez\xc3\xbakhova had suddenly died of that terrible\nmalady it had been so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large\ngatherings, everyone said that Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova had died of a\nterrible attack of angina pectoris, but in intimate circles details\nwere mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had\nprescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect;\nbut H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne, tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and\nthat her husband to whom she had written (that wretched, profligate\nPierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large dose of the\ndrug, and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her.\nIt was said that Prince Vas\xc3\xadli and the old count had turned upon the\nItalian, but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate\ndeceased that they had immediately let the matter drop.\n\nTalk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\nlack of news, the loss of Kut\xc3\xa1ysov, and the death of H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne.\n\nOn the third day after Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s report a country gentleman arrived from\nMoscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread through\nthe whole town. This was terrible! What a position for the Emperor to\nbe in! Kut\xc3\xbazov was a traitor, and Prince Vas\xc3\xadli during the visits of\ncondolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s death said of\nKut\xc3\xbazov, whom he had formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his\ngrief to forget what he had said), that it was impossible to expect\nanything else from a blind and depraved old man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such\na man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it,\nbut the next day the following communication was received from Count\nRostopch\xc3\xadn:\n\nPrince Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands\npolice officers to guide the army to the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n road. He writes that\nhe is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s action decides the\nfate of the capital and of your empire! Russia will shudder to learn of\nthe abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in\nwhich lie the ashes of your ancestors! I shall follow the army. I have\nhad everything removed, and it only remains for me to weep over the fate\nof my fatherland.\n\nOn receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volk\xc3\xb3nski to Kut\xc3\xbazov\nwith the following rescript:\n\nPrince Michael Ilari\xc3\xb3novich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have\nreceived no communication from you, yet on the first of September I\nreceived from the commander in chief of Moscow, via Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl, the sad\nnews that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You can\nyourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your silence\nincreases my astonishment. I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince\nVolk\xc3\xb3nski, to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons\nthat have induced you to take this melancholy decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nNine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from Kut\xc3\xbazov\nreached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event. This\nmessenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know Russian, but who was\nquoique \xc3\xa9tranger, russe de c\xc5\x93ur et d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa2me, * as he said of himself.\n\n    * Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.\n\nThe Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace\non Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before the campaign\nand who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as he wrote) when\nhe appeared before notre tr\xc3\xa8s gracieux souverain * with the news of the\nburning of Moscow, dont les flammes \xc3\xa9clairaient sa route. *(2)\n\n     * Our most gracious sovereign.\n\n     * (2) Whose flames illumined his route.\n\nThough the source of M. Michaud\xe2\x80\x99s chagrin must have been different from\nthat which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when shown\ninto the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s study that the latter at once asked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you brought me sad news, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery sad, sire,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nabandonment of Moscow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\nEmperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.\n\nMichaud respectfully delivered the message Kut\xc3\xbazov had entrusted to him,\nwhich was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow, and that\nas the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as\nMoscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to choose the\nlatter.\n\nThe Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the enemy entered the city?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all in flames,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreplied Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he was\nfrightened by what he had done.\n\nThe Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip\ntrembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.\n\nBut this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming\nhimself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in a\nfirm voice:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence requires\ngreat sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in all things to\nHis will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave the army when it\nsaw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle? Did you not notice\ndiscouragement?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSeeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also\ngrew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\ndirect and relevant question which required a direct answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nasked to gain time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel, I always require it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Emperor. \xe2\x80\x9cConceal nothing\nfrom me, I wish to know absolutely how things are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire!\xe2\x80\x9d said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on his\nlips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, \xe2\x80\x9csire, I left the\nwhole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without exception in\ndesperate and agonized terror...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that?\xe2\x80\x9d the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cWould\nmisfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMichaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had\nprepared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with respectful playfulness, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are only afraid lest\nYour Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should allow yourself to be\npersuaded to make peace. They are burning for the combat,\xe2\x80\x9d declared this\nrepresentative of the Russian nation, \xe2\x80\x9cand to prove to Your Majesty by\nthe sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his eyes,\nhe patted Michaud on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou set me at ease, Colonel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe bent his head and was silent for some time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, go back to the army,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, drawing himself up to his\nfull height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture,\n\xe2\x80\x9cand tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that\nwhen I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the head of my\nbeloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of\nmy empire. It still offers me more than my enemies suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nEmperor growing more and more animated; \xe2\x80\x9cbut should it ever be ordained\nby Divine Providence,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, raising to heaven his fine eyes\nshining with emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my dynasty should cease to reign on the\nthrone of my ancestors, then after exhausting all the means at my\ncommand, I shall let my beard grow to here\xe2\x80\x9d (he pointed halfway down his\nchest) \xe2\x80\x9cand go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants, rather\nthan sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose\nsacrifices I know how to appreciate.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHaving uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly\nturned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes,\nand went to the further end of his study. Having stood there a few\nmoments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow\nwith a vigorous movement. The Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s mild and handsome face was\nflushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we may\nrecall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or I,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Emperor,\ntouching his breast. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can no longer both reign together. I have\nlearned to know him, and he will not deceive me any more....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the Emperor paused, with a frown.\n\nWhen he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, Michaud\xe2\x80\x94quoique \xc3\xa9tranger, russe de c\xc5\x93ur et d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa2me,\xe2\x80\x94at\nthat solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard (as\nhe used afterwards to say), and gave expression to his own feelings and\nthose of the Russian people whose representative he considered himself\nto be, in the following words:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSire!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cYour Majesty is at this moment signing the glory of\nthe nation and the salvation of Europe!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIt is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that\nwhen half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to\ndistant provinces, and one levy after another was being raised for the\ndefense of the fatherland, all Russians from the greatest to the least\nwere solely engaged in sacrificing themselves, saving their fatherland,\nor weeping over its downfall. The tales and descriptions of that time\nwithout exception speak only of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion,\ndespair, grief, and the heroism of the Russians. But it was not really\nso. It appears so to us because we see only the general historic\ninterest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests\nthat people had. Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment\nso much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the\npublic interest from being felt or even noticed. Most of the people at\nthat time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were\nguided only by their private interests, and they were the very people\nwhose activities at that period were most useful.\n\nThose who tried to understand the general course of events and to take\npart in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members\nof society, they saw everything upside down, and all they did for the\ncommon good turned out to be useless and foolish\xe2\x80\x94like Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s and\nMam\xc3\xb3nov\xe2\x80\x99s regiments which looted Russian villages, and the lint the\nyoung ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded, and so on.\nEven those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings,\nwho discussed Russia\xe2\x80\x99s position at the time involuntarily introduced\ninto their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or\nuseless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of\nactions no one could possibly be guilty of. In historic events the rule\nforbidding us to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is specially\napplicable. Only unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part\nin an historic event never understands its significance. If he tries to\nrealize it his efforts are fruitless.\n\nThe more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in\nRussia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg and\nin the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and gentlemen in\nmilitia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of\nself-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow\nthere was little talk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight\nof its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French, but they\nthought about their next pay, their next quarters, of Matr\xc3\xabshka the\nvivandi\xc3\xa8re, and like matters.\n\nAs the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rost\xc3\xb3v took a close\nand prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually,\nwithout any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was\ngoing on in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his\nbrains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the state of\nRussia, he would have said that it was not his business to think about\nit, that Kut\xc3\xbazov and others were there for that purpose, but that he had\nheard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength, that\nfighting would probably go on for a long time yet, and that things being\nso it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple\nof years\xe2\x80\x99 time.\n\nAs he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being\nsent to Vor\xc3\xb3nezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without\nregret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but\nwith the greatest pleasure\xe2\x80\x94which he did not conceal and which his\ncomrades fully understood.\n\nA few days before the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, Nicholas received the\nnecessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in\nadvance, he set out with post horses for Vor\xc3\xb3nezh.\n\nOnly a man who has experienced it\xe2\x80\x94that is, has passed some months\ncontinuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war\xe2\x80\x94can understand the\ndelight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the\narmy\xe2\x80\x99s foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals. When\xe2\x80\x94free\nfrom soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a camp\xe2\x80\x94he saw villages\nwith peasants and peasant women, gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s country houses, fields\nwhere cattle were grazing, posthouses with stationmasters asleep in\nthem, he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time. What for\na long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women, young\nand healthy, without a dozen officers making up to each of them; women,\ntoo, who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke\nwith them.\n\nIn the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in Vor\xc3\xb3nezh,\nordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, and next day, very\nclean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not worn for a long\ntime, went to present himself to the authorities.\n\nThe commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man who was\nevidently pleased with his military designation and rank. He received\nNicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically military)\nand questioned him with an important air, as if considering the general\nprogress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do\nso. Nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him.\n\nFrom the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The governor\nwas a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated the stud\nfarms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended to him a horse\ndealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had\nthe best horses, and promised to assist him in every way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x99s son? My wife was a great friend of your\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s. We are at home on Thursdays\xe2\x80\x94today is Thursday, so please come\nand see us quite informally,\xe2\x80\x9d said the governor, taking leave of him.\n\nImmediately on leaving the governor\xe2\x80\x99s, Nicholas hired post horses and,\ntaking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop to the\nlandowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything seemed to\nhim pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Vor\xc3\xb3nezh\nand, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind,\neverything went well and easily.\n\nThe landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old cavalryman, a\nhorse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old brandy\nand some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he smoked, and who\nowned some splendid horses.\n\nIn very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six\nthousand rubles\xe2\x80\x94to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts. After\ndining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine, Nicholas\xe2\x80\x94having\nexchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was already on the\nfriendliest terms\xe2\x80\x94galloped back over abominable roads, in the brightest\nframe of mind, continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for\nthe governor\xe2\x80\x99s party.\n\nWhen he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented himself,\nNicholas arrived at the governor\xe2\x80\x99s rather late, but with the phrase\n\xe2\x80\x9cbetter late than never\xe2\x80\x9d on his lips.\n\nIt was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew\nthat Catherine Petr\xc3\xb3vna would play valses and the \xc3\xa9cossaise on the\nclavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come as\nto a ball.\n\nProvincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this\ndifference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the\narrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything that\nwent on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable, an\n\xe2\x80\x9cin for a penny, in for a pound\xe2\x80\x94who cares?\xe2\x80\x9d spirit, and the inevitable\nsmall talk, instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances,\nnow turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.\n\nThe society gathered together at the governor\xe2\x80\x99s was the best in\nVor\xc3\xb3nezh.\n\nThere were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 Moscow\nacquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with the\ncavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured\nand well-bred Count Rost\xc3\xb3v. Among the men was an Italian prisoner, an\nofficer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence of that\nprisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. The Italian\nwas, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed to him\nthat everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he treated him\ncordially though with dignity and restraint.\n\nAs soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing around him\na fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the words \xe2\x80\x9cbetter late\nthan never\xe2\x80\x9d and heard them repeated several times by others, people\nclustered around him; all eyes turned on him, and he felt at once\nthat he had entered into his proper position in the province\xe2\x80\x94that of\na universal favorite: a very pleasant position, and intoxicatingly so\nafter his long privations. At posting stations, at inns, and in the\nlandowner\xe2\x80\x99s snuggery, maidservants had been flattered by his notice, and\nhere too at the governor\xe2\x80\x99s party there were (as it seemed to Nicholas)\nan inexhaustible number of pretty young women, married and unmarried,\nimpatiently awaiting his notice. The women and girls flirted with him\nand, from the first day, the people concerned themselves to get this\nfine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down. Among these\nwas the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife herself, who welcomed Rost\xc3\xb3v as a near relative\nand called him \xe2\x80\x9cNicholas.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCatherine Petr\xc3\xb3vna did actually play valses and the \xc3\xa9cossaise, and\ndancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial\nsociety by his agility. His particularly free manner of dancing even\nsurprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he\ndanced that evening. He had never danced like that in Moscow and would\neven have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in\nbad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by\nsomething unusual, something they would have to accept as the regular\nthing in the capital though new to them in the provinces.\n\nAll the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and\npleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials.\nWith the na\xc3\xafve conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men\xe2\x80\x99s\nwives were created for them, Rost\xc3\xb3v did not leave the lady\xe2\x80\x99s side and\ntreated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style, as if,\nwithout speaking of it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady\nwould get on together. The husband, however, did not seem to share that\nconviction and tried to behave morosely with Rost\xc3\xb3v. But the\nlatter\xe2\x80\x99s good-natured na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 was so boundless that sometimes even he\ninvoluntarily yielded to Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 good humor. Toward the end of the\nevening, however, as the wife\xe2\x80\x99s face grew more flushed and animated, the\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s became more and more melancholy and solemn, as though there\nwere but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife\xe2\x80\x99s\nshare increased the husband\xe2\x80\x99s diminished.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending closely\nover the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a\nsmile that never left his face. Jauntily shifting the position of his\nlegs in their tight riding breeches, diffusing an odor of perfume, and\nadmiring his partner, himself, and the fine outlines of his legs in\ntheir well-fitting Hessian boots, Nicholas told the blonde lady that he\nwished to run away with a certain lady here in Vor\xc3\xb3nezh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich lady?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA charming lady, a divine one. Her eyes\xe2\x80\x9d (Nicholas looked at his\npartner) \xe2\x80\x9care blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figure\xe2\x80\x9d (he glanced\nat her shoulders) \xe2\x80\x9clike Diana\xe2\x80\x99s....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking\nabout.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Nik\xc3\xadta Iv\xc3\xa1nych!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if wishing\nNik\xc3\xadta Iv\xc3\xa1nych to share his joke, he began to tell him of his intention\nto elope with a blonde lady.\n\nThe husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governor\xe2\x80\x99s good-natured\nwife came up with a look of disapproval.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnna Ign\xc3\xa1tyevna wants to see you, Nicholas,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, pronouncing the\nname so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna Ign\xc3\xa1tyevna was a very\nimportant person. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Nicholas! You know you let me call you so?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnna Ign\xc3\xa1tyevna Malv\xc3\xadntseva. She has heard from her niece how you\nrescued her.... Can you guess?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI rescued such a lot of them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer niece, Princess Bolk\xc3\xb3nskaya. She is here in Vor\xc3\xb3nezh with her aunt.\nOho! How you blush. Why, are...?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit! Please don\xe2\x80\x99t, Aunt!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, very well!... Oh, what a fellow you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with\na blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with the most\nimportant personages of the town. This was Malv\xc3\xadntseva, Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\naunt on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side, a rich, childless widow who always lived in\nVor\xc3\xb3nezh. When Rost\xc3\xb3v approached her she was standing settling up for\nthe game. She looked at him and, screwing up her eyes sternly, continued\nto upbraid the general who had won from her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery pleased, mon cher,\xe2\x80\x9d she then said, holding out her hand to\nNicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cPray come and see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom\nMalv\xc3\xadntseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas\nknew of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the\nimportant old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to\ncome to see her.\n\nNicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the mention\nof Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear,\nwhich he himself did not understand.\n\nWhen he had parted from Malv\xc3\xadntseva Nicholas wished to return to the\ndancing, but the governor\xe2\x80\x99s little wife placed her plump hand on his\nsleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to\nher sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew\nso as not to be in her way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d began the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife with a serious\nexpression on her kind little face, \xe2\x80\x9cthat really would be the match for\nyou: would you like me to arrange it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you mean, Aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine Petr\xc3\xb3vna\nspeaks of Lily, but I say, no\xe2\x80\x94the princess! Do you want me to do it? I\nam sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl she is,\nreally! And she is not at all so plain, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. \xe2\x80\x9cAs befits\na soldier, Aunt, I don\xe2\x80\x99t force myself on anyone or refuse anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid before he had time to consider what he was saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, remember, this is not a joke!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife said as if talking to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\nmy dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other, the\nblonde. One is sorry for the husband, really....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, we are good friends with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas in the simplicity\nof his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to\nhimself might not be pleasant to someone else.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what nonsense I have been saying to the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife!\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nNicholas suddenly at supper. \xe2\x80\x9cShe will really begin to arrange a\nmatch... and S\xc3\xb3nya...?\xe2\x80\x9d And on taking leave of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife,\nwhen she again smilingly said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cWell then, remember!\xe2\x80\x9d he drew her\naside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, my dear? Come, let\xe2\x80\x99s sit down here,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\nNicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate\nthoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or\nhis friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he afterwards\nrecalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which\nhad very important results for him, it seemed to him\xe2\x80\x94as it seems to\neveryone in such cases\xe2\x80\x94that it was merely some silly whim that seized\nhim: yet that burst of frankness, together with other trifling events,\nhad immense consequences for him and for all his family.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but the\nvery idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Princess Bolk\xc3\xb3nskaya\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s another matter. I will tell you the\ntruth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to her; and\nthen, after I met her under such circumstances\xe2\x80\x94so strangely, the idea\noften occurred to me: \xe2\x80\x98This is fate.\xe2\x80\x99 Especially if you remember that\nMamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never happened to meet her\nbefore, somehow it had always happened that we did not meet. And as long\nas my sister Nat\xc3\xa1sha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of\nthe question for me to think of marrying her. And it must needs happen\nthat I should meet her just when Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s engagement had been broken\noff... and then everything... So you see... I never told this to anyone\nand never will, only to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife pressed his elbow gratefully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know S\xc3\xb3nya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her, and\nwill do so.... So you see there can be no question about\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas\nincoherently and blushing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know S\xc3\xb3nya has nothing and\nyou yourself say your Papa\xe2\x80\x99s affairs are in a very bad way. And what\nabout your mother? It would kill her, that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing. And what sort of\nlife would it be for S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x94if she\xe2\x80\x99s a girl with a heart? Your mother\nin despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and S\xc3\xb3nya ought to\nunderstand that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, Aunt, it is impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined with a sigh, after\na short pause. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, would the princess have me? And besides, she is\nnow in mourning. How can one think of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get you married at once? There is\nalways a right way of doing things,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a matchmaker you are, Aunt...\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas, kissing her plump\nlittle hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nOn reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rost\xc3\xb3v, Princess Mary had\nfound her nephew there with his tutor, and a letter from Prince Andrew\ngiving her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malv\xc3\xadntseva at Vor\xc3\xb3nezh.\nThat feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s illness, since his death, and especially since her meeting with\nRost\xc3\xb3v was smothered by arrangements for the journey, anxiety about her\nbrother, settling in a new house, meeting new people, and attending to\nher nephew\xe2\x80\x99s education. She was sad. Now, after a month passed in quiet\nsurroundings, she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which\nwas associated in her mind with the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and\nincessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother,\nthe only intimate person now remaining to her, was exposed. She was\nworried too about her nephew\xe2\x80\x99s education for which she had always felt\nherself incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace\xe2\x80\x94a\npeace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams\nand hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were\nrelated to her meeting with Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nThe day after her party the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife came to see Malv\xc3\xadntseva\nand, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though\nunder present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of course, not to be\nthought of, all the same the young people might be brought together and\ncould get to know one another. Malv\xc3\xadntseva expressed approval, and the\ngovernor\xe2\x80\x99s wife began to speak of Rost\xc3\xb3v in Mary\xe2\x80\x99s presence, praising\nhim and telling how he had blushed when Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s name was\nmentioned. But Princess Mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful\nfeeling\xe2\x80\x94her mental tranquillity was destroyed, and desires, doubts,\nself-reproach, and hopes reawoke.\n\nDuring the two days that elapsed before Rost\xc3\xb3v called, Princess Mary\ncontinually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she decided\nnot to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt\xe2\x80\x94that it\nwould not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to receive visitors;\nthen she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her; then\nit occurred to her that her aunt and the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife had intentions\nconcerning herself and Rost\xc3\xb3v\xe2\x80\x94their looks and words at times seemed to\nconfirm this supposition\xe2\x80\x94then she told herself that only she, with her\nsinful nature, could think this of them: they could not forget that\nsituated as she was, while still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking\nwould be an insult to her and to her father\xe2\x80\x99s memory. Assuming that she\ndid go down to see him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say\nto her and what she would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed\nundeservedly cold and then to mean too much. More than anything she\nfeared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as\nsoon as she saw him.\n\nBut when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing\nroom that Count Rost\xc3\xb3v had called, the princess showed no confusion,\nonly a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new\nand radiant light.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have met him, Aunt?\xe2\x80\x9d said she in a calm voice, unable herself to\nunderstand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.\n\nWhen Rost\xc3\xb3v entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an\ninstant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then\njust as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with\nshining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose\nwith a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate hand to him,\nand began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep\nwomanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in the drawing\nroom, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise. Herself a\nconsummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a\nman she wished to attract.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly\nimproved without my having noticed it. And above all, what tact and\ngrace!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\nHad Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she would\nhave been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that\nhad taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized that dear,\nloved face, a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to\nspeak and act apart from her own will. From the time Rost\xc3\xb3v entered, her\nface became suddenly transformed. It was as if a light had been kindled\nin a carved and painted lantern and the intricate, skillful, artistic\nwork on its sides, that previously seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless,\nwas suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty. For the first\ntime all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had\nlived appeared on the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction\nwith herself, her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her\nmeekness, love, and self-sacrifice\xe2\x80\x94all this now shone in those radiant\neyes, in her delicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle face.\n\nRost\xc3\xb3v saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He\nfelt that the being before him was quite different from, and better\nthan, anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself.\n\nTheir conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of the\nwar, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow\nabout it; they spoke of their last meeting\xe2\x80\x94Nicholas trying to change the\nsubject\xe2\x80\x94they talked of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s kind wife, of Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 relations,\nand of Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nShe did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as soon\nas her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s\nmisfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was too near\nher heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him. Nicholas\nnoticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s character\nwith an observation unusual to him, and everything confirmed his\nconviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being.\nNicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the\nprincess (as she did when he was mentioned) and even when he thought of\nher, but in her presence he felt quite at ease, and said not at all what\nhe had prepared, but what, quite appropriately, occurred to him at the\nmoment.\n\nWhen a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is usual when\nthere are children, turned to Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s little son, caressing him\nand asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He took the boy on\nhis knee, played with him, and looked round at Princess Mary. With a\nsoftened, happy, timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms\nof the man she loved. Nicholas also noticed that look and, as if\nunderstanding it, flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with\ngood natured playfulness.\n\nAs she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society, and\nNicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but all\nthe same the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife went on with her matchmaking, passing on to\nNicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice\nversa, and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary. For this\npurpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishop\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse before Mass.\n\nThough Rost\xc3\xb3v told the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife that he would not make any\ndeclaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.\n\nAs at Tilsit Rost\xc3\xb3v had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody\nconsidered right was right, so now, after a short but sincere struggle\nbetween his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice, and\nin obedient submission to circumstances, he chose the latter and yielded\nto the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where. He\nknew that after his promise to S\xc3\xb3nya it would be what he deemed base to\ndeclare his feelings to Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never\nact basely. But he also knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart)\nthat by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those\nwho were guiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing\nsomething very important\xe2\x80\x94more important than anything he had ever done\nin his life.\n\nAfter meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on\nexternally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for him\nand he often thought about her. But he never thought about her as he\nhad thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met\nin society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time rapturously,\nthought about S\xc3\xb3nya. He had pictured each of those young ladies as\nalmost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as a possible wife,\nadapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life:\na white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s carriage,\nlittle ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to her, and so on\xe2\x80\x94and these\npictures of the future had given him pleasure. But with Princess Mary,\nto whom they were trying to get him engaged, he could never picture\nanything of future married life. If he tried, his pictures seemed\nincongruous and false. It made him afraid.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe dreadful news of the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, of our losses in killed and\nwounded, and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow reached\nVor\xc3\xb3nezh in the middle of September. Princess Mary, having learned of\nher brother\xe2\x80\x99s wound only from the Gazette and having no definite news of\nhim, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her again himself) to\nset off in search of Prince Andrew.\n\nWhen he received the news of the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 and the abandonment\nof Moscow, Rost\xc3\xb3v was not seized with despair, anger, the desire for\nvengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but everything in Vor\xc3\xb3nezh\nsuddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and he experienced an\nindefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The conversations he heard\nseemed to him insincere; he did not know how to judge all these affairs\nand felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear\nto him. He made haste to finish buying the horses, and often became\nunreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster.\n\nA few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which\nNicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory.\nHe stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military\ndecorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of subjects.\nWhen the service was over the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife beckoned him to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen the princess?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, indicating with a movement of\nher head a lady standing on the opposite side, beyond the choir.\n\nNicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the profile\nhe saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude, timidity, and\npity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary, evidently engrossed\nby her thoughts, was crossing herself for the last time before leaving\nthe church.\n\nNicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same face he had\nseen before, there was the same general expression of refined, inner,\nspiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There was a\npathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had occurred\nbefore when she was present, Nicholas went up to her without waiting to\nbe prompted by the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife and not asking himself whether or not\nit was right and proper to address her here in church, and told her he\nhad heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul. As soon as\nshe heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face, lighting up both\nher sorrow and her joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rost\xc3\xb3v. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\nis that if your brother, Prince Andrew Nikol\xc3\xa1evich, were not living, it\nwould have been at once announced in the Gazette, as he is a colonel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but cheered\nby the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I have known so many cases of a splinter wound\xe2\x80\x9d (the Gazette said\nit was a shell) \xe2\x80\x9ceither proving fatal at once or being very slight,\xe2\x80\x9d\ncontinued Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must hope for the best, and I am sure...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary interrupted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that would be so dread...\xe2\x80\x9d she began and, prevented by agitation\nfrom finishing, she bent her head with a movement as graceful as\neverything she did in his presence and, looking up at him gratefully,\nwent out, following her aunt.\n\nThat evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle some\naccounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that business it\nwas already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed,\nand for a long time he paced up and down the room, reflecting on his\nlife, a thing he rarely did.\n\nPrincess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met\nher in Smol\xc3\xa9nsk province. His having encountered her in such exceptional\ncircumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as\na good match, had drawn his particular attention to her. When he met her\nagain in Vor\xc3\xb3nezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing\nbut powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he\nobserved in her at this time. He was, however, preparing to go away and\nit had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself\nof chances of meeting her. But that day\xe2\x80\x99s encounter in church had, he\nfelt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale,\nsad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures,\nand especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features\nagitated him and evoked his sympathy. In men Rost\xc3\xb3v could not bear to\nsee the expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not\nlike Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy\nand dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed\nthe depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible\nattraction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with S\xc3\xb3nya?\xe2\x80\x9d And he\ninvoluntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and\nthe abundance of it in the other\xe2\x80\x94a spirituality he himself lacked and\ntherefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were\nhe free. How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife.\nBut no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear picture\npresented itself to his mind. He had long ago pictured to himself a\nfuture with S\xc3\xb3nya, and that was all clear and simple just because it\nhad all been thought out and he knew all there was in S\xc3\xb3nya, but it was\nimpossible to picture a future with Princess Mary, because he did not\nunderstand her but simply loved her.\n\nReveries about S\xc3\xb3nya had had something merry and playful in them, but to\ndream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little frightening.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow she prayed!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was plain that her whole soul was in\nher prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains, and I am\nsure her prayer will be answered. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I pray for what I want?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsuddenly thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I want? To be free, released from S\xc3\xb3nya...\nShe was right,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, remembering what the governor\xe2\x80\x99s wife had\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing but misfortune can come of marrying S\xc3\xb3nya. Muddles,\ngrief for Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible muddles!\nBesides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t love her\xe2\x80\x94not as I should. O, God! release me from\nthis dreadful, inextricable position!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly began to pray. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\nprayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not pray as\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn into\nsugar\xe2\x80\x94and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so. No,\nbut I am not praying for trifles now,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought as he put his pipe\ndown in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself before the icon.\nSoftened by memories of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not\ndone for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the\ndoor opened and Lavr\xc3\xbashka came in with some papers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlockhead! Why do you come in without being called?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nicholas,\nquickly changing his attitude.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the governor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lavr\xc3\xbashka in a sleepy voice. \xe2\x80\x9cA courier has\narrived and there\xe2\x80\x99s a letter for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right, thanks. You can go!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother and\nthe other from S\xc3\xb3nya. He recognized them by the handwriting and opened\nS\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s first. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his\neyes opened wide with fear and joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried aloud.\n\nUnable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and\nreading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then again,\nand standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders,\nstretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed.\nWhat he had just been praying for with confidence that God would hear\nhim had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were\nsomething extraordinary and unexpected, and as if the very fact that it\nhad happened so quickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he\nhad prayed, but by some ordinary coincidence.\n\nThis unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary letter\nfrom S\xc3\xb3nya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which\nthere had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last unfortunate\nevents\xe2\x80\x94the loss of almost the whole of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 Moscow property\xe2\x80\x94and\nthe countess\xe2\x80\x99 repeatedly expressed wish that Nicholas should marry\nPrincess Bolk\xc3\xb3nskaya, together with his silence and coldness of late,\nhad all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and\nset him completely free.\n\nIt would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow\nor discord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote), and my\nlove has no aim but the happiness of those I love; so, Nicholas, I\nbeg you to consider yourself free, and to be assured that, in spite of\neverything, no one can love you more than does\n\nYour S\xc3\xb3nya\n\nBoth letters were written from Tr\xc3\xb3itsa. The other, from the countess,\ndescribed their last days in Moscow, their departure, the fire, and\nthe destruction of all their property. In this letter the countess also\nmentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them;\nhis state was very critical, but the doctor said there was now more\nhope. S\xc3\xb3nya and Nat\xc3\xa1sha were nursing him.\n\nNext day Nicholas took his mother\xe2\x80\x99s letter and went to see Princess\nMary. Neither he nor she said a word about what \xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha nursing him\xe2\x80\x9d\nmight mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as\nintimate with the princess as if they were relations.\n\nThe following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl,\nand a few days later left to rejoin his regiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s letter written from Tr\xc3\xb3itsa, which had come as an answer to\nNicholas\xe2\x80\x99 prayer, was prompted by this: the thought of getting Nicholas\nmarried to an heiress occupied the old countess\xe2\x80\x99 mind more and more. She\nknew that S\xc3\xb3nya was the chief obstacle to this happening, and S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s\nlife in the countess\xe2\x80\x99 house had grown harder and harder, especially\nafter they had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting\nwith Princess Mary in Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo. The countess let no occasion slip of\nmaking humiliating or cruel allusions to S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\nBut a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that\nwas going on, she called S\xc3\xb3nya to her and, instead of reproaching and\nmaking demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself\nand repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her\nengagement with Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be at peace till you promise me this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that\nshe would do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave no actual\npromise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded\nof her. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and\nbrought her up. To sacrifice herself for others was S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s habit. Her\nposition in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her\nworth, and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it. But in all her\nformer acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they\nraised her in her own esteem and in that of others, and so made her more\nworthy of Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world. But\nnow they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the\nwhole reward for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life.\nAnd for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been\nher benefactors only to torture her the more painfully; she felt jealous\nof Nat\xc3\xa1sha who had never experienced anything of this sort, had never\nneeded to sacrifice herself, but made others sacrifice themselves for\nher and yet was beloved by everybody. And for the first time S\xc3\xb3nya felt\nthat out of her pure, quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling\nwas beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle, virtue,\nor religion. Under the influence of this feeling S\xc3\xb3nya, whose life of\ndependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive, having answered\nthe countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and\nresolved to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him\nfree but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.\n\nThe bustle and terror of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 last days in Moscow stifled the\ngloomy thoughts that oppressed S\xc3\xb3nya. She was glad to find escape\nfrom them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s\npresence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and for\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God\ndid not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nloved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him. She\nknew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances\nthey would again fall in love with one another, and that Nicholas would\nthen not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would be within the\nprohibited degrees of affinity. Despite all the terror of what had\nhappened during those last days and during the first days of their\njourney, this feeling that Providence was intervening in her personal\naffairs cheered S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\nAt the Tr\xc3\xb3itsa monastery the Rost\xc3\xb3vs first broke their journey for a\nwhole day.\n\nThree large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry, one\nof which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much better\nthat day and Nat\xc3\xa1sha was sitting with him. In the next room sat the\ncount and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was\ncalling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery.\nS\xc3\xb3nya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew and\nNat\xc3\xa1sha were talking about. She heard the sound of their voices through\nthe door. That door opened and Nat\xc3\xa1sha came out, looking excited. Not\nnoticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the\nwide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to S\xc3\xb3nya and took her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, what are you about? Come here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to pray\nfor aid to God and His saint.\n\nAs soon as the prior withdrew, Nat\xc3\xa1sha took her friend by the hand and\nwent with her into the unoccupied room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, will he live?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, how happy I am, and how\nunhappy!... S\xc3\xb3nya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only he\nlives! He cannot... because... because... of...\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat\xc3\xa1sha burst into\ntears.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! I knew it! Thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured S\xc3\xb3nya. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter\xe2\x80\x99s fear and\ngrief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one.\nSobbing, she kissed and comforted Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only he lives!\xe2\x80\x9d she\nthought. Having wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two\nfriends went together to Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s door. Nat\xc3\xa1sha opened it\ncautiously and glanced into the room, S\xc3\xb3nya standing beside her at the\nhalf-open door.\n\nPrince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale face was\ncalm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular breathing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, Nat\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d S\xc3\xb3nya suddenly almost screamed, catching her companion\xe2\x80\x99s\narm and stepping back from the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s that, that...\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya, with a white face and trembling lips.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha softly closed the door and went with S\xc3\xb3nya to the window, not\nyet understanding what the latter was telling her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya with a solemn and frightened expression.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe at\nChristmas? Do you remember what I saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely recalling\nthat S\xc3\xb3nya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom she had seen\nlying down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember?\xe2\x80\x9d S\xc3\xb3nya went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw it then and told everybody, you\nand Duny\xc3\xa1sha. I saw him lying on a bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, making a gesture with\nher hand and a lifted finger at each detail, \xe2\x80\x9cand that he had his eyes\nclosed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were\nfolded,\xe2\x80\x9d she concluded, convincing herself that the details she had just\nseen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror.\n\nShe had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that\ncame into her head, but what she had invented then seemed to her now\nas real as any other recollection. She not only remembered what she had\nthen said\xe2\x80\x94that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with\nsomething red\xe2\x80\x94but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said\nthat he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, it really was pink!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who now thought she\ntoo remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most\nextraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what does it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she added meditatively.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it is all so strange,\xe2\x80\x9d replied S\xc3\xb3nya, clutching at\nher head.\n\nA few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and Nat\xc3\xa1sha went to him, but\nS\xc3\xb3nya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the window\nthinking about the strangeness of what had occurred.\n\n\nThey had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and the\ncountess was writing to her son.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya!\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as her\nniece passed, \xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xb3nya, won\xe2\x80\x99t you write to Nicholas?\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke in a soft,\ntremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles\nS\xc3\xb3nya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words. Those\neyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and\nreadiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mamma, I will write,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred that\nday, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her\nvision. Now that she knew that the renewal of Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s relations with\nPrince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princess Mary, she\nwas joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in\nwhich she was accustomed to live and loved to live. So with a joyful\nconsciousness of performing a magnanimous deed\xe2\x80\x94interrupted several times\nby the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes\xe2\x80\x94she wrote that touching\nletter the arrival of which had so amazed Nicholas.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him with\nhostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which he was taken.\nIn their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as\nto who he might be\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a very important person\xe2\x80\x94and hostility as a\nresult of their recent personal conflict with him.\n\nBut when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the\nnew guard\xe2\x80\x94both officers and men\xe2\x80\x94he was not as interesting as he had\nbeen to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not\nrecognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person\nwho had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had\nuttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only\nNo. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason\nby order of the Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable\nabout Pierre, it was only his unabashed, meditative concentration\nand thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke French, which struck them as\nsurprisingly good. In spite of this he was placed that day with the\nother arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was\nrequired by an officer.\n\nAll the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and,\nrecognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as\nhe spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him.\n\nThat evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among\nthem) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was taken\nwith the others to a house where a French general with a white mustache\nsat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms.\nWith the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners,\nand which is supposed to preclude human frailty, Pierre like the others\nwas questioned as to who he was, where he had been, with what object,\nand so on.\n\nThese questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the\nessence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that essence\xe2\x80\x99s\nbeing revealed, and were designed only to form a channel through which\nthe judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to\nthe desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as Pierre began to say\nanything that did not fit in with that aim, the channel was removed and\nthe water could flow to waste. Pierre felt, moreover, what the accused\nalways feel at their trial, perplexity as to why these questions were\nput to him. He had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a\nkind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed. He\nknew he was in these men\xe2\x80\x99s power, that only by force had they brought\nhim there, that force alone gave them the right to demand answers\nto their questions, and that the sole object of that assembly was to\ninculpate him. And so, as they had the power and wish to inculpate\nhim, this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary. It was\nevident that any answer would lead to conviction. When asked what he\nwas doing when he was arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner\nthat he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the\nflames. Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre answered that he \xe2\x80\x9cwas\nprotecting a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cto protect a woman who was being insulted\nwas the duty of every man; that...\xe2\x80\x9d They interrupted him, for this\nwas not to the point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where\nwitnesses had seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what\nwas happening in Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked\nwhere he was going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they\nasked, repeating their first question, which he had declined to answer.\nAgain he replied that he could not answer it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut that down, that\xe2\x80\x99s bad... very bad,\xe2\x80\x9d sternly remarked the general\nwith the white mustache and red flushed face.\n\n\nOn the fourth day fires broke out on the Z\xc3\xbabovski rampart.\n\nPierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchant\xe2\x80\x99s\nhouse near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the streets Pierre\nfelt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole\ncity. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not then realize the\nsignificance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires with\nhorror.\n\nHe passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and\nduring that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that all\nthose confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day\nfrom the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn from the\nsoldiers. Evidently for them \xe2\x80\x9cthe marshal\xe2\x80\x9d represented a very high and\nrather mysterious power.\n\nThese first days, before the eighth of September when the prisoners were\nhad up for a second examination, were the hardest of all for Pierre.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOn the eighth of September an officer\xe2\x80\x94a very important one judging by\nthe respect the guards showed him\xe2\x80\x94entered the coach house where the\nprisoners were. This officer, probably someone on the staff, was holding\na paper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there, naming\nPierre as \xe2\x80\x9cthe man who does not give his name.\xe2\x80\x9d Glancing indolently and\nindifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge\nto have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the\nmarshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with\nthirteen others was led to the Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s Field. It was a fine day, sunny\nafter rain, and the air was unusually pure. The smoke did not hang low\nas on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the\nZ\xc3\xbabovski rampart, but rose through the pure air in columns. No flames\nwere seen, but columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all Moscow as far\nas Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin. On all sides there were\nwaste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing, and\nhere and there the blackened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed\nat the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well. Here and\nthere he could see churches that had not been burned. The Kr\xc3\xa9mlin, which\nwas not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and\nthe belfry of Iv\xc3\xa1n the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin\nglittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.\nThese bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the\nNativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this\nholiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to be\nseen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw\nthe French.\n\nIt was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but in\nplace of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, Pierre\nunconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order had been\nestablished over this ruined nest. He felt this in the looks of\nthe soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily, were\nescorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the looks of an\nimportant French official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier,\nwhom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry sounds of regimental\nmusic he heard from the left side of the field, and felt and realized\nit especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had read out\nwhen he came that morning. Pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers\nand led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men,\nand it seemed that they might have forgotten him, or confused him with\nthe others. But no: the answers he had given when questioned had come\nback to him in his designation as \xe2\x80\x9cthe man who does not give his name,\xe2\x80\x9d\nand under that appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were\nnow leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces\nthat he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted\nand that they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself\nto be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose\naction he did not understand but which was working well.\n\nHe and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s\nField, to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the\nconvent. This was Prince Shcherb\xc3\xa1tov\xe2\x80\x99s house, where Pierre had often\nbeen in other days, and which, as he learned from the talk of the\nsoldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of Eckm\xc3\xbchl (Davout).\n\nThey were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one.\nPierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass gallery,\nan anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low\nstudy at the door of which stood an adjutant.\n\nDavout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end of\nthe room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently consulting\na paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without raising his eyes,\nhe said in a low voice:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To him\nDavout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for his\ncruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern schoolmaster\nwho was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that every\ninstant of delay might cost him his life; but he did not know what\nto say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first\nexamination, yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and\nembarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had decided what to do,\nDavout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back on his forehead,\nscrewed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently\ncalculated to frighten Pierre.\n\nThe chill that had been running down Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s back now seized his head\nas in a vise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a Russian spy,\xe2\x80\x9d Davout interrupted, addressing another general\nwho was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.\n\nDavout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice Pierre\nrapidly began:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monseigneur,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a duke.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia officer and\nhave not quitted Moscow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Davout.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBez\xc3\xbakhov.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat proof have I that you are not lying?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonseigneur!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a pleading\nvoice.\n\nDavout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they looked\nat one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from conditions of war\nand law, that look established human relations between the two men. At\nthat moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their\nminds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and\nwere brothers.\n\nAt the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the\npapers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre\nwas merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without\nburdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a\nhuman being. He reflected for a moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you show me that you are telling the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d said Davout\ncoldly.\n\nPierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the\nstreet where the house was.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not what you say,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Davout.\n\nIn a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of the\ntruth of his statements.\n\nBut at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout.\n\nDavout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began\nbuttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre.\n\nWhen the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head in\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But\nwhere they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house\nor to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as\nthey crossed the Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s Field.\n\nHe turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another\nquestion to Davout.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Davout, but what this \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d meant, Pierre did\nnot know.\n\nPierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was far, or\nin which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was stupefied,\nand noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others\ndid till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only thought in his\nmind at that time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to\ndeath? Not the men on the commission that had first examined him\xe2\x80\x94not one\nof them wished to or, evidently, could have done it. It was not Davout,\nwho had looked at him in so human a way. In another moment Davout would\nhave realized that he was doing wrong, but just then the adjutant had\ncome in and interrupted him. The adjutant, also, had evidently had no\nevil intent though he might have refrained from coming in. Then who was\nexecuting him, killing him, depriving him of life\xe2\x80\x94him, Pierre, with all\nhis memories, aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And\nPierre felt that it was no one.\n\nIt was a system\xe2\x80\x94a concurrence of circumstances.\n\nA system of some sort was killing him\xe2\x80\x94Pierre\xe2\x80\x94depriving him of life, of\neverything, annihilating him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nFrom Prince Shcherb\xc3\xa1tov\xe2\x80\x99s house the prisoners were led straight down the\nVirgin\xe2\x80\x99s Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen garden\nin which a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit had been\ndug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood\nin a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and many\nof Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers who were not on duty\xe2\x80\x94Germans, Italians, and\nFrenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of the post\nstood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high\nboots and shakos.\n\nThe prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the list\n(Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums suddenly\nbegan to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre felt as\nif part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of thinking or\nunderstanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only one wish\xe2\x80\x94that\nthe frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly. Pierre\nlooked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.\n\nThe two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and thin,\nthe other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was\na domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled hair and a\nplump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome\nman with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes. The fifth was a\nfactory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat.\n\nPierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them separately or\ntwo at a time. \xe2\x80\x9cIn couples,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the officer in command in a calm\nvoice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident\nthat they were all hurrying\xe2\x80\x94not as men hurry to do something they\nunderstand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and\nincomprehensible task.\n\nA French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of\nprisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.\n\nThen two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the\nofficer\xe2\x80\x99s command took the two convicts who stood first in the row. The\nconvicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks were being\nbrought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching\nhuntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other scratched his back\nand made a movement of the lips resembling a smile. With hurried hands\nthe soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and\nbound them to the post.\n\nTwelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm\nregular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned away\nto avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling\nnoise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific\nthunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen\nwere doing something near the pit, with pale faces and trembling hands.\nTwo more prisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar looks,\nthese two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for\nprotection in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe\nwhat was going to happen to them. They could not believe it because they\nalone knew what their life meant to them, and so they neither understood\nnor believed that it could be taken from them.\n\nAgain Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again the\nsound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the same moment\nhe saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the Frenchmen who\nwere again doing something by the post, their trembling hands impeding\none another. Pierre, breathing heavily, looked around as if asking what\nit meant. The same question was expressed in all the looks that met his.\n\nOn the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and officers\nwithout exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and conflict that\nwere in his own heart. \xe2\x80\x9cBut who, after all, is doing this? They are all\nsuffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?\xe2\x80\x9d flashed for an instant through\nhis mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSharpshooters of the 86th, forward!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted someone. The fifth\nprisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away\xe2\x80\x94alone. Pierre did not\nunderstand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been brought\nthere only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror, and no\nsense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place. The fifth man\nwas the factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment they laid hands on\nhim he sprang aside in terror and clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered\nand shook himself free.) The lad was unable to walk. They dragged him\nalong, holding him up under the arms, and he screamed. When they got\nhim to the post he grew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something.\nWhether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought\nit incredible that men should kill him, at any rate he took his stand at\nthe post, waiting to be blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded\nanimal looked around him with glittering eyes.\n\nPierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His curiosity\nand agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the highest pitch\nat this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he\nwrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other.\n\nWhen they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which\nhurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against the\nbloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in that\nposition, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back again\nmore comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss\nhis slightest movement.\n\nProbably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of\neight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards remember\nhaving heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw how the\nworkman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how blood showed\nitself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the weight of the\nhanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head hanging unnaturally\nand one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one hindered\nhim. Pale, frightened people were doing something around the workman.\nThe lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he\nuntied the ropes. The body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it awkwardly\nfrom the post and began pushing it into the pit.\n\nThey all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must\nhide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.\n\nPierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with\nhis knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other.\nThat shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively, but spadefuls\nof earth were already being thrown over the whole body. One of the\nsoldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and angrily at Pierre to\ngo back. But Pierre did not understand him and remained near the post,\nand no one drove him away.\n\nWhen the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was taken\nback to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the post\nmade a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. The twenty-four\nsharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the center of the\ncircle, ran back to their places as the companies passed by.\n\nPierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in\ncouples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies. This\none, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed back, and\nhis musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit at the spot\nfrom which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken man, taking some steps\nforward and back to save himself from falling. An old, noncommissioned\nofficer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to\nhis company. The crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse. They\nall went away silently and with drooping heads.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will teach them to start fires,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the Frenchmen.\n\nPierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who\nwas trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was not\nable to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he made a\nhopeless movement with his arm and went away.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAfter the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners\nand placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.\n\nToward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and\ntold him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for\nthe prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said to him, Pierre\ngot up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the upper end of the\nfield, where there were some sheds built of charred planks, beams,\nand battens, and led him into one of them. In the darkness some twenty\ndifferent men surrounded Pierre. He looked at them without understanding\nwho they were, why they were there, or what they wanted of him. He heard\nwhat they said, but did not understand the meaning of the words and\nmade no kind of deduction from or application of them. He replied to\nquestions they put to him, but did not consider who was listening to his\nreplies, nor how they would understand them. He looked at their faces\nand figures, but they all seemed to him equally meaningless.\n\nFrom the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by\nmen who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the mainspring of\nhis life, on which everything depended and which made everything appear\nalive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed\ninto a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not acknowledge it to\nhimself, his faith in the right ordering of the universe, in humanity,\nin his own soul, and in God, had been destroyed. He had experienced this\nbefore, but never so strongly as now. When similar doubts had assailed\nhim before, they had been the result of his own wrongdoing, and at the\nbottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from\nthose doubts was to be found within himself. But now he felt that\nthe universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins\nremained, and this not by any fault of his own. He felt that it was not\nin his power to regain faith in the meaning of life.\n\nAround him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something\nabout him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and\nasking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he\nfound himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and\ntalking on all sides.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, mates... that very prince who...\xe2\x80\x9d some voice at the other\nend of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word who.\n\nSitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall,\nPierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon as\nhe closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory\nlad\xe2\x80\x94especially dreadful because of its simplicity\xe2\x80\x94and the faces of the\nmurderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he opened\nhis eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him.\n\nBeside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he\nwas first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from\nhim every time he moved. This man was doing something to his legs in the\ndarkness, and though Pierre could not see his face he felt that the man\ncontinually glanced at him. On growing used to the darkness Pierre saw\nthat the man was taking off his leg bands, and the way he did it aroused\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\n\nHaving unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he carefully\ncoiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg, glancing up\nat Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the other was already\nunwinding the band on the second leg. In this way, having carefully\nremoved the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following\none another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs\nfixed above his head. Then he took out a knife, cut something, closed\nthe knife, placed it under the head of his bed, and, seating himself\ncomfortably, clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes\non Pierre. The latter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting,\nand well-rounded in these deft movements, in the man\xe2\x80\x99s well-ordered\narrangements in his corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at\nthe man without taking his eyes from him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d the little man suddenly said.\n\nAnd there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice\nthat Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt tears\nrising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time to betray\nhis confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant tones:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, lad, don\xe2\x80\x99t fret!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in the tender singsong caressing voice\nold Russian peasant women employ. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fret, friend\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98suffer an hour,\nlive for an age!\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is, my dear fellow. And here we live,\nthank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too, there are good\nmen as well as bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and still speaking, he turned on his knees\nwith a supple movement, got up, coughed, and went off to another part of\nthe shed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, you rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other\nend of the shed. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve come, you rascal? She remembers... Now, now,\nthat\xe2\x80\x99ll do!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at\nhim, returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something\nwrapped in a rag.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, eat a bit, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, resuming his former respectful tone as\nhe unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had soup for\ndinner and the potatoes are grand!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed\nextremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, are they all right?\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should\ndo like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into two\nequal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it from the\nrag, and handed it to Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe potatoes are grand!\xe2\x80\x9d he said once more. \xe2\x80\x9cEat some like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut why did they shoot those poor\nfellows? The last one was hardly twenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTss, tt...!\xe2\x80\x9d said the little man. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, what a sin... what a sin!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his\nmouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: \xe2\x80\x9cHow was it, sir, that you\nstayed in Moscow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nPierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and tried\nme as an incendiary.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere there\xe2\x80\x99s law there\xe2\x80\x99s injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d put in the little man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you been here long?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre asked as he munched the last of\nthe potato.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, are you a soldier then?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we are soldiers of the \xc3\x81psheron regiment. I was dying of fever. We\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t told anything. There were some twenty of us lying there. We had\nno idea, never guessed at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you feel sad here?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre inquired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can one help it, lad? My name is Plat\xc3\xb3n, and the surname is\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to\naddress him. \xe2\x80\x9cThey call me \xe2\x80\x98little falcon\xe2\x80\x99 in the regiment. How is one\nto help feeling sad? Moscow\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s the mother of cities. How can one see\nall this and not feel sad? But \xe2\x80\x98the maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies\nfirst\xe2\x80\x99; that\xe2\x80\x99s what the old folks used to tell us,\xe2\x80\x9d he added rapidly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? I?\xe2\x80\x9d said Karat\xc3\xa1ev. \xe2\x80\x9cI say things happen not as we plan but as God\njudges,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said\nbefore, and immediately continued:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have\nabundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still\nliving?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nAnd though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed\nsmile of kindliness puckered the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s lips as he put these\nquestions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that\nhe had no mother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there\xe2\x80\x99s none as\ndear as one\xe2\x80\x99s own mother!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and have you little ones?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nwent on asking.\n\nAgain Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s negative answer seemed to distress him, and he hastened\nto add:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind! You\xe2\x80\x99re young folks yet, and please God may still have some.\nThe great thing is to live in harmony....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same now,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre could not help saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Karat\xc3\xa1ev, \xe2\x80\x9cnever decline a prison or a\nbeggar\xe2\x80\x99s sack!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently preparing to\ntell a long story.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had\na well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and our\nhouse was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing\nthere were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so\nhappened...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Plat\xc3\xb3n Karat\xc3\xa1ev told a long story of how he had gone into someone\xe2\x80\x99s\ncopse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper, had been\ntried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, lad,\xe2\x80\x9d and a smile changed the tone of his voice, \xe2\x80\x9cwe thought it\nwas a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been for\nmy sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger\nbrother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife\nbehind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a\nsoldier. I come home on leave and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how it was, I look and\nsee that they are living better than before. The yard full of cattle,\nthe women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the\nyoungest, at home. Father, he says, \xe2\x80\x98All my children are the same to\nme: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if Plat\xc3\xb3n hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\nbeen shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to go.\xe2\x80\x99 called us\nall to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front of the icons.\n\xe2\x80\x98Michael,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98come here and bow down to his feet; and you, young\nwoman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also bow down before\nhim! Do you understand?\xe2\x80\x99 he says. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it is, dear fellow. Fate\nlooks for a head. But we are always judging, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s not well\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\nnot right!\xe2\x80\x99 Our luck is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and it\nbulges, but when you\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn it out it\xe2\x80\x99s empty! That\xe2\x80\x99s how it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Plat\xc3\xb3n shifted his seat on the straw.\n\nAfter a short silence he rose.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think you must be sleepy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and began rapidly crossing\nhimself and repeating:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus\nChrist, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, have\nmercy on us and save us!\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, then bowed to the ground, got\nup, sighed, and sat down again on his heap of straw. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way.\nLay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nmuttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat prayer was that you were saying?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Plat\xc3\xb3n, who had almost fallen asleep. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was I saying?\nI was praying. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what was that you said: Frola and Lavra?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Plat\xc3\xb3n quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe horses\xe2\x80\x99 saints. One must\npity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now you\xe2\x80\x99ve curled up and got warm,\nyou daughter of a bitch!\xe2\x80\x9d said Karat\xc3\xa1ev, touching the dog that lay at\nhis feet, and again turning over he fell asleep immediately.\n\nSounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance\noutside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but\ninside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep, but\nlay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular snoring\nof Plat\xc3\xb3n who lay beside him, and he felt that the world that had been\nshattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on\nnew and unshakable foundations.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTwenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were confined\nin the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he remained for\nfour weeks.\n\nWhen Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to\nhim except Plat\xc3\xb3n Karat\xc3\xa1ev, who always remained in his mind a most\nvivid and precious memory and the personification of everything Russian,\nkindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn\nthe first impression of him, as of something round, was fully confirmed:\nPlat\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s whole figure\xe2\x80\x94in a French overcoat girdled with a cord, a\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x99s cap, and bast shoes\xe2\x80\x94was round. His head was quite round, his\nback, chest, shoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever\nready to embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his\nlarge, gentle brown eyes were also round.\n\nPlat\xc3\xb3n Karat\xc3\xa1ev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of\ncampaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not himself\nknow his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his brilliantly\nwhite, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he\nlaughed\xe2\x80\x94as he often did\xe2\x80\x94were all sound and good, there was not a gray\nhair in his beard or on his head, and his whole body gave an impression\nof suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance.\n\nHis face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of\ninnocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief\npeculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It was\nevident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say,\nand consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an\nirresistible persuasiveness.\n\nHis physical strength and agility during the first days of his\nimprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and\nsickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cLord, lay me\ndown as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!\xe2\x80\x9d and every morning on getting\nup, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI lay down and curled up, I get up and shake myself.\xe2\x80\x9d And\nindeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he\nonly had to shake himself, to be ready without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s delay for some\nwork, just as children are ready to play directly they awake. He could\ndo everything, not very well but not badly. He baked, cooked, sewed,\nplaned, and mended boots. He was always busy, and only at night allowed\nhimself conversation\xe2\x80\x94of which he was fond\xe2\x80\x94and songs. He did not sing\nlike a trained singer who knows he is listened to, but like the birds,\nevidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches\noneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were\nalways high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his\nface at such times was very serious.\n\nHaving been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he seemed to\nhave thrown off all that had been forced upon him\xe2\x80\x94everything military\nand alien to himself\xe2\x80\x94and had returned to his former peasant habits.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA soldier on leave\xe2\x80\x94a shirt outside breeches,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say.\n\nHe did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did not\ncomplain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during\nthe whole of his army service. When he related anything it was generally\nsome old and evidently precious memory of his \xe2\x80\x9cChristian\xe2\x80\x9d life, as he\ncalled his peasant existence. The proverbs, of which his talk was full,\nwere for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers\nemploy, but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so\ninsignificant, but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance\nof profound wisdom.\n\nHe would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous\noccasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he talked well,\nadorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which\nPierre thought he invented himself, but the chief charm of his talk lay\nin the fact that the commonest events\xe2\x80\x94sometimes just such as Pierre\nhad witnessed without taking notice of them\xe2\x80\x94assumed in Karat\xc3\xa1ev\xe2\x80\x99s a\ncharacter of solemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales one of the\nsoldiers used to tell of an evening (they were always the same), but\nmost of all he liked to hear stories of real life. He would smile\njoyfully when listening to such stories, now and then putting in a word\nor asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear\nto himself. Karat\xc3\xa1ev had no attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre\nunderstood them, but loved and lived affectionately with everything life\nbrought him in contact with, particularly with man\xe2\x80\x94not any particular\nman, but those with whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his\ncomrades, the French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt\nthat in spite of Karat\xc3\xa1ev\xe2\x80\x99s affectionate tenderness for him (by which\nhe unconsciously gave Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s spiritual life its due) he would not have\ngrieved for a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in\nthe same way toward Karat\xc3\xa1ev.\n\nTo all the other prisoners Plat\xc3\xb3n Karat\xc3\xa1ev seemed a most ordinary\nsoldier. They called him \xe2\x80\x9clittle falcon\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPlat\xc3\xb3sha,\xe2\x80\x9d chaffed him\ngood-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always\nremained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable, rounded,\neternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth.\n\nPlat\xc3\xb3n Karat\xc3\xa1ev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he began\nto speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.\n\nSometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask him to\nrepeat them, but Plat\xc3\xb3n could never recall what he had said a moment\nbefore, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of his\nfavorite song: native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in\nit, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning could be got out of it. He\ndid not, and could not, understand the meaning of words apart from\ntheir context. Every word and action of his was the manifestation of\nan activity unknown to him, which was his life. But his life, as he\nregarded it, had no meaning as a separate thing. It had meaning only as\npart of a whole of which he was always conscious. His words and actions\nflowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance\nexhales from a flower. He could not understand the value or significance\nof any word or deed taken separately.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nWhen Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs at Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl she at once prepared to go there, in spite of her\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to dissuade her\xe2\x80\x94and not merely to go herself but to take\nher nephew with her. Whether it were difficult or easy, possible or\nimpossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it was her duty,\nnot only to herself, to be near her brother who was perhaps dying, but\nto do everything possible to take his son to him, and so she prepared\nto set off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew himself, Princess\nMary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the\nlong journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son.\n\nIn a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were the\nhuge family coach in which she had traveled to Vor\xc3\xb3nezh, a semiopen\ntrap, and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nlittle Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, T\xc3\xadkhon, and a\nyoung footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her.\n\nThe usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the\nroundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through L\xc3\xadpetsk,\nRyaz\xc3\xa1n, Vlad\xc3\xadmir, and Sh\xc3\xbaya was very long and, as post horses were not\neverywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near Ryaz\xc3\xa1n where the French\nwere said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.\n\nDuring this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and\nPrincess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of\nspirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and\nno difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy, which\ninfected her fellow travelers, they approached Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl by the end of\nthe second week.\n\nThe last days of her stay in Vor\xc3\xb3nezh had been the happiest of her life.\nHer love for Rost\xc3\xb3v no longer tormented or agitated her. It filled her\nwhole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she no longer\nstruggled against it. Latterly she had become convinced that she loved\nand was beloved, though she never said this definitely to herself\nin words. She had become convinced of it at her last interview with\nNicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs. Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the fact that\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s relations with Nat\xc3\xa1sha might, if he recovered, be\nrenewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of\nthis.\n\nYet in spite of that, his relation to her\xe2\x80\x94considerate, delicate, and\nloving\xe2\x80\x94not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to Princess\nMary that he was even glad that the family connection between them\nallowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew that she\nloved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was\nbeloved, and was happy in regard to it.\n\nBut this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent\nher feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that\nspiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her\nto give full play to her feeling for her brother. That feeling was so\nstrong at the moment of leaving Vor\xc3\xb3nezh that those who saw her off, as\nthey looked at her careworn, despairing face, felt sure she would fall\nill on the journey. But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the\njourney, which she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from\nher grief and gave her strength.\n\nAs always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of the\njourney itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl\nthe thought of what might await her there\xe2\x80\x94not after many days, but that\nvery evening\xe2\x80\x94again presented itself to her and her agitation increased\nto its utmost limit.\n\nThe courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the\nRost\xc3\xb3vs were staying in Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl, and in what condition Prince Andrew\nwas, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled\nby the terrible pallor of the princess\xe2\x80\x99 face that looked out at him from\nthe window.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found out everything, your excellency: the Rost\xc3\xb3vs are staying\nat the merchant Br\xc3\xb3nnikov\xe2\x80\x99s house, in the Square not far from here,\nright above the V\xc3\xb3lga,\xe2\x80\x9d said the courier.\n\nPrincess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding\nwhy he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her\nbrother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is the prince?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis excellency is staying in the same house with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he is alive,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice:\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servants say he is still the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhat \xe2\x80\x9cstill the same\xe2\x80\x9d might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with an\nunnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting in\nfront of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head\nand did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and\nswaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps clattered as they were let\ndown.\n\nThe carriage door was opened. On the left there was water\xe2\x80\x94a great\nriver\xe2\x80\x94and on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance:\nservants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as\nit seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This was\nS\xc3\xb3nya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. \xe2\x80\x9cThis way, this way!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ngirl, with the same artificial smile, and the princess found herself in\nthe hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came rapidly to\nmeet her with a look of emotion. This was the countess. She embraced\nPrincess Mary and kissed her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMon enfant!\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cje vous aime et vous connais depuis\nlongtemps.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cMy child! I love you and have known you a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nDespite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the\ncountess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly\nknowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in\nFrench in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and\nasked: \xe2\x80\x9cHow is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor says that he is not in danger,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, but as\nshe spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed a\ncontradiction of her words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he? Can I see him\xe2\x80\x94can I?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the princess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\ncountess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with Dessalles.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh, what a\nlovely boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where S\xc3\xb3nya was\ntalking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the boy, and\nthe old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had changed very\nmuch since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had been a brisk,\ncheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered\nperson. While talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as\nif asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing. After the\ndestruction of Moscow and of his property, thrown out of his accustomed\ngroove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to\nfeel that there was no longer a place for him in life.\n\nIn spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible, and\nher vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they\nshould be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew,\nthe princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the\nnecessity of submitting, for a time, to this new order of things which\nshe had entered. She knew it to be necessary, and though it was hard for\nher she was not vexed with these people.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my niece,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count, introducing S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know\nher, Princess?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary turned to S\xc3\xb3nya and, trying to stifle the hostile\nfeeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt\noppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far\nfrom what was in her own heart.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked again, addressing them all.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is downstairs. Nat\xc3\xa1sha is with him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered S\xc3\xb3nya, flushing. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nhave sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. She turned\naway and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him, when\nlight, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door.\nThe princess looked round and saw Nat\xc3\xa1sha coming in, almost running\xe2\x80\x94that\nNat\xc3\xa1sha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in Moscow long\nsince.\n\nBut hardly had the princess looked at Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face before she realized\nthat here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a friend.\nShe ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her shoulder.\n\nAs soon as Nat\xc3\xa1sha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s bed, heard\nof Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, she softly left his room and hastened to her\nwith those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to Princess Mary.\n\nThere was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the\ndrawing room\xe2\x80\x94that of love\xe2\x80\x94boundless love for him, for her, and for all\nthat was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for others,\nand passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them. It was\nplain that at that moment there was in Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s heart no thought of\nherself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.\n\nPrincess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at the\nfirst glance at Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face, and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful\npleasure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come to him, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, leading her into the other\nroom.\n\nPrincess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\nShe felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn\neverything.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow...\xe2\x80\x9d she began her question but stopped short.\n\nShe felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and\nprofoundly.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say\nall she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes\nwhich penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was impossible\nnot to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly, Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s lips\ntwitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and covering her face\nwith her hands she burst into sobs.\n\nPrincess Mary understood.\n\nBut she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how is his wound? What is his general condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, you... will see,\xe2\x80\x9d was all Nat\xc3\xa1sha could say.\n\nThey sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off\ncrying and were able to go to him with calm faces.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse? When\ndid this happen?\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary inquired.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish\ncondition and the pain he suffered, but at Tr\xc3\xb3itsa that had passed\nand the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger had also\npassed. When they reached Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl the wound had begun to fester\n(Nat\xc3\xa1sha knew all about such things as festering) and the doctor had\nsaid that the festering might take a normal course. Then fever set in,\nbut the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut two days ago this suddenly happened,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, struggling with\nher sobs. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but you will see what he is like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he weaker? Thinner?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the princess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too good, he\ncannot, cannot live, because...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nWhen Nat\xc3\xa1sha opened Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s door with a familiar movement and\nlet Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt the\nsobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now\ntried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at\nhim without tears.\n\nThe princess understood what Nat\xc3\xa1sha had meant by the words: \xe2\x80\x9ctwo days\nago this suddenly happened.\xe2\x80\x9d She understood those words to mean that he\nhad suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs\nof approaching death. As she stepped to the door she already saw in\nimagination Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle,\nmild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore\naffected her very strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, tender\nwords to her such as her father had uttered before his death, and\nthat she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his\npresence. Yet sooner or later it had to be, and she went in. The sobs\nrose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly\ndistinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his\nfeatures, and then she saw his face and met his gaze.\n\nHe was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by\npillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white hand\nhe held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate\nmustache he had grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them\nas they entered.\n\nOn seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s pace suddenly\nslackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She suddenly\nfelt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and\neyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in what am I to blame?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked herself. And his cold, stern look\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are alive and thinking of the living, while I...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there\nwas an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and\nNat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nHe kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a voice\nas calm and aloof as his look.\n\nHad he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such horror\ninto Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s heart as the tone of his voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you brought little Nicholas?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in the same slow, quiet\nmanner and with an obvious effort to remember.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she was\nsaying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, my dear, you must ask the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, and again making\nan evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips only (his\nwords clearly did not correspond to his thoughts):\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerci, ch\xc3\xa8re amie, d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre venue.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for coming, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nPrincess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just\nperceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She now\nunderstood what had happened to him two days before. In his words, his\ntone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look could be\nfelt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world, terrible\nin one who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he understand\nanything living; but it was obvious that he failed to understand, not\nbecause he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something\nelse\xe2\x80\x94something the living did not and could not understand\xe2\x80\x94and which\nwholly occupied his mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\nbreaking the silence and pointing to Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cShe looks after me all\nthe time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a\nthing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say that,\nbefore her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to live he\ncould not have said those words in that offensively cold tone. If he had\nnot known that he was dying, how could he have failed to pity her and\nhow could he speak like that in her presence? The only explanation was\nthat he was indifferent, because something else, much more important,\nhad been revealed to him.\n\nThe conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary came by way of Ryaz\xc3\xa1n,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nPrince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, and only\nafter calling her so in his presence did Nat\xc3\xa1sha notice it herself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey told her that all Moscow has been burned down, and that...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was\nmaking an effort to listen, but could not do so.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they say it\xe2\x80\x99s burned,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great pity,\xe2\x80\x9d and he gazed\nstraight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his fingers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?\xe2\x80\x9d Prince Andrew suddenly said,\nevidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wrote here that he\ntook a great liking to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on simply and calmly, evidently\nunable to understand all the complex significance his words had for\nliving people. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you\nto get married,\xe2\x80\x9d he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having\nfound words he had long been seeking.\n\nPrincess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her, except as\na proof of how far away he now was from everything living.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy talk of me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said quietly and glanced at Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were again\nsilent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew, would you like...\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cwould you like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking\nabout you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but\nPrincess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he did\nnot smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with quiet, gentle\nirony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last\nmeans of arousing him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s room he looked at\nhis father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else\nwas crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to\nsay to him.\n\nWhen Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to her\nbrother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer began\nto cry.\n\nHe looked at her attentively.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it about Nicholas?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nPrincess Mary nodded her head, weeping.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, you know the Gosp...\xe2\x80\x9d but he broke off.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t cry here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking at her with the same\ncold expression.\n\n\nWhen Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying at\nthe thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father. With\na great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their\npoint of view.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to them it must seem sad!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how simple it is.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father\nfeedeth them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself and wished to say to Princess Mary;\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut no, they will take it their own way, they won\xe2\x80\x99t understand! They\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t understand that all those feelings they prize so\xe2\x80\x94all our feelings,\nall those ideas that seem so important to us, are unnecessary. We cannot\nunderstand one another,\xe2\x80\x9d and he remained silent.\n\n\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and knew\nnothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining knowledge,\nobservation, and experience, but had he possessed all the faculties he\nafterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or more profound\nunderstanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between\nhis father, Mary, and Nat\xc3\xa1sha, than he had then. He understood it\ncompletely, and, leaving the room without crying, went silently up\nto Nat\xc3\xa1sha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his\nbeautiful, thoughtful eyes, then his uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled\nand leaning his head against her he began to cry.\n\nAfter that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him and\neither sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to Nat\xc3\xa1sha of whom\nhe seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and clung to them quietly and\nshyly.\n\nWhen Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face had told her. She did not speak any more to Nat\xc3\xa1sha of\nhopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside his sofa, and\ndid not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in soul to that\nEternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above the dying man was now so\nevident.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nNot only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt that he was\ndying and was already half dead. He was conscious of an aloofness from\neverything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence.\nWithout haste or agitation he awaited what was coming. That inexorable,\neternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which he had felt\ncontinually all his life\xe2\x80\x94was now near to him and, by the strange\nlightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and palpable....\n\n\nFormerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that terribly\ntormenting fear of death\xe2\x80\x94the end\xe2\x80\x94but now he no longer understood that\nfear.\n\nHe had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before\nhim, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky, and\nknew that he was face to face with death. When he came to himself after\nbeing wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love had instantly\nunfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that\nhad restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased to think about\nit.\n\nDuring the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he\nspent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new\nprinciple of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously\ndetached himself from earthly life. To love everything and everybody and\nalways to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone, not\nto live this earthly life. And the more imbued he became with that\nprinciple of love, the more he renounced life and the more completely he\ndestroyed that dreadful barrier which\xe2\x80\x94in the absence of such love\xe2\x80\x94stands\nbetween life and death. When during those first days he remembered that\nhe would have to die, he said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of it? So much the\nbetter!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut after the night in Myt\xc3\xadshchi when, half delirious, he had seen her\nfor whom he longed appear before him and, having pressed her hand to his\nlips, had shed gentle, happy tears, love for a particular woman again\ncrept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life. And\njoyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind. Recalling the\nmoment at the ambulance station when he had seen Kur\xc3\xa1gin, he could not\nnow regain the feeling he then had, but was tormented by the question\nwhether Kur\xc3\xa1gin was alive. And he dared not inquire.\n\nHis illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nreferred to when she said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis suddenly happened,\xe2\x80\x9d had occurred two\ndays before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual struggle\nbetween life and death, in which death gained the victory. It was\nthe unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as\npresented to him in the form of his love for Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and a last, though\nultimately vanquished, attack of terror before the unknown.\n\nIt was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish, and his\nthoughts were preternaturally clear. S\xc3\xb3nya was sitting by the table. He\nbegan to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, she has come!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\nAnd so it was: in S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s place sat Nat\xc3\xa1sha who had just come in\nnoiselessly.\n\nSince she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced this\nphysical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an armchair\nplaced sideways, screening the light of the candle from him, and was\nknitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings since Prince\nAndrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old\nnurses who knit stockings, and that there is something soothing in\nthe knitting of stockings. The needles clicked lightly in her slender,\nrapidly moving hands, and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile\nof her drooping face. She moved, and the ball rolled off her knees. She\nstarted, glanced round at him, and screening the candle with her hand\nstooped carefully with a supple and exact movement, picked up the ball,\nand regained her former position.\n\nHe looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a\ndeep breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed\ncautiously.\n\nAt the Tr\xc3\xb3itsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had told\nher that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound which had\nbrought them together again, but after that they never spoke of the\nfuture.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it or can it not be?\xe2\x80\x9d he now thought as he looked at her and\nlistened to the light click of the steel needles. \xe2\x80\x9cCan fate have brought\nme to her so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible that the\ntruth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent\nmy life in falsity? I love her more than anything in the world! But what\nam I to do if I love her?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and he involuntarily groaned,\nfrom a habit acquired during his sufferings.\n\nOn hearing that sound Nat\xc3\xa1sha put down the stocking, leaned nearer to\nhim, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to him\nand bent over him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in. No one\nelse gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do... that light.\nI want to weep for joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94She turned away for an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy too much?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your soul, your\nwhole soul\xe2\x80\x94shall I live? What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it, sure!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha almost shouted, taking hold of both his\nhands with a passionate movement.\n\nHe remained silent awhile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow good it would be!\xe2\x80\x9d and taking her hand he kissed it.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this would\nnot do and that he had to be quiet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have not slept,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, repressing her joy. \xe2\x80\x9cTry to sleep...\nplease!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle and\nsat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked at\nhim, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on her\nstocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.\n\nSoon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep long and\nsuddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.\n\nAs he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now\nalways occupied his mind\xe2\x80\x94about life and death, and chiefly about death.\nHe felt himself nearer to it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove? What is love?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I\nunderstand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only\nbecause I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to\ndie means that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and\neternal source.\xe2\x80\x9d These thoughts seemed to him comforting. But they were\nonly thoughts. Something was lacking in them, they were not clear, they\nwere too one-sidedly personal and brain-spun. And there was the former\nagitation and obscurity. He fell asleep.\n\nHe dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but that\nhe was quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and\ninsignificant people appeared before him. He talked to them and\ndiscussed something trivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere.\nPrince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had\nmore important cares, but he continued to speak, surprising them by\nempty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to\ndisappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded\nall else. He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. Everything\ndepended on whether he was, or was not, in time to lock it. He went, and\ntried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be\nin time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers. He\nwas seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was the fear of death. It\nstood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward\nthe door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing\nagainst it and forcing its way in. Something not human\xe2\x80\x94death\xe2\x80\x94was\nbreaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the\ndoor, making a final effort to hold it back\xe2\x80\x94to lock it was no longer\npossible\xe2\x80\x94but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from\nbehind by that terror, opened and closed again.\n\nOnce again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain\nand both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was\ndeath, and Prince Andrew died.\n\nBut at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep,\nand at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was death! I died\xe2\x80\x94and woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!\xe2\x80\x9d And\nall at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then\nconcealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision. He felt as\nif powers till then confined within him had been liberated, and that\nstrange lightness did not again leave him.\n\nWhen, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, Nat\xc3\xa1sha went\nup and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer and looked at\nher strangely, not understanding.\n\nThat was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\narrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting fever\nassumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did not interest\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more\nconvincing.\n\nFrom that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together with\nhis awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration of life it did\nnot seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the\nduration of a dream.\n\nThere was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow\nawakening.\n\nHis last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both\nPrincess Mary and Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who did not leave him, felt this. They did\nnot weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt\nthat they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he had left\nthem) but on what reminded them most closely of him\xe2\x80\x94his body. Both felt\nthis so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not\naffect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief.\nNeither in his presence nor out of it did they weep, nor did they ever\ntalk to one another about him. They felt that they could not express in\nwords what they understood.\n\nThey both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and deeper,\naway from them, and they both knew that this had to be so and that it\nwas right.\n\nHe confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of\nhim. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\nand turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and\nNat\xc3\xa1sha understood that) but simply because he thought it was all that\nwas required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy, he did\nwhat was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was\nanything else he should do.\n\nWhen the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving,\noccurred, Princess Mary and Nat\xc3\xa1sha were present.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it over?\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes\nlain motionless, growing cold before them. Nat\xc3\xa1sha went up, looked at\nthe dead eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but did not\nkiss them, but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him\xe2\x80\x94his\nbody.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere has he gone? Where is he now?...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table,\neveryone came to take leave of him and they all wept.\n\nLittle Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity.\nThe countess and S\xc3\xb3nya cried from pity for Nat\xc3\xa1sha and because he was\nno more. The old count cried because he felt that before long, he, too,\nmust take the same terrible step.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their own\npersonal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which\nhad taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the\nsimple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their\npresence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN: 1812\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nMan\xe2\x80\x99s mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness, but\nthe desire to find those causes is implanted in man\xe2\x80\x99s soul. And without\nconsidering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one\nof which taken separately may seem to be the cause, he snatches at the\nfirst approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the cause!\xe2\x80\x9d In historical events (where the actions of men are\nthe subject of observation) the first and most primitive approximation\nto present itself was the will of the gods and, after that, the will of\nthose who stood in the most prominent position\xe2\x80\x94the heroes of history.\nBut we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event\xe2\x80\x94which\nlies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it\xe2\x80\x94to\nbe convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the\nactions of the mass but is itself continually controlled. It may seem\nto be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of\nhistorical events this way or that; yet there is the same difference\nbetween a man who says that the people of the West moved on the East\nbecause Napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because\nit had to happen, as there is between those who declared that the\nearth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who\nadmitted that they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there\nwere laws directing its movement and that of the other planets. There\nis, and can be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause of\nall causes. But there are laws directing events, and some of these laws\nare known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend.\nThe discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite\nabandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man,\njust as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was\npossible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the\nearth.\n\nThe historians consider that, next to the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 and the\noccupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, the most\nimportant episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the Russian\narmy from the Ryaz\xc3\xa1na to the Kal\xc3\xbaga road and to the Tar\xc3\xbatino camp\xe2\x80\x94the\nso-called flank march across the Kr\xc3\xa1snaya Pakhr\xc3\xa1 River. They ascribe the\nglory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to\nwhom the honor is due. Even foreign historians, including the French,\nacknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders when they speak of\nthat flank march. But it is hard to understand why military writers,\nand following them others, consider this flank march to be the profound\nconception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon. In\nthe first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius\nof this movement lay, for not much mental effort was needed to see that\nthe best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where\nthere are most provisions; and even a dull boy of thirteen could have\nguessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from Moscow\nin 1812 was on the Kal\xc3\xbaga road. So it is impossible to understand by\nwhat reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver\nwas a profound one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why\nthey think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and destroy\nthe French; for this flank march, had it been preceded, accompanied,\nor followed by other circumstances, might have proved ruinous to the\nRussians and salutary for the French. If the position of the Russian\narmy really began to improve from the time of that march, it does not at\nall follow that the march was the cause of it.\n\nThat flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to\nthe Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its\ndestruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If\nMurat had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained\ninactive? If the Russian army at Kr\xc3\xa1snaya Pakhr\xc3\xa1 had given battle as\nBennigsen and Barclay advised? What would have happened had the French\nattacked the Russians while they were marching beyond the Pakhr\xc3\xa1? What\nwould have happened if on approaching Tar\xc3\xbatino, Napoleon had attacked\nthe Russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he\nattacked them at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk? What would have happened had the French moved\non Petersburg?... In any of these eventualities the flank march that\nbrought salvation might have proved disastrous.\n\nThe third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying\nhistory deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be\nattributed to any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in\nreality, like the retreat from Fil\xc3\xad, it did not suggest itself to anyone\nin its entirety, but resulted\xe2\x80\x94moment by moment, step by step, event by\nevent\xe2\x80\x94from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only\nseen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the\npast.\n\nAt the council at Fil\xc3\xad the prevailing thought in the minds of the\nRussian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a\ndirect retreat by the N\xc3\xadzhni road. In proof of this there is the fact\nthat the majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and above\nall there is the well-known conversation after the council, between the\ncommander in chief and Lansk\xc3\xb3y, who was in charge of the commissariat\ndepartment. Lansk\xc3\xb3y informed the commander in chief that the army\nsupplies were for the most part stored along the Ok\xc3\xa1 in the T\xc3\xbala and\nRyaz\xc3\xa1n provinces, and that if they retreated on N\xc3\xadzhni the army would\nbe separated from its supplies by the broad river Ok\xc3\xa1, which cannot be\ncrossed early in winter. This was the first indication of the necessity\nof deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course\xe2\x80\x94a\ndirect retreat on N\xc3\xadzhni-N\xc3\xb3vgorod. The army turned more to the south,\nalong the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n road and nearer to its supplies. Subsequently the\ninactivity of the French (who even lost sight of the Russian army),\nconcern for the safety of the arsenal at T\xc3\xbala, and especially the\nadvantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn\nstill further south to the T\xc3\xbala road. Having crossed over, by a forced\nmarch, to the T\xc3\xbala road beyond the Pakhr\xc3\xa1, the Russian commanders\nintended to remain at Pod\xc3\xb3lsk and had no thought of the Tar\xc3\xbatino\nposition; but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of French\ntroops who had for a time lost touch with the Russians, and projects\nof giving battle, and above all the abundance of provisions in Kal\xc3\xbaga\nprovince, obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross\nfrom the T\xc3\xbala to the Kal\xc3\xbaga road and go to Tar\xc3\xbatino, which was between\nthe roads along which those supplies lay. Just as it is impossible to\nsay when it was decided to abandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say\nprecisely when, or by whom, it was decided to move to Tar\xc3\xbatino. Only\nwhen the army had got there, as the result of innumerable and varying\nforces, did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this\nmovement and long ago foreseen its result.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance\nof the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually\nretreating straight back from the invaders, deviated from that direct\ncourse and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn toward the\ndistrict where supplies were abundant.\n\nIf instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the\nRussian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could not\nhave done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow, describing\nan arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where\nthe country was richest.\n\nThat movement from the N\xc3\xadzhni to the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n, T\xc3\xbala, and Kal\xc3\xbaga roads was\nso natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction, and\ndemands were sent from Petersburg for Kut\xc3\xbazov to take his army that\nway. At Tar\xc3\xbatino Kut\xc3\xbazov received what was almost a reprimand from\nthe Emperor for having moved his army along the Ryaz\xc3\xa1n road, and the\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s letter indicated to him the very position he had already\noccupied near Kal\xc3\xbaga.\n\nHaving rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the\nwhole campaign and by the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, the Russian army\xe2\x80\x94when\nthe strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was\nreceived\xe2\x80\x94assumed the position natural to it.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as it is\ncalled, but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of\nwhat had happened. He alone then understood the meaning of the French\narmy\xe2\x80\x99s inactivity, he alone continued to assert that the battle of\nBorodin\xc3\xb3 had been a victory, he alone\xe2\x80\x94who as commander in chief might\nhave been expected to be eager to attack\xe2\x80\x94employed his whole strength to\nrestrain the Russian army from useless engagements.\n\nThe beast wounded at Borodin\xc3\xb3 was lying where the fleeing hunter had\nleft him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and\nmerely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was heard\nto moan.\n\nThe moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed its\ncalamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s camp with\novertures for peace.\n\nNapoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was\nright, wrote to Kut\xc3\xbazov the first words that occurred to him, though\nthey were meaningless.\n\n\nMONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my adjutants-general\nto discuss several interesting questions with you. I beg your Highness\nto credit what he says to you, especially when he expresses the\nsentiment of esteem and special regard I have long entertained for your\nperson. This letter having no other object, I pray God, monsieur le\nprince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and gracious protection!\n\nNAPOLEON\n\nMOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812\n\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as\nthe initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present spirit\nof my nation.\xe2\x80\x9d But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his\ntroops from attacking.\n\nDuring the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and\nthe Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tar\xc3\xbatino, a change had taken\nplace in the relative strength of the two armies\xe2\x80\x94both in spirit and in\nnumber\xe2\x80\x94as a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian\nside. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown\nto the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking\nat once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauriston\xe2\x80\x99s\nmission; the abundance of provisions at Tar\xc3\xbatino; the reports coming in\nfrom all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of\nrecruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian\nsoldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been\nassembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been\nresting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of,\nwas doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to\nthe French stationed at Tar\xc3\xbatino; the news of easy successes gained by\npeasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this;\nthe desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as\nthe French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x99s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and\nthat the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial change\nin the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable. And at\nonce, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand\nhas completed a full circle, this change was shown by an increased\nactivity, whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe Russian army was commanded by Kut\xc3\xbazov and his staff, and also by the\nEmperor from Petersburg. Before the news of the abandonment of Moscow\nhad been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole campaign\nhad been drawn up and sent to Kut\xc3\xbazov for his guidance. Though this plan\nhad been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was still in our hands,\nit was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action.\nKut\xc3\xbazov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always\ndifficult to execute. So fresh instructions were sent for the solution\nof difficulties that might be encountered, as well as fresh people who\nwere to watch Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s actions and report upon them.\n\nBesides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized.\nThe posts left vacant by Bagrati\xc3\xb3n, who had been killed, and by\nBarclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be filled. Very serious\nconsideration was given to the question whether it would be better to\nput A in B\xe2\x80\x99s place and B in D\xe2\x80\x99s, or on the contrary to put D in A\xe2\x80\x99s\nplace, and so on\xe2\x80\x94as if anything more than A\xe2\x80\x99s or B\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction\ndepended on this.\n\nAs a result of the hostility between Kut\xc3\xbazov and Bennigsen, his Chief of\nStaff, the presence of confidential representatives of the Emperor, and\nthese transfers, a more than usually complicated play of parties\nwas going on among the staff of the army. A was undermining B, D was\nundermining C, and so on in all possible combinations and permutations.\nIn all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct\nof the war, which all these men believed they were directing; but this\naffair of the war went on independently of them, as it had to go:\nthat is, never in the way people devised, but flowing always from the\nessential attitude of the masses. Only in the highest spheres did\nall these schemes, crossings, and interminglings appear to be a true\nreflection of what had to happen.\n\n\nPrince Michael Ilari\xc3\xb3novich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of October\nin a letter that reached Kut\xc3\xbazov after the battle at Tar\xc3\xbatino) Since\nSeptember 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last reports\nwere written on the twentieth, and during all this time not only has\nno action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient\ncapital, but according to your last report you have even retreated\nfarther. S\xc3\xa9rpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and T\xc3\xbala\nwith its famous arsenal, so indispensable to the army, is in danger.\nFrom General Wintzingerode\xe2\x80\x99s reports, I see that an enemy corps of ten\nthousand men is moving on the Petersburg road. Another corps of several\nthousand men is moving on Dm\xc3\xadtrov. A third has advanced along the\nVlad\xc3\xadmir road, and a fourth, rather considerable detachment is stationed\nbetween R\xc3\xbaza and Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as\nthe twenty-fifth. In view of all this information, when the enemy has\nscattered his forces in large detachments, and with Napoleon and his\nGuards in Moscow, is it possible that the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s forces confronting you\nare so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive? On the\ncontrary, he is probably pursuing you with detachments, or at most with\nan army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you. It would seem\nthat, availing yourself of these circumstances, you might advantageously\nattack a weaker one and annihilate him, or at least oblige him to\nretreat, retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now\noccupied by the enemy, and thereby averting danger from T\xc3\xbala and other\ntowns in the interior. You will be responsible if the enemy is able to\ndirect a force of any size against Petersburg to threaten this capital\nin which it has not been possible to retain many troops; for with the\narmy entrusted to you, and acting with resolution and energy, you have\nample means to avert this fresh calamity. Remember that you have still\nto answer to our offended country for the loss of Moscow. You have\nexperienced my readiness to reward you. That readiness will not weaken\nin me, but I and Russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal,\nfirmness, and success which your intellect, military talent, and the\ncourage of the troops you command justify us in expecting.\n\n\nBut by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation of\nthe forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched,\nKut\xc3\xbazov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he\ncommanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.\n\nOn the second of October a Cossack, Shapov\xc3\xa1lov, who was out scouting,\nkilled one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded hare he made\nhis way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of Murat\xe2\x80\x99s\narmy, encamped there without any precautions. The Cossack laughingly\ntold his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the French.\nA cornet, hearing the story, informed his commander.\n\nThe Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers wished\nto take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, but one of\nthe superior officers, who was acquainted with the higher authorities,\nreported the incident to a general on the staff. The state of things on\nthe staff had of late been exceedingly strained. Erm\xc3\xb3lov had been to\nsee Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use\nhis influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the\noffensive.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I did not know you I should think you did not want what you are\nasking for. I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure to do\nthe opposite,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Bennigsen.\n\nThe Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out, was\nthe final proof that events had matured. The tightly coiled spring was\nreleased, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play. Despite all\nhis supposed power, his intellect, his experience, and his knowledge\nof men, Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x94having taken into consideration the Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s report, a\nnote from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to the Emperor, the wishes\nhe supposed the Emperor to hold, and the fact that all the generals\nexpressed the same wish\xe2\x80\x94could no longer check the inevitable movement,\nand gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful\xe2\x80\x94gave\nhis approval, that is, to the accomplished fact.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBennigsen\xe2\x80\x99s note and the Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s information that the left flank\nof the French was unguarded were merely final indications that it was\nnecessary to order an attack, and it was fixed for the fifth of October.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth of October Kut\xc3\xbazov signed the dispositions.\nToll read them to Erm\xc3\xb3lov, asking him to attend to the further\narrangements.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right\xe2\x80\x94all right. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t time just now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Erm\xc3\xb3lov, and\nleft the hut.\n\nThe dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the Austerlitz\ndispositions, it was written\xe2\x80\x94though not in German this time:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe First Column will march here and here,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe Second Column will\nmarch there and there,\xe2\x80\x9d and so on; and on paper, all these columns\narrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy.\nEverything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions,\nand as is always the case, not a single column reached its place at the\nappointed time.\n\nWhen the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been\nprepared, an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to Erm\xc3\xb3lov\nto deal with. A young officer of the Horse Guards, Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s orderly,\npleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him, went to\nErm\xc3\xb3lov\xe2\x80\x99s quarters.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Erm\xc3\xb3lov\xe2\x80\x99s orderly.\n\nThe officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom Erm\xc3\xb3lov was\noften to be found.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, and the general\xe2\x80\x99s out too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s gone out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf only they don\xe2\x80\x99t make me responsible for this delay! What a nuisance\nit is!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the officer, and he rode round the whole camp. One man\nsaid he had seen Erm\xc3\xb3lov ride past with some other generals, others said\nhe must have returned home. The officer searched till six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\nevening without even stopping to eat. Erm\xc3\xb3lov was nowhere to be found\nand no one knew where he was. The officer snatched a little food at\na comrade\xe2\x80\x99s, and rode again to the vanguard to find Milor\xc3\xa1dovich.\nMilor\xc3\xa1dovich too was away, but here he was told that he had gone to a\nball at General K\xc3\xadkin\xe2\x80\x99s and that Erm\xc3\xb3lov was probably there too.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there, over at \xc3\x89chkino,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Cossack officer, pointing to a\ncountry house in the far distance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, outside our line?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve put two regiments as outposts, and they\xe2\x80\x99re having such a spree\nthere, it\xe2\x80\x99s awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officer rode out beyond our lines to \xc3\x89chkino. While still at a\ndistance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s dance song\nproceeding from the house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meadows... in the meadows!\xe2\x80\x9d he heard, accompanied by whistling\nand the sound of a torban, drowned every now and then by shouts. These\nsounds made his spirits rise, but at the same time he was afraid that\nhe would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order\nentrusted to him. It was already past eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He dismounted\nand went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained\nintact between the Russian and French forces. In the refreshment room\nand the hall, footmen were bustling about with wine and viands. Groups\nof singers stood outside the windows. The officer was admitted and\nimmediately saw all the chief generals of the army together, and among\nthem Erm\xc3\xb3lov\xe2\x80\x99s big imposing figure. They all had their coats unbuttoned\nand were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces,\nlaughing loudly. In the middle of the room a short handsome general with\na red face was dancing the trep\xc3\xa1k with much spirit and agility.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1nych! Ha, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment\nhe was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait; but one of\nthe generals espied him and, hearing what he had come about, informed\nErm\xc3\xb3lov.\n\nErm\xc3\xb3lov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what the\nofficer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think he went off just by chance?\xe2\x80\x9d said a comrade, who was on the\nstaff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to\nErm\xc3\xb3lov. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a trick. It was done on purpose to get Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn into\ntrouble. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see what a mess there\xe2\x80\x99ll be tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNext day the decrepit Kut\xc3\xbazov, having given orders to be called early,\nsaid his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness of\nhaving to direct a battle he did not approve of, got into his cal\xc3\xa8che\nand drove from Letash\xc3\xb3vka (a village three and a half miles from\nTar\xc3\xbatino) to the place where the attacking columns were to meet. He sat\nin the cal\xc3\xa8che, dozing and waking up by turns, and listening for any\nsound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun.\nBut all was still quiet. A damp dull autumn morning was just dawning. On\napproaching Tar\xc3\xbatino Kut\xc3\xbazov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to\nwater across the road along which he was driving. Kut\xc3\xbazov looked at\nthem searchingly, stopped his carriage, and inquired what regiment they\nbelonged to. They belonged to a column that should have been far in\nfront and in ambush long before then. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\nthe old commander in chief. But a little further on he saw infantry\nregiments with their arms piled and the soldiers, only partly dressed,\neating their rye porridge and carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The\nofficer reported that no order to advance had been received.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! Not rec...\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov began, but checked himself immediately and\nsent for a senior officer. Getting out of his cal\xc3\xa8che, he waited with\ndrooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down. When\nE\xc3\xbdkhen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned, appeared,\nKut\xc3\xbazov went purple in the face, not because that officer was to blame\nfor the mistake, but because he was an object of sufficient importance\nfor him to vent his wrath on. Trembling and panting the old man fell\ninto that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the\nground, and he fell upon E\xc3\xbdkhen, threatening him with his hands,\nshouting and loading him with gross abuse. Another man, Captain Br\xc3\xb3zin,\nwho happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame, suffered the\nsame fate.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of another blackguard are you? I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you shot!\nScoundrels!\xe2\x80\x9d yelled Kut\xc3\xbazov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and\nreeling.\n\nHe was suffering physically. He, the commander in chief, a Serene\nHighness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had\nin Russia, to be placed in this position\xe2\x80\x94made the laughingstock of the\nwhole army! \xe2\x80\x9cI needn\xe2\x80\x99t have been in such a hurry to pray about today,\nor have kept awake thinking everything over all night,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he to\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to\nmock me so... and now!\xe2\x80\x9d He was in a state of physical suffering as if\nfrom corporal punishment, and could not avoid expressing it by cries of\nanger and distress. But his strength soon began to fail him, and looking\nabout him, conscious of having said much that was amiss, he again got\ninto his cal\xc3\xa8che and drove back in silence.\n\nHis wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly he\nlistened to excuses and self-justifications (Erm\xc3\xb3lov did not come to see\nhim till the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen, Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn,\nand Toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next\nday. And once more Kut\xc3\xbazov had to consent.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nNext day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening\nand advanced during the night. It was an autumn night with dark purple\nclouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy, and the troops\nadvanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of the artillery\ncould be faintly heard. The men were forbidden to talk out loud, to\nsmoke their pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried to prevent their\nhorses neighing. The secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm\nand they marched gaily. Some columns, supposing they had reached their\ndestination, halted, piled arms, and settled down on the cold ground,\nbut the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they\nevidently should not have been.\n\nOnly Count Orl\xc3\xb3v-Den\xc3\xadsov with his Cossacks (the least important\ndetachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time. This\ndetachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path leading from\nthe village of Strom\xc3\xadlova to Dm\xc3\xadtrovsk.\n\nToward dawn, Count Orl\xc3\xb3v-Den\xc3\xadsov, who had dozed off, was awakened by a\ndeserter from the French army being brought to him. This was a Polish\nsergeant of Poniatowski\xe2\x80\x99s corps, who explained in Polish that he had\ncome over because he had been slighted in the service: that he ought\nlong ago to have been made an officer, that he was braver than any of\nthem, and so he had left them and wished to pay them out. He said that\nMurat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were,\nand that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would\ncapture him alive. Count Orl\xc3\xb3v-Den\xc3\xadsov consulted his fellow officers.\n\nThe offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered to go and\neverybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing and arguing,\nMajor-General Gr\xc3\xa9kov with two Cossack regiments decided to go with the\nPolish sergeant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Count Orl\xc3\xb3v-Den\xc3\xadsov to the sergeant at parting,\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you have been lying I\xe2\x80\x99ll have you hanged like a dog; but if it\xe2\x80\x99s\ntrue you shall have a hundred gold pieces!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWithout replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and rode\naway with Gr\xc3\xa9kov whose men had quickly assembled. They disappeared into\nthe forest, and Count Orl\xc3\xb3v-Den\xc3\xadsov, having seen Gr\xc3\xa9kov off, returned,\nshivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he\nhad undertaken on his own responsibility, and began looking at the enemy\ncamp, now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying\ncampfires. Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open\ndeclivity to his right. He looked in that direction, but though the\ncolumns would have been visible quite far off, they were not to be seen.\nIt seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the French\ncamp, and his keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is really too late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Count Orl\xc3\xb3v, looking at the camp.\n\nAs often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before\nour eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the\nsergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian\nattack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which\nhe would lead away heaven only knew where. How could one capture a\ncommander in chief from among such a mass of troops!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure that rascal was lying,\xe2\x80\x9d said the count.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can still be called back,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of his suite, who like Count\nOrl\xc3\xb3v felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\ncamp.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have them fetched back?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch them back, fetch them back!\xe2\x80\x9d said Count Orl\xc3\xb3v with sudden\ndetermination, looking at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be too late. It is quite\nlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the adjutant galloped through the forest after Gr\xc3\xa9kov. When Gr\xc3\xa9kov\nreturned, Count Orl\xc3\xb3v-Den\xc3\xadsov, excited both by the abandoned attempt and\nby vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear, as\nwell as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance. All his men\nfelt the same excitement.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMount!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded in a whisper. The men took their places and\ncrossed themselves.... \xe2\x80\x9cForward, with God\xe2\x80\x99s aid!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah-ah-ah!\xe2\x80\x9d reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack companies,\ntrailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out\nof a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.\n\nOne desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw the\nCossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed and only just waking\nup, ran off in all directions, abandoning cannons, muskets, and horses.\n\nHad the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what was behind and\naround them, they would have captured Murat and everything there.\nThat was what the officers desired. But it was impossible to make the\nCossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners. None of them\nlistened to orders. Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were\ntaken on the spot, besides standards and (what seemed most important to\nthe Cossacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like. All this had\nto be dealt with, the prisoners and guns secured, the booty divided\xe2\x80\x94not\nwithout some shouting and even a little fighting among themselves\xe2\x80\x94and it\nwas on this that the Cossacks all busied themselves.\n\nThe French, not being farther pursued, began to recover themselves: they\nformed into detachments and began firing. Orl\xc3\xb3v-Den\xc3\xadsov, still waiting\nfor the other columns to arrive, advanced no further.\n\nMeantime, according to the dispositions which said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe First\nColumn will march\xe2\x80\x9d and so on, the infantry of the belated columns,\ncommanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due order\nand, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their appointed\nplaces. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully, began to halt;\nmurmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and finally a\nbackward movement. Adjutants and generals galloped about, shouted, grew\nangry, quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and were late, gave\nvent to a little abuse, and at last gave it all up and went forward,\nsimply to get somewhere. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall get somewhere or other!\xe2\x80\x9d And they did\nindeed get somewhere, though not to their right places; a few eventually\neven got to their right place, but too late to be of any use and only\nin time to be fired at. Toll, who in this battle played the part of\nWeyrother at Austerlitz, galloped assiduously from place to place,\nfinding everything upside down everywhere. Thus he stumbled on Bagov\xc3\xbat\xe2\x80\x99s\ncorps in a wood when it was already broad daylight, though the corps\nshould long before have joined Orl\xc3\xb3v-Den\xc3\xadsov. Excited and vexed by the\nfailure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it, Toll\ngalloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him\nseverely, saying that he ought to be shot. General Bagov\xc3\xbat, a fighting\nold soldier of placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay,\nconfusion, and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody\xe2\x80\x99s surprise\nand quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things\nto Toll.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men as\nwell as anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and advanced with a single division.\n\nComing out onto a field under the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fire, this brave general went\nstraight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering in his\nagitation whether going into action now, with a single division, would\nbe of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets were just what he\nneeded in his angry mood. One of the first bullets killed him, and other\nbullets killed many of his men. And his division remained under fire for\nsome time quite uselessly.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMeanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the front,\nbut Kut\xc3\xbazov accompanied that column. He well knew that nothing but\nconfusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will, and as\nfar as was in his power held the troops back. He did not advance.\n\nHe rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering\nsuggestions that they should attack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe word attack is always on your tongue, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t see that we are\nunable to execute complicated maneuvers,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Milor\xc3\xa1dovich who\nasked permission to advance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take Murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in\ntime, and nothing can be done now!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied to someone else.\n\nWhen Kut\xc3\xbazov was informed that at the French rear\xe2\x80\x94where according to the\nreports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobody\xe2\x80\x94there were now\ntwo battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance at Erm\xc3\xb3lov who was\nbehind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see! They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds,\nbut as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, and the enemy,\nforewarned, takes measures accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nErm\xc3\xb3lov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words.\nHe understood that for him the storm had blown over, and that Kut\xc3\xbazov\nwould content himself with that hint.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s having a little fun at my expense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Erm\xc3\xb3lov softly, nudging\nwith his knee Ra\xc3\xa9vski who was at his side.\n\nSoon after this, Erm\xc3\xb3lov moved up to Kut\xc3\xbazov and respectfully remarked:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not too late yet, your Highness\xe2\x80\x94the enemy has not gone away\xe2\x80\x94if\nyou were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so much as see\na little smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Murat\xe2\x80\x99s troops\nwere in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every hundred paces he\nhalted for three quarters of an hour.\n\nThe whole battle consisted in what Orl\xc3\xb3v-Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s Cossacks had done:\nthe rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.\n\nIn consequence of this battle Kut\xc3\xbazov received a diamond decoration,\nand Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others also\nreceived pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades,\nand following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nRussian officers and generals after the Tar\xc3\xbatino battle, letting it be\nunderstood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that\nwe ourselves should not have done so, just as people speak today. But\npeople who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about\nor deliberately deceive themselves. No battle\xe2\x80\x94Tar\xc3\xbatino, Borodin\xc3\xb3, or\nAusterlitz\xe2\x80\x94takes place as those who planned it anticipated. That is an\nessential condition.\n\nA countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than during\na battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence the course\ntaken by the fight, and that course never can be known in advance and\nnever coincides with the direction of any one force.\n\nIf many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given\nbody, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those\nforces, but will always be a mean\xe2\x80\x94what in mechanics is represented by\nthe diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.\n\nIf in the descriptions given by historians, especially French ones, we\nfind their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously\nformed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions\nare false.\n\nThe battle of Tar\xc3\xbatino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in\nview\xe2\x80\x94to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the\ndispositions; nor that which Count Orl\xc3\xb3v-Den\xc3\xadsov may have had in view\xe2\x80\x94to\ntake Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying the whole\ncorps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor the aim of\nthe officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself; nor\nthat of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got, and so on. But\nif the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the\nRussians of that day desired\xe2\x80\x94to drive the French out of Russia and\ndestroy their army\xe2\x80\x94it is quite clear that the battle of Tar\xc3\xbatino, just\nbecause of its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that stage\nof the campaign. It would be difficult and even impossible to imagine\nany result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle. With\na minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the greatest\nconfusion, the most important results of the whole campaign were\nattained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure of the\nweakness of the French, and the administration of that shock which\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army had only awaited to begin its flight.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nNapoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there\ncan be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the\nhands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient\ncapital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and\nincalculable wealth, is in Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s hands. The Russian army, only half\nthe strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to attack for\na whole month. Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s position is most brilliant. He can either fall\non the Russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate\nan advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on\nPetersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return to Smol\xc3\xa9nsk or\nV\xc3\xadlna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be\nrequired to retain the brilliant position the French held at that time.\nFor that, only very simple and easy steps were necessary: not to allow\nthe troops to loot, to prepare winter clothing\xe2\x80\x94of which there was\nsufficient in Moscow for the whole army\xe2\x80\x94and methodically to collect the\nprovisions, of which (according to the French historians) there were\nenough in Moscow to supply the whole army for six months. Yet Napoleon,\nthat greatest of all geniuses, who the historians declare had control of\nthe army, took none of these steps.\n\nHe not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used his\npower to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open\nto him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in Moscow,\nadvancing on Petersburg or on N\xc3\xadzhni-N\xc3\xb3vgorod, or retiring by a more\nnortherly or more southerly route (say by the road Kut\xc3\xbazov afterwards\ntook), nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he\nactually did. He remained in Moscow till October, letting the troops\nplunder the city; then, hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind\nhim, he quitted Moscow, approached Kut\xc3\xbazov without joining battle,\nturned to the right and reached M\xc3\xa1lo-Yarosl\xc3\xa1vets, again without\nattempting to break through and take the road Kut\xc3\xbazov took, but retiring\ninstead to Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk along the devastated Smol\xc3\xa9nsk road. Nothing more\nstupid than that could have been devised, or more disastrous for the\narmy, as the sequel showed. Had Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s aim been to destroy his army,\nthe most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series\nof actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose,\nindependently of anything the Russian army might do.\n\nNapoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he destroyed his\narmy because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as\nunjust as to say that he had brought his troops to Moscow because he\nwished to and because he was very clever and a genius.\n\nIn both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the\npersonal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws that\nguided the event.\n\nThe historians quite falsely represent Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s faculties as having\nweakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did not justify\nhis actions. He employed all his ability and strength to do the best he\ncould for himself and his army, as he had done previously and as he did\nsubsequently in 1813. His activity at that time was no less astounding\nthan it was in Egypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in Prussia. We do not\nknow for certain in how far his genius was genuine in Egypt\xe2\x80\x94where forty\ncenturies looked down upon his grandeur\xe2\x80\x94for his great exploits there are\nall told us by Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in\nAustria or Prussia, for we have to draw our information from French\nor German sources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps\nwithout fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans\nto recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on\nin Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius\nin order to hide our shame. We have paid for the right to look at the\nmatter plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.\n\nHis activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as\nelsewhere. Order after order and plan after plan were issued by him\nfrom the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The absence\nof citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of Moscow, did not\ndisconcert him. He did not lose sight either of the welfare of his\narmy or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the people\nof Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic\nconsiderations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nWith regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his entry into\nMoscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements\nof the Russian army, sent army corps out along the different roads, and\ncharged Murat to find Kut\xc3\xbazov. Then he gave careful directions about the\nfortification of the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future\ncampaign over the whole map of Russia.\n\nWith regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain Y\xc3\xa1kovlev,\nwho had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of\nMoscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity,\nand having written a letter to the Emperor Alexander in which he\nconsidered it his duty to inform his Friend and Brother that Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nhad managed affairs badly in Moscow, he dispatched Y\xc3\xa1kovlev to\nPetersburg.\n\nHaving similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to Tut\xc3\xb3lmin, he\ndispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.\n\nWith regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders\nto find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Rostopch\xc3\xadn was\npunished by an order to burn down his houses.\n\nWith regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a\nconstitution. A municipality was established and the following\nannouncement issued:\n\n\nINHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!\n\nYour misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King\ndesires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you how he\npunishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to\nput an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A\npaternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form your\nmunicipality or city government. It will take care of you, of your\nneeds, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished by a red\nribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear\na white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a red\nribbon round the left arm.\n\nThe city police is established on its former footing, and better order\nalready prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has\nappointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty\ncommissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different\nwards of the city. You will recognize them by the white ribbon they will\nwear on the left arm. Several churches of different denominations are\nopen, and divine service is performed in them unhindered. Your fellow\ncitizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been\ngiven that they should find in them the help and protection due to\ntheir misfortunes. These are the measures the government has adopted to\nre-establish order and relieve your condition. But to achieve this\naim it is necessary that you should add your efforts and should, if\npossible, forget the misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain\nthe hope of a less cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and\nignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or\non what remains of your property, and finally that you should not doubt\nthat these will be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest\nand most just of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you\nmay be, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of\na state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to\nanother, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the\nmilitary and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow!\n\n\nWith regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all the\ntroops in turn should enter Moscow \xc3\xa0 la maraude * to obtain provisions\nfor themselves, so that the army might have its future provided for.\n\n    * As looters.\n\nWith regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back\nand services to be again performed in the churches.\n\nWith regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the following was\nplacarded everywhere:\n\nPROCLAMATION\n\nYou, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom\nmisfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of\nthe soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen!\nTranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in\nit. Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places\non finding that they are respected. Any violence to them or to their\nproperty is promptly punished. His Majesty the Emperor and King protects\nthem, and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey\nhis orders. He desires to end your misfortunes and restore you to your\nhomes and families. Respond, therefore, to his benevolent intentions\nand come to us without fear. Inhabitants, return with confidence to your\nabodes! You will soon find means of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen\nand industrious artisans, return to your work, your houses, your shops,\nwhere the protection of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper pay\nfor your work. And lastly you too, peasants, come from the forests where\nyou are hiding in terror, return to your huts without fear, in full\nassurance that you will find protection! Markets are established in the\ncity where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of\nthe soil. The government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom\nof sale for them: (1) From today, peasants, husbandmen, and those\nliving in the neighborhood of Moscow may without any danger bring their\nsupplies of all kinds to two appointed markets, of which one is on\nthe Mokhov\xc3\xa1ya Street and the other at the Provision Market. (2) Such\nsupplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may\nagree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be\nfree to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him\nunder any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday of each week are appointed\nas the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops\nwill be stationed along the highroads on Tuesdays and Saturdays at such\ndistances from the town as to protect the carts. (4) Similar measures\nwill be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no\nhindrance on their return journey. (5) Steps will immediately be taken\nto re-establish ordinary trading.\n\nInhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and artisans,\nto whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry out the\npaternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to\nco-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay your respect and\nconfidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!\n\n\nWith the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people,\nreviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. The Emperor\nrode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and, despite his\npreoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the theaters that were\nestablished by his order.\n\nIn regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads,\nNapoleon also did all in his power. He caused the words Maison de ma\nM\xc3\xa8re to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining\ntender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He\nvisited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him\nto kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with Tut\xc3\xb3lmin. Then, as\nThiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged\nRussian money which he had prepared: \xe2\x80\x9cRaising the use of these means\nby an act worthy of himself and of the French army, he let relief\nbe distributed to those who had been burned out. But as food was too\nprecious to be given to foreigners, who were for the most part enemies,\nNapoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food\nfrom outside, and had paper rubles distributed to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith reference to army discipline, orders were continually being issued\nto inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties\nand to suppress robbery.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nBut strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plans\xe2\x80\x94which were\nnot at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances\xe2\x80\x94did not\naffect the essence of the matter but, like the hands of a clock detached\nfrom the mechanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without\nengaging the cogwheels.\n\nWith reference to the military side\xe2\x80\x94the plan of campaign\xe2\x80\x94that work of\ngenius of which Thiers remarks that, \xe2\x80\x9cHis genius never devised anything\nmore profound, more skillful, or more admirable,\xe2\x80\x9d and enters into a\npolemic with M. Fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred\nnot to the fourth but to the fifteenth of October\xe2\x80\x94that plan never was or\ncould be executed, for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the\ncase. The fortifying of the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin, for which la Mosqu\xc3\xa9e (as Napoleon\ntermed the church of Basil the Beatified) was to have been razed to\nthe ground, proved quite useless. The mining of the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin only helped\ntoward fulfilling Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s wish that it should be blown up when he\nleft Moscow\xe2\x80\x94as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to\nbe beaten. The pursuit of the Russian army, about which Napoleon was so\nconcerned, produced an unheard-of result. The French generals lost touch\nwith the Russian army of sixty thousand men, and according to Thiers it\nwas only eventually found, like a lost pin, by the skill\xe2\x80\x94and apparently\nthe genius\xe2\x80\x94of Murat.\n\nWith reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s arguments as to his\nmagnanimity and justice, both to Tut\xc3\xb3lmin and to Y\xc3\xa1kovlev (whose chief\nconcern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;\nAlexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their\nembassage.\n\nWith regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed\nincendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.\n\nWith regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a\nmunicipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain\npeople who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of\npreserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property from being\nlooted.\n\nWith regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so easily been\nsettled by Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s visit to a mosque, no results were achieved.\nTwo or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to carry out\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s wish, but one of them was slapped in the face by a French\nsoldier while conducting service, and a French official reported of\nanother that: \xe2\x80\x9cThe priest whom I found and invited to say Mass cleaned\nand locked up the church. That night the doors were again broken\nopen, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and other disorders\nperpetrated.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWith reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious workmen and\nto peasants evoked no response. There were no industrious workmen, and\nthe peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town\nwith the proclamation and killed them.\n\nAs to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops,\nthese did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in the\nKr\xc3\xa9mlin and in Posny\xc3\xa1kov\xe2\x80\x99s house were closed again at once because the\nactors and actresses were robbed.\n\nEven philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as\nwell as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The\nFrench, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the\npaper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the\nunfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.\n\nBut the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given\nby the authorities at that time was Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to stop the\nlooting and re-establish discipline.\n\nThis is what the army authorities were reporting:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order\nis not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a\nlawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they sell stolen\ngoods.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of\nthe 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate\ninhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have\nthe ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly\nwitnessed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging\xe2\x80\x94October\n9.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our\ndistrict who ought to be arrested by a strong force\xe2\x80\x94October 11.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to\nstop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning\nto the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed\nmore violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today. The\nEmperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his\nperson, who should set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to\nsuch a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army\nsupplies. Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying\nsentinels and officers, and have abused and beaten them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Grand Marshal of the palace,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the governor, \xe2\x80\x9ccomplains\nbitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to\ncommit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows\nof the Emperor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the\nprovender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated and\nperished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it did not\ngo away.\n\nIt began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the\ncapture of transport trains on the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk road, and by the battle of\nTar\xc3\xbatino. The news of that battle of Tar\xc3\xbatino, unexpectedly received\nby Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish the Russians\n(Thiers says), and he issued the order for departure which the whole\narmy was demanding.\n\nFleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had\nstolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal tr\xc3\xa9sor, but on\nseeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers says)\nhorror-struck. And yet with his experience of war he did not order all\nthe superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with those of a\ncertain marshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at the cal\xc3\xa8ches and\ncarriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very\ngood thing, as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the\nsick, and the wounded.\n\nThe plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which\nfeels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To study the\nskillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it\nentered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps\nand shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded animal,\nhearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunter\xe2\x80\x99s gun, runs forward and\nback again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his\nwhole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the battle of Tar\xc3\xbatino\nfrightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunter\xe2\x80\x99s gun,\nreached him, turned back, and finally\xe2\x80\x94like any wild beast\xe2\x80\x94ran back along\nthe most disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent was\nfamiliar.\n\nDuring the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have been\nthe leader of all these movements\xe2\x80\x94as the figurehead of a ship may seem\nto a savage to guide the vessel\xe2\x80\x94acted like a child who, holding a couple\nof strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nEarly in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of the\nshed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little\nblue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped about\nhim. This little dog lived in their shed, sleeping beside Karat\xc3\xa1ev at\nnight; it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned\nagain. Probably it had never had an owner, and it still belonged to\nnobody and had no name. The French called it Azor; the soldier who\ntold stories called it Femg\xc3\xa1lka; Karat\xc3\xa1ev and others called it Gray, or\nsometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a name, or even of a breed or\nany definite color did not seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in the\nleast. Its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume, its bandy legs\nserved it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run\nvery easily and quickly on three legs, as if disdaining to use all\nfour. Everything pleased it. Now it would roll on its back, yelping with\ndelight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance, and\nnow frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only\nremnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldier\xe2\x80\x99s trousers which by\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev\xe2\x80\x99s advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and\na peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this\ntime. He no longer seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of\nsolidity and strength hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache\ncovered the lower part of his face, and a tangle of hair, infested\nwith lice, curled round his head like a cap. The look of his eyes\nwas resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before. The former\nslackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an\nenergetic readiness for action and resistance. His feet were bare.\n\nPierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen\nwere passing that morning, then into the distance across the river, then\nat the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him,\nand then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various\npositions, moving his dirty thick big toes. Every time he looked at his\nbare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction flitted across his face.\nThe sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned\nduring these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him.\n\nFor some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in\nthe mornings\xe2\x80\x94what is called an \xe2\x80\x9cold wives\xe2\x80\x99 summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly\npleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in\nthe air.\n\nOn everything\xe2\x80\x94far and near\xe2\x80\x94lay the magic crystal glitter seen only at\nthat time of autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance,\nwith the village, the church, and the large white house. The bare trees,\nthe sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green church spire,\nand the corners of the white house in the distance, all stood out in the\ntransparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness.\nNear by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion\noccupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green\nbeside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled house\xe2\x80\x94which in dull\nweather was repulsively ugly\xe2\x80\x94seemed quietly beautiful now, in the clear,\nmotionless brilliance.\n\nA French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a skullcap on\nhis head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from behind a corner of\nthe shed and approached Pierre with a friendly wink.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!\xe2\x80\x9d (Their name for Pierre.) \xe2\x80\x9cEh? Just like\nspring!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his pipe,\nthough whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be on the march in such weather...\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\n\nPierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the corporal told\nhim that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an\norder about the prisoners that day. Sokol\xc3\xb3v, one of the soldiers in the\nshed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that something\nshould be done about him. The corporal replied that Pierre need not\nworry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and\narrangements would be made for the sick, and that in general everything\nthat could happen had been foreseen by the authorities.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the captain,\nyou know. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to the captain\nwhen he makes his round, he will do anything for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with Pierre\nand showed him all sorts of favors.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You see, St. Thomas,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to me the other day. \xe2\x80\x98Monsieur Kiril is\na man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who has\nhad misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what\xe2\x80\x99s what.... If he wants\nanything and asks me, he won\xe2\x80\x99t get a refusal. When one has studied, you\nsee, one likes education and well-bred people.\xe2\x80\x99 It is for your sake I\nmention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not been for you\nthat affair would have ended ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The affair\nhe had alluded to had happened a few days before\xe2\x80\x94a fight between the\nprisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had succeeded in\npacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre\ntalking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said.\nWhile Pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving\nMoscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier came up to the door of\nthe shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way\nof greeting, he asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had\ngiven a shirt to sew was in that shed.\n\nA week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them,\nwhich they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and\nshirts for them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReady, ready, dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Karat\xc3\xa1ev, coming out with a neatly\nfolded shirt.\n\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work,\nwas wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. His\nhair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast,\nand his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here it is,\nready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Plat\xc3\xb3n, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn.\n\nThe Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his\nhesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had\na long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin bare\nbody, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on\nwould laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly. None\nof the prisoners said a word.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, it fits well!\xe2\x80\x9d Plat\xc3\xb3n kept repeating, pulling the shirt straight.\n\nThe Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without raising\nhis eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper\ntools; and, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nPlat\xc3\xb3n with one of his round smiles, obviously pleased with his work.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good, quite good, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frenchman, in French, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\nthere must be some linen left over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will fit better still when it sets to your body,\xe2\x80\x9d said Karat\xc3\xa1ev,\nstill admiring his handiwork. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be nice and comfortable....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nFrenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note and\ngave it to Karat\xc3\xa1ev. \xe2\x80\x9cBut give me the pieces that are over.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre saw that Plat\xc3\xb3n did not want to understand what the Frenchman\nwas saying, and he looked on without interfering. Karat\xc3\xa1ev thanked the\nFrenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The Frenchman\ninsisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked\nPierre to translate what he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he want the bits for?\xe2\x80\x9d said Karat\xc3\xa1ev. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d make fine leg\nbands for us. Well, never mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Karat\xc3\xa1ev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression, took\na small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the\nFrenchman without looking at him. \xe2\x80\x9cOh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Karat\xc3\xa1ev and went\naway. The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment, then\nlooked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s look had told him\nsomething, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlatoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d And handing back the odd\nbits he turned and went out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, look at that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Karat\xc3\xa1ev, swaying his head. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople said\nthey were not Christians, but they too have souls. It\xe2\x80\x99s what the old\nfolk used to say: \xe2\x80\x98A sweating hand\xe2\x80\x99s an open hand, a dry hand\xe2\x80\x99s close.\xe2\x80\x99\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s naked, but yet he\xe2\x80\x99s given it back.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the\npieces.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99ll make grand leg bands, dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and went back\ninto the shed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nFour weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and though\nthe French had offered to move him from the men\xe2\x80\x99s to the officers\xe2\x80\x99 shed,\nhe had stayed in the shed where he was first put.\n\nIn burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the extreme\nlimits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his physical\nstrength and health, of which he had till then been unconscious, and\nthanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that\nit was impossible to say when they began, he endured his position\nnot only lightly but joyfully. And just at this time he obtained the\ntranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach.\nHe had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind, that\ninner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle\nof Borodin\xc3\xb3. He had sought it in philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the\ndissipations of town life, in wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice,\nand in romantic love for Nat\xc3\xa1sha; he had sought it by reasoning\xe2\x80\x94and all\nthese quests and experiments had failed him. And now without thinking\nabout it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the\nhorror of death, through privation, and through what he recognized in\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev.\n\nThose dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it\nwere forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating\nthoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important. It did\nnot now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or\nNapoleon. It was plain to him that all these things were no business\nof his, and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and\ntherefore could not do so. \xe2\x80\x9cRussia and summer weather are not bound\ntogether,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, repeating words of Karat\xc3\xa1ev\xe2\x80\x99s which he found\nstrangely consoling. His intention of killing Napoleon and his\ncalculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now\nseemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous. His anger with his wife\nand anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely\ntrivial but even amusing. What concern was it of his that somewhere or\nother that woman was leading the life she preferred? What did it matter\nto anybody, and especially to him, whether or not they found out that\ntheir prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s name was Count Bez\xc3\xbakhov?\n\nHe now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite\nagreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts somewhat\ndifferently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could\nonly be negative, but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony\nas though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is\nimplanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre\nbelieved it without any mental reservation. The absence of suffering,\nthe satisfaction of one\xe2\x80\x99s needs and consequent freedom in the choice of\none\xe2\x80\x99s occupation, that is, of one\xe2\x80\x99s way of life, now seemed to Pierre to\nbe indubitably man\xe2\x80\x99s highest happiness. Here and now for the first time\nhe fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat,\ndrinking when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of\nwarmth when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to\ntalk and to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of one\xe2\x80\x99s needs\xe2\x80\x94good\nfood, cleanliness, and freedom\xe2\x80\x94now that he was deprived of all this,\nseemed to Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice\nof occupation, that is, of his way of life\xe2\x80\x94now that that was so\nrestricted\xe2\x80\x94seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a\nsuperfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying one\xe2\x80\x99s\nneeds, while great freedom in the choice of occupation\xe2\x80\x94such freedom as\nhis wealth, his education, and his social position had given him in his\nown life\xe2\x80\x94is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult\nand destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation.\n\nAll Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free. Yet\nsubsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke with\nenthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable, strong,\njoyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner\nfreedom which he experienced only during those weeks.\n\nWhen on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn, and\nsaw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still dark\nat first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills, and the\nwooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance,\nwhen he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the\ncrows flying from Moscow across the field, and when afterwards light\ngleamed from the east and the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rim appeared solemnly from behind a\ncloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the\nriver, all began to sparkle in the glad light\xe2\x80\x94Pierre felt a new joy and\nstrength in life such as he had never before known. And this not only\nstayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment, but even grew in\nstrength as the hardships of his position increased.\n\nThat feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still\nfurther strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners\nformed of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge\nof languages, the respect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his\nreadiness to give anything asked of him (he received the allowance\nof three rubles a week made to officers); with his strength, which he\nshowed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut; his\ngentleness to his companions, and his capacity for sitting still and\nthinking without doing anything (which seemed to them incomprehensible),\nhe appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being. The very\nqualities that had been a hindrance, if not actually harmful, to him in\nthe world he had lived in\xe2\x80\x94his strength, his disdain for the comforts of\nlife, his absent-mindedness and simplicity\xe2\x80\x94here among these people gave\nhim almost the status of a hero. And Pierre felt that their opinion\nplaced responsibilities upon him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe French evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh\nof October: kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts loaded, and troops\nand baggage trains started.\n\nAt seven in the morning a French convoy in marching trim, wearing shakos\nand carrying muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood in front\nof the sheds, and animated French talk mingled with curses sounded all\nalong the lines.\n\nIn the shed everyone was ready, dressed, belted, shod, and only awaited\nthe order to start. The sick soldier, Sokol\xc3\xb3v, pale and thin with dark\nshadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed.\nHis eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiringly\nat his comrades who were paying no attention to him, and he moaned\nregularly and quietly. It was evidently not so much his sufferings that\ncaused him to moan (he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at being\nleft alone.\n\nPierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes Karat\xc3\xa1ev had\nmade for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest\nand brought to have his boots mended with, went up to the sick man and\nsquatted down beside him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Sokol\xc3\xb3v, they are not all going away! They have a hospital\nhere. You may be better off than we others,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned the man in a\nlouder voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and ask them again directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, rising and going to\nthe door of the shed.\n\nJust as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him a\npipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal and\nsoldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal\nstraps, and these changed their familiar faces.\n\nThe corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The prisoners\nhad to be counted before being let out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorporal, what will they do with the sick man?...\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre began.\n\nBut even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal\nhe knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that\nmoment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums\nwas suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nwords and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed\nbecame semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned\nthe sick man\xe2\x80\x99s groans.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is!... It again!...\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre to himself, and an\ninvoluntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporal\xe2\x80\x99s changed face,\nin the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the\ndrums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled\npeople against their will to kill their fellow men\xe2\x80\x94that force the effect\nof which he had witnessed during the executions. To fear or to try to\nescape that force, to address entreaties or exhortations to those who\nserved as its tools, was useless. Pierre knew this now. One had to wait\nand endure. He did not again go to the sick man, nor turn to look at\nhim, but stood frowning by the door of the hut.\n\nWhen that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one\nanother like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed\nhis way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had\nassured him was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also in\nmarching kit, and on his cold face appeared that same it which Pierre\nhad recognized in the corporal\xe2\x80\x99s words and in the roll of the drums.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass on, pass on!\xe2\x80\x9d the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and\nlooking at the prisoners who thronged past him.\n\nPierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing\nPierre.\n\nPierre told him about the sick man.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll manage to walk, devil take him!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cPass on, pass\non!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued without looking at Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is dying,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre again began.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so good...\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the captain, frowning angrily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...\xe2\x80\x9d rattled the drums, and Pierre understood\nthat this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it\nwas now useless to say any more.\n\nThe officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march\nin front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among them, and\nabout three hundred men.\n\nThe officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all strangers to\nPierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at him and at his\nshoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him walked a fat major\nwith a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing a Kaz\xc3\xa1n dressing\ngown tied round with a towel, and who evidently enjoyed the respect of\nhis fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco\npouch, inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his\npipe firmly with the other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and\ngrowled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that\nthey were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were\nall surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at.\nAnother, a thin little officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing\nwhere they were now being taken and how far they would get that day. An\nofficial in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from\nside to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his\nobservations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part\nof the city was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent\nwas a Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was\nmistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you disputing about?\xe2\x80\x9d said the major angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it\nmatter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it\xe2\x80\x99s burned\ndown, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the\nroad wide enough?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning to a man behind him who was not\npushing him at all.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, oh! What have they done?\xe2\x80\x9d the prisoners on one side and another\nwere heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. \xe2\x80\x9cAll beyond the\nriver, and Z\xc3\xbabova, and in the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin.... Just look! There\xe2\x80\x99s not half of\nit left. Yes, I told you\xe2\x80\x94the whole quarter beyond the river, and so it\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know it\xe2\x80\x99s burned, so what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nmajor.\n\nAs they passed near a church in the Kham\xc3\xb3vniki (one of the few unburned\nquarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one\nside and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And\nsmeared with something!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these\nexclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the palings\nsurrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw better\nthan he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set upright\nagainst the palings with its face smeared with soot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...\xe2\x80\x9d the convoy\nguards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh virulence,\ndrove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at\nthe dead man.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nThrough the cross streets of the Kham\xc3\xb3vniki quarter the prisoners\nmarched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons\nbelonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they\ncame among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with\nprivate vehicles.\n\nAt the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get across.\nFrom the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage\ntrains before and behind them. To the right, where the Kal\xc3\xbaga road turns\nnear Nesk\xc3\xbachny, endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into\nthe distance. These were troops of Beauharnais\xe2\x80\x99 corps which had started\nbefore any of the others. Behind, along the riverside and across the\nStone Bridge, were Ney\xe2\x80\x99s troops and transport.\n\nDavout\xe2\x80\x99s troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the\nCrimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kal\xc3\xbaga road.\nBut the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnais\xe2\x80\x99\ntrain had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the Kal\xc3\xbaga road when\nthe vanguard of Ney\xe2\x80\x99s army was already emerging from the Great Ord\xc3\xbdnka\nStreet.\n\nWhen they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps\nforward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles and men\ncrowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few hundred paces\nthat separated the bridge from the Kal\xc3\xbaga road, taking more than an\nhour to do so, and came out upon the square where the streets of the\nTransmoskv\xc3\xa1 ward and the Kal\xc3\xbaga road converge, and the prisoners jammed\nclose together had to stand for some hours at that crossway. From all\nsides, like the roar of the sea, were heard the rattle of wheels, the\ntramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. Pierre stood\npressed against the wall of a charred house, listening to that noise\nwhich mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums.\n\nTo get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of\nthe half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They\xe2\x80\x99ve loaded goods even on\nthe cannon! Look there, those are furs!\xe2\x80\x9d they exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cJust see what\nthe blackguards have looted.... There! See what that one has behind\nin the cart.... Why, those are settings taken from some icons, by\nheaven!... Oh, the rascals!... See how that fellow has loaded\nhimself up, he can hardly walk! Good lord, they\xe2\x80\x99ve even grabbed those\nchaises!... See that fellow there sitting on the trunks.... Heavens!\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, hit him on the snout\xe2\x80\x94on his snout! Like this, we\nshan\xe2\x80\x99t get away before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown! It\xe2\x80\x99s\nlike a portable house.... That fellow\xe2\x80\x99s dropped his sack and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see\nit. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking either!\nYes, I dare say, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way they\xe2\x80\x99ll let you pass.... Just look,\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven, so they are! In\ncarriages\xe2\x80\x94see how comfortably they\xe2\x80\x99ve settled themselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain, as at the church in Kham\xc3\xb3vniki, a wave of general curiosity\nbore all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to\nhis stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their\ncuriosity. In three carriages involved among the munition carts, closely\nsqueezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in glaring\ncolors, who were shouting something in shrill voices.\n\nFrom the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious\nforce nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse\nsmeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned\nruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression\non him\xe2\x80\x94as if his soul, making ready for a hard struggle, refused to\nreceive impressions that might weaken it.\n\nThe women\xe2\x80\x99s vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, soldiers,\nwagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts,\nmore soldiers, and now and then women.\n\nPierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.\n\nAll these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible\npower. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came flowing from\nthe different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly;\nthey all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white\nteeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of abuse flew from\nside to side, and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute\nand coldly cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the\ncorporal\xe2\x80\x99s face when the drums were beating.\n\nIt was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort\ncollected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among\nthe baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all sides, emerged\nonto the Kal\xc3\xbaga road.\n\nThey marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the sun\nbegan to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men\nbegan to prepare for their night\xe2\x80\x99s rest. They all appeared angry and\ndissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could\nbe heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran\ninto one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole. Several\nsoldiers ran toward the cart from different sides: some beat the\ncarriage horses on their heads, turning them aside, others fought among\nthemselves, and Pierre saw that one German was badly wounded on the head\nby a sword.\n\nIt seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid fields\nin the chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and the same\nfeeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on\nthat had seized them at the start. Once at a standstill they all seemed\nto understand that they did not yet know where they were going, and that\nmuch that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey.\n\nDuring this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they\nhad done at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the first time\nreceived horseflesh for their meat ration.\n\nFrom the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like\npersonal spite against each of the prisoners, in unexpected contrast to\ntheir former friendly relations.\n\nThis spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of\nprisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian\nsoldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had escaped. Pierre saw\na Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from\nthe road, and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to\ncourt-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the\nRussian. To the noncommissioned officer\xe2\x80\x99s excuse that the prisoner was\nill and could not walk, the officer replied that the order was to shoot\nthose who lagged behind. Pierre felt that that fatal force which had\ncrushed him during the executions, but which he had not felt during his\nimprisonment, now again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but\nhe felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush\nhim, there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent\nof it.\n\nHe ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his\ncomrades.\n\nNeither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in\nMoscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of the\norder to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in reaction\nagainst the worsening of their position they were all particularly\nanimated and gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences, of amusing\nscenes they had witnessed during the campaign, and avoided all talk of\ntheir present situation.\n\nThe sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in the\nsky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the\nrising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray\nhaze. It grew light. The evening was ending, but the night had not yet\ncome. Pierre got up and left his new companions, crossing between the\ncampfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the\ncommon soldier prisoners were stationed. He wanted to talk to them. On\nthe road he was stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him back.\n\nPierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an\nunharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him and\ndropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the\ncart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought. Suddenly he\nburst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that\nmen from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and\nevidently solitary laughter could mean.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa-ha-ha!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cThe soldier\ndid not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me captive.\nWhat, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...\xe2\x80\x9d and he laughed\ntill tears started to his eyes.\n\nA man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at\nall by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther away from\nthe inquisitive man, and looked around him.\n\nThe huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the\ncrackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the\nred campfires were growing paler and dying down. High up in the light\nsky hung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp, unseen\nbefore, were now visible in the distance. And farther still, beyond\nthose forests and fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless distance\nlured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling\nstars in its faraway depths. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all that is me, all that is within me,\nand it is all I!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they caught all that and put it\ninto a shed boarded up with planks!\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled, and went and lay down to\nsleep beside his companions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nIn the early days of October another envoy came to Kut\xc3\xbazov with a letter\nfrom Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow, though\nNapoleon was already not far from Kut\xc3\xbazov on the old Kal\xc3\xbaga road.\nKut\xc3\xbazov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly\nbrought by Lauriston, saying that there could be no question of peace.\n\nSoon after that a report was received from D\xc3\xb3rokhov\xe2\x80\x99s guerrilla\ndetachment operating to the left of Tar\xc3\xbatino that troops of Broussier\xe2\x80\x99s\ndivision had been seen at Form\xc3\xadnsk and that being separated from the\nrest of the French army they might easily be destroyed. The soldiers and\nofficers again demanded action. Generals on the staff, excited by the\nmemory of the easy victory at Tar\xc3\xbatino, urged Kut\xc3\xbazov to carry out\nD\xc3\xb3rokhov\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion. Kut\xc3\xbazov did not consider any offensive necessary.\nThe result was a compromise which was inevitable: a small detachment was\nsent to Form\xc3\xadnsk to attack Broussier.\n\nBy a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most\ndifficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokht\xc3\xbarov\xe2\x80\x94that same modest\nlittle Dokht\xc3\xbarov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans\nof battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering crosses on\nbatteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of as\nundecided and undiscerning\xe2\x80\x94but whom we find commanding wherever the\nposition was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from\nAusterlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he remained last at the\nAugezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what was possible when all\nwere flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear\nguard. Ill with fever he went to Smol\xc3\xa9nsk with twenty thousand men\nto defend the town against Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s whole army. In Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, at the\nMal\xc3\xa1khov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he\nwas awakened by the bombardment of the town\xe2\x80\x94and Smol\xc3\xa9nsk held out all\nday long. At the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, when Bagrati\xc3\xb3n was killed and nine\ntenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the\nFrench artillery fire was directed against it, the man sent there was\nthis same irresolute and undiscerning Dokht\xc3\xbarov\xe2\x80\x94Kut\xc3\xbazov hastening to\nrectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first.\nAnd the quiet little Dokht\xc3\xbarov rode thither, and Borodin\xc3\xb3 became the\ngreatest glory of the Russian army. Many heroes have been described to\nus in verse and prose, but of Dokht\xc3\xbarov scarcely a word has been said.\n\nIt was Dokht\xc3\xbarov again whom they sent to Form\xc3\xadnsk and from there to\nM\xc3\xa1lo-Yarosl\xc3\xa1vets, the place where the last battle with the French was\nfought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began;\nand we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the\ncampaign, but of Dokht\xc3\xbarov nothing or very little is said and that\ndubiously. And this silence about Dokht\xc3\xbarov is the clearest testimony to\nhis merit.\n\nIt is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a\nmachine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance\nand is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most\nimportant part. The man who does not understand the construction of\nthe machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which\nrevolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine, and\nnot the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working.\n\nOn the tenth of October when Dokht\xc3\xbarov had gone halfway to Form\xc3\xadnsk and\nstopped at the village of Arist\xc3\xb3vo, preparing faithfully to execute the\norders he had received, the whole French army having, in its convulsive\nmovement, reached Murat\xe2\x80\x99s position apparently in order to give\nbattle\xe2\x80\x94suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new\nKal\xc3\xbaga road and began to enter Form\xc3\xadnsk, where only Broussier had\nbeen till then. At that time Dokht\xc3\xbarov had under his command, besides\nD\xc3\xb3rokhov\xe2\x80\x99s detachment, the two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and\nSesl\xc3\xa1vin.\n\nOn the evening of October 11 Sesl\xc3\xa1vin came to the Arist\xc3\xb3vo headquarters\nwith a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner said that the\ntroops that had entered Form\xc3\xadnsk that day were the vanguard of the whole\narmy, that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four\ndays previously. That same evening a house serf who had come from\nB\xc3\xb3rovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town. Some\nCossacks of Dokht\xc3\xbarov\xe2\x80\x99s detachment reported having sighted the French\nGuards marching along the road to B\xc3\xb3rovsk. From all these reports it was\nevident that where they had expected to meet a single division there\nwas now the whole French army marching from Moscow in an unexpected\ndirection\xe2\x80\x94along the Kal\xc3\xbaga road. Dokht\xc3\xbarov was unwilling to undertake\nany action, as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do. He had\nbeen ordered to attack Form\xc3\xadnsk. But only Broussier had been there at\nthat time and now the whole French army was there. Erm\xc3\xb3lov wished to act\non his own judgment, but Dokht\xc3\xbarov insisted that he must have Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s\ninstructions. So it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff.\n\nFor this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhov\xc3\xadtinov, was chosen, who\nwas to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering\na written report. Toward midnight Bolkhov\xc3\xadtinov, having received the\ndispatch and verbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff\naccompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nIt was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for four days.\nHaving changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a\nhalf over a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhov\xc3\xadtinov reached Litash\xc3\xabvka after\none o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence\nhung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he entered\na dark passage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe general on duty, quick! It\xe2\x80\x99s very important!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to someone\nwho had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night\nhe has not slept,\xe2\x80\x9d said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should\nwake the captain first.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is very important, from General Dokht\xc3\xbarov,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nBolkhov\xc3\xadtinov, entering the open door which he had found by feeling in\nthe dark.\n\nThe orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour honor, your honor! A courier.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What\xe2\x80\x99s that? From whom?\xe2\x80\x9d came a sleepy voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Dokht\xc3\xbarov and from Alex\xc3\xa9y Petr\xc3\xb3vich. Napoleon is at Form\xc3\xadnsk,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Bolkhov\xc3\xadtinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but\nguessing by the voice that it was not Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn.\n\nThe man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like waking him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, fumbling for something. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is very\nill. Perhaps this is only a rumor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the dispatch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bolkhov\xc3\xadtinov. \xe2\x80\x9cMy orders are to give it at\nonce to the general on duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, I\xe2\x80\x99ll light a candle. You damned rascal, where do you\nalways hide it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice of the man who was stretching himself,\nto the orderly. (This was Shcherb\xc3\xadnin, Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn\xe2\x80\x99s adjutant.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\nfound it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found it!\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\n\nThe orderly was striking a light and Shcherb\xc3\xadnin was fumbling for\nsomething on the candlestick.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the nasty beasts!\xe2\x80\x9d said he with disgust.\n\nBy the light of the sparks Bolkhov\xc3\xadtinov saw Shcherb\xc3\xadnin\xe2\x80\x99s youthful face\nas he held the candle, and the face of another man who was still asleep.\nThis was Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn.\n\nWhen the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned\nup, first blue and then red, Shcherb\xc3\xadnin lit the tallow candle, from\nthe candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were\nrunning away, and looked at the messenger. Bolkhov\xc3\xadtinov was bespattered\nall over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave the report?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Shcherb\xc3\xadnin, taking the envelope.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe news is reliable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bolkhov\xc3\xadtinov. \xe2\x80\x9cPrisoners, Cossacks, and\nthe scouts all say the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be done, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wake him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shcherb\xc3\xadnin,\nrising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a\ngreatcoat. \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Petr\xc3\xb3vich!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. (Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn did not stir.) \xe2\x80\x9cTo\nthe General Staff!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a smile, knowing that those words would\nbe sure to arouse him.\n\nAnd in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On\nKonovn\xc3\xadtsyn\xe2\x80\x99s handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever,\nthere still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote\nfrom present affairs, but then he suddenly started and his face assumed\nits habitual calm and firm appearance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it? From whom?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked immediately but without hurry,\nblinking at the light.\n\nWhile listening to the officer\xe2\x80\x99s report Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn broke the seal and\nread the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in\ntheir woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his\nboots. Then he took off his nightcap, combed his hair over his temples,\nand donned his cap.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKonovn\xc3\xadtsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great\nimportance and that no time must be lost. He did not consider or ask\nhimself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest him. He\nregarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his\nreason but by something else. There was within him a deep unexpressed\nconviction that all would be well, but that one must not trust to this\nand still less speak about it, but must only attend to one\xe2\x80\x99s own work.\nAnd he did his work, giving his whole strength to the task.\n\nPeter Petr\xc3\xb3vich Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn, like Dokht\xc3\xbarov, seems to have been included\nmerely for propriety\xe2\x80\x99s sake in the list of the so-called heroes of\n1812\xe2\x80\x94the Barclays, Ra\xc3\xa9vskis, Erm\xc3\xb3lovs, Pl\xc3\xa1tovs, and Milor\xc3\xa1doviches. Like\nDokht\xc3\xbarov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity\nand information, and like Dokht\xc3\xbarov he never made plans of battle but\nwas always found where the situation was most difficult. Since his\nappointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open,\ngiving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up. In\nbattle he was always under fire, so that Kut\xc3\xbazov reproved him for it and\nfeared to send him to the front, and like Dokht\xc3\xbarov he was one of those\nunnoticed cogwheels that, without clatter or noise, constitute the most\nessential part of the machine.\n\nComing out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn\nfrowned\xe2\x80\x94partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the\nunpleasant thought that occurred to him, of how all that nest of\ninfluential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news,\nespecially Bennigsen, who ever since Tar\xc3\xbatino had been at daggers\ndrawn with Kut\xc3\xbazov; and how they would make suggestions, quarrel, issue\norders, and rescind them. And this premonition was disagreeable to him\nthough he knew it could not be helped.\n\nAnd in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news, immediately\nbegan to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters, until\nKonovn\xc3\xadtsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded him that they must\ngo to see his Highness.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He often fell\nasleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his bed\nwithout undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.\n\nSo he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred head on\nhis plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and peering into the\ndarkness.\n\nSince Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more\ninfluence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him, Kut\xc3\xbazov\nwas more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being\nobliged to take part in useless aggressive movements. The lesson of the\nTar\xc3\xbatino battle and of the day before it, which Kut\xc3\xbazov remembered with\npain, must, he thought, have some effect on others too.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.\nPatience and time are my warriors, my champions,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Kut\xc3\xbazov. He\nknew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will fall\nof itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled, the tree\nis harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an experienced sportsman\nhe knew that the beast was wounded, and wounded as only the whole\nstrength of Russia could have wounded it, but whether it was mortally\nwounded or not was still an undecided question. Now by the fact of\nLauriston and Barth\xc3\xa9lemi having been sent, and by the reports of the\nguerrillas, Kut\xc3\xbazov was almost sure that the wound was mortal. But he\nneeded further proofs and it was necessary to wait.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall\nsee! Continual maneuvers, continual advances!\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\nOnly to distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are\nlike children from whom one can\xe2\x80\x99t get any sensible account of what has\nhappened because they all want to show how well they can fight. But\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s not what is needed now.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to\nthem that when they have thought of two or three contingencies\xe2\x80\x9d (he\nremembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) \xe2\x80\x9cthey have\nforeseen everything. But the contingencies are endless.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at Borodin\xc3\xb3 was\nmortal or not had hung over Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s head for a whole month. On the one\nhand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other Kut\xc3\xbazov felt assured\nwith all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the\nRussians had put their whole strength must have been mortal. But in any\ncase proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for them and grew\nmore impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed during those\nsleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals\nfor doing. He imagined all sorts of possible contingencies, just like\nthe younger men, but with this difference, that he saw thousands of\ncontingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them. The\nlonger he thought the more contingencies presented themselves. He\nimagined all sorts of movements of the Napoleonic army as a whole or\nin sections\xe2\x80\x94against Petersburg, or against him, or to outflank him.\nHe thought too of the possibility (which he feared most of all) that\nNapoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in Moscow\nawaiting him. Kut\xc3\xbazov even imagined that Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army might turn back\nthrough Med\xc3\xbdn and Yukhn\xc3\xb3v, but the one thing he could not foresee was\nwhat happened\xe2\x80\x94the insane, convulsive stampede of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army during\nits first eleven days after leaving Moscow: a stampede which made\npossible what Kut\xc3\xbazov had not yet even dared to think of\xe2\x80\x94the complete\nextermination of the French. D\xc3\xb3rokhov\xe2\x80\x99s report about Broussier\xe2\x80\x99s\ndivision, the guerrillas\xe2\x80\x99 reports of distress in Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army, rumors\nof preparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition that\nthe French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But these were\nonly suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not to\nKut\xc3\xbazov. With his sixty years\xe2\x80\x99 experience he knew what value to attach\nto rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news\nso that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew how readily\nin such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary. And the more\nhe desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it. This question\nabsorbed all his mental powers. All else was to him only life\xe2\x80\x99s\ncustomary routine. To such customary routine belonged his conversations\nwith the staff, the letters he wrote from Tar\xc3\xbatino to Madame de Sta\xc3\xabl,\nthe reading of novels, the distribution of awards, his correspondence\nwith Petersburg, and so on. But the destruction of the French, which he\nalone foresaw, was his heart\xe2\x80\x99s one desire.\n\nOn the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm and\nthinking of that.\n\nThere was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of Toll,\nKonovn\xc3\xadtsyn, and Bolkhov\xc3\xadtinov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, who\xe2\x80\x99s there? Come in, come in! What news?\xe2\x80\x9d the field marshal called\nout to them.\n\nWhile a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the substance\nof the news.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho brought it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Kut\xc3\xbazov with a look which, when the candle was\nlit, struck Toll by its cold severity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no doubt about it, your Highness.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall him in, call him here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch\nresting against the other which was doubled under him. He screwed up his\nseeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully, as if wishing to\nread in his face what preoccupied his own mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, tell me, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Bolkhov\xc3\xadtinov in his low, aged\nvoice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest,\n\xe2\x80\x9ccome nearer\xe2\x80\x94nearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That Napoleon\nhas left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBolkhov\xc3\xadtinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had\nbeen told to report.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak quicker, quicker! Don\xe2\x80\x99t torture me!\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov interrupted him.\n\nBolkhov\xc3\xadtinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting\ninstructions. Toll was beginning to say something but Kut\xc3\xbazov checked\nhim. He tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered and\nwrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side of\nthe room, to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer...\xe2\x80\x9d said he in a\ntremulous voice with folded hands. \xe2\x80\x9cRussia is saved. I thank Thee, O\nLord!\xe2\x80\x9d and he wept.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nFrom the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s activity was directed toward restraining his troops, by\nauthority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks,\nmaneuvers, or encounters with the perishing enemy. Dokht\xc3\xbarov went to\nM\xc3\xa1lo-Yarosl\xc3\xa1vets, but Kut\xc3\xbazov lingered with the main army and gave\norders for the evacuation of Kal\xc3\xbaga\xe2\x80\x94a retreat beyond which town seemed\nto him quite possible.\n\nEverywhere Kut\xc3\xbazov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for his\nretreat fled in the opposite direction.\n\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at Tar\xc3\xbatino\nand M\xc3\xa1lo-Yarosl\xc3\xa1vets, and make conjectures as to what would have\nhappened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern\nprovinces.\n\nBut not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing\ninto those southern provinces (for the Russian army did not bar his\nway), the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army, for\nthen already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin. How\ncould that army\xe2\x80\x94which had found abundant supplies in Moscow and had\ntrampled them underfoot instead of keeping them, and on arriving at\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk had looted provisions instead of storing them\xe2\x80\x94how could that\narmy recuperate in Kal\xc3\xbaga province, which was inhabited by Russians such\nas those who lived in Moscow, and where fire had the same property of\nconsuming what was set ablaze?\n\nThat army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3\nand the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were, the\nchemical elements of dissolution.\n\nThe members of what had once been an army\xe2\x80\x94Napoleon himself and all his\nsoldiers--fled without knowing whither, each concerned only to make his\nescape as quickly as possible from this position, of the hopelessness of\nwhich they were all more or less vaguely conscious.\n\nSo it came about that at the council at M\xc3\xa1lo-Yarosl\xc3\xa1vets, when the\ngenerals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all\nmouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier\nMouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thing\nneedful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not\neven Napoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all\nrecognized.\n\nBut though they all realized that it was necessary to get away, there\nstill remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee. An\nexternal shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this shock came in\ndue time. It was what the French called \xe2\x80\x9cle hourra de l\xe2\x80\x99Empereur.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe day after the council at M\xc3\xa1lo-Yarosl\xc3\xa1vets Napoleon rode out early in\nthe morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and\nan escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the\nprevious and of the impending battle. Some Cossacks on the prowl for\nbooty fell in with the Emperor and very nearly captured him. If the\nCossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what saved him was the very\nthing that was destroying the French army, the booty on which the\nCossacks fell. Here as at Tar\xc3\xbatino they went after plunder, leaving the\nmen. Disregarding Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon\nmanaged to escape.\n\nWhen les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor himself\nin the midst of his army, it was clear that there was nothing for it but\nto fly as fast as possible along the nearest, familiar road. Napoleon\nwith his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, not feeling his\nformer agility and boldness, and under the influence of the fright\nthe Cossacks had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued\norders\xe2\x80\x94as the historians tell us\xe2\x80\x94to retreat by the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk road.\n\nThat Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated, does\nnot prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces which\ninfluenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk (that is,\nthe Smol\xc3\xa9nsk) road acted simultaneously on him also.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nA man in motion always devises an aim for that motion. To be able to go\na thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the\nend of those thousand miles. One must have the prospect of a promised\nland to have the strength to move.\n\nThe promised land for the French during their advance had been Moscow,\nduring their retreat it was their native land. But that native land\nwas too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely\nnecessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cToday I\nshall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I shall rest and\nspend the night,\xe2\x80\x9d and during the first day\xe2\x80\x99s journey that resting place\neclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires. And\nthe impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd.\n\nFor the French retreating along the old Smol\xc3\xa9nsk road, the final\ngoal\xe2\x80\x94their native land\xe2\x80\x94was too remote, and their immediate goal\nwas Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously\nintensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that\nmuch food and fresh troops awaited them in Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, nor that they were\ntold so (on the contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon himself,\nknew that provisions were scarce there), but because this alone could\ngive them strength to move on and endure their present privations. So\nboth those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves, and\npushed on to Smol\xc3\xa9nsk as to a promised land.\n\nComing out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising energy\nand unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. Besides the\ncommon impulse which bound the whole crowd of French into one mass and\nsupplied them with a certain energy, there was another cause binding\nthem together\xe2\x80\x94their great numbers. As with the physical law of gravity,\ntheir enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself. In their\nhundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation.\n\nEach of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner\nto escape from all this horror and misery; but on the one hand the force\nof this common attraction to Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, their goal, drew each of them in\nthe same direction; on the other hand an army corps could not surrender\nto a company, and though the French availed themselves of every\nconvenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the\nslightest decent pretext, such pretexts did not always occur. Their\nvery numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that\npossibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the\nRussians to stop this movement, to which the French were directing all\ntheir energies. Beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the\nbody could hasten the process of decomposition.\n\nA lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a certain\nlimit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow. On\nthe contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow\nbecomes.\n\nOf the Russian commanders Kut\xc3\xbazov alone understood this. When the flight\nof the French army along the Smol\xc3\xa9nsk road became well defined, what\nKonovn\xc3\xadtsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of October began\nto occur. The superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves,\nto cut off, to seize, to capture, and to overthrow the French, and all\nclamored for action.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited in the\ncase of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.\n\nHe could not tell them what we say now: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy fight, why block the road,\nlosing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches? What\nis the use of that, when a third of their army has melted away on the\nroad from Moscow to Vy\xc3\xa1zma without any battle?\xe2\x80\x9d But drawing from his\naged wisdom what they could understand, he told them of the golden\nbridge, and they laughed at and slandered him, flinging themselves on,\nrending and exulting over the dying beast.\n\nErm\xc3\xb3lov, Milor\xc3\xa1dovich, Pl\xc3\xa1tov, and others in proximity to the French\nnear Vy\xc3\xa1zma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two\nFrench corps, and by way of reporting their intention to Kut\xc3\xbazov they\nsent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope.\n\nAnd try as Kut\xc3\xbazov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked,\ntrying to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced to the\nattack with music and with drums beating, and killed and lost thousands\nof men.\n\nBut they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French army,\nclosing up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily melting\naway, to pursue its fatal path to Smol\xc3\xa9nsk.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN: 1812\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nThe Battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, with the occupation of Moscow that followed it\nand the flight of the French without further conflicts, is one of the\nmost instructive phenomena in history.\n\nAll historians agree that the external activity of states and nations\nin their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars, and that as a\ndirect result of greater or less success in war the political strength\nof states and nations increases or decreases.\n\nStrange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor,\nhaving quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\narmy, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten thousand men, and\nsubjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions, all\nthe facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm the truth of the\nstatement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another\nis the cause, or at least an essential indication, of an increase or\ndecrease in the strength of the nation\xe2\x80\x94even though it is unintelligible\nwhy the defeat of an army\xe2\x80\x94a hundredth part of a nation\xe2\x80\x94should oblige\nthat whole nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the\nrights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the\ndefeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its\nrights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army\nsuffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.\n\nSo according to history it has been found from the most ancient times,\nand so it is to our own day. All Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s wars serve to confirm this\nrule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses\nits rights, and the rights and the strength of France increase. The\nvictories of the French at Jena and Auerst\xc3\xa4dt destroy the independent\nexistence of Prussia.\n\nBut then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow is\ntaken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia that\nceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and\nthen Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of\nhistory: to say that the field of battle at Borodin\xc3\xb3 remained in the\nhands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles\nthat destroyed Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army, is impossible.\n\nAfter the French victory at Borodin\xc3\xb3 there was no general engagement nor\nany that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist. What\ndoes this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China,\nwe might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the\nhistorians\xe2\x80\x99 usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards);\nif the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number\nof troops took part, we might treat it as an exception; but this event\noccurred before our fathers\xe2\x80\x99 eyes, and for them it was a question of the\nlife or death of their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest of\nall known wars.\n\nThe period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3 to the\nexpulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not\nproduce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest;\nit proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in\nthe conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else.\n\nThe French historians, describing the condition of the French army\nbefore it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army,\nexcept the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport\xe2\x80\x94there was no forage\nfor the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could remedy,\nfor the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the\nFrench have it.\n\nThe victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants\nKarp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their\ncarts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest\nany heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such\npeasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered\nthem, but burned it instead.\n\nLet us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers\naccording to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has\ngone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself\nwounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his\nlife, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to\nhand begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine that the combatant who\nso sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was\nat the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to\nconceal the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory\nwith the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what\nconfusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel.\n\nThe fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was\nthe French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up\nthe cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter\naccording to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described\nthe event.\n\nAfter the burning of Smol\xc3\xa9nsk a war began which did not follow any\nprevious traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the\nretreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodin\xc3\xb3 and the renewed\nretreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of\ntransports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.\n\nNapoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing\nattitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s rapier saw a cudgel\nraised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kut\xc3\xbazov and to\nthe Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all\nthe rules\xe2\x80\x94as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of the\ncomplaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in\nspite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather\ndisgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en\nquarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit\nthrust en prime, and so on\xe2\x80\x94the cudgel of the people\xe2\x80\x99s war was lifted\nwith all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting\nanyone\xe2\x80\x99s tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and\nfell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French\ntill the whole invasion had perished.\n\nAnd it is well for a people who do not\xe2\x80\x94as the French did in 1813\xe2\x80\x94salute\naccording to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their\nrapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous conqueror,\nbut at the moment of trial, without asking what rules others have\nadopted in similar cases, simply and easily pick up the first cudgel\nthat comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and\nrevenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOne of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so-called\nlaws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed\ntogether in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars that take on a\nnational character. In such actions, instead of two crowds opposing\neach other, the men disperse, attack singly, run away when attacked by\nstronger forces, but again attack when opportunity offers. This was done\nby the guerrillas in Spain, by the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, and\nby the Russians in 1812.\n\nPeople have called this kind of war \xe2\x80\x9cguerrilla warfare\xe2\x80\x9d and assume that\nby so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a war does\nnot fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule\nof tactics which is accepted as infallible. That rule says that an\nattacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his\nopponent at the moment of conflict.\n\nGuerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly infringes\nthat rule.\n\nThis contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes\nthe strength of an army to be identical with its numbers. Military\nscience says that the more troops the greater the strength. Les gros\nbataillons ont toujours raison. *\n\n    * Large battalions are always victorious.\n\nFor military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics\nby reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal\nto each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal.\n\nMomentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.\n\nIn military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass\nand some unknown x.\n\nMilitary science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact\nthat the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that\nsmall detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the existence\nof this unknown factor and tries to discover it\xe2\x80\x94now in a geometric\nformation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most usually, in the\ngenius of the commanders. But the assignment of these various meanings\nto the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic\nfacts.\n\nYet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to gratify\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cheroes\xe2\x80\x9d) of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by\ncommanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.\n\nThat unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the\ngreater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men\ncomposing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are not,\nfighting under the command of a genius, in two\xe2\x80\x94or three-line formation,\nwith cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute. Men\nwho want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous\nconditions for fighting.\n\nThe spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives\nthe resulting force. To define and express the significance of this\nunknown factor\xe2\x80\x94the spirit of an army\xe2\x80\x94is a problem for science.\n\nThis problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute\nfor the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes\napparent\xe2\x80\x94such as the commands of the general, the equipment employed,\nand so on\xe2\x80\x94mistaking these for the real significance of the factor,\nand if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being\nthe greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger. Only then,\nexpressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative\nsignificance of this factor, can we hope to define the unknown.\n\nTen men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions, or\ndivisions, conquer\xe2\x80\x94that is, kill or take captive\xe2\x80\x94all the others, while\nthemselves losing four, so that on the one side four and on the other\nfifteen were lost. Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen, and\ntherefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This equation does not\ngive us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two\nunknowns. And by bringing variously selected historic units (battles,\ncampaigns, periods of war) into such equations, a series of numbers\ncould be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be\ndiscovered.\n\nThe tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking, and\nin smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth that the\nstrength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men forward under\nfire more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed\nthan is needed to resist attacks. But this rule which leaves out of\naccount the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in\nparticularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or\nfall in the spirit of the troops occurs, as in all national wars.\n\nThe French, retreating in 1812\xe2\x80\x94though according to tactics they should\nhave separated into detachments to defend themselves\xe2\x80\x94congregated into\na mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass\nheld the army together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought according\nto tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up\ninto small units, because their spirit had so risen that separate\nindividuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing\nany compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and\ndangers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk.\n\nBefore partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the\ngovernment, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had\nbeen destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off\nas instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. Den\xc3\xads Dav\xc3\xbddov,\nwith his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the value of\nthis terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science\ndestroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit for taking the first\nstep toward regularizing this method of warfare.\n\nOn August 24 Dav\xc3\xbddov\xe2\x80\x99s first partisan detachment was formed and then\nothers were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more\nnumerous these detachments became.\n\nThe irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the\nfallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree\xe2\x80\x94the\nFrench army\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when\nthe French were fleeing toward Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, there were hundreds of such\ncompanies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that adopted\nall the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and the\ncomforts of life. Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry. There were\nalso small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and\nlandowners that remained unknown. A sacristan commanded one party which\ncaptured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month; and there\nwas Vas\xc3\xadlisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew hundreds of the\nFrench.\n\nThe partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of\nOctober. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves,\namazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded\nand captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling,\nhardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the end\nof October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had become\nclear to all what could be ventured against the French and what could\nnot. Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and moving\naccording to rules at a distance from the French, still regarded many\nthings as impossible. The small bands that had started their activities\nlong before and had already observed the French closely considered\nthings possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare\nto contemplate. The Cossacks and peasants who crept in among the French\nnow considered everything possible.\n\nOn October 22, Den\xc3\xadsov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his\ngroup at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morning he\nand his party had been on the move. All day long he had been watching\nfrom the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of\ncavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the\narmy, which\xe2\x80\x94as was learned from spies and prisoners\xe2\x80\x94was moving under a\nstrong escort to Smol\xc3\xa9nsk. Besides Den\xc3\xadsov and D\xc3\xb3lokhov (who also led\na small party and moved in Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s vicinity), the commanders of some\nlarge divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and, as Den\xc3\xadsov\nexpressed it, were sharpening their teeth for it. Two of the commanders\nof large parties\xe2\x80\x94one a Pole and the other a German\xe2\x80\x94sent invitations\nto Den\xc3\xadsov almost simultaneously, requesting him to join up with their\ndivisions to attack the convoy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov on reading\nthese documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite his heartfelt\ndesire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general, he had to forgo\nthat pleasure because he was already under the command of the Polish\ngeneral. To the Polish general he replied to the same effect, informing\nhim that he was already under the command of the German.\n\nHaving arranged matters thus, Den\xc3\xadsov and D\xc3\xb3lokhov intended, without\nreporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that\nconvoy with their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from\nthe village of Mik\xc3\xbalino to that of Sh\xc3\xa1mshevo. To the left of the road\nbetween Mik\xc3\xbalino and Sh\xc3\xa1mshevo there were large forests, extending in\nsome places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back\nfrom it. Through these forests Den\xc3\xadsov and his party rode all day,\nsometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very\nedge, but never losing sight of the moving French. That morning,\nCossacks of Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s party had seized and carried off into the forest\ntwo wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck in the mud not\nfar from Mik\xc3\xbalino where the forest ran close to the road. Since then,\nand until evening, the party had watched the movements of the French\nwithout attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach Sh\xc3\xa1mshevo\nquietly without alarming them and then, after joining D\xc3\xb3lokhov who was\nto come that evening to a consultation at a watchman\xe2\x80\x99s hut in the forest\nless than a mile from Sh\xc3\xa1mshevo, to surprise the French at dawn, falling\nlike an avalanche on their heads from two sides, and rout and capture\nthem all at one blow.\n\nIn their rear, more than a mile from Mik\xc3\xbalino where the forest came\nright up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh\ncolumns of French should show themselves.\n\nBeyond Sh\xc3\xa1mshevo, D\xc3\xb3lokhov was to observe the road in the same way, to\nfind out at what distance there were other French troops. They reckoned\nthat the convoy had fifteen hundred men. Den\xc3\xadsov had two hundred, and\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of numbers did not\ndeter Den\xc3\xadsov. All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were\nand to learn that he had to capture a \xe2\x80\x9ctongue\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, a man from\nthe enemy column. That morning\xe2\x80\x99s attack on the wagons had been made so\nhastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a\nlittle drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was a straggler he\ncould tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of\nputting the whole column on the alert, so he sent T\xc3\xadkhon Shcherb\xc3\xa1ty, a\npeasant of his party, to Sh\xc3\xa1mshevo to try and seize at least one of the\nFrench quartermasters who had been sent on in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIt was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were both\nthe color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and then\nsuddenly heavy slanting rain came down.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down\nwas riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. Like his horse,\nwhich turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving\nrain and gazed anxiously before him. His thin face with its short, thick\nblack beard looked angry.\n\nBeside Den\xc3\xadsov rode an esaul, * Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s fellow worker, also in felt\ncloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.\n\n    * A captain of Cossacks.\n\nEsaul Lov\xc3\xa1yski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,\npale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm\nself-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was impossible to\nsay in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first\nglance at the esaul and Den\xc3\xadsov one saw that the latter was wet and\nuncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse, while looking at the\nesaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always\nand that he was not a man who had mounted a horse, but a man who was one\nwith his horse, a being consequently possessed of twofold strength.\n\nA little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and\nwearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.\n\nA little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirgh\xc3\xadz mount with an enormous\ntail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue\nFrench overcoat.\n\nBeside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform and\nblue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on to the\nhussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed about him\nwith surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that morning.\n\nBehind them along the narrow, sodden, cut up forest road came hussars in\nthrees and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in French\ngreatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The horses,\nbeing drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay.\nTheir necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely\nthin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles, reins, were all wet,\nslippery, and sodden, like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed\nthe road. The men sat huddled up trying not to stir, so as to warm the\nwater that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold\nwater that was leaking in under their seats, their knees, and at the\nback of their necks. In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two\nwagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had\nbeen hitched on in front, rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and\nsplashed through the water that lay in the ruts.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped\nhis rider\xe2\x80\x99s knee against a tree.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Den\xc3\xadsov angrily, and showing his teeth he\nstruck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and his\ncomrades with mud.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger\n(none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more because he\nstill had no news from D\xc3\xb3lokhov and the man sent to capture a \xe2\x80\x9ctongue\xe2\x80\x9d\nhad not returned.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99ll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it off till\nanother day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey\nfrom under our noses,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Den\xc3\xadsov, continually peering forward,\nhoping to see a messenger from D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\nOn coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the\nright, Den\xc3\xadsov stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s someone coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nThe esaul looked in the direction Den\xc3\xadsov indicated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is not presupposable\nthat it is the lieutenant colonel himself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the esaul, who was fond\nof using words the Cossacks did not know.\n\nThe approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer\nvisible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary\ngallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and\ndrenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him,\nstanding in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young\nlad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to Den\xc3\xadsov\nand handed him a sodden envelope.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the general,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease excuse its not being quite\ndry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, they kept telling us: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous, it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid the officer, addressing the esaul while Den\xc3\xadsov was reading the\ndispatch. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Komar\xc3\xb3v and I\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he pointed to the Cossack\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwere prepared.\nWe have each of us two pistols.... But what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, noticing\nthe French drummer boy. \xe2\x80\x9cA prisoner? You\xe2\x80\x99ve already been in action? May\nI speak to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWost\xc3\xb3v! P\xc3\xa9tya!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Den\xc3\xadsov, having run through the dispatch.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say who you were?\xe2\x80\x9d and turning with a smile he held out\nhis hand to the lad.\n\nThe officer was P\xc3\xa9tya Rost\xc3\xb3v.\n\nAll the way P\xc3\xa9tya had been preparing himself to behave with Den\xc3\xadsov as\nbefitted a grown-up man and an officer\xe2\x80\x94without hinting at their previous\nacquaintance. But as soon as Den\xc3\xadsov smiled at him P\xc3\xa9tya brightened\nup, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner he had been\nrehearsing, and began telling him how he had already been in a battle\nnear Vy\xc3\xa1zma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov interrupted him, and his face\nagain assumed its anxious expression.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael Feokl\xc3\xadtych,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the esaul, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is again fwom that\nGerman, you know. He\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he indicated P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis serving under him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Den\xc3\xadsov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a\nrepetition of the German general\xe2\x80\x99s demand that he should join forces\nwith him for an attack on the transport.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t take it tomowwow, he\xe2\x80\x99ll snatch it fwom under our noses,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded.\n\nWhile Den\xc3\xadsov was talking to the esaul, P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x94abashed by Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s\ncold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his\ntrousers\xe2\x80\x94furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so\nthat no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial an air as\npossible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill there be any orders, your honor?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Den\xc3\xadsov, holding his\nhand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for\nwhich he had prepared himself, \xe2\x80\x9cor shall I remain with your honor?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrders?\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov repeated thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cBut can you stay till\ntomowwow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please... May I stay with you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\nDen\xc3\xadsov.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya blushed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me no instructions. I think I could?\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, inquiringly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all wight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\nAnd turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place\narranged near the watchman\xe2\x80\x99s hut in the forest, and told the officer on\nthe Kirgh\xc3\xadz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant) to go and\nfind out where D\xc3\xb3lokhov was and whether he would come that evening.\nDen\xc3\xadsov himself intended going with the esaul and P\xc3\xa9tya to the edge of\nthe forest where it reached out to Sh\xc3\xa1mshevo, to have a look at the part\nof the French bivouac they were to attack next day.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the peasant guide, \xe2\x80\x9clead us to\nSh\xc3\xa1mshevo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov, P\xc3\xa9tya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and the\nhussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the\nedge of the forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from\nthe trees. Den\xc3\xadsov, the esaul, and P\xc3\xa9tya rode silently, following the\npeasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned toes\nand moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves,\nsilently led them to the edge of the forest.\n\nHe ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to where\nthe screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree that\nhad not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to\nthem with his hand.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov and P\xc3\xa9tya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant was\nstanding they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest, on a\ndownward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a steep\nravine, was a small village and a landowner\xe2\x80\x99s house with a broken roof.\nIn the village, in the house, in the garden, by the well, by the pond,\nover all the rising ground, and all along the road uphill from the\nbridge leading to the village, not more than five hundred yards\naway, crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist. Their\nun-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the\ncarts, and their calls to one another, could be clearly heard.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBwing the prisoner here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov in a low voice, not taking his\neyes off the French.\n\nA Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to Den\xc3\xadsov.\nPointing to the French troops, Den\xc3\xadsov asked him what these and those\nof them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and\nlifting his eyebrows, looked at Den\xc3\xadsov in affright, but in spite of\nan evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers, merely\nassenting to everything Den\xc3\xadsov asked him. Den\xc3\xadsov turned away from him\nfrowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now\nat Den\xc3\xadsov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village and\nalong the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether D\xc3\xb3lokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov with\na merry sparkle in his eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very suitable spot,\xe2\x80\x9d said the esaul.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll send the infantwy down by the swamps,\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov continued.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll cweep up to the garden; you\xe2\x80\x99ll wide up fwom there with the\nCossacks\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I\nwith my hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hollow is impassable\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a swamp there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the esaul. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\nhorses would sink. We must ride round more to the left....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhile they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded\nfrom the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then\nanother, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices\nshouting together came up from the slope. For a moment Den\xc3\xadsov and the\nesaul drew back. They were so near that they thought they were the cause\nof the firing and shouting. But the firing and shouting did not relate\nto them. Down below, a man wearing something red was running through the\nmarsh. The French were evidently firing and shouting at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s our T\xc3\xadkhon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the esaul.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is! It is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wascal!\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll get away!\xe2\x80\x9d said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.\n\nThe man whom they called T\xc3\xadkhon, having run to the stream, plunged in\nso that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared for an\ninstant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet, and ran on.\nThe French who had been pursuing him stopped.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmart, that!\xe2\x80\x9d said the esaul.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a beast!\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov with his former look of vexation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has\nhe been doing all this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s our plast\xc3\xban. I sent him to capture a \xe2\x80\x98tongue.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya, nodding at the first words Den\xc3\xadsov uttered as if\nhe understood it all, though he really did not understand anything of\nit.\n\nT\xc3\xadkhon Shcherb\xc3\xa1ty was one of the most indispensable men in their band.\nHe was a peasant from Pokr\xc3\xb3vsk, near the river Gzhat. When Den\xc3\xadsov had\ncome to Pokr\xc3\xb3vsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual\nsummoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the French,\nthe elder, as though shielding himself, had replied, as all village\nelders did, that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them. But\nwhen Den\xc3\xadsov explained that his purpose was to kill the French, and\nasked if no French had strayed that way, the elder replied that some\n\xe2\x80\x9cmore-orderers\xe2\x80\x9d had really been at their village, but that T\xc3\xadkhon\nShcherb\xc3\xa1ty was the only man who dealt with such matters. Den\xc3\xadsov had\nT\xc3\xadkhon called and, having praised him for his activity, said a few words\nin the elder\xe2\x80\x99s presence about loyalty to the Tsar and the country and\nthe hatred of the French that all sons of the fatherland should cherish.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t do the French any harm,\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xadkhon, evidently frightened by\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s words. \xe2\x80\x9cWe only fooled about with the lads for fun, you know!\nWe killed a score or so of \xe2\x80\x98more-orderers,\xe2\x80\x99 but we did no harm else....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext day when Den\xc3\xadsov had left Pokr\xc3\xb3vsk, having quite forgotten about\nthis peasant, it was reported to him that T\xc3\xadkhon had attached himself\nto their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it. Den\xc3\xadsov gave\norders to let him do so.\n\nT\xc3\xadkhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching water,\nflaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking and aptitude\nfor partisan warfare. At night he would go out for booty and always\nbrought back French clothing and weapons, and when told to would bring\nin French captives also. Den\xc3\xadsov then relieved him from drudgery and\nbegan taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him\nenrolled among the Cossacks.\n\nT\xc3\xadkhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging\nbehind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried\nrather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf uses\nits teeth, with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching\nthick bones. T\xc3\xadkhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at\narm\xe2\x80\x99s length, or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs\nor carve spoons. In Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s party he held a peculiar and exceptional\nposition. When anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be\ndone\xe2\x80\x94to push a cart out of the mud with one\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, pull a horse\nout of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or walk\nmore than thirty miles in a day\xe2\x80\x94everybody pointed laughingly at T\xc3\xadkhon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt that devil\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s as strong as a horse!\xe2\x80\x9d they said of him.\n\nOnce a Frenchman T\xc3\xadkhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him\nand shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which T\xc3\xadkhon\ntreated only with internal and external applications of vodka) was the\nsubject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment\xe2\x80\x94jokes in which\nT\xc3\xadkhon readily joined.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?\xe2\x80\x9d the Cossacks would banter\nhim. And T\xc3\xadkhon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended to be\nangry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only effect\nof this incident on T\xc3\xadkhon was that after being wounded he seldom\nbrought in prisoners.\n\nHe was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found more\nopportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more Frenchmen,\nand consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars\nand willingly accepted that role. Now he had been sent by Den\xc3\xadsov\novernight to Sh\xc3\xa1mshevo to capture a \xe2\x80\x9ctongue.\xe2\x80\x9d But whether because he\nhad not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept\nthrough the night, he had crept by day into some bushes right among the\nFrench and, as Den\xc3\xadsov had witnessed from above, had been detected by\nthem.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAfter talking for some time with the esaul about next day\xe2\x80\x99s attack,\nwhich now, seeing how near they were to the French, he seemed to have\ndefinitely decided on, Den\xc3\xadsov turned his horse and rode back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my lad, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go and get dwy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\nAs they approached the watchhouse Den\xc3\xadsov stopped, peering into the\nforest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging arms,\nwearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kaz\xc3\xa1n hat, was approaching\nwith long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax\nstuck in his girdle. When he espied Den\xc3\xadsov he hastily threw something\ninto the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and\napproached his commander. It was T\xc3\xadkhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked\nface and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He\nlifted his head high and gazed at Den\xc3\xadsov as if repressing a laugh.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, where did you disappear to?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,\xe2\x80\x9d answered T\xc3\xadkhon\nboldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well, why\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t you taken one?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I took one all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xadkhon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I took him first thing at dawn,\xe2\x80\x9d T\xc3\xadkhon continued, spreading\nout his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes. \xe2\x80\x9cI took him\ninto the forest. Then I see he\xe2\x80\x99s no good and think I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and fetch a\nlikelier one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see?... What a wogue\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s just as I thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov to the\nesaul. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you bwing that one?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the good of bringing him?\xe2\x80\x9d T\xc3\xadkhon interrupted hastily and\nangrily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat one wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done for you. As if I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\nsort you want!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a bwute you are!... Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went for another one,\xe2\x80\x9d T\xc3\xadkhon continued, \xe2\x80\x9cand I crept like this\nthrough the wood and lay down.\xe2\x80\x9d (He suddenly lay down on his stomach\nwith a supple movement to show how he had done it.) \xe2\x80\x9cOne turned up and\nI grabbed him, like this.\xe2\x80\x9d (He jumped up quickly and lightly.) \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Come\nalong to the colonel,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. He starts yelling, and suddenly there\nwere four of them. They rushed at me with their little swords. So I went\nfor them with my ax, this way: \xe2\x80\x98What are you up to?\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98Christ\nbe with you!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d shouted T\xc3\xadkhon, waving his arms with an angry scowl and\nthrowing out his chest.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the\npuddles!\xe2\x80\x9d said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained from\nlaughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from T\xc3\xadkhon\xe2\x80\x99s face to the esaul\xe2\x80\x99s\nand Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s, unable to make out what it all meant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t play the fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov, coughing angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\nbwing the first one?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nT\xc3\xadkhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other,\nthen suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin,\ndisclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called\nShcherb\xc3\xa1ty\xe2\x80\x94the gap-toothed). Den\xc3\xadsov smiled, and P\xc3\xa9tya burst into a peal\nof merry laughter in which T\xc3\xadkhon himself joined.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xadkhon. \xe2\x80\x9cThe clothes\non him\xe2\x80\x94poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your honor! Why,\nhe says: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m a general\xe2\x80\x99s son myself, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go!\xe2\x80\x99 he says.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a bwute!\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to question...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I questioned him,\xe2\x80\x9d said T\xc3\xadkhon. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know much.\n\xe2\x80\x98There are a lot of us,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98but all poor stuff\xe2\x80\x94only soldiers in\nname,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98Shout loud at them,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98and you\xe2\x80\x99ll take\nthem all,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d T\xc3\xadkhon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into\nDen\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a hundwed sharp lashes\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to play the\nfool!\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov severely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why are you angry?\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated T\xc3\xadkhon, \xe2\x80\x9cjust as if I\xe2\x80\x99d never seen\nyour Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark and I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch you any of\nthem you want\xe2\x80\x94three if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let\xe2\x80\x99s go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov, and rode all the way to the watchhouse\nin silence and frowning angrily.\n\nT\xc3\xadkhon followed behind and P\xc3\xa9tya heard the Cossacks laughing with him\nand at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes.\n\nWhen the fit of laughter that had seized him at T\xc3\xadkhon\xe2\x80\x99s words and smile\nhad passed and P\xc3\xa9tya realized for a moment that this T\xc3\xadkhon had killed a\nman, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt\na pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted only a moment. He felt\nit necessary to hold his head higher, to brace himself, and to question\nthe esaul with an air of importance about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s undertaking, that\nhe might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself.\n\nThe officer who had been sent to inquire met Den\xc3\xadsov on the way with the\nnews that D\xc3\xb3lokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov at once cheered up and, calling P\xc3\xa9tya to him, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, tell\nme about yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow, joined\nhis regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a\nlarge guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his commission,\nand especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in\nthe battle of Vy\xc3\xa1zma, P\xc3\xa9tya had been in a constant state of blissful\nexcitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to\nmiss any chance to do something really heroic. He was highly delighted\nwith what he saw and experienced in the army, but at the same time\nit always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being\nperformed just where he did not happen to be. And he was always in a\nhurry to get where he was not.\n\nWhen on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send\nsomebody to Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s detachment, P\xc3\xa9tya begged so piteously to be sent\nthat the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he recalled\nP\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s mad action at the battle of Vy\xc3\xa1zma, where instead of riding by\nthe road to the place to which he had been sent, he had galloped to the\nadvanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired\nhis pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any\naction whatever of Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s. That was why P\xc3\xa9tya had blushed and grown\nconfused when Den\xc3\xadsov asked him whether he could stay. Before they had\nridden to the outskirts of the forest P\xc3\xa9tya had considered he must carry\nout his instructions strictly and return at once. But when he saw the\nFrench and saw T\xc3\xadkhon and learned that there would certainly be an\nattack that night, he decided, with the rapidity with which young people\nchange their views, that the general, whom he had greatly respected till\nthen, was a rubbishy German, that Den\xc3\xadsov was a hero, the esaul a hero,\nand T\xc3\xadkhon a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave\nthem at a moment of difficulty.\n\nIt was already growing dusk when Den\xc3\xadsov, P\xc3\xa9tya, and the esaul rode up\nto the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be seen, and\nCossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and\nwere kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the French\ncould not see the smoke. In the passage of the small watchhouse a\nCossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton. In the room\nthree officers of Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s band were converting a door into a tabletop.\nP\xc3\xa9tya took off his wet clothes, gave them to be dried, and at once began\nhelping the officers to fix up the dinner table.\n\nIn ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the\ntable were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.\n\nSitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton\nwith his hands, down which the grease trickled, P\xc3\xa9tya was in an ecstatic\nchildish state of love for all men, and consequently of confidence that\nothers loved him in the same way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then what do you think, Vas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Den\xc3\xadsov. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\nall right my staying a day with you?\xe2\x80\x9d And not waiting for a reply he\nanswered his own question: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see I was told to find out\xe2\x80\x94well, I am\nfinding out.... Only do let me into the very... into the chief... I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want a reward.... But I want...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head and\nflourishing his arms.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cInto the vewy chief...\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov repeated with a smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly, please let me command something, so that I may really command...\xe2\x80\x9d\nP\xc3\xa9tya went on. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would it be to you?... Oh, you want a knife?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton.\n\nAnd he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease keep it. I have several like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya, blushing.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavens! I was quite forgetting!\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI have some\nraisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler and\nhe has such capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to something\nsweet. Would you like some?...\xe2\x80\x9d and P\xc3\xa9tya ran out into the passage to\nhis Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds\nof raisins. \xe2\x80\x9cHave some, gentlemen, have some!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want a coffeepot, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the esaul. \xe2\x80\x9cI bought a\ncapital one from our sutler! He has splendid things. And he\xe2\x80\x99s very\nhonest, that\xe2\x80\x99s the chief thing. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to send it to you. Or\nperhaps your flints are giving out, or are worn out\xe2\x80\x94that happens\nsometimes, you know. I have brought some with me, here they are\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he\nshowed a bag\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. Please take as\nmany as you want, or all if you like....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, P\xc3\xa9tya stopped and\nblushed.\n\nHe tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was\nfoolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered the French\ndrummer boy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s capital for us here, but what of him? Where have they\nput him? Have they fed him? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t they hurt his feelings?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\nBut having caught himself saying too much about the flints, he was now\nafraid to speak out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might ask,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they\xe2\x80\x99ll say: \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a boy himself and so\nhe pities the boy.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ll show them tomorrow whether I\xe2\x80\x99m a boy. Will it\nseem odd if I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d P\xc3\xa9tya thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind!\xe2\x80\x9d and immediately,\nblushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared\nironical, he said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to\neat?... Perhaps...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s a poor little fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov, who evidently saw\nnothing shameful in this reminder. \xe2\x80\x9cCall him in. His name is Vincent\nBosse. Have him fetched.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call him,\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov repeated.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya was standing at the door when Den\xc3\xadsov said this. He slipped in\nbetween the officers, came close to Den\xc3\xadsov, and said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd having kissed Den\xc3\xadsov he ran out of the hut.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBosse! Vincent!\xe2\x80\x9d P\xc3\xa9tya cried, stopping outside the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho do you want, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a voice in the darkness.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured that\nday.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Ves\xc3\xa9nny?\xe2\x80\x9d said a Cossack.\n\nVincent, the boy\xe2\x80\x99s name, had already been changed by the Cossacks into\nVes\xc3\xa9nny (vernal) and into Ves\xc3\xa9nya by the peasants and soldiers. In both\nthese adaptations the reference to spring (vesn\xc3\xa1) matched the impression\nmade by the young lad.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, Ves\xc3\xa9nya!\nVes\xc3\xa9nya!\xe2\x80\x94Ves\xc3\xa9nny!\xe2\x80\x9d laughing voices were heard calling to one another in\nthe darkness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a smart lad,\xe2\x80\x9d said an hussar standing near P\xc3\xa9tya. \xe2\x80\x9cWe gave him\nsomething to eat a while ago. He was awfully hungry!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the\ndarkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, c\xe2\x80\x99est vous!\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya. \xe2\x80\x9cVoulez-vous manger? N\xe2\x80\x99ayez pas peur, on\nne vous fera pas de mal,\xe2\x80\x9d * he added shyly and affectionately, touching\nthe boy\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cEntrez, entrez.\xe2\x80\x9d *(2)\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cAh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you! Do you want something to eat? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be\n     afraid, they won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * (2) \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMerci, monsieur,\xe2\x80\x9d * said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish\nvoice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThere were many things P\xc3\xa9tya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but did\nnot dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then in\nthe darkness he took the boy\xe2\x80\x99s hand and pressed it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, come in!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated in a gentle whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what can I do\nfor him?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in first.\n\nWhen the boy had entered the hut, P\xc3\xa9tya sat down at a distance from\nhim, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him. But\nhe fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem\nridiculous to give some to the drummer boy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe arrival of D\xc3\xb3lokhov diverted P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s attention from the drummer boy,\nto whom Den\xc3\xadsov had had some mutton and vodka given, and whom he had had\ndressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and\nnot sent away with the other prisoners. P\xc3\xa9tya had heard in the army many\nstories of D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the\nFrench, so from the moment he entered the hut P\xc3\xa9tya did not take his\neyes from him, but braced himself up more and more and held his head\nhigh, that he might not be unworthy even of such company.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s appearance amazed P\xc3\xa9tya by its simplicity.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas the\nWonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and everything he\ndid indicated his unusual position. But D\xc3\xb3lokhov, who in Moscow had worn\na Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most correct officer of\nthe Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman\xe2\x80\x99s padded coat with\nan Order of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set\nstraight on his head. He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of\nthe room, and without greeting anyone went up to Den\xc3\xadsov and began\nquestioning him about the matter in hand. Den\xc3\xadsov told him of the\ndesigns the large detachments had on the transport, of the message P\xc3\xa9tya\nhad brought, and his own replies to both generals. Then he told him all\nhe knew of the French detachment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so. But we must know what troops they are and their numbers,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid D\xc3\xb3lokhov. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be necessary to go there. We can\xe2\x80\x99t start the\naffair without knowing for certain how many there are. I like to work\naccurately. Here now\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t one of these gentlemen like to ride over\nto the French camp with me? I have brought a spare uniform.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, I... I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need for you to go at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Den\xc3\xadsov, addressing\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov, \xe2\x80\x9cand as for him, I won\xe2\x80\x99t let him go on any account.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed P\xc3\xa9tya. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\nall. You\xe2\x80\x99ll take me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning to D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of the\nFrench drummer boy. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you had that youngster with you long?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nasked Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was taken today but he knows nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99m keeping him with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and where do you put the others?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? I send them away and take a weceipt for them,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Den\xc3\xadsov,\nsuddenly flushing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I say boldly that I have not a single man\xe2\x80\x99s life\non my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or\nthwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of staining\xe2\x80\x94I speak\nbluntly\xe2\x80\x94staining the honor of a soldier?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of\nsixteen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov with cold irony, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s time for you to drop\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not said anything! I only say that I\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly go with\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya shyly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for you and me, old fellow, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to drop these amenities,\xe2\x80\x9d\ncontinued D\xc3\xb3lokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of\nthis subject which irritated Den\xc3\xadsov. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, why have you kept this lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe went on, swaying his head. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are sorry for him! Don\xe2\x80\x99t we\nknow those \xe2\x80\x98receipts\xe2\x80\x99 of yours? You send a hundred men away, and thirty\nget there. The rest either starve or get killed. So isn\xe2\x80\x99t it all the\nsame not to send them?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss the matter. I do not\nwish to take it on my conscience. You say they\xe2\x80\x99ll die. All wight. Only\nnot by my fault!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov began laughing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if\nthey did catch me they\xe2\x80\x99d string me up to an aspen tree, and with all\nyour chivalry just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, we must get to work.\nTell the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms in it.\nWell, are you coming with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Yes, yes, certainly!\xe2\x80\x9d cried P\xc3\xa9tya, blushing almost to tears and\nglancing at Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\nWhile D\xc3\xb3lokhov had been disputing with Den\xc3\xadsov what should be done with\nprisoners, P\xc3\xa9tya had once more felt awkward and restless; but again he\nhad no time to grasp fully what they were talking about. \xe2\x80\x9cIf grown-up,\ndistinguished men think so, it must be necessary and right,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut above all Den\xc3\xadsov must not dare to imagine that I\xe2\x80\x99ll obey him and\nthat he can order me about. I will certainly go to the French camp with\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov. If he can, so can I!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd to all Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s persuasions, P\xc3\xa9tya replied that he too was\naccustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that he\nnever considered personal danger.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you\xe2\x80\x99ll admit that if we don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure how many of them there\nare... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are only two\nof us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go, so don\xe2\x80\x99t\nhinder me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will only make things worse....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nHaving put on French greatcoats and shakos, P\xc3\xa9tya and D\xc3\xb3lokhov rode to\nthe clearing from which Den\xc3\xadsov had reconnoitered the French camp,\nand emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the\nhollow. On reaching the bottom, D\xc3\xb3lokhov told the Cossacks accompanying\nhim to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the\nbridge. P\xc3\xa9tya, his heart in his mouth with excitement, rode by his side.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re caught, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be taken alive! I have a pistol,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered\nhe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk Russian,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov in a hurried whisper, and at that\nvery moment they heard through the darkness the challenge: \xe2\x80\x9cQui vive?\xe2\x80\x9d *\nand the click of a musket.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe blood rushed to P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s face and he grasped his pistol.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLanciers du 6-me,\xe2\x80\x9d * replied D\xc3\xb3lokhov, neither hastening nor slackening\nhis horse\xe2\x80\x99s pace.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cLancers of the 6th Regiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThe black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMot d\xe2\x80\x99ordre.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cPassword.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDites donc, le colonel G\xc3\xa9rard est ici?\xe2\x80\x9d * he asked.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, is Colonel G\xc3\xa9rard here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMot d\xe2\x80\x99ordre,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not replying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas le\nmot d\xe2\x80\x99ordre...\xe2\x80\x9d cried D\xc3\xb3lokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight\nat the sentinel. \xe2\x80\x9cJe vous demande si le colonel est ici.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cWhen an officer is making his round, sentinels don\xe2\x80\x99t ask\n     him for the password.... I am asking you if the colonel is\n     here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAnd without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped\naside, D\xc3\xb3lokhov rode up the incline at a walk.\n\nNoticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, D\xc3\xb3lokhov stopped\nhim and inquired where the commander and officers were. The man,\na soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in\na friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up\nthe hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he called the\nlandowner\xe2\x80\x99s house.\n\nHaving ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk could be\nheard around the campfires, D\xc3\xb3lokhov turned into the courtyard of the\nlandowner\xe2\x80\x99s house. Having ridden in, he dismounted and approached a\nbig blazing campfire, around which sat several men talking noisily.\nSomething was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and\na soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by the fire, was\nkneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a hard nut to crack,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the officers who was sitting\nin the shadow at the other side of the fire.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll make them get a move on, those fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d said another, laughing.\n\nBoth fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s and P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s steps as they advanced to the fire leading their\nhorses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBonjour, messieurs!\xe2\x80\x9d * said D\xc3\xb3lokhov loudly and clearly.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cGood day, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThere was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire,\nand one tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up to\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Cl\xc3\xa9ment?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the devil...?\xe2\x80\x9d But, noticing\nhis mistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted D\xc3\xb3lokhov as a\nstranger, asking what he could do for him.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their\nregiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew\nanything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything, and P\xc3\xa9tya\nthought the officers were beginning to look at him and D\xc3\xb3lokhov with\nhostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too late,\xe2\x80\x9d said\na voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that\nnight.\n\nHe handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and\nsquatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long\nneck. That officer did not take his eyes from D\xc3\xb3lokhov and again asked\nto what regiment he belonged. D\xc3\xb3lokhov, as if he had not heard the\nquestion, did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe which he took\nfrom his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them\nwas safe from Cossacks.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose brigands are everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d replied an officer from behind the\nfire.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers\nsuch as his companion and himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut probably they would not dare to\nattack large detachments?\xe2\x80\x9d he added inquiringly. No one replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now he\xe2\x80\x99ll come away,\xe2\x80\x9d P\xc3\xa9tya thought every moment as he stood by\nthe campfire listening to the talk.\n\nBut D\xc3\xb3lokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began\nputting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion,\nhow many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about the Russian\nprisoners with that detachment, D\xc3\xb3lokhov said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would be\nbetter to shoot such rabble,\xe2\x80\x9d and burst into loud laughter, so strange\nthat P\xc3\xa9tya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise,\nand involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.\n\nNo one replied a word to D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s laughter, and a French officer whom\nthey could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and whispered\nsomething to a companion. D\xc3\xb3lokhov got up and called to the soldier who\nwas holding their horses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill they bring our horses or not?\xe2\x80\x9d thought P\xc3\xa9tya, instinctively\ndrawing nearer to D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\nThe horses were brought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya wished to say \xe2\x80\x9cGood night\xe2\x80\x9d but could not utter a word. The\nofficers were whispering together. D\xc3\xb3lokhov was a long time mounting\nhis horse which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at a\nfootpace. P\xc3\xa9tya rode beside him, longing to look round to see whether or\nnot the French were running after them, but not daring to.\n\nComing out onto the road D\xc3\xb3lokhov did not ride back across the open\ncountry, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and listened.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. P\xc3\xa9tya recognized the sound of Russian voices\nand saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires.\nWhen they had descended to the bridge P\xc3\xa9tya and D\xc3\xb3lokhov rode past the\nsentinel, who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it, then\nthey descended into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, good-by. Tell Den\xc3\xadsov, \xe2\x80\x98at the first shot at daybreak,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov and was about to ride away, but P\xc3\xa9tya seized hold of him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how splendid!\nHow I love you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d said D\xc3\xb3lokhov. But P\xc3\xa9tya did not let go of him\nand D\xc3\xb3lokhov saw through the gloom that P\xc3\xa9tya was bending toward him and\nwanted to kiss him. D\xc3\xb3lokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and\nvanished into the darkness.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nHaving returned to the watchman\xe2\x80\x99s hut, P\xc3\xa9tya found Den\xc3\xadsov in the\npassage. He was awaiting P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s return in a state of agitation,\nanxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, listening to\nP\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s rapturous account. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, devil take you, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t slept because\nof you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can still get a nap before\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut... no,\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sleep yet. Besides I know\nmyself, if I fall asleep it\xe2\x80\x99s finished. And then I am used to not\nsleeping before a battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his\nexpedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day.\n\nThen, noticing that Den\xc3\xadsov was asleep, he rose and went out of doors.\n\nIt was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were still\nfalling from the trees. Near the watchman\xe2\x80\x99s hut the black shapes of the\nCossacks\xe2\x80\x99 shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen. Behind\nthe hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them\nwere discernible, and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red.\nNot all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep; here and there, amid the\nsounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by, could be\nheard low voices which seemed to be whispering.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.\nSomeone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses\nmunching their oats. In the dark P\xc3\xa9tya recognized his own horse, which\nhe called \xe2\x80\x9cKarab\xc3\xa1kh\xe2\x80\x9d though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Karab\xc3\xa1kh! We\xe2\x80\x99ll do some service tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, sniffing its\nnostrils and kissing it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy aren\xe2\x80\x99t you asleep, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said a Cossack who was sitting under a\nwagon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ah... Likhach\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x94isn\xe2\x80\x99t that your name? Do you know I have only just\ncome back! We\xe2\x80\x99ve been into the French camp.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd P\xc3\xa9tya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but\nalso of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his life\nthan to act \xe2\x80\x9cjust anyhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you should get some sleep now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am used to this,\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, aren\xe2\x80\x99t the flints in your\npistols worn out? I brought some with me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want any? You can\nhave some.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at\nP\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am accustomed to doing everything accurately,\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and then\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re sorry for it afterwards. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my\nsaber for me? It\xe2\x80\x99s got bl...\xe2\x80\x9d (P\xc3\xa9tya feared to tell a lie, and the saber\nnever had been sharpened.) \xe2\x80\x9cCan you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLikhach\xc3\xabv got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon P\xc3\xa9tya heard the warlike\nsound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat on its\nedge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say! Are the lads asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d asked P\xc3\xa9tya.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome are, and some aren\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94like us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and that boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVes\xc3\xa9nny? Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast asleep\nafter his fright. He was that glad!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter that P\xc3\xa9tya remained silent for a long time, listening to the\nsounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you sharpening?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a man coming up to the wagon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s saber.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, whom P\xc3\xa9tya took to be an hussar. \xe2\x80\x9cWas the\ncup left here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, by the wheel!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe hussar took the cup.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be daylight soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, yawning, and went away.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s\nguerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon\ncaptured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under\nit Likhach\xc3\xabv was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark\nblotch to the right was the watchman\xe2\x80\x99s hut, and the red blotch below to\nthe left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had come\nfor the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor\nwaited to know anything of all this. He was in a fairy kingdom where\nnothing resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be the\nwatchman\xe2\x80\x99s hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of\nthe earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be the eye of an\nenormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon, but it might\nvery well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high\ntower from which, if he fell, he would have to fall for a whole day or a\nwhole month, or go on falling and never reach the bottom. Perhaps it\nwas just the Cossack, Likhach\xc3\xabv, who was sitting under the wagon, but it\nmight be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful, most splendid man in the\nworld, whom no one knew of. It might really have been that the hussar\ncame for water and went back into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply\nvanished\xe2\x80\x94disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness.\n\nNothing P\xc3\xa9tya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was in a\nfairy kingdom where everything was possible.\n\nHe looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth.\nIt was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly\nsailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if the clouds\nwere passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed as\nif the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising\nhigh, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low that one could\ntouch it with one\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s eyes began to close and he swayed a little.\n\nThe trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed and\njostled one another. Someone snored.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOzheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...\xe2\x80\x9d hissed the saber against the whetstone,\nand suddenly P\xc3\xa9tya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown,\nsweetly solemn hymn. P\xc3\xa9tya was as musical as Nat\xc3\xa1sha and more so than\nNicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the\nmelody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly\nfresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The melody\ngrew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was played was\na fugue\xe2\x80\x94though P\xc3\xa9tya had not the least conception of what a fugue is.\nEach instrument\xe2\x80\x94now resembling a violin and now a horn, but better\nand clearer than violin or horn\xe2\x80\x94played its own part, and before it had\nfinished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the\nsame air, and then with a third and a fourth; and they all blended into\none and again became separate and again blended, now into solemn church\nmusic, now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94why, that was in a dream!\xe2\x80\x9d P\xc3\xa9tya said to himself, as he lurched\nforward. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in my ears. But perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s music of my own. Well, go\non, my music! Now!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance, sounds\nfluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again all\nmingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, this is delightful!\nAs much as I like and as I like!\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9tya to himself. He tried to\nconduct that enormous orchestra.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow softly, softly die away!\xe2\x80\x9d and the sounds obeyed him. \xe2\x80\x9cNow fuller,\nmore joyful. Still more and more joyful!\xe2\x80\x9d And from an unknown depth rose\nincreasingly triumphant sounds. \xe2\x80\x9cNow voices join in!\xe2\x80\x9d ordered P\xc3\xa9tya. And\nat first from afar he heard men\xe2\x80\x99s voices and then women\xe2\x80\x99s. The voices\ngrew in harmonious triumphant strength, and P\xc3\xa9tya listened to their\nsurpassing beauty in awe and joy.\n\nWith a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from the\ntrees, and the hissing of the saber, \xe2\x80\x9cOzheg-zheg-zheg...\xe2\x80\x9d and again the\nhorses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the choir but\njoining in it.\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all the\ntime, wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to\nshare it. He was awakened by Likhach\xc3\xabv\xe2\x80\x99s kindly voice.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nP\xc3\xa9tya woke up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s getting light, it\xe2\x80\x99s really getting light!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\n\nThe horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their\nvery tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches.\nP\xc3\xa9tya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it\nto Likhach\xc3\xabv; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and sheathed\nit. The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle\ngirths.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s the commander,\xe2\x80\x9d said Likhach\xc3\xabv.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov came out of the watchman\xe2\x80\x99s hut and, having called P\xc3\xa9tya, gave\norders to get ready.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness, tightened\ntheir saddle girths, and formed companies. Den\xc3\xadsov stood by the\nwatchman\xe2\x80\x99s hut giving final orders. The infantry of the detachment\npassed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist\nof early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through the mud. The esaul\ngave some orders to his men. P\xc3\xa9tya held his horse by the bridle,\nimpatiently awaiting the order to mount. His face, having been bathed\nin cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were particularly brilliant.\nCold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, is ev\xe2\x80\x99wything weady?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Den\xc3\xadsov. \xe2\x80\x9cBwing the horses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe horses were brought. Den\xc3\xadsov was angry with the Cossack because the\nsaddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted. P\xc3\xa9tya put his\nfoot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but\nP\xc3\xa9tya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and,\nturning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him, rode\nup to Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for God\xe2\x80\x99s\nsake...!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov seemed to have forgotten P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s very existence. He turned to\nglance at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask one thing of you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cto obey me and not shove\nyourself forward anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe did not say another word to P\xc3\xa9tya but rode in silence all the way.\nWhen they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing\nlight over the field. Den\xc3\xadsov talked in whispers with the esaul and\nthe Cossacks rode past P\xc3\xa9tya and Den\xc3\xadsov. When they had all ridden by,\nDen\xc3\xadsov touched his horse and rode down the hill. Slipping onto their\nhaunches and sliding, the horses descended with their riders into the\nravine. P\xc3\xa9tya rode beside Den\xc3\xadsov, the pulsation of his body constantly\nincreasing. It was getting lighter and lighter, but the mist still hid\ndistant objects. Having reached the valley, Den\xc3\xadsov looked back and\nnodded to a Cossack beside him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe signal!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nThe Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the tramp\nof horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from various sides,\nand then more shots.\n\nAt the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, P\xc3\xa9tya lashed his\nhorse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding Den\xc3\xadsov who\nshouted at him. It seemed to P\xc3\xa9tya that at the moment the shot was\nfired it suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge.\nCossacks were galloping along the road in front of him. On the bridge\nhe collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he galloped on.\nIn front of him soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were running from right\nto left across the road. One of them fell in the mud under his horse\xe2\x80\x99s\nfeet.\n\nCossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the midst\nof that crowd terrible screams arose. P\xc3\xa9tya galloped up, and the\nfirst thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman,\nclutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!... Lads!... ours!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted P\xc3\xa9tya, and giving rein to his\nexcited horse he galloped forward along the village street.\n\nHe could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged\nRussian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road,\nwere shouting something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking\nFrenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red face,\nhad been defending himself against the hussars. When P\xc3\xa9tya galloped\nup the Frenchman had already fallen. \xe2\x80\x9cToo late again!\xe2\x80\x9d flashed through\nP\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing\ncould be heard. The shots came from the yard of the landowner\xe2\x80\x99s house\nhe had visited the night before with D\xc3\xb3lokhov. The French were making\na stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with\nbushes and were firing at the Cossacks who crowded at the gateway.\nThrough the smoke, as he approached the gate, P\xc3\xa9tya saw D\xc3\xb3lokhov, whose\nface was of a pale-greenish tint, shouting to his men. \xe2\x80\x9cGo round! Wait\nfor the infantry!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed as P\xc3\xa9tya rode up to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted P\xc3\xa9tya, and without pausing a moment\ngalloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the\nsmoke was thickest.\n\nA volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others plashed\nagainst something. The Cossacks and D\xc3\xb3lokhov galloped after P\xc3\xa9tya into\nthe gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke some of the\nFrench threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the\nCossacks, while others ran down the hill toward the pond. P\xc3\xa9tya was\ngalloping along the courtyard, but instead of holding the reins he waved\nboth his arms about rapidly and strangely, slipping farther and farther\nto one side in his saddle. His horse, having galloped up to a campfire\nthat was smoldering in the morning light, stopped suddenly, and P\xc3\xa9tya\nfell heavily on to the wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and\nlegs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless. A bullet had\npierced his skull.\n\nAfter speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the house\nwith a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that\nthey surrendered, D\xc3\xb3lokhov dismounted and went up to P\xc3\xa9tya, who lay\nmotionless with outstretched arms.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone for!\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet Den\xc3\xadsov\nwho was riding toward him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKilled?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Den\xc3\xadsov, recognizing from a distance the unmistakably\nlifeless attitude\xe2\x80\x94very familiar to him\xe2\x80\x94in which P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s body was lying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone for!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated D\xc3\xb3lokhov as if the utterance of these words\nafforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who\nwere surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up. \xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t take them!\xe2\x80\x9d he\ncalled out to Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov did not reply; he rode up to P\xc3\xa9tya, dismounted, and with\ntrembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered\nface which had already gone white.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nrecalled P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise at the\nsound, like the yelp of a dog, with which Den\xc3\xadsov turned away, walked to\nthe wattle fence, and seized hold of it.\n\nAmong the Russian prisoners rescued by Den\xc3\xadsov and D\xc3\xb3lokhov was Pierre\nBez\xc3\xbakhov.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nDuring the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been\nissued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners\namong whom was Pierre. On the twenty-second of October that party was\nno longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left\nMoscow. Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first\nstages with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other half had gone\non ahead. Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in\nfront of the prisoners was left; they had all disappeared. The artillery\nthe prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was\nnow replaced by Marshal Junot\xe2\x80\x99s enormous baggage train, convoyed by\nWestphalians. Behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train.\n\nFrom Vy\xc3\xa1zma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in three\ncolumns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder that Pierre\nhad noticed at their first halting place after leaving Moscow had now\nreached the utmost limit.\n\nThe road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead\nhorses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments\ncontinually changed about, now joining the moving column, now again\nlagging behind it.\n\nSeveral times during the march false alarms had been given and the\nsoldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run\nheadlong, crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and\nabused each other for their causeless panic.\n\nThese three groups traveling together\xe2\x80\x94the cavalry stores, the convoy of\nprisoners, and Junot\xe2\x80\x99s baggage train\xe2\x80\x94still constituted a separate and\nunited whole, though each of the groups was rapidly melting away.\n\nOf the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and\ntwenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been\ncaptured or left behind. Some of Junot\xe2\x80\x99s wagons also had been captured\nor abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers\nfrom Davout\xe2\x80\x99s corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned that\na larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the\nprisoners, and that one of their comrades, a German soldier, had been\nshot by the marshal\xe2\x80\x99s own order because a silver spoon belonging to the\nmarshal had been found in his possession.\n\nThe group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three hundred\nand thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a hundred now\nremained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the\ncavalry saddles or Junot\xe2\x80\x99s baggage. They understood that the saddles and\nJunot\xe2\x80\x99s spoon might be of some use, but that cold and hungry soldiers\nshould have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry Russians who\nfroze and lagged behind on the road (in which case the order was to\nshoot them) was not merely incomprehensible but revolting. And the\nescort, as if afraid, in the grievous condition they themselves were in,\nof giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering\ntheir own plight still worse, treated them with particular moroseness\nand severity.\n\nAt Dorogob\xc3\xbazh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the\nprisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores, several\nof the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away, but were\nrecaptured by the French and shot.\n\nThe arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer prisoners\nshould be kept separate from the rest, had long since been abandoned.\nAll who could walk went together, and after the third stage Pierre had\nrejoined Karat\xc3\xa1ev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev for its master.\n\nOn the third day after leaving Moscow Karat\xc3\xa1ev again fell ill with the\nfever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he grew\ngradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know why, but\nsince Karat\xc3\xa1ev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to\ngo near him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev generally lay down at the halting places, and when he smelled\nthe odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before, Pierre\nmoved farther away and did not think about him.\n\nWhile imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his intellect\nbut with his whole being, by life itself, that man is created for\nhappiness, that happiness is within him, in the satisfaction of simple\nhuman needs, and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from\nsuperfluity. And now during these last three weeks of the march he had\nlearned still another new, consolatory truth\xe2\x80\x94that nothing in this world\nis terrible. He had learned that as there is no condition in which man\ncan be happy and entirely free, so there is no condition in which he\nneed be unhappy and lack freedom. He learned that suffering and freedom\nhave their limits and that those limits are very near together; that the\nperson in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as\nhe now, sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled\nwhile the other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing\nshoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet\nthat were covered with sores\xe2\x80\x94his footgear having long since fallen to\npieces. He discovered that when he had married his wife\xe2\x80\x94of his own free\nwill as it had seemed to him\xe2\x80\x94he had been no more free than now when they\nlocked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself subsequently\ntermed his sufferings, but which at the time he scarcely felt, the worst\nwas the state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. (The horseflesh\nwas appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder\nthey used instead of salt was even pleasant; there was no great cold,\nit was always warm walking in the daytime, and at night there were the\ncampfires; the lice that devoured him warmed his body.) The one thing\nthat was at first hard to bear was his feet.\n\nAfter the second day\xe2\x80\x99s march Pierre, having examined his feet by the\ncampfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when\neverybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up,\nwalked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more\nterrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at them now,\nbut thought of other things.\n\nOnly now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the\nsaving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing\nto another, which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows\nsuperfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit.\n\nHe did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged\nbehind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did not\nthink of Karat\xc3\xa1ev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon\nhave to share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about himself. The\nharder his position became and the more terrible the future, the more\nindependent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful\nand comforting thoughts, memories, and imaginings that came to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nAt midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going uphill along\nthe muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and at the roughness of\nthe way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and\nthen again at his feet. The former and the latter were alike familiar\nand his own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side\nof the road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction\nlifting one hind leg and hopping along on three, and then again going on\nall four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion. The\ndog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in Moscow. All around lay\nthe flesh of different animals\xe2\x80\x94from men to horses\xe2\x80\x94in various stages of\ndecomposition; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the\ndog could eat all it wanted.\n\nIt had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it\nmight cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began raining\nharder than before. The saturated road no longer absorbed the water,\nwhich ran along the ruts in streams.\n\nPierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps in\nthrees, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally addressing the\nrain, he repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, now then, go on! Pelt harder!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and\ndeep within him his soul was occupied with something important and\ncomforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a\nconversation with Karat\xc3\xa1ev the day before.\n\nAt their yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s halting place, feeling chilly by a dying campfire,\nPierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was burning better.\nThere Plat\xc3\xb3n Karat\xc3\xa1ev was sitting covered up\xe2\x80\x94head and all\xe2\x80\x94with his\ngreatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his\neffective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre knew. It\nwas already past midnight, the hour when Karat\xc3\xa1ev was usually free of\nhis fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the fire and\nheard Plat\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic face\nbrightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at his heart. His\nfeeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away,\nbut there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down, trying not to look at\nPlat\xc3\xb3n.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won\xe2\x80\x99t grant us death,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nPlat\xc3\xb3n, and at once resumed the story he had begun.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, brother,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, with a smile on his pale emaciated face\nand a particularly happy light in his eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see, brother...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre had long been familiar with that story. Karat\xc3\xa1ev had told it\nto him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially joyful\nemotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that tale as to\nsomething new, and the quiet rapture Karat\xc3\xa1ev evidently felt as he told\nit communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was of an old merchant\nwho lived a good and God-fearing life with his family, and who went once\nto the N\xc3\xadzhni fair with a companion\xe2\x80\x94a rich merchant.\n\nHaving put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning his\ncompanion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained knife\nwas found under the old merchant\xe2\x80\x99s pillow. He was tried, knouted, and\nhis nostrils having been torn off, \xe2\x80\x9call in due form\xe2\x80\x9d as Karat\xc3\xa1ev put it,\nhe was sent to hard labor in Siberia.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so, brother\xe2\x80\x9d (it was at this point that Pierre came up), \xe2\x80\x9cten years\nor more passed by. The old man was living as a convict, submitting as\nhe should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God for death. Well, one\nnight the convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man among\nthem. And they began telling what each was suffering for, and how they\nhad sinned against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had\ntaken two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply\nbeen a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: \xe2\x80\x98What\nare you being punished for, Daddy?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I, my dear brothers,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98am\nbeing punished for my own and other men\xe2\x80\x99s sins. But I have not killed\nanyone or taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped my\npoorer brothers. I was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had much\nproperty. \xe2\x80\x98And he went on to tell them all about it in due order. \xe2\x80\x98I\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t grieve for myself,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98God, it seems, has chastened me.\nOnly I am sorry for my old wife and the children,\xe2\x80\x99 and the old man began\nto weep. Now it happened that in the group was the very man who had\nkilled the other merchant. \xe2\x80\x98Where did it happen, Daddy?\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98When,\nand in what month?\xe2\x80\x99 He asked all about it and his heart began to ache.\nSo he comes up to the old man like this, and falls down at his feet!\n\xe2\x80\x98You are perishing because of me, Daddy,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s quite true,\nlads, that this man,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98is being tortured innocently and for\nnothing! I,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98did that deed, and I put the knife under your\nhead while you were asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98for Christ\xe2\x80\x99s\nsake!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and he drew\nthe logs together.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the old man said, \xe2\x80\x98God will forgive you, we are all sinners in His\nsight. I suffer for my own sins,\xe2\x80\x99 and he wept bitter tears. Well,\nand what do you think, dear friends?\xe2\x80\x9d Karat\xc3\xa1ev continued, his face\nbrightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had\nto tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the\nauthorities. \xe2\x80\x98I have taken six lives,\xe2\x80\x99 he says (he was a great sinner),\n\xe2\x80\x98but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let him suffer\nbecause of me.\xe2\x80\x99 So he confessed and it was all written down and the\npapers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while\nthey were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in the\npapers all in due form\xe2\x80\x94the authorities I mean\xe2\x80\x94time passed. The affair\nreached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s decree came: to set the\nmerchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded. The\npaper arrived and they began to look for the old man. \xe2\x80\x98Where is the old\nman who has been suffering innocently and in vain? A paper has come from\nthe Tsar!\xe2\x80\x99 so they began looking for him,\xe2\x80\x9d here Karat\xc3\xa1ev\xe2\x80\x99s lower jaw\ntrembled, \xe2\x80\x9cbut God had already forgiven him\xe2\x80\x94he was dead! That\xe2\x80\x99s how it\nwas, dear fellows!\xe2\x80\x9d Karat\xc3\xa1ev concluded and sat for a long time silent,\ngazing before him with a smile.\n\nAnd Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself\nbut by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that lit up\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev\xe2\x80\x99s face as he told it, and the mystic significance of that joy.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\x80 vos places!\xe2\x80\x9d * suddenly cried a voice.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cTo your places.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nA pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something\njoyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the\nprisoners. From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left came\nsmartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the prisoners at a\ntrot. The expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the\napproach of those in authority. The prisoners thronged together and were\npushed off the road. The convoy formed up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!\xe2\x80\x9d and hardly had the\nsleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled\nby. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a\ntranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of the\nmarshals. His eye fell on Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s large and striking figure, and in\nthe expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he\ndetected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.\n\nThe general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a\nred and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several officers\nformed a group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their faces all\nlooked excited and worried.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say? What did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre heard them ask.\n\nWhile the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in a\ncrowd, and Pierre saw Karat\xc3\xa1ev whom he had not yet seen that morning.\nHe sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On his face,\nbesides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling\nthe tale of the merchant who suffered innocently, there was now an\nexpression of quiet solemnity.\n\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with\ntears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to\nhim. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself. He made as if he\ndid not notice that look and moved hastily away.\n\nWhen the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round. Karat\xc3\xa1ev\nwas still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two\nFrenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look round again\nbut went limping up the hill.\n\nFrom behind, where Karat\xc3\xa1ev had been sitting, came the sound of a shot.\nPierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that he\nhad not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk\xe2\x80\x94a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And he\nagain started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of\nwhom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and\nin the expression on their faces\xe2\x80\x94one of them glanced timidly at\nPierre\xe2\x80\x94there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of\nthe young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and\nremembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt while\ndrying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.\n\nBehind him, where Karat\xc3\xa1ev had been sitting, the dog began to howl.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a stupid beast! Why is it howling?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre.\n\nHis comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided looking\nback at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling,\njust as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their faces.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nThe stores, the prisoners, and the marshal\xe2\x80\x99s baggage train stopped at\nthe village of Sh\xc3\xa1mshevo. The men crowded together round the campfires.\nPierre went up to the fire, ate some roast horseflesh, lay down with his\nback to the fire, and immediately fell asleep. He again slept as he had\ndone at Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk after the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3.\n\nAgain real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or another,\ngave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts that had\nbeen expressed in his dream at Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife is everything. Life is God. Everything changes and moves and that\nmovement is God. And while there is life there is joy in consciousness\nof the divine. To love life is to love God. Harder and more blessed\nthan all else is to love this life in one\xe2\x80\x99s sufferings, in innocent\nsufferings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKarat\xc3\xa1ev!\xe2\x80\x9d came to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\n\nAnd suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly old man\nwho had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nthe old man, and showed Pierre a globe. This globe was alive\xe2\x80\x94a vibrating\nball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface consisted of drops\nclosely pressed together, and all these drops moved and changed places,\nsometimes several of them merging into one, sometimes one dividing\ninto many. Each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as\npossible, but others striving to do the same compressed it, sometimes\ndestroyed it, and sometimes merged with it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is life,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old teacher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow simple and clear it is,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cHow is it I did not know\nit before?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect\nHim to the greatest extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from the\nsurface, sinks to the depths, and again emerges. There now, Karat\xc3\xa1ev\nhas spread out and disappeared. Do you understand, my child?\xe2\x80\x9d said the\nteacher.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand, damn you?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a voice, and Pierre woke up.\n\nHe lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed a Russian\nsoldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting a piece\nof meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy,\nhairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod. His\nbrown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of\nthe charcoal.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to him,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, turning quickly to a soldier\nwho stood behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cBrigand! Get away!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned\naway and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier the\nFrenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting something\nwith his hand. Looking more closely Pierre recognized the blue-gray dog,\nsitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he\xe2\x80\x99s come?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Plat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he began, but did not finish.\n\nSuddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy\xe2\x80\x94of\nthe look Plat\xc3\xb3n had given him as he sat under the tree, of the shot\nheard from that spot, of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s howl, of the guilty faces of the two\nFrenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and smoking gun, and of\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev\xe2\x80\x99s absence at this halt\xe2\x80\x94and he was on the point of realizing\nthat Karat\xc3\xa1ev had been killed, but just at that instant, he knew not\nwhy, the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent\nwith a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev. And\nwithout linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion\nfrom them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a vision of the country in\nsummertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating\nglobe, and he sank into water so that it closed over his head.\n\nBefore sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing.\nFrench soldiers were running past him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cossacks!\xe2\x80\x9d one of them shouted, and a moment later a crowd of\nRussians surrounded Pierre.\n\nFor a long time he could not understand what was happening to him. All\naround he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!\xe2\x80\x9d old soldiers exclaimed, weeping, as\nthey embraced Cossacks and hussars.\n\nThe hussars and Cossacks crowded round the prisoners; one offered them\nclothes, another boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed as he sat\namong them and could not utter a word. He hugged the first soldier who\napproached him, and kissed him, weeping.\n\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd\nof disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all that had\nhappened, were talking loudly among themselves, but as they passed\nD\xc3\xb3lokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them\nwith cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they became silent. On the\nopposite side stood D\xc3\xb3lokhov\xe2\x80\x99s Cossack, counting the prisoners and\nmarking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many?\xe2\x80\x9d D\xc3\xb3lokhov asked the Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second hundred,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Cossack.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFilez, filez!\xe2\x80\x9d * D\xc3\xb3lokhov kept saying, having adopted this expression\nfrom the French, and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they\nflashed with a cruel light.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cGet along, get along!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some Cossacks\nwho were carrying the body of P\xc3\xa9tya Rost\xc3\xb3v to a hole that had been dug\nin the garden.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nAfter the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight of\nthe French assumed a still more tragic character, with men freezing,\nor roasting themselves to death at the campfires, while carriages\nwith people dressed in furs continued to drive past, carrying away the\nproperty that had been stolen by the Emperor, kings, and dukes; but\nthe process of the flight and disintegration of the French army went on\nessentially as before.\n\nFrom Moscow to Vy\xc3\xa1zma the French army of seventy-three thousand men not\nreckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but pillage)\nwas reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not more than five thousand\nhad fallen in battle. From this beginning the succeeding terms of the\nprogression could be determined mathematically. The French army melted\naway and perished at the same rate from Moscow to Vy\xc3\xa1zma, from Vy\xc3\xa1zma\nto Smol\xc3\xa9nsk, from Smol\xc3\xa9nsk to the Ber\xc3\xabzina, and from the Ber\xc3\xabzina to\nV\xc3\xadlna\xe2\x80\x94independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold, the\npursuit, the barring of the way, or any other particular conditions.\nBeyond Vy\xc3\xa1zma the French army instead of moving in three columns huddled\ntogether into one mass, and so went on to the end. Berthier wrote to his\nEmperor (we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge\nfrom the truth in describing the condition of an army) and this is what\nhe said:\n\n\nI deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition of the various\ncorps I have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last\ntwo or three days\xe2\x80\x99 march. They are almost disbanded. Scarcely a quarter\nof the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments, the others\ngo off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and\nescape discipline. In general they regard Smol\xc3\xa9nsk as the place where\nthey hope to recover. During the last few days many of the men have been\nseen to throw away their cartridges and their arms. In such a state\nof affairs, whatever your ultimate plans may be, the interest of Your\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s service demands that the army should be rallied at Smol\xc3\xa9nsk\nand should first of all be freed from ineffectives, such as dismounted\ncavalry, unnecessary baggage, and artillery material that is no longer\nin proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, who are worn out with\nhunger and fatigue, need these supplies as well as a few days\xe2\x80\x99 rest.\nMany have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs. This\nstate of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that\nunless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under\ncontrol in case of an engagement.\n\nNovember 9: twenty miles from Smol\xc3\xa9nsk.\n\n\nAfter staggering into Smol\xc3\xa9nsk which seemed to them a promised land, the\nFrench, searching for food, killed one another, sacked their own stores,\nand when everything had been plundered fled farther.\n\nThey all went without knowing whither or why they were going. Still less\ndid that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any orders to\nhim. But still he and those about him retained their old habits: wrote\ncommands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; called one another\nsire, mon cousin, prince d\xe2\x80\x99Eckm\xc3\xbchl, roi de Naples, and so on. But these\norders and reports were only on paper, nothing in them was acted upon\nfor they could not be carried out, and though they entitled one\nanother Majesties, Highnesses, or Cousins, they all felt that they were\nmiserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to\npay. And though they pretended to be concerned about the army, each\nwas thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save\nhimself.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nThe movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign\nfrom Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian\nblindman\xe2\x80\x99s buff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of\nthem occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his\nwhereabouts. First he rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into\na tight place he runs away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to\nescape runs straight into his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\n\nAt first while they were still moving along the Kal\xc3\xbaga road, Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\narmies made their presence known, but later when they reached the\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight\xe2\x80\x94and often\nthinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians.\n\nOwing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit\nand the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of\napproximately ascertaining the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s position\xe2\x80\x94by cavalry scouting\xe2\x80\x94was\nnot available. Besides, as a result of the frequent and rapid change of\nposition by each army, even what information was obtained could not be\ndelivered in time. If news was received one day that the enemy had been\nin a certain position the day before, by the third day when something\ncould have been done, that army was already two days\xe2\x80\x99 march farther on\nand in quite another position.\n\nOne army fled and the other pursued. Beyond Smol\xc3\xa9nsk there were several\ndifferent roads available for the French, and one would have thought\nthat during their stay of four days they might have learned where\nthe enemy was, might have arranged some more advantageous plan and\nundertaken something new. But after a four days\xe2\x80\x99 halt the mob, with no\nmaneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither\nto the right nor to the left but along the old\xe2\x80\x94the worst\xe2\x80\x94road, through\nKr\xc3\xa1snoe and Orsh\xc3\xa1.\n\nExpecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French separated\nin their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four hours. In\nfront of them all fled the Emperor, then the kings, then the dukes. The\nRussian army, expecting Napoleon to take the road to the right beyond\nthe Dnieper\xe2\x80\x94which was the only reasonable thing for him to do\xe2\x80\x94themselves\nturned to the right and came out onto the highroad at Kr\xc3\xa1snoe. And here\nas in a game of blindman\xe2\x80\x99s buff the French ran into our vanguard. Seeing\ntheir enemy unexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped\nshort from the sudden fright, but then they resumed their flight,\nabandoning their comrades who were farther behind. Then for three days\nseparate portions of the French army\xe2\x80\x94first Murat\xe2\x80\x99s (the vice-king\xe2\x80\x99s),\nthen Davout\xe2\x80\x99s, and then Ney\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94ran, as it were, the gauntlet of the\nRussian army. They abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy\nbaggage, their artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the\nRussians by night by making semicircles to the right.\n\nNey, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of\nSmol\xc3\xa9nsk which were in nobody\xe2\x80\x99s way, because despite the unfortunate\nplight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor\nagainst which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had had a corps of ten\nthousand men, reached Napoleon at Orsh\xc3\xa1 with only one thousand men left,\nhaving abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having crossed the\nDnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.\n\nFrom Orsh\xc3\xa1 they fled farther along the road to V\xc3\xadlna, still playing\nat blindman\xe2\x80\x99s buff with the pursuing army. At the Ber\xc3\xabzina they again\nbecame disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, but those\nwho got across the river fled farther. Their supreme chief donned a\nfur coat and, having seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone,\nabandoning his companions. The others who could do so drove away too,\nleaving those who could not to surrender or die.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nThis campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which they did\nall they could to destroy themselves. From the time they turned onto\nthe Kal\xc3\xbaga road to the day their leader fled from the army, none of the\nmovements of the crowd had any sense. So one might have thought that\nregarding this period of the campaign the historians, who attributed\nthe actions of the mass to the will of one man, would have found it\nimpossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory. But\nno! Mountains of books have been written by the historians about this\ncampaign, and everywhere are described Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements, the\nmaneuvers, and his profound plans which guided the army, as well as the\nmilitary genius shown by his marshals.\n\nThe retreat from M\xc3\xa1lo-Yarosl\xc3\xa1vets when he had a free road into a\nwell-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along\nwhich Kut\xc3\xbazov afterwards pursued him\xe2\x80\x94this unnecessary retreat along\na devastated road\xe2\x80\x94is explained to us as being due to profound\nconsiderations. Similarly profound considerations are given for\nhis retreat from Smol\xc3\xa9nsk to Orsh\xc3\xa1. Then his heroism at Kr\xc3\xa1snoe is\ndescribed, where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle\nand take personal command, and to have walked about with a birch stick\nand said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJ\xe2\x80\x99ai assez fait l\xe2\x80\x99empereur; il est temps de faire le g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9ral,\xe2\x80\x9d * but\nnevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning to its fate the\nscattered fragments of the army he left behind.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cI have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act\n     the general.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nThen we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals, especially\nof Ney\xe2\x80\x94a greatness of soul consisting in this: that he made his way by\nnight around through the forest and across the Dnieper and escaped to\nOrsh\xc3\xa1, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tenths of his men.\n\nAnd lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from his heroic\narmy is presented to us by the historians as something great and\ncharacteristic of genius. Even that final running away, described in\nordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child\nis taught to be ashamed of\xe2\x80\x94even that act finds justification in the\nhistorians\xe2\x80\x99 language.\n\nWhen it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical\nratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly contrary to all\nthat humanity calls right or even just, the historians produce a saving\nconception of \xe2\x80\x9cgreatness.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGreatness,\xe2\x80\x9d it seems, excludes the standards\nof right and wrong. For the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\xe2\x80\x9d man nothing is wrong, there is no\natrocity for which a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\xe2\x80\x9d man can be blamed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est grand!\xe2\x80\x9d * say the historians, and there no longer exists either\ngood or evil but only \xe2\x80\x9cgrand\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot grand.\xe2\x80\x9d Grand is good, not\ngrand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in their conception, of some\nspecial animals called \xe2\x80\x9cheroes.\xe2\x80\x9d And Napoleon, escaping home in a warm\nfur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades\nbut were (in his opinion) men he had brought there, feels que c\xe2\x80\x99est\ngrand, *(2) and his soul is tranquil.\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cIt is great.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n     * (2) That it is great.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDu sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au ridicule il n\xe2\x80\x99y\na qu\xe2\x80\x99un pas,\xe2\x80\x9d * said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been\nrepeating: \xe2\x80\x9cSublime! Grand! Napol\xc3\xa9on le Grand!\xe2\x80\x9d Du sublime au ridicule\nil n\xe2\x80\x99y a qu\xe2\x80\x99un pas.\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nAnd it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with\nthe standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one\xe2\x80\x99s own nothingness\nand immeasurable meanness.\n\nFor us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no human\nactions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where simplicity,\ngoodness, and truth are absent.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nWhat Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign\nof 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret,\ndissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is\nthat the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies\nsurrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered French, hungry\nand freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the historians relate)\nthe aim of the Russians was to stop the French, to cut them off, and\ncapture them all?\n\nHow was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than the\nFrench had given battle at Borodin\xc3\xb3, did not achieve its purpose when it\nhad surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim was to capture\nthem? Can the French be so enormously superior to us that when we had\nsurrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them? How could\nthat happen?\n\nHistory (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions\nsays that this occurred because Kut\xc3\xbazov and Torm\xc3\xa1sov and Chichag\xc3\xb3v, and\nthis man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers....\n\nBut why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were\nguilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and\npunished? But even if we admitted that Kut\xc3\xbazov, Chichag\xc3\xb3v, and others\nwere the cause of the Russian failures, it is still incomprehensible\nwhy, the position of the Russian army being what it was at Kr\xc3\xa1snoe and\nat the Ber\xc3\xabzina (in both cases we had superior forces), the French army\nwith its marshals, kings, and Emperor was not captured, if that was what\nthe Russians aimed at.\n\nThe explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military\nhistorians (to the effect that Kut\xc3\xbazov hindered an attack) is unfounded,\nfor we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at\nVy\xc3\xa1zma and Tar\xc3\xbatino.\n\nWhy was the Russian army\xe2\x80\x94which with inferior forces had withstood the\nenemy in full strength at Borodin\xc3\xb3\xe2\x80\x94defeated at Kr\xc3\xa1snoe and the Ber\xc3\xabzina\nby the disorganized crowds of the French when it was numerically\nsuperior?\n\nIf the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing\nNapoleon and his marshals\xe2\x80\x94and that aim was not merely frustrated but all\nattempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled\xe2\x80\x94then this last period\nof the campaign is quite rightly considered by the French to be a\nseries of victories, and quite wrongly considered victorious by Russian\nhistorians.\n\nThe Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims\nof logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical\nrhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit\nthat the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for\nNapoleon and defeats for Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\nBut putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a\nconclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French\nvictories brought the French complete destruction, while the series\nof Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the\nliberation of their country.\n\nThe source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians\nstudying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals,\nfrom memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth, have attributed to this\nlast period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely that of\ncutting off and capturing Napoleon with his marshals and his army.\n\nThere never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have been\nsenseless and its attainment quite impossible.\n\nIt would have been senseless, first because Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s disorganized\narmy was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that is to say, was\ndoing just what every Russian desired. So what was the use of performing\nvarious operations on the French who were running away as fast as they\npossibly could?\n\nSecondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose\nwhole energy was directed to flight.\n\nThirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one\xe2\x80\x99s own troops in\norder to destroy the French army, which without external interference\nwas destroying itself at such a rate that, though its path was not\nblocked, it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually\ndid in December, namely a hundredth part of the original army.\n\nFourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the\nEmperor, kings, and dukes\xe2\x80\x94whose capture would have been in the highest\ndegree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit diplomatists of\nthe time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized. Still more senseless\nwould have been the wish to capture army corps of the French, when our\nown army had melted away to half before reaching Kr\xc3\xa1snoe and a whole\ndivision would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners, and\nwhen our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners\nalready taken were perishing of hunger.\n\nAll the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his\narmy were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving out of\nhis garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted, should\nrun to the gate and hit the cow on the head. The only thing to be said\nin excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry. But not even\nthat could be said for those who drew up this project, for it was not\nthey who had suffered from the trampled beds.\n\nBut besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would have\nbeen senseless, it was impossible.\n\nIt was impossible first because\xe2\x80\x94as experience shows that a three-mile\nmovement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans\xe2\x80\x94the\nprobability of Chichag\xc3\xb3v, Kut\xc3\xbazov, and Wittgenstein effecting a junction\non time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to\nimpossibility, as in fact thought Kut\xc3\xbazov, who when he received the plan\nremarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the\ndesired results.\n\nSecondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with which\nNapoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than the\nRussians possessed would have been required.\n\nThirdly it was impossible, because the military term \xe2\x80\x9cto cut off\xe2\x80\x9d has no\nmeaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. To cut off\nan army\xe2\x80\x94to bar its road\xe2\x80\x94is quite impossible, for there is always plenty\nof room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be\nseen, as the military scientists might convince themselves by the\nexample of Kr\xc3\xa1snoe and of the Ber\xc3\xabzina. It is only possible to capture\nprisoners if they agree to be captured, just as it is only possible\nto catch a swallow if it settles on one\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Men can only be taken\nprisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and\ntactics, as the Germans did. But the French troops quite rightly did not\nconsider that this suited them, since death by hunger and cold awaited\nthem in flight or captivity alike.\n\nFourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the world\nbegan has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained\nin 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the French strained its\nstrength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying\nitself.\n\nDuring the movement of the Russian army from Tar\xc3\xbatino to Kr\xc3\xa1snoe it\nlost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to the\npopulation of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of the army\nwithout a battle.\n\nAnd it is of this period of the campaign\xe2\x80\x94when the army lacked boots\nand sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and\nwas camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees\nof frost, when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and\nthe rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be\nmaintained, when men were taken into that region of death where\ndiscipline fails, not for a few hours only as in a battle, but for\nmonths, where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and\ncold, when half the army perished in a single month\xe2\x80\x94it is of this period\nof the campaign that the historians tell us how Milor\xc3\xa1dovich should have\nmade a flank march to such and such a place, Torm\xc3\xa1sov to another place,\nand Chichag\xc3\xb3v should have crossed (more than knee-deep in snow) to\nsomewhere else, and how so-and-so \xe2\x80\x9crouted\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccut off\xe2\x80\x9d the French and\nso on and so on.\n\nThe Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should have been\ndone to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not to blame\nbecause other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed that they should\ndo what was impossible.\n\nAll that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the\nfacts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians\ndealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words\nand sentiments of various generals, and not the history of the events.\n\nTo them the words of Milor\xc3\xa1dovich seem very interesting, and so do their\nsurmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question\nof those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves\ndoes not even interest them, for it does not come within the range of\ntheir investigation.\n\nYet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and\nconsider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a\ndirect part in the events, and all the questions that seemed insoluble\neasily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.\n\nThe aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in\nthe imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist because it was\nsenseless and unattainable.\n\nThe people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion. That aim\nwas attained in the first place of itself, as the French ran away,\nand so it was only necessary not to stop their flight. Secondly it was\nattained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the French, and\nthirdly by the fact that a large Russian army was following the French,\nready to use its strength in case their movement stopped.\n\nThe Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal. And the\nexperienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a\nmenace than to strike the running animal on the head.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN: 1812 - 13\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nWhen seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror: substance\nsimilar to his own is perishing before his eyes. But when it is a\nbeloved and intimate human being that is dying, besides this horror at\nthe extinction of life there is a severance, a spiritual wound, which\nlike a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals, but always\naches and shrinks at any external irritating touch.\n\nAfter Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s death Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Princess Mary alike felt this.\nDrooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of\ndeath that overhung them, they dared not look life in the face. They\ncarefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact.\nEverything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street, a summons to\ndinner, the maid\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry what dress to prepare, or worse still any\nword of insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an insult, painfully\nirritated the wound, interrupting that necessary quiet in which\nthey both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still\nresounded in their imagination, and hindered their gazing into those\nmysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before\nthem.\n\nOnly when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain.\nThey spoke little even to one another, and when they did it was of very\nunimportant matters.\n\nBoth avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility of\na future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully did\nthey avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed to them that\nwhat they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in\nwords, and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the\nmajesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before\ntheir eyes.\n\nContinued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of everything\nthat might lead up to the subject\xe2\x80\x94this halting on all sides at the\nboundary of what they might not mention\xe2\x80\x94brought before their minds with\nstill greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling.\n\nBut pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy.\nPrincess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of\nher own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was the first to\nbe called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt\nfor the first fortnight. She received letters from her relations to\nwhich she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas had been put\nwas damp and he began to cough; Alp\xc3\xa1tych came to Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl with reports\non the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they\nshould return to Moscow to the house on the Vozdv\xc3\xadzhenka Street, which\nhad remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs. Life did not\nstand still and it was necessary to live. Hard as it was for Princess\nMary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she\nhad lived till then, and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave\nNat\xc3\xa1sha alone, yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she\ninvoluntarily yielded to them. She went through the accounts with\nAlp\xc3\xa1tych, conferred with Dessalles about her nephew, and gave orders and\nmade preparations for the journey to Moscow.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making\npreparations for departure, held aloof from her too.\n\nPrincess Mary asked the countess to let Nat\xc3\xa1sha go with her to Moscow,\nand both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw their daughter\nlosing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the\nadvice of Moscow doctors would be good for her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha replied when this was proposed to\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cDo please just leave me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d And she ran out of the room, with\ndifficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than\nof sorrow.\n\nAfter she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her grief,\nNat\xc3\xa1sha spent most of the time in her room by herself, sitting huddled\nup feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and twisting\nsomething with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and\nfixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. This solitude exhausted\nand tormented her but she was in absolute need of it. As soon as anyone\nentered she got up quickly, changed her position and expression, and\npicked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting impatiently for the\nintruder to go.\n\nShe felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that\non which\xe2\x80\x94with a terrible questioning too great for her strength\xe2\x80\x94her\nspiritual gaze was fixed.\n\nOne day toward the end of December Nat\xc3\xa1sha, pale and thin, dressed in a\nblack woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot, was\ncrouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously crumpling and\nsmoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the\ndoor.\n\nShe was gazing in the direction in which he had gone\xe2\x80\x94to the other side\nof life. And that other side of life, of which she had never before\nthought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable,\nwas now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of\nlife, where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering\nand indignity.\n\nShe was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine him\notherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him again as he had been\nat Myt\xc3\xadshchi, at Tr\xc3\xb3itsa, and at Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl.\n\nShe saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own, and\nsometimes devised other words they might have spoken.\n\nThere he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, leaning\nhis head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his\nshoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his eyes glitter, and a\nwrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. One of his legs twitches\njust perceptibly, but rapidly. Nat\xc3\xa1sha knows that he is struggling with\nterrible pain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that pain like? Why does he have that pain? What\ndoes he feel? How does it hurt him?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha. He noticed her\nwatching him, raised his eyes, and began to speak seriously:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing would be terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d said he: \xe2\x80\x9cto bind oneself forever to a\nsuffering man. It would be continual torture.\xe2\x80\x9d And he looked searchingly\nat her. Nat\xc3\xa1sha as usual answered before she had time to think what she\nwould say. She said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis can\xe2\x80\x99t go on\xe2\x80\x94it won\xe2\x80\x99t. You will get well\xe2\x80\x94quite\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she\nhad then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look at those words\nand understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted\ngaze.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agreed,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha now said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it would be dreadful if\nhe always continued to suffer. I said it then only because it would have\nbeen dreadful for him, but he understood it differently. He thought it\nwould be dreadful for me. He then still wished to live and feared death.\nAnd I said it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not say what I meant.\nI thought quite differently. Had I said what I thought, I should have\nsaid: even if he had to go on dying, to die continually before my eyes,\nI should have been happy compared with what I am now. Now there is\nnothing... nobody. Did he know that? No, he did not and never will know\nit. And now it will never, never be possible to put it right.\xe2\x80\x9d And\nnow he again seemed to be saying the same words to her, only in her\nimagination Nat\xc3\xa1sha this time gave him a different answer. She stopped\nhim and said: \xe2\x80\x9cTerrible for you, but not for me! You know that for me\nthere is nothing in life but you, and to suffer with you is the greatest\nhappiness for me,\xe2\x80\x9d and he took her hand and pressed it as he had\npressed it that terrible evening four days before his death. And in her\nimagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have\nsaid then but only spoke now: \xe2\x80\x9cI love thee!... thee! I love, love...\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe said, convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a\ndesperate effort....\n\nShe was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her\neyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.\nAgain everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again with a\nstrained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And now, now\nit seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at the instant\nwhen it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a\nloud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears. Duny\xc3\xa1sha,\nher maid, entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look\non her face and showing no concern for her mistress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to your Papa at once, please!\xe2\x80\x9d said she with a strange, excited\nlook. \xe2\x80\x9cA misfortune... about Peter Il\xc3\xbdnich... a letter,\xe2\x80\x9d she finished\nwith a sob.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nBesides a feeling of aloofness from everybody Nat\xc3\xa1sha was feeling a\nspecial estrangement from the members of her own family. All of\nthem\xe2\x80\x94her father, mother, and S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x94were so near to her, so familiar, so\ncommonplace, that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the\nworld in which she had been living of late, and she felt not merely\nindifferent to them but regarded them with hostility. She heard\nDuny\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s words about Peter Il\xc3\xbdnich and a misfortune, but did not grasp\nthem.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat misfortune? What misfortune can happen to them? They just live\ntheir own old, quiet, and commonplace life,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nAs she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s room. His face was puckered up and wet with tears. He\nhad evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were\nchoking him. When he saw Nat\xc3\xa1sha he waved his arms despairingly and\nburst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPe... P\xc3\xa9tya... Go, go, she... is calling...\xe2\x80\x9d and weeping like a child\nand quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost fell into\nit, covering his face with his hands.\n\nSuddenly an electric shock seemed to run through Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s whole being.\nTerrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache as if\nsomething was being torn inside her and she were dying. But the pain\nwas immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive\nconstraint that had prevented her taking part in life. The sight of her\nfather, the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the\ndoor, made her immediately forget herself and her own grief.\n\nShe ran to her father, but he feebly waved his arm, pointing to her\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s door. Princess Mary, pale and with quivering chin, came out\nfrom that room and taking Nat\xc3\xa1sha by the arm said something to her.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha neither saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid steps, pausing\nat the door for an instant as if struggling with herself, and then ran\nto her mother.\n\nThe countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position,\nstretching out and beating her head against the wall. S\xc3\xb3nya and the\nmaids were holding her arms.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha! Nat\xc3\xa1sha!...\xe2\x80\x9d cried the countess. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not true... it\xe2\x80\x99s not\ntrue... He\xe2\x80\x99s lying... Nat\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d she shrieked, pushing those around her\naway. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away, all of you; it\xe2\x80\x99s not true! Killed!... ha, ha, ha!...\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not true!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha put one knee on the armchair, stooped over her mother, embraced\nher, and with unexpected strength raised her, turned her face toward\nherself, and clung to her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMummy!... darling!... I am here, my dearest Mummy,\xe2\x80\x9d she kept on\nwhispering, not pausing an instant.\n\nShe did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her,\ndemanded a pillow and hot water, and unfastened and tore open her\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s dress.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!...\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered\nincessantly, kissing her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her own\nirrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks.\n\nThe countess pressed her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand, closed her eyes, and became\nquiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness,\nglanced vacantly around her, and seeing Nat\xc3\xa1sha began to press her\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s head with all her strength. Then she turned toward her\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a soft trustful whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha,\nyou would not deceive me? You\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me the whole truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was\nnothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling Mummy!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, straining all the power of her love to\nfind some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her\nmother.\n\nAnd again in a futile struggle with reality her mother, refusing to\nbelieve that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom\nof life, escaped from reality into a world of delirium.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, nor the\nnext day and night. She did not sleep and did not leave her mother. Her\npersevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess\nevery moment, not explaining or consoling, but recalling her to life.\n\nDuring the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes,\nand Nat\xc3\xa1sha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes,\nbut opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak. The countess was\nsitting up in bed and speaking softly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow glad I am you have come. You are tired. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you have some tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\nNat\xc3\xa1sha went up to her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have improved in looks and grown more\nmanly,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the countess, taking her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! What are you saying...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, he is no more, no more!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first\ntime.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nPrincess Mary postponed her departure. S\xc3\xb3nya and the count tried to\nreplace Nat\xc3\xa1sha but could not. They saw that she alone was able to\nrestrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nremained constantly at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side, sleeping on a lounge chair\nin her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her incessantly\nbecause the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed her\nmother.\n\nThe mother\xe2\x80\x99s wounded spirit could not heal. P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s death had torn from\nher half her life. When the news of P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s death had come she had been\na fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room\na listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that\nalmost killed the countess, this second blow, restored Nat\xc3\xa1sha to life.\n\nA spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like\na physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may\nheal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet\nheal completely only as the result of a vital force from within.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended,\nbut her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of\nlife\xe2\x80\x94love\xe2\x80\x94was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life.\n\nPrince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s last days had bound Princess Mary and Nat\xc3\xa1sha together;\nthis new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary\nput off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Nat\xc3\xa1sha as if\nshe had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom\nhad strained Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s physical strength.\n\nOne afternoon noticing Nat\xc3\xa1sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took\nher to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Nat\xc3\xa1sha lay down,\nbut when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she\ncalled her back.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are tired\xe2\x80\x94try to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is much better. She spoke so well today,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned\nPrincess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she like him?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, like and yet not like. But she\nis quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What\nis in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What\ndoes she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary,\xe2\x80\x9d she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s hand to herself,\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love you!\nLet us be quite, quite friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Nat\xc3\xa1sha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making\nPrincess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings.\n\nFrom that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only\nbetween women was established between Princess Mary and Nat\xc3\xa1sha. They\nwere continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and\nspent most of their time together. When one went out the other became\nrestless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt more in harmony\nwith one another than either of them felt with herself when alone. A\nfeeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive\nfeeling of life being possible only in each other\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\n\nSometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were already\nin bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They spoke most\nof what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her childhood, of her\nmother, her father, and her daydreams; and Nat\xc3\xa1sha, who with a passive\nlack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of\ndevotion, submission, and the poetry of Christian self-sacrifice, now\nfeeling herself bound to Princess Mary by affection, learned to love her\npast too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to\nher. She did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her\nown life, for she was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood\nand loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues. For\nPrincess Mary, listening to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s tales of childhood and early\nyouth, there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of\nlife: belief in life and its enjoyment.\n\nJust as before, they never mentioned him so as not to lower (as they\nthought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him had\nthe effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being\nconscious of it.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all\ntalked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes she was\nsuddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, weakness,\nand loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined her bare arm\ncarefully, surprised at its thinness, and in the morning noticed her\ndrawn and, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her glass. It seemed to\nher that things must be so, and yet it was dreadfully sad.\n\nOne day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath.\nUnconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down, and\nthen, testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing the result.\n\nAnother time when she called Duny\xc3\xa1sha her voice trembled, so she called\nagain\xe2\x80\x94though she could hear Duny\xc3\xa1sha coming\xe2\x80\x94called her in the deep chest\ntones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened attentively to\nherself.\n\nShe did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the layer\nof slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, delicate\nyoung shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking root would so\ncover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that\nit would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound had begun to heal\nfrom within.\n\nAt the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count\ninsisted on Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s going with her to consult the doctors.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAfter the encounter at Vy\xc3\xa1zma, where Kut\xc3\xbazov had been unable to hold\nback his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and\nso on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the Russians\nwho pursued them, continued as far as Kr\xc3\xa1snoe without a battle. The\nflight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could\nnot keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke down, and the\ninformation received of the movements of the French was never reliable.\n\nThe men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching\nat the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any\nfaster.\n\nTo realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only\nnecessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not\nlosing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tar\xc3\xbatino and\nless than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that place a\nhundred thousand strong reached Kr\xc3\xa1snoe with only fifty thousand.\n\nThe rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army\nas the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference was that\nthe Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction\nas hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind\nin enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their\nown people. The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army was\nthe rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the\ncorresponding decrease of the Russian army.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the\nmovement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian\narmy generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at\nTar\xc3\xbatino and Vy\xc3\xa1zma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our\narmy.\n\nBut besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the\narmy caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident, another\nreason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to Kut\xc3\xbazov.\nThe aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French. The road the\nFrench would take was unknown, and so the closer our troops trod on\ntheir heels the greater distance they had to cover. Only by following\nat some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the French. All\nthe artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of\nthe army and a lengthening of its marches, whereas the only reasonable\naim was to shorten those marches. To that end Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s activity was\ndirected during the whole campaign from Moscow to V\xc3\xadlna\xe2\x80\x94not casually or\nintermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov felt and knew\xe2\x80\x94not by reasoning or science but with the whole of\nhis Russian being\xe2\x80\x94what every Russian soldier felt: that the French were\nbeaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but at the\nsame time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march,\nthe rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year.\n\nBut to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army,\nwho wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for some\nreason to capture a king or a duke\xe2\x80\x94it seemed that now\xe2\x80\x94when any battle\nmust be horrible and senseless\xe2\x80\x94was the very time to fight and conquer\nsomebody. Kut\xc3\xbazov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after\nanother they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those\nsoldiers\xe2\x80\x94ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved\xe2\x80\x94who within a\nmonth and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number,\nand who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater\ndistance than they had already traversed, before they reached the\nfrontier.\n\nThis longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and\nto cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians stumbled on\nthe French army.\n\nSo it was at Kr\xc3\xa1snoe, where they expected to find one of the three\nFrench columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen\nthousand men. Despite all Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to avoid that ruinous\nencounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob\nof French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at Kr\xc3\xa1snoe for three\ndays.\n\nToll wrote a disposition: \xe2\x80\x9cThe first column will march to so and so,\xe2\x80\x9d\netc. And as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition.\nPrince Eug\xc3\xa8ne of W\xc3\xbcrttemberg fired from a hill over the French crowds\nthat were running past, and demanded reinforcements which did not\narrive. The French, avoiding the Russians, dispersed and hid themselves\nin the forest by night, making their way round as best they could, and\ncontinued their flight.\n\nMilor\xc3\xa1dovich, who said he did not want to know anything about the\ncommissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be found when\nhe was wanted\xe2\x80\x94that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche * as he styled\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94who was fond of parleys with the French, sent envoys demanding\ntheir surrender, wasted time, and did not do what he was ordered to do.\n\n    * Knight without fear and without reproach.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give you that column, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, riding up to the troops and\npointing out the French to the cavalry.\n\nAnd the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could\nscarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented\nto them\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold,\nfrost-bitten, and starving\xe2\x80\x94and the column that had been presented to\nthem threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to\ndo.\n\nAt Kr\xc3\xa1snoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several hundred\ncannon, and a stick called a \xe2\x80\x9cmarshal\xe2\x80\x99s staff,\xe2\x80\x9d and disputed as to who\nhad distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement\xe2\x80\x94though\nthey much regretted not having taken Napoleon, or at least a marshal or\na hero of some sort, and reproached one another and especially Kut\xc3\xbazov\nfor having failed to do so.\n\nThese men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of the\nmost melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes and\nimagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable\ndeed. They blamed Kut\xc3\xbazov and said that from the very beginning of the\ncampaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he thought of\nnothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the Linen\nFactories because he was comfortable there, that at Kr\xc3\xa1snoe he checked\nthe advance because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite\nlost his head, and that it was probable that he had an understanding\nwith Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so on, and so on.\n\nNot only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk\nin this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as grand,\nwhile Kut\xc3\xbazov is described by foreigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak\nold courtier, and by Russians as something indefinite\xe2\x80\x94a sort of puppet\nuseful only because he had a Russian name.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nIn 1812 and 1813 Kut\xc3\xbazov was openly accused of blundering. The Emperor\nwas dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written by order\nof the Highest Authorities it is said that Kut\xc3\xbazov was a cunning court\nliar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by his blunders at\nKr\xc3\xa1snoe and the Ber\xc3\xabzina he deprived the Russian army of the glory of\ncomplete victory over the French. *\n\n     * History of the year 1812. The character of Kut\xc3\xbazov and\n     reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at\n     Kr\xc3\xa1snoe, by Bogd\xc3\xa1novich.\n\nSuch is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian mind\ndoes not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary individuals\nwho, discerning the will of Providence, submit their personal will to\nit. The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning\nthe higher laws.\n\nFor Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon\xe2\x80\x94that most\ninsignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile, showed\nhuman dignity\xe2\x80\x94Napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm; he\nis grand. But Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x94the man who from the beginning to the end of his\nactivity in 1812, never once swerving by word or deed from Borodin\xc3\xb3 to\nV\xc3\xadlna, presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice\nand a present consciousness of the future importance of what was\nhappening\xe2\x80\x94Kut\xc3\xbazov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful, and\nwhen speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little\nashamed.\n\nAnd yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose\nactivity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be\ndifficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the\nwill of the whole people. Still more difficult would it be to find\nan instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so\ncompletely accomplished as that to which all Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s efforts were\ndirected in 1812.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov never talked of \xe2\x80\x9cforty centuries looking down from the\nPyramids,\xe2\x80\x9d of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of\nwhat he intended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he\nsaid nothing about himself, adopted no pose, always appeared to be\nthe simplest and most ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most\nordinary things. He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de\nSta\xc3\xabl, read novels, liked the society of pretty women, jested with\ngenerals, officers, and soldiers, and never contradicted those who tried\nto prove anything to him. When Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn at the Ya\xc3\xbaza bridge\ngalloped up to Kut\xc3\xbazov with personal reproaches for having caused the\ndestruction of Moscow, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow was it you promised not to abandon\nMoscow without a battle?\xe2\x80\x9d Kut\xc3\xbazov replied: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall not abandon\nMoscow without a battle,\xe2\x80\x9d though Moscow was then already abandoned. When\nArakch\xc3\xa9ev, coming to him from the Emperor, said that Erm\xc3\xb3lov ought to\nbe appointed chief of the artillery, Kut\xc3\xbazov replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was\njust saying so myself,\xe2\x80\x9d though a moment before he had said quite the\ncontrary. What did it matter to him\xe2\x80\x94who then alone amid a senseless\ncrowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was\nhappening\xe2\x80\x94what did it matter to him whether Rostopch\xc3\xadn attributed the\ncalamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it matter to\nhim who was appointed chief of the artillery.\n\nNot merely in these cases but continually did that old man\xe2\x80\x94who by\nexperience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the\nwords serving as their expression are not what move people\xe2\x80\x94use quite\nmeaningless words that happened to enter his head.\n\nBut that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole\ntime of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim\ntoward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite of\nhimself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real\nthoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood.\nBeginning with the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3, from which time his disagreement\nwith those about him began, he alone said that the battle of Borodin\xc3\xb3\nwas a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches\nand reports up to the time of his death. He alone said that the loss of\nMoscow is not the loss of Russia. In reply to Lauriston\xe2\x80\x99s proposal of\npeace, he said: There can be no peace, for such is the people\xe2\x80\x99s will. He\nalone during the retreat of the French said that all our maneuvers are\nuseless, everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could\ndesire; that the enemy must be offered \xe2\x80\x9ca golden bridge\xe2\x80\x9d; that neither\nthe Tar\xc3\xbatino, the Vy\xc3\xa1zma, nor the Kr\xc3\xa1snoe battles were necessary; that\nwe must keep some force to reach the frontier with, and that he would\nnot sacrifice a single Russian for ten Frenchmen.\n\nAnd this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakch\xc3\xa9ev\nto please the Emperor, he alone\xe2\x80\x94incurring thereby the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\ndispleasure\xe2\x80\x94said in V\xc3\xadlna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is\nuseless and harmful.\n\nNor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the\nevents. His actions\xe2\x80\x94without the smallest deviation\xe2\x80\x94were all directed\nto one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his strength for\nconflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive them out\nof Russia, minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people\nand of our army.\n\nThis procrastinator Kut\xc3\xbazov, whose motto was \xe2\x80\x9cPatience and Time,\xe2\x80\x9d\nthis enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodin\xc3\xb3, investing the\npreparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kut\xc3\xbazov who before\nthe battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in\ncontradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that Borodin\xc3\xb3\nwas a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was\nlost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after\nwinning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat\ninsisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought,\nand that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia\ncrossed.\n\nIt is easy now to understand the significance of these events\xe2\x80\x94if only we\nabstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed\nonly in the heads of a dozen individuals\xe2\x80\x94for the events and results now\nlie before us.\n\nBut how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion,\nso truly discern the importance of the people\xe2\x80\x99s view of the events that\nin all his activity he was never once untrue to it?\n\nThe source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the\nevents then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in\nfull purity and strength.\n\nOnly the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused\nthe people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s wish, to\nselect him\xe2\x80\x94an old man in disfavor\xe2\x80\x94to be their representative in the\nnational war. And only that feeling placed him on that highest human\npedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all his powers\nnot to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on\nthem.\n\nThat simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not be\ncast in the false mold of a European hero\xe2\x80\x94the supposed ruler of men\xe2\x80\x94that\nhistory has invented.\n\nTo a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception of\ngreatness.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of\nKr\xc3\xa1snoe. Toward evening\xe2\x80\x94after much disputing and many mistakes made by\ngenerals who did not go to their proper places, and after adjutants had\nbeen sent about with counterorders\xe2\x80\x94when it had become plain that the\nenemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no\nbattle, Kut\xc3\xbazov left Kr\xc3\xa1snoe and went to D\xc3\xb3broe whither his headquarters\nhad that day been transferred.\n\nThe day was clear and frosty. Kut\xc3\xbazov rode to D\xc3\xb3broe on his plump little\nwhite horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who\nwhispered among themselves behind his back. All along the road groups of\nFrench prisoners captured that day (there were seven thousand of them)\nwere crowding to warm themselves at campfires. Near D\xc3\xb3broe an immense\ncrowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged\nin anything they had been able to get hold of, were standing in the road\nbeside a long row of unharnessed French guns. At the approach of the\ncommander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on\nKut\xc3\xbazov who, wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat\nthat bulged on his round shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his\nwhite horse. One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and\nprisoners had been captured.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was\nsaying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed\nattentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a specially\nwretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured by frost-bitten noses\nand cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and festering eyes.\n\nOne group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them, one of\nwhom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of raw\nflesh with their hands. There was something horrible and bestial in\nthe fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent\nexpression with which, after a glance at Kut\xc3\xbazov, the soldier with the\nsores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He puckered his\nface, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At another\nspot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a Frenchman on the\nshoulder, saying something to him in a friendly manner, and Kut\xc3\xbazov with\nthe same expression on his face again swayed his head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you saying?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked the general, who continuing his report\ndirected the commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s attention to some standards captured\nfrom the French and standing in front of the Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk regiment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the standards!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kut\xc3\xbazov, evidently detaching himself with\ndifficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.\n\nHe looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at him from\nall sides awaiting a word from him.\n\nHe stopped in front of the Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk regiment, sighed deeply, and\nclosed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying\nthe standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them.\nKut\xc3\xbazov was silent for a few seconds and then, submitting with evident\nreluctance to the duty imposed by his position, raised his head\nand began to speak. A throng of officers surrounded him. He looked\nattentively around at the circle of officers, recognizing several of\nthem.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you all!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing the soldiers and then again the\nofficers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were\ndistinctly heard. \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you all for your hard and faithful service.\nThe victory is complete and Russia will not forget you! Honor to you\nforever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe paused and looked around.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLower its head, lower it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to a soldier who had accidentally\nlowered the French eagle he was holding before the Preobrazh\xc3\xa9nsk\nstandards. \xe2\x80\x9cLower, lower, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. Hurrah lads!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing\nthe men with a rapid movement of his chin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHur-r-rah!\xe2\x80\x9d roared thousands of voices.\n\nWhile the soldiers were shouting Kut\xc3\xbazov leaned forward in his saddle\nand bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic\ngleam.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, brothers...\xe2\x80\x9d said he when the shouts had ceased... and all at\nonce his voice and the expression of his face changed. It was no longer\nthe commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to\ntell his comrades something very important.\n\nThere was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the\nsoldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he was going to\nsay.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, brothers, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for you, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped!\nBear up; it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long now! We\xe2\x80\x99ll see our visitors off and then\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll rest. The Tsar won\xe2\x80\x99t forget your service. It is hard for you, but\nstill you are at home while they\xe2\x80\x94you see what they have come to,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nhe, pointing to the prisoners. \xe2\x80\x9cWorse off than our poorest beggars.\nWhile they were strong we didn\xe2\x80\x99t spare ourselves, but now we may even\npity them. They are human beings too. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it so, lads?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze fixed\nupon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew brighter\nand brighter with an old man\xe2\x80\x99s mild smile, which drew the corners of his\nlips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased speaking and bowed\nhis head as if in perplexity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after all who asked them here? Serves them right, the bloody\nbastards!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, suddenly lifting his head.\n\nAnd flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time\nduring the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the soldiers\nlaughing joyfully and shouting \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could have\nrepeated the field marshal\xe2\x80\x99s address, begun solemnly and then changing\ninto an old man\xe2\x80\x99s simplehearted talk; but the hearty sincerity of that\nspeech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe\nand consciousness of the justice of our cause, exactly expressed by that\nold man\xe2\x80\x99s good-natured expletives, was not merely understood but lay\nin the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and\nlong-sustained shouts. Afterwards when one of the generals addressed\nKut\xc3\xbazov asking whether he wished his cal\xc3\xa8che to be sent for, Kut\xc3\xbazov in\nanswering unexpectedly gave a sob, being evidently greatly moved.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nWhen the troops reached their night\xe2\x80\x99s halting place on the eighth of\nNovember, the last day of the Kr\xc3\xa1snoe battles, it was already growing\ndusk. All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly\nfalling snow and toward evening it began to clear. Through the falling\nsnow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew\nkeener.\n\nAn infantry regiment which had left Tar\xc3\xbatino three thousand strong but\nnow numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night\nat its halting place\xe2\x80\x94a village on the highroad. The quartermasters who\nmet the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead\nFrenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff. There was only one hut\navailable for the regimental commander.\n\nThe commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the\nvillage and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.\n\nLike some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its\nlair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep\nthrough the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village, and\nimmediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of branches,\nand merry voices could be heard from there. Another section amid the\nregimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy\ngetting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the horses. A third\nsection scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff\nofficers, carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts, and\ndragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, for the\ncampfires, or wattle fences to serve for shelter.\n\nSome fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle\nwall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, all together\xe2\x80\x94shove!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the voices, and the huge surface\nof the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, was seen\nswaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked more and\nmore and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had been pushing\nit. Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That\xe2\x80\x99s it.... Where\nare you shoving to?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to sing. At\nthe end of the third verse as the last note died away, twenty voices\nroared out at once: \xe2\x80\x9cOo-oo-oo-oo! That\xe2\x80\x99s it. All together! Heave away,\nboys!...\xe2\x80\x9d but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved, and\nin the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand...\nwill you? You may want us one of these days.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSome twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way into the\nvillage joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was about\nthirty-five feet long and seven feet high, moved forward along the\nvillage street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the\ngasping men.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMerry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you up to?\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly came the authoritative voice of a\nsergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you\nfoul-mouthed devils, you brutes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to you!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted he,\nhitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you make less noise?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped\nhis face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against\nthe wattle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, how that devil hits out! He\xe2\x80\x99s made my face all bloody,\xe2\x80\x9d said he\nin a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d said a laughing voice, and moderating their tones\nthe men moved forward.\n\nWhen they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as\nbefore, interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives.\n\nIn the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had gathered and\nwere in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the\nmaneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed to make a flank march\nto the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) and capture him.\n\nBy the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place\nthe campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood\ncrackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers flitted\nto and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden\ndown.\n\nAxes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done without any\norders being given. Stores of wood were brought for the night, shelters\nwere rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being boiled, and muskets\nand accouterments put in order.\n\nThe wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the\nEighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket rests,\nand a campfire was built before it. They beat the tattoo, called the\nroll, had supper, and settled down round the fires for the night\xe2\x80\x94some\nrepairing their footgear, some smoking pipes, and some stripping\nthemselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOne would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched\nconditions the Russian soldiers were in at that time\xe2\x80\x94lacking warm boots\nand sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, in the snow\nwith eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full rations (the\ncommissariat did not always keep up with the troops)\xe2\x80\x94they would have\npresented a very sad and depressing spectacle.\n\nOn the contrary, the army had never under the best material conditions\npresented a more cheerful and animated aspect. This was because all who\nbegan to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army\nday by day. All the physically or morally weak had long since been left\nbehind and only the flower of the army\xe2\x80\x94physically and mentally\xe2\x80\x94remained.\n\nMore men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company than\nanywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their\ncampfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by their wattle\nthey demanded contributions of fuel.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Mak\xc3\xa9ev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you lost or\nhave the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a red-haired\nand red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the\nsmoke but not moving back from the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Jackdaw, go and fetch\nsome wood!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to another soldier.\n\nThis red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being\nrobust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The soldier\nthey called \xe2\x80\x9cJackdaw,\xe2\x80\x9d a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose\nobediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into\nthe light of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier\ncarrying a load of wood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring it here\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s fine!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with\ntheir mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats, making\nthe flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer and lit their pipes.\nThe handsome young soldier who had brought the wood, setting his arms\nakimbo, began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot\nwhere he stood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother! The dew is cold but clear.... It\xe2\x80\x99s well that I\xe2\x80\x99m a\nmusketeer...\xe2\x80\x9d he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out, your soles will fly off!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the red-haired man,\nnoticing that the sole of the dancer\xe2\x80\x99s boot was hanging loose. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\nfellow you are for dancing!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, and threw it\non the fire.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight enough, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and, having sat down, took out of his\nknapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his foot.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the steam that spoils them,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, stretching out his feet\ntoward the fire.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when we\xe2\x80\x99ve finished\nhammering them, we\xe2\x80\x99re to receive double kits!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that son of a bitch Petr\xc3\xb3v has lagged behind after all, it seems,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid one sergeant major.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had an eye on him this long while,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s a poor sort of soldier....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all very well, but when a man\xe2\x80\x99s feet are frozen how can he\nwalk?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said a sergeant major.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to be doing the same?\xe2\x80\x9d said an old soldier, turning\nreproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a\nsqueaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the\nfire, \xe2\x80\x9ca plump man gets thin, but for a thin one it\xe2\x80\x99s death. Take\nme, now! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no strength left,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with sudden resolution\nturning to the sergeant major. \xe2\x80\x9cTell them to send me to hospital; I\xe2\x80\x99m\naching all over; anyway I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be able to keep up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do, that\xe2\x80\x99ll do!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sergeant major quietly.\n\nThe soldier said no more and the talk went on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and the fact is that\nnot one of them had what you might call real boots on,\xe2\x80\x9d said a soldier,\nstarting a new theme. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were no more than make-believes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing the hut for the\ncolonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d put in\nthe dancer. \xe2\x80\x9cAs they turned them over one seemed still alive and, would\nyou believe it, he jabbered something in their lingo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99re a clean folk, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d the first man went on; \xe2\x80\x9che was\nwhite\xe2\x80\x94as white as birchbark\xe2\x80\x94and some of them are such fine fellows, you\nmight think they were nobles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand our talk at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the dancer with a\npuzzled smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in his\nown way. A queer lot!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s strange, friends,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the man who had wondered at their\nwhiteness, \xe2\x80\x9cthe peasants at Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk were saying that when they began\nburying the dead\xe2\x80\x94where the battle was you know\xe2\x80\x94well, those dead had been\nlying there for nearly a month, and says the peasant, \xe2\x80\x98they lie as white\nas paper, clean, and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it from the cold?\xe2\x80\x9d asked someone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If it\nhad been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. \xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 he\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,\xe2\x80\x99 he says,\n\xe2\x80\x98we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag\nthem off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98are white as paper\nand not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAll were silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be from their food,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant major. \xe2\x80\x9cThey used to\ngobble the same food as the gentry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNo one contradicted him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat peasant near Mozh\xc3\xa1ysk where the battle was said the men were all\ncalled up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and\nstill didn\xe2\x80\x99t finish carting the dead away. And as for the wolves, he\nsays...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a real battle,\xe2\x80\x9d said an old soldier. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the only one worth\nremembering; but since that... it\xe2\x80\x99s only been tormenting folk.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them and,\nmy word, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t let us get near before they just threw down their\nmuskets and went on their knees. \xe2\x80\x98Pardon!\xe2\x80\x99 they say. That\xe2\x80\x99s only one\ncase. They say Pl\xc3\xa1tov took \xe2\x80\x98Poleon himself twice. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\nthe right charm. He catches him and catches him\xe2\x80\x94no good! He turns into\na bird in his hands and flies away. And there\xe2\x80\x99s no way of killing him\neither.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a first-class liar, Kisel\xc3\xabv, when I come to look at you!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiar, indeed! It\xe2\x80\x99s the real truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he fell into my hands, when I\xe2\x80\x99d caught him I\xe2\x80\x99d bury him in the\nground with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a lot of men he\xe2\x80\x99s\nruined!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyhow we\xe2\x80\x99re going to end it. He won\xe2\x80\x99t come here again,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\nthe old soldier, yawning.\n\nThe conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to sleep.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the stars. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful how they shine! You would think the\nwomen had spread out their linen,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men, gazing with\nadmiration at the Milky Way.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of a good harvest next year.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall want some more wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou warm your back and your belly gets frozen. That\xe2\x80\x99s queer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? Look how he\xe2\x80\x99s\nsprawling!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen asleep\ncould be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, now and again\nexchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound\nof general, merry laughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the\nsoldiers, \xe2\x80\x9cand what a lot of them there are!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOne of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re having such fun,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, coming back. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Frenchies have\nturned up. One\xe2\x80\x99s quite frozen and the other\xe2\x80\x99s an awful swaggerer. He\xe2\x80\x99s\nsinging songs....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go across and have a look....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe Fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest. A huge\ncampfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow, lighting up the\nbranches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.\n\nAbout midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest,\nand the crackling of dry branches.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bear, lads,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men.\n\nThey all raised their heads to listen, and out of the forest into the\nbright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to\none another.\n\nThese were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest. They came up\nto the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did\nnot understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an officer\xe2\x80\x99s hat\nand seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he had been going to\nsit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl\ntied round his head, was stronger. He raised his companion and said\nsomething, pointing to his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen,\nspread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man, and brought some\nbuckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them.\n\nThe exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his head\nwrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.\n\nWhen Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he\nsuddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the\nsoldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and\nresting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire, looking at\nthe Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally he emitted\na long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel, pointing to his\nshoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that Ramballe was\nan officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian officer who had come up\nto the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a French\nofficer into his hut to warm him, and when the messenger returned and\nsaid that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him, Ramballe\nwas told to go. He rose and tried to walk, but staggered and would have\nfallen had not a soldier standing by held him up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the soldiers, winking and\nturning mockingly to Ramballe.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you are\xe2\x80\x94a real peasant!\xe2\x80\x9d came\nrebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.\n\nThey surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two\nsoldiers, and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around their\nnecks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh, my\nbrave, kind friends,\xe2\x80\x9d and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one\nof the men like a child.\n\nMeanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire, surrounded by\nthe soldiers.\n\nMorel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes, was\nwearing a woman\xe2\x80\x99s cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his\nhead over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing a French song\nin a hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier.\nThe soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, now then, teach us how it goes! I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon pick it up. How is\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man\xe2\x80\x94a singer and a wag\xe2\x80\x94whom Morel was embracing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!\xe2\x80\x9d sang Morel, winking. \xe2\x80\x9cCe\ndiable \xc3\xa0 quatre...\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n     * \xe2\x80\x9cLong live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! That rowdy\n     devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVivarika! Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the soldier, flourishing\nhis arm and really catching the tune.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo! Ha, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d rose their rough, joyous laughter from all sides.\n\nMorel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go on, go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n    \xe2\x80\x9cQui eut le triple talent,\n    De boire, de battre,\n    Et d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre un vert galant.\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n      * Who had a triple talent\n      For drinking, for fighting,\n      And for being a gallant old boy...\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt goes smoothly, too. Well, now, Zalet\xc3\xa1ev!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKe...\xe2\x80\x9d Zalet\xc3\xa1ev, brought out with effort: \xe2\x80\x9cke-e-e-e,\xe2\x80\x9d he drawled,\nlaboriously pursing his lips, \xe2\x80\x9cle-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e\nde-tra-va-ga-la\xe2\x80\x9d he sang.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after\nstarving.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to work on\nhis third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him.\nThe older men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such\nnonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one\nwould occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a\nsmile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are men too,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his\ncoat. \xe2\x80\x9cEven wormwood grows on its own root.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard\nfrost....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey all grew silent. The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking\nat them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring\nup, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering something\ngladsome and mysterious to one another.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical\nprogression; and that crossing of the Ber\xc3\xabzina about which so much has\nbeen written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction, and\nnot at all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so much has been\nand still is written about the Ber\xc3\xabzina, on the French side this is only\nbecause at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army\nhad been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment\ninto a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory, and on the\nRussian side merely because in Petersburg\xe2\x80\x94far from the seat of war\xe2\x80\x94a\nplan (again one of Pfuel\xe2\x80\x99s) had been devised to catch Napoleon in a\nstrategic trap at the Ber\xc3\xabzina River. Everyone assured himself that all\nwould happen according to plan, and therefore insisted that it was just\nthe crossing of the Ber\xc3\xabzina that destroyed the French army. In reality\nthe results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the French\xe2\x80\x94in\nguns and men lost\xe2\x80\x94than Kr\xc3\xa1snoe had been, as the figures show.\n\nThe sole importance of the crossing of the Ber\xc3\xabzina lies in the fact\nthat it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for\ncutting off the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s retreat and the soundness of the only possible\nline of action\xe2\x80\x94the one Kut\xc3\xbazov and the general mass of the army\ndemanded\xe2\x80\x94namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd fled\nat a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to\nreaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible\nto block its path. This was shown not so much by the arrangements it\nmade for crossing as by what took place at the bridges. When the bridges\nbroke down, unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with\nchildren who were with the French transport, all\xe2\x80\x94carried on by vis\ninerti\xc3\xa6\xe2\x80\x94pressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and\ndid not surrender.\n\nThat impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of pursuers\nwas equally bad. As long as they remained with their own people each\nmight hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held\namong them. But those who surrendered, while remaining in the same\npitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in the\nnecessities of life. The French did not need to be informed of the fact\nthat half the prisoners\xe2\x80\x94with whom the Russians did not know what to\ndo\xe2\x80\x94perished of cold and hunger despite their captors\xe2\x80\x99 desire to save\nthem; they felt that it could not be otherwise. The most compassionate\nRussian commanders, those favorable to the French\xe2\x80\x94and even the Frenchmen\nin the Russian service\xe2\x80\x94could do nothing for the prisoners. The French\nperished from the conditions to which the Russian army was itself\nexposed. It was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and\nindispensable soldiers to give to the French who, though not harmful, or\nhated, or guilty, were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did that,\nbut they were exceptions.\n\nCertain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was hope.\nTheir ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in collective\nflight, and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated.\n\nThe farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the\nremnant, especially after the Ber\xc3\xabzina, on which (in consequence of the\nPetersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians, and\nthe keener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, who blamed one\nanother and Kut\xc3\xbazov most of all. Anticipation that the failure of\nthe Petersburg Ber\xc3\xabzina plan would be attributed to Kut\xc3\xbazov led\nto dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more strongly\nexpressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a\nrespectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was\nto blame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or\nasking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable\nformality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at\nevery turn.\n\nBecause they could not understand him all these people assumed that\nit was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grasp the\nprofundity of their plans, that he would answer with his phrases (which\nthey thought were mere phrases) about a \xe2\x80\x9cgolden bridge,\xe2\x80\x9d about the\nimpossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions,\nand so forth. They had heard all that before. And all he said\xe2\x80\x94that it\nwas necessary to await provisions, or that the men had no boots\xe2\x80\x94was so\nsimple, while what they proposed was so complicated and clever, that\nit was evident that he was old and stupid and that they, though not in\npower, were commanders of genius.\n\nAfter the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg\nhero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their\nmaximum. Kut\xc3\xbazov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.\nOnly once, after the affair of the Ber\xc3\xabzina, did he get angry and write\nto Bennigsen (who reported separately to the Emperor) the following\nletter:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency please\nbe so good as to set off for Kal\xc3\xbaga on receipt of this, and there await\nfurther commands and appointments from His Imperial Majesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut after Bennigsen\xe2\x80\x99s departure, the Grand Duke Tsar\xc3\xa9vich Constantine\nP\xc3\xa1vlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the beginning of the\ncampaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by Kut\xc3\xbazov.\nNow having come to the army, he informed Kut\xc3\xbazov of the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s\ndispleasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their\nadvance. The Emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days\xe2\x80\x99\ntime.\n\nThe old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs\xe2\x80\x94this\nsame Kut\xc3\xbazov who in August had been chosen commander in chief\nagainst the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and\nheir-apparent from the army\xe2\x80\x94who on his own authority and contrary to the\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now realized at\nonce that his day was over, that his part was played, and that the power\nhe was supposed to hold was no longer his. And he understood this not\nmerely from the attitude of the court. He saw on the one hand that the\nmilitary business in which he had played his part was ended and felt\nthat his mission was accomplished; and at the same time he began to\nbe conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the\nnecessity of physical rest.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth of November Kut\xc3\xbazov entered V\xc3\xadlna\xe2\x80\x94his \xe2\x80\x9cdear V\xc3\xadlna\xe2\x80\x9d\nas he called it. Twice during his career Kut\xc3\xbazov had been governor of\nV\xc3\xadlna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old\nfriends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had\nso long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army\nand state and, as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed,\nimmersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been\naccustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be\ndone in the realm of history did not concern him at all.\n\nChichag\xc3\xb3v, one of the most zealous \xe2\x80\x9ccutters-off\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbreakers-up,\xe2\x80\x9d who\nhad first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but\nnever wished to go where he was sent: Chichag\xc3\xb3v, noted for the boldness\nwith which he spoke to the Emperor, and who considered Kut\xc3\xbazov to be\nunder an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace\nwith Turkey in 1811 independently of Kut\xc3\xbazov, and found that peace had\nalready been concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of\nsecuring that peace was really Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s; this Chichag\xc3\xb3v was the first\nto meet Kut\xc3\xbazov at the castle where the latter was to stay. In undress\nnaval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he handed\nKut\xc3\xbazov a garrison report and the keys of the town. The contemptuously\nrespectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was\nexpressed in the highest degree by the behavior of Chichag\xc3\xb3v, who knew\nof the accusations that were being directed against Kut\xc3\xbazov.\n\nWhen speaking to Chichag\xc3\xb3v, Kut\xc3\xbazov incidentally mentioned that the\nvehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at Bor\xc3\xadsov\nhad been recovered and would be restored to him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the\ncontrary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give\ndinner parties,\xe2\x80\x9d warmly replied Chichag\xc3\xb3v, who tried by every word he\nspoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kut\xc3\xbazov to be\nanimated by the same desire.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle penetrating\nsmile: \xe2\x80\x9cI meant merely to say what I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nContrary to the Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s wish Kut\xc3\xbazov detained the greater part of the\narmy at V\xc3\xadlna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack\nand physically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army\naffairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting\nthe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s arrival led a dissipated life.\n\nHaving left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suite\xe2\x80\x94Count\nTolst\xc3\xb3y, Prince Volk\xc3\xb3nski, Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, and others\xe2\x80\x94the Emperor reached\nV\xc3\xadlna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to\nthe castle. In spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff\nofficers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle, as well as\na guard of honor of the Sem\xc3\xabnov regiment.\n\nA courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with three\nfoam-flecked horses, shouted \xe2\x80\x9cComing!\xe2\x80\x9d and Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn rushed into the\nvestibule to inform Kut\xc3\xbazov, who was waiting in the hall porter\xe2\x80\x99s little\nlodge.\n\nA minute later the old man\xe2\x80\x99s large stout figure in full-dress uniform,\nhis chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach,\nwaddled out into the porch. He put on his hat with its peaks to the\nsides and, holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort\nsideways down the steps to the level of the street, took in his hand the\nreport he had prepared for the Emperor.\n\nThere was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew\nfuriously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh\nin which the figures of the Emperor and Volk\xc3\xb3nski could already be\ndescried.\n\nFrom the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect\non the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all over,\nreadjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and,\nat the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh,\nlifted his eyes to him, handed him the report and began speaking in his\nsmooth, ingratiating voice.\n\nThe Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kut\xc3\xbazov from head to foot,\nfrowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to the\nold man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too, owing\nto a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings, had its\nusual effect on Kut\xc3\xbazov and he gave a sob.\n\nThe Emperor greeted the officers and the Sem\xc3\xabnov guard, and again\npressing the old man\xe2\x80\x99s hand went with him into the castle.\n\nWhen alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his\ndissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made\nat Kr\xc3\xa1snoe and the Ber\xc3\xabzina, and informed him of his intentions for a\nfuture campaign abroad. Kut\xc3\xbazov made no rejoinder or remark. The same\nsubmissive, expressionless look with which he had listened to the\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before settled\non his face now.\n\nWhen Kut\xc3\xbazov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing\nthe ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by someone\xe2\x80\x99s\nvoice saying:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Serene Highness!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of\nCount Tolst\xc3\xb3y, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay\na small object. Kut\xc3\xbazov seemed not to understand what was expected of\nhim.\n\nSuddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed\nacross his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the\nobject that lay on the salver. It was the Order of St. George of the\nFirst Class.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nNext day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the Emperor\nhonored by his presence. Kut\xc3\xbazov had received the Order of St. George\nof the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors, but\neveryone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him. The proprieties\nwere observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example,\nbut everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and\ngood-for-nothing. When Kut\xc3\xbazov, conforming to a custom of Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s\nday, ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the\nEmperor\xe2\x80\x99s feet on his entering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry face\nand muttered something in which some people caught the words, \xe2\x80\x9cthe old\ncomedian.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure with Kut\xc3\xbazov was specially increased at V\xc3\xadlna\nby the fact that Kut\xc3\xbazov evidently could not or would not understand the\nimportance of the coming campaign.\n\nWhen on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers assembled\nabout him: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not only saved Russia, you have saved Europe!\xe2\x80\x9d they\nall understood that the war was not ended.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that\nno fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia,\nbut could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had\ngained. He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying\nfresh troops, spoke of the hardships already endured by the people, of\nthe possibility of failure and so forth.\n\nThis being the field marshal\xe2\x80\x99s frame of mind he was naturally regarded\nas merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.\n\nTo avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural method was\nto do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with Barclay at\nthe beginning of the Russian campaign\xe2\x80\x94to transfer the authority to the\nEmperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under the commander in\nchief\xe2\x80\x99s feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the\nchange.\n\nWith this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real\nstrength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, Konovn\xc3\xadtsyn, and\nErm\xc3\xb3lov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke loudly of the field\nmarshal\xe2\x80\x99s great weakness and failing health.\n\nHis health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to\nanother. And in fact his health was poor.\n\nSo naturally, simply, and gradually\xe2\x80\x94just as he had come from Turkey to\nthe Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to the army\nwhen he was needed there\xe2\x80\x94now when his part was played out, Kut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s\nplace was taken by a new and necessary performer.\n\nThe war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to every Russian\nheart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.\n\nThe movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a\nmovement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war another\nleader was necessary, having qualities and views differing from\nKut\xc3\xbazov\xe2\x80\x99s and animated by different motives.\n\nAlexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east\nto west and for the refixing of national frontiers as Kut\xc3\xbazov had been\nfor the salvation and glory of Russia.\n\nKut\xc3\xbazov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or\nNapoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative of\nthe Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia had\nbeen liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was nothing\nleft to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for the representative of the\nnational war but to die, and Kut\xc3\xbazov died.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAs generally happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the\nphysical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after\nthey were over. After his liberation he reached Or\xc3\xabl, and on the third\nday there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up\nfor three months. He had what the doctors termed \xe2\x80\x9cbilious fever.\xe2\x80\x9d But\ndespite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him\nmedicines to drink, he recovered.\n\nScarcely any impression was left on Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s mind by all that happened\nto him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He remembered\nonly the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internal physical\ndistress, and pains in his feet and side. He remembered a general\nimpression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being\nworried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him, he\nalso remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses, and\nabove all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time.\nOn the day of his rescue he had seen the body of P\xc3\xa9tya Rost\xc3\xb3v. That same\nday he had learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of\nBorodin\xc3\xb3 for more than a month had recently died in the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 house\nat Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl, and Den\xc3\xadsov who told him this news also mentioned H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s\ndeath, supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at\nthe time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its\nsignificance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as\npossible from places where people were killing one another, to some\npeaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over\nall the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Or\xc3\xabl he\nimmediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw\nin attendance on him two of his servants, Ter\xc3\xa9nty and V\xc3\xa1ska, who had\ncome from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been\nliving on his estate at El\xc3\xa9ts and hearing of his rescue and illness had\ncome to look after him.\n\nIt was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost the\nimpressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months\nand got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere\ntomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he\nwould be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in\nhis dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity. In the\nsame way little by little he came to understand the news he had been\ntold after his rescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, the death of\nhis wife, and the destruction of the French.\n\nA joyous feeling of freedom\xe2\x80\x94that complete inalienable freedom natural\nto man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside\nMoscow\xe2\x80\x94filled Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s soul during his convalescence. He was surprised\nto find that this inner freedom, which was independent of external\nconditions, now had as it were an additional setting of external\nliberty. He was alone in a strange town, without acquaintances. No one\ndemanded anything of him or sent him anywhere. He had all he wanted:\nthe thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no\nlonger there, since she was no more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how good! How splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself when a cleanly laid\ntable was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down for\nthe night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the French had\ngone and that his wife was no more. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how good, how splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd by old habit he asked himself the question: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what then?\nWhat am I going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d And he immediately gave himself the answer:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he had\ncontinually sought to find\xe2\x80\x94the aim of life\xe2\x80\x94no longer existed for\nhim now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared\ntemporarily\xe2\x80\x94he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not\npresent itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the\ncomplete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at\nthis time.\n\nHe could not see an aim, for he now had faith\xe2\x80\x94not faith in any kind of\nrule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever-manifest\nGod. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself. That search for\nan aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity\nhe had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his\nnurse had told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere. In his\ncaptivity he had learned that in Karat\xc3\xa1ev God was greater, more infinite\nand unfathomable than in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the\nFreemasons. He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into\nthe far distance finds what he sought at his very feet. All his life\nhe had looked over the heads of the men around him, when he should have\nmerely looked in front of him without straining his eyes.\n\nIn the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable\ninfinite something. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and\nhad looked for it. In everything near and comprehensible he had seen\nonly what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had\nequipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space,\nwhere petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to\nhim great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen. And such\nhad European life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and philanthropy\nseemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as he had accounted\nthem, his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen\nthe same pettiness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, however, he\nhad learned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everything, and\ntherefore\xe2\x80\x94to see it and enjoy its contemplation\xe2\x80\x94he naturally threw away\nthe telescope through which he had till now gazed over men\xe2\x80\x99s heads, and\ngladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and\ninfinite life around him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and\nhappy he became. That dreadful question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d which had formerly\ndestroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that\nquestion, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d a simple answer was now always ready in his soul:\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there is a God, that God without whose will not one hair falls\nfrom a man\xe2\x80\x99s head.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIn external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance he\nwas just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed\noccupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special\nof his own. The difference between his former and present self was that\nformerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to\nhim, he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to\ndistinguish something at a distance. At present he still forgot what was\nsaid to him and still did not see what was before his eyes, but he now\nlooked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what\nwas before him and listened to what was said, though evidently seeing\nand hearing something quite different. Formerly he had appeared to be\na kindhearted but unhappy man, and so people had been inclined to avoid\nhim. Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips, and\nsympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to\nwhether they were as contented as he was, and people felt pleased by his\npresence.\n\nPreviously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and\nseldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in conversation and\nknew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate\nsecrets.\n\nThe princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly\nhostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after\nthe old count\xe2\x80\x99s death, now after staying a short time in Or\xc3\xabl\xe2\x80\x94where she\nhad come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she\nconsidered it her duty to nurse him\xe2\x80\x94felt to her surprise and vexation\nthat she had become fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek her\napproval, he merely studied her with interest. Formerly she had felt\nthat he regarded her with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into\nherself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side\nof her nature; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most\nintimate places of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but afterwards\ngratefully, she let him see the hidden, kindly sides of her character.\n\nThe most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more\nsuccessfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and\nshowing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s cunning consisted simply in\nfinding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered,\nhard, and (in her own way) proud princess.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence of\nbad people but of people such as myself,\xe2\x80\x9d thought she.\n\nHis servants too\xe2\x80\x94Ter\xc3\xa9nty and V\xc3\xa1ska\xe2\x80\x94in their own way noticed the change\nthat had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had become much\n\xe2\x80\x9csimpler.\xe2\x80\x9d Ter\xc3\xa9nty, when he had helped him undress and wished him good\nnight, often lingered with his master\xe2\x80\x99s boots in his hands and clothes\nover his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk. And Pierre,\nnoticing that Ter\xc3\xa9nty wanted a chat, generally kept him there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, tell me... now, how did you get food?\xe2\x80\x9d he would ask.\n\nAnd Ter\xc3\xa9nty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of\nthe old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and\ntalking, or sometimes listening to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s stories, and then would go\nout into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and\naffection for him.\n\nThe doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though he\nconsidered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment\nwas of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Pierre\ntelling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the\ncharacters of his patients in general, and especially of the ladies.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our\nprovincials,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say.\n\nThere were several prisoners from the French army in Or\xc3\xabl, and the\ndoctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.\n\nThis officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make fun of\nthe tenderness the Italian expressed for him.\n\nThe Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk\nwith him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love,\nand pour out to him his indignation against the French and especially\nagainst Napoleon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight\nsuch a nation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, who have suffered so from the\nFrench, do not even feel animosity toward them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely by\nevoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing.\n\nDuring the last days of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s stay in Or\xc3\xabl his old Masonic\nacquaintance Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in\n1807, came to see him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who\nhad a large estate in Or\xc3\xabl province, and he occupied a temporary post in\nthe commissariat department in that town.\n\nHearing that Bez\xc3\xbakhov was in Or\xc3\xabl, Willarski, though they had never been\nintimate, came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy\nthat people who meet in a desert generally express for one another.\nWillarski felt dull in Or\xc3\xabl and was pleased to meet a man of his own\ncircle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.\n\nBut to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much\nbehind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into\napathy and egotism.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nBut for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been\nformerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as\nhe looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that\nhe had been like that himself but a short time before.\n\nWillarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs,\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, and his official duties. He regarded all these\noccupations as hindrances to life, and considered that they were all\ncontemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his\nfamily. Military, administrative, political, and Masonic interests\ncontinually absorbed his attention. And Pierre, without trying to\nchange the other\xe2\x80\x99s views and without condemning him, but with the quiet,\njoyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, was interested in this\nstrange though very familiar phenomenon.\n\nThere was a new feature in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s relations with Willarski, with the\nprincess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which\ngained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of\nthe impossibility of changing a man\xe2\x80\x99s convictions by words, and his\nrecognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing\nthings each from his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of\neach individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a\nbasis of the sympathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other\npeople. The difference, and sometimes complete contradiction, between\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s opinions and their lives, and between one man and another, pleased\nhim and drew from him an amused and gentle smile.\n\nIn practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center\nof gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary questions,\nespecially requests for money to which, as an extremely wealthy man,\nhe was very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and\nperplexity. \xe2\x80\x9cTo give or not to give?\xe2\x80\x9d he had asked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\nit and he needs it. But someone else needs it still more. Who needs it\nmost? And perhaps they are both impostors?\xe2\x80\x9d In the old days he had been\nunable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all\nwho asked as long as he had anything to give. Formerly he had been in a\nsimilar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his\nproperty, when one person advised one thing and another something else.\n\nNow to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or\nperplexity about these questions. There was now within him a judge who\nby some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done.\n\nHe was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he felt\ncertain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first time he\nhad recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a colonel,\ncame to him and, after talking a great deal about his exploits,\nconcluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre should give\nhim four thousand francs to send to his wife and children. Pierre\nrefused without the least difficulty or effort, and was afterwards\nsurprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so\ninsurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused the colonel\xe2\x80\x99s\ndemand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when\nleaving Or\xc3\xabl, to induce the Italian officer to accept some money of\nwhich he was evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own\nmore settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision\nwith regard to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in\nand near Moscow.\n\nHis head steward came to him at Or\xc3\xabl and Pierre reckoned up with him his\ndiminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according to the\nhead steward\xe2\x80\x99s calculation, about two million rubles.\n\nTo console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate\nshowing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but\nwould even be increased if he refused to pay his wife\xe2\x80\x99s debts which he\nwas under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his Moscow house\nand the country house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him eighty\nthousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course that\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre with a cheerful smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t need all that at all. By being ruined I have become much richer.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut in January Sav\xc3\xa9lich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the\nstate of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made\nof the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this\nas of a settled matter. About the same time he received letters from\nPrince Vas\xc3\xadli and other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\ndebts. And Pierre decided that the steward\xe2\x80\x99s proposals which had so\npleased him were wrong and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s affairs and must rebuild in Moscow. Why this was necessary he\ndid not know, but he knew for certain that it was necessary. His income\nwould be reduced by three fourths, but he felt it must be done.\n\nWillarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.\n\nDuring the whole time of his convalescence in Or\xc3\xabl Pierre had\nexperienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his\njourney he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new\nfaces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt like\na schoolboy on holiday. Everyone\xe2\x80\x94the stagecoach driver, the post-house\noverseers, the peasants on the roads and in the villages\xe2\x80\x94had a new\nsignificance for him. The presence and remarks of Willarski who\ncontinually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia and its\nbackwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure.\nWhere Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary strength and\nvitality\xe2\x80\x94the strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained\nthe life of this original, peculiar, and unique people. He did not\ncontradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with him\xe2\x80\x94an apparent\nagreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to\nnothing\xe2\x80\x94and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nIt would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap\nhas been destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of\nrubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they\njostle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally\ndifficult to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of the\nFrench to throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow. But when\nwe watch the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy, and\nimmense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction\nof the heap, something indestructible, which though intangible is the\nreal strength of the colony, still exists; and similarly, though in\nMoscow in the month of October there was no government and no churches,\nshrines, riches, or houses\xe2\x80\x94it was still the Moscow it had been in\nAugust. All was destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and\nindestructible.\n\nThe motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after it had\nbeen cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at first\nfor the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had in\ncommon: a desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, to\napply their activities there.\n\nWithin a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in a\nfortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the\nnumber, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what it had been in\n1812.\n\nThe first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerode\xe2\x80\x99s\ndetachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and residents who had\nfled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity. The Russians who\nentered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered it in their turn. They\ncontinued what the French had begun. Trains of peasant carts came to\nMoscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the\nruined houses and the streets. The Cossacks carried off what they could\nto their camps, and the householders seized all they could find in other\nhouses and moved it to their own, pretending that it was their property.\n\nBut the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third\ncontingent, and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more\ndifficult and assumed more definite forms.\n\nThe French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of\nregular life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship, with\nluxury, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms were\nlifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, warehouses,\nmarket stalls, granaries\xe2\x80\x94for the most part still stocked with goods\xe2\x80\x94and\nthere were factories and workshops, palaces and wealthy houses filled\nwith luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government offices, churches, and\ncathedrals. The longer the French remained the more these forms of town\nlife perished, until finally all was merged into one confused, lifeless\nscene of plunder.\n\nThe more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the\nwealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But\nplundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city\nbegan, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater\nthe number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth\nof the city and its regular life restored.\n\nBesides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by curiosity,\nsome by official duties, some by self-interest\xe2\x80\x94house owners, clergy,\nofficials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and peasants\xe2\x80\x94streamed into\nMoscow as blood flows to the heart.\n\nWithin a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off\nplunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses\nout of the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comrades\xe2\x80\x99\ndiscomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down\none another\xe2\x80\x99s prices to below what they had been in former days. Gangs\nof carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, and on\nall sides logs were being hewn, new houses built, and old, charred ones\nrepaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths. Cookshops and taverns were\nopened in partially burned houses. The clergy resumed the services\nin many churches that had not been burned. Donors contributed\nChurch property that had been stolen. Government clerks set up their\nbaize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms.\nThe higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of\ngoods left behind by the French. The owners of houses in which much\nproperty had been left, brought there from other houses, complained of\nthe injustice of taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the Kr\xc3\xa9mlin;\nothers insisted that as the French had gathered things from different\nhouses into this or that house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to\nkeep all that was found there. They abused the police and bribed them,\nmade out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that\nhad perished in the fire, and demanded relief. And Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn\nwrote proclamations.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nAt the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of\nhis house which had not been burned. He called on Count Rostopch\xc3\xadn and\non some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he intended to leave\nfor Petersburg two days later. Everybody was celebrating the victory,\neverything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city.\nEveryone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished to meet him, and\neveryone questioned him about what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly\nwell disposed toward them all, but was now instinctively on his\nguard for fear of binding himself in any way. To all questions put to\nhim\xe2\x80\x94whether important or quite trifling\xe2\x80\x94such as: Where would he live?\nWas he going to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg and would he\nmind taking a parcel for someone?\xe2\x80\x94he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cI\nthink so,\xe2\x80\x9d and so on.\n\nHe had heard that the Rost\xc3\xb3vs were at Kostrom\xc3\xa1 but the thought of\nNat\xc3\xa1sha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant\nmemory of the distant past. He felt himself not only free from social\nobligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had\naroused in himself.\n\nOn the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetsk\xc3\xb3ys that\nPrincess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days of\nPrince Andrew had often occupied Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and now recurred to\nhim with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary\nwas in Moscow and living in her house\xe2\x80\x94which had not been burned\xe2\x80\x94in\nVozdv\xc3\xadzhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.\n\nOn his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their\nfriendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last\none at Borodin\xc3\xb3.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?\nIs it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him\nbefore he died?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. He recalled Karat\xc3\xa1ev and his death and\ninvoluntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so\nsimilar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he\nfelt for both of them.\n\nPierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood.\nThe house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its\ngeneral aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a\nstern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence\nof the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house,\ninformed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments, and that\nshe received on Sundays.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnnounce me. Perhaps she will see me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease step into the portrait gallery.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought\nword from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he\nwould excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.\n\nIn a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her\nanother person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess\nalways had lady companions, but who they were and what they were like\nhe never knew or remembered. \xe2\x80\x9cThis must be one of her companions,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nthought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.\n\nThe princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her\nhand, \xe2\x80\x9cso this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the very\nlast,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a\nshyness that surprised him for an instant.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good\nnews we had received for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAgain the princess glanced round at her companion with even more\nuneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre\ninterrupted her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust imagine\xe2\x80\x94I knew nothing about him!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he had been\nkilled. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only know that\nhe fell in with the Rost\xc3\xb3vs.... What a strange coincidence!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the\ncompanion\xe2\x80\x99s face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and,\nas often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion\nin the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not\nhinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.\n\nBut when he mentioned the Rost\xc3\xb3vs, Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s face expressed still\ngreater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s face to\nthat of the lady in the black dress and said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really not recognize her?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre looked again at the companion\xe2\x80\x99s pale, delicate face with its\nblack eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long forgotten\nand more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThis stern, thin, pale face that\nlooks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut at that moment Princess Mary said, \xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d And with difficulty,\neffort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its\nhinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from\nthat opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with\na happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been\nthinking\xe2\x80\x94especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and\nenveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possible,\nit was Nat\xc3\xa1sha and he loved her.\n\nAt that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess Mary,\nand above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had been unaware.\nHe flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He tried to hide his\nagitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more clearly\xe2\x80\x94clearer\nthan any words could have done\xe2\x80\x94did he betray to himself, to her, and to\nPrincess Mary that he loved her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s only the unexpectedness of it,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. But as soon as\nhe tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he\nagain glanced at Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and\na still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul. He\nbecame confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was\nsaying.\n\nPierre had failed to notice Nat\xc3\xa1sha because he did not at all expect to\nsee her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the change in\nher since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin and pale, but\nthat was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unrecognizable at the\nmoment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with\na suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when he first entered and\nglanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes\nwere kindly attentive and sadly interrogative.\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s part,\nbut only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has come to stay with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cThe count and\ncountess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dreadful\nstate; but it was necessary for Nat\xc3\xa1sha herself to see a doctor. They\ninsisted on her coming with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, is there a family free from sorrow now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, addressing\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it happened the very day we were rescued. I saw him.\nWhat a delightful boy he was!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes\nwidened and lit up.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can one say or think of as a consolation?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\nWhy had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith...\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\nPrincess Mary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, that is really true,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre hastily interrupted her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it true?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha asked, looking attentively into Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ask why?\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thought alone of what\nawaits...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked\ninquiringly at Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd because,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre continued, \xe2\x80\x9conly one who believes that there is a\nGod ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and... yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped.\nPierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed Princess Mary,\nasking about his friend\xe2\x80\x99s last days.\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he felt\nthat his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was now a\njudge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to\nhim than that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was\nconsidering what impression his words would make on Nat\xc3\xa1sha. He did\nnot purposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he\nregarded from her standpoint.\n\nPrincess Mary\xe2\x80\x94reluctantly as is usual in such cases\xe2\x80\x94began telling of\nthe condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. But Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s face\nquivering with emotion, his questions and his eager restless expression,\ngradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall\nfor her own sake.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, and so...?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with\nhis whole body and eagerly listened to her story. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes... so he\ngrew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always sought\none thing\xe2\x80\x94to be perfectly good\xe2\x80\x94so he could not be afraid of death. The\nfaults he had\xe2\x80\x94if he had any\xe2\x80\x94were not of his making. So he did soften?...\nWhat a happy thing that he saw you again,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, suddenly turning to\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and looking at her with eyes full of tears.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment.\nShe hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that was happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d she then said in her quiet voice with its\ndeep chest notes. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me it certainly was happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d She paused. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\nhe... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I entered\nthe room....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her\nknees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her\nhead and began to speak rapidly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare to\nask about him. Then suddenly S\xc3\xb3nya told me he was traveling with us. I\nhad no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was\nto see him and be with him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.\n\nAnd not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had\nnever yet mentioned to anyone\xe2\x80\x94all she had lived through during those\nthree weeks of their journey and life at Yarosl\xc3\xa1vl.\n\nPierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of\ntears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of death,\nnor of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only pity for\nher, for what she was suffering now while she was speaking.\n\nPrincess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat beside\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, and heard for the first time the story of those last days of\nher brother\xe2\x80\x99s and Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s love.\n\nEvidently Nat\xc3\xa1sha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.\n\nShe spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of\nher soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she\nrepeated the same thing twice.\n\nDessalles\xe2\x80\x99 voice was heard outside the door asking whether little\nNicholas might come in to say good night.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x94everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nShe got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the door\nwhich was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and rushed\nfrom the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.\n\nPierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not\nunderstand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.\n\nPrincess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention\nto her nephew who had entered the room.\n\nAt that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 face, which\nresembled his father\xe2\x80\x99s, affected Pierre so much that when he had kissed\nthe boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, and went to the\nwindow. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but she would not let\nhim go.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Nat\xc3\xa1sha and I sometimes don\xe2\x80\x99t go to sleep till after two, so please\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we will come immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBefore Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first\ntime she has talked of him like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nPierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; a few minutes\nlater he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with Nat\xc3\xa1sha. Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nwas calm, though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her\nface. They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness\nwhich usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is\nimpossible to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is\nawkward, and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like\naffectation. They went silently to table. The footmen drew back the\nchairs and pushed them up again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin\nand, resolving to break the silence, looked at Nat\xc3\xa1sha and at Princess\nMary. They had evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of\nboth shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life\nalso has joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you take vodka, Count?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Princess Mary, and those words\nsuddenly banished the shadows of the past. \xe2\x80\x9cNow tell us about yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid she. \xe2\x80\x9cOne hears such improbable wonders about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary Abr\xc3\xa1movna\ninvited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened, or ought\nto have happened, to me. Step\xc3\xa1n Step\xc3\xa1nych also instructed me how I ought\nto tell of my experiences. In general I have noticed that it is very\neasy to be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people\ninvite me out and tell me all about myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha smiled and was on the point of speaking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been told,\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary interrupted her, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you lost two\nmillions in Moscow. Is that true?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am three times as rich as before,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pierre.\n\nThough the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\ndebts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he had\nbecome three times as rich as before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have certainly gained is freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d he began seriously, but did\nnot continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you building?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Sav\xc3\xa9lich says I must!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, you did not know of the countess\xe2\x80\x99 death when you decided to\nremain in Moscow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing\nthat her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his\nwords a meaning he had perhaps not intended.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning\nPrincess Mary had given to his words. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard of it in Or\xc3\xabl and you\ncannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,\xe2\x80\x9d he\nadded quickly, glancing at Nat\xc3\xa1sha and noticing on her face curiosity as\nto how he would speak of his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cbut her death shocked me terribly.\nWhen two people quarrel they are always both in fault, and one\xe2\x80\x99s own\nguilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer\nalive. And then such a death... without friends and without consolation!\nI am very, very sorry for her,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, and was pleased to notice\na look of glad approval on Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess\nMary.\n\nPierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look\nat Nat\xc3\xa1sha. When he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold,\nstern, and he fancied even contemptuous.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been told?\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Princess Mary.\n\nPierre laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner\nmeans being Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s guest. Not only did I never see him but I heard\nnothing about him\xe2\x80\x94I was in much lower company!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSupper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his\ncaptivity was gradually led on to do so.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nasked with a slight smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI guessed it then when we met at the\nS\xc3\xbakharev tower, do you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by\nPrincess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s questions and especially by Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s into giving a\ndetailed account of his adventures.\n\nAt first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with\nhim toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he came\nto describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was\nunconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed\nemotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he\nhas lived through.\n\nPrincess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his goodness.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face constantly\nchanging with the narrative, watched Pierre with an attention that never\nwandered\xe2\x80\x94evidently herself experiencing all that he described. Not only\nher look, but her exclamations and the brief questions she put, showed\nPierre that she understood just what he wished to convey. It was clear\nthat she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to,\nbut could not, express in words. The account Pierre gave of the incident\nwith the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was\nthis: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an awful sight\xe2\x80\x94children abandoned, some in the flames...\nOne was snatched out before my eyes... and there were women who had\ntheir things snatched off and their earrings torn out...\xe2\x80\x9d he flushed and\ngrew confused. \xe2\x80\x9cThen a patrol arrived and all the men\xe2\x80\x94all those who were\nnot looting, that is\xe2\x80\x94were arrested, and I among them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you\xe2\x80\x99re not telling us everything; I am sure you did\nsomething...\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha and pausing added, \xe2\x80\x9csomething fine?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass\nover the horrible details, but Nat\xc3\xa1sha insisted that he should not omit\nanything.\n\nPierre began to tell about Karat\xc3\xa1ev, but paused. By this time he had\nrisen from the table and was pacing the room, Nat\xc3\xa1sha following him with\nher eyes. Then he added:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand what I learned from that illiterate man\xe2\x80\x94that\nsimple fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, go on!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey killed him almost before my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last\ndays of their retreat, of Karat\xc3\xa1ev\xe2\x80\x99s illness and his death.\n\nHe told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now, as\nit were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that he was\ntelling it all to Nat\xc3\xa1sha he experienced that pleasure which a man has\nwhen women listen to him\xe2\x80\x94not clever women who when listening either try\nto remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity\noffers to retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their\nown and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their\nlittle mental workshop\xe2\x80\x94but the pleasure given by real women gifted with\na capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself.\nNat\xc3\xa1sha without knowing it was all attention: she did not lose a word,\nno single quiver in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in\nhis face, nor a single gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its\nflight and took it straight into her open heart, divining the secret\nmeaning of all Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s mental travail.\n\nPrincess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she\nnow saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the\npossibility of love and happiness between Nat\xc3\xa1sha and Pierre, and the\nfirst thought of this filled her heart with gladness.\n\nIt was three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad and\nstern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.\n\nPierre finished his story. Nat\xc3\xa1sha continued to look at him intently\nwith bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to understand\nsomething more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in shamefaced\nand happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what\nto say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary was silent. It\noccurred to none of them that it was three o\xe2\x80\x99clock and time to go to\nbed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople speak of misfortunes and sufferings,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if\nat this moment I were asked: \xe2\x80\x98Would you rather be what you were before\nyou were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?\xe2\x80\x99 then for\nheaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh! We imagine\nthat when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is\nonly then that what is new and good begins. While there is life there is\nhappiness. There is much, much before us. I say this to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\nturning to Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, answering something quite different. \xe2\x80\x9cI too should\nwish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre looked intently at her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and nothing more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not true, not true!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not to blame for being\nalive and wishing to live\xe2\x80\x94nor you either.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuddenly Nat\xc3\xa1sha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and\nbegan to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Nat\xc3\xa1sha?\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled at Pierre through her tears. \xe2\x80\x9cGood night!\nIt is time for bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre rose and took his leave.\n\n\nPrincess Mary and Nat\xc3\xa1sha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of\nwhat Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of\nPierre nor did Nat\xc3\xa1sha speak of him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good night, Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, I am often afraid\nthat by not speaking of him\xe2\x80\x9d (she meant Prince Andrew) \xe2\x80\x9cfor fear of not\ndoing justice to our feelings, we forget him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s remark, but she did not express agreement in words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible to forget?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and\npainful, but good, very good!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure he really loved\nhim. That is why I told him... Was it all right?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, suddenly\nblushing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess\nMary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Mary...\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha suddenly said with a mischievous smile\nsuch as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, \xe2\x80\x9che has\nsomehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh\xe2\x80\x94as if he had just come out of\na Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has greatly improved.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he\nhad come straight from the bath... Papa used to...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand why he\xe2\x80\x9d (Prince Andrew) \xe2\x80\x9cliked no one so much as him,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Princess Mary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when they\nare quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike him\xe2\x80\x94in\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nAnd the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as\nif it had been forgotten there.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nIt was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He paced\nup and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem\nand frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now\nsmiling happily.\n\nHe was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and of their love, at one\nmoment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling.\nIt was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the\nroom.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done if it cannot be avoided? What\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?\nEvidently it has to be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself, and hastily undressing\nhe got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or\nindecision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything\nthat she and I may be man and wife,\xe2\x80\x9d he told himself.\n\nA few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the\nFriday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Sav\xc3\xa9lich came to ask him about\npacking for the journey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe asked involuntarily, though only to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, long ago\nbefore this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy? But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is and\nhow attentive, and how he remembers everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, looking at\nSav\xc3\xa9lich\xe2\x80\x99s old face, \xe2\x80\x9cand what a pleasant smile he has!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sav\xc3\xa9lich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre\nasked him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under the\nlate count\xe2\x80\x94the kingdom of heaven be his!\xe2\x80\x94and we have lived under you\ntoo, without ever being wronged.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your children?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children will live just the same. With such masters one can live.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about my heirs?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cSupposing I suddenly marry...\nit might happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with an involuntary smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow easy he thinks it,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how terrible\nit is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sav\xc3\xa9lich.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it off for a bit. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you later. You must forgive\nthe trouble I have put you to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, and seeing Sav\xc3\xa9lich smile,\nhe thought: \xe2\x80\x9cBut how strange it is that he should not know that now\nthere is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first of\nall! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shall\nI have a talk with him and see what he thinks?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\nanother time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had been to\nsee Princess Mary the day before and had there met\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhom do you think?\nNat\xc3\xa1sha Rost\xc3\xb3va!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he\nhad seen Anna Sem\xc3\xabnovna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen the princess,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard that they were\narranging a match for her with young Rost\xc3\xb3v. It would be a very good\nthing for the Rost\xc3\xb3vs, they are said to be utterly ruined.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I mean do you know Nat\xc3\xa1sha Rost\xc3\xb3va?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she either doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand or is pretending,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter not say anything to her either.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s journey.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow kind they all are,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is surprising is that\nthey should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of\ninterest to them. And all for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOn the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send\na representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be\nreturned to their owners that day.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this man too,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pierre, looking into the face of the Chief\nof Police. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy\nbothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is not honest\nand takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he take bribes?\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a\nkind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre went to Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s to dinner.\n\nAs he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned\ndown, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness\nof the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters\nof the town, stretching out and concealing one another, reminded him of\nthe Rhine and the Colosseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers,\nthe carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes, the women\nhawkers, and the shopkeepers, all looked at him with cheerful beaming\neyes that seemed to say: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, there he is! Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what will come of\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt the entrance to Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s house Pierre felt doubtful whether\nhe had really been there the night before and really seen Nat\xc3\xa1sha and\ntalked to her. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find\nno one there.\xe2\x80\x9d But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her\npresence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom. She\nwas in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the\nsame way as the day before, yet she was quite different. Had she been\nlike this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have\nfailed to recognize her.\n\nShe was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince\nAndrew\xe2\x80\x99s fianc\xc3\xa9e. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on\nher face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.\n\nPierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there, but\nPrincess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.\n\nNext day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though\nPrincess Mary and Nat\xc3\xa1sha were evidently glad to see their visitor and\nthough all Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s interest was now centered in that house, by the\nevening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from\none trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long\nthat Princess Mary and Nat\xc3\xa1sha exchanged glances, evidently wondering\nwhen he would go. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy\nand embarrassed, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take\nhis leave.\n\nPrincess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of\na headache began to say good night.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not going,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as\nthough offended. \xe2\x80\x9cYes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x94but I won\xe2\x80\x99t say\ngood-by yet. I will call round in case you have any commissions for me,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not taking\nhis departure.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other hand\ninstead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly and\nintently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she\nhad plainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and\nlong-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.\n\nWhen Nat\xc3\xa1sha left the room Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s confusion and awkwardness\nimmediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly\nmoved an armchair toward Princess Mary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I wanted to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, answering her look as if she had\nspoken. \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my\ndear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I\nknow it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to\nher. No, not that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I can\xe2\x80\x99t...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know when I began to love her, but I have loved her and her\nalone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without\nher. I cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that\nperhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that\npossibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope?\nTell me what I am to do, dear princess!\xe2\x80\x9d he added after a pause, and\ntouched her hand as she did not reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking of what you have told me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Princess Mary.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at\npresent...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was\nimpossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change\nin Nat\xc3\xa1sha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre\nspoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo speak to her now wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the princess all the same.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI know...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre was looking into Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?... Well?...\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that she loves... will love you,\xe2\x80\x9d Princess Mary corrected\nherself.\n\nBefore her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened\nexpression seized Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cWrite to her\nparents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to\nhappen and my heart tells me it will.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can\xe2\x80\x99t be.... How happy I am!\nNo, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go. But I may come again\ntomorrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNext day Pierre came to say good-by. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was less animated than\nshe had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre\nsometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she\nexisted any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\nNo, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x9d he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that\nfilled his soul with joy.\n\nWhen on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not help\nholding it a little longer in his own.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure\nof feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that it will one\nday be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to myself?... No, that\xe2\x80\x99s\nimpossible!...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d she said aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall look forward very much to\nyour return,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in a whisper.\n\nAnd these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face which\naccompanied them, formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible\nmemories, interpretations, and happy meditations for Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I shall\nlook forward very much to your return....\xe2\x80\x99 Yes, yes, how did she say it?\nYes, \xe2\x80\x98I shall look forward very much to your return.\xe2\x80\x99 Oh, how happy I\nam! What is happening to me? How happy I am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre to himself.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThere was nothing in Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s soul now at all like what had troubled it\nduring his courtship of H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne.\n\nHe did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words\nhe had spoken, or say: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, why did I not say that?\xe2\x80\x9d and, \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever made\nme say \xe2\x80\x98Je vous aime\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d On the contrary, he now repeated in imagination\nevery word that he or Nat\xc3\xa1sha had spoken and pictured every detail of\nher face and smile, and did not wish to diminish or add anything, but\nonly to repeat it again and again. There was now not a shadow of doubt\nin his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong.\nOnly one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: \xe2\x80\x9cWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it all\na dream? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceited and\nself-confident? I believe all this\xe2\x80\x94and suddenly Princess Mary will tell\nher, and she will be sure to smile and say: \xe2\x80\x98How strange! He must be\ndeluding himself. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he know that he is a man, just a man, while\nI...? I am something altogether different and higher.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any\nplans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only\nhe could attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended\nwith that.\n\nA joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself incapable,\npossessed him. The whole meaning of life\xe2\x80\x94not for him alone but for the\nwhole world\xe2\x80\x94seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of\nbeing loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with\none thing only\xe2\x80\x94his future happiness. Sometimes it seemed to him that\nother people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to\nhide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests. In\nevery word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He often\nsurprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which\nseemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. And when\nhe realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied\nthem with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them\nthat all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of\nattention.\n\nWhen it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service,\nor when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the\nassumption that everybody\xe2\x80\x99s welfare depended on this or that issue\nof events, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise\npeople by his strange comments. But at this time he saw everybody\xe2\x80\x94both\nthose who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of life (that\nis, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently did not\nunderstand it\xe2\x80\x94in the bright light of the emotion that shone within\nhimself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met\neverything that was good and worthy of being loved.\n\nWhen dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, her memory\naroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he\nnow knew. Prince Vas\xc3\xadli, who having obtained a new post and some\nfresh decorations was particularly proud at this time, seemed to him a\npathetic, kindly old man much to be pitied.\n\nOften in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity. All\nthe views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true\nfor him always. He not only did not renounce them subsequently, but when\nhe was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he referred to the views he had\nheld at this time of his madness and they always proved correct.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may have appeared strange and queer then,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I was\nnot so mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wiser and had\nmore insight than at any other time, and understood all that is worth\nunderstanding in life, because... because I was happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to\ndiscover personal attributes which he termed \xe2\x80\x9cgood qualities\xe2\x80\x9d in people\nbefore loving them; his heart was now overflowing with love, and by\nloving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving\nthem.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nAfter Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s departure that first evening, when Nat\xc3\xa1sha had said to\nPrincess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks just, yes, just as\nif he had come out of a Russian bath\xe2\x80\x94in a short coat and with his hair\ncropped,\xe2\x80\x9d something hidden and unknown to herself, but irrepressible,\nawoke in Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s soul.\n\nEverything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered.\nTo her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the\nsurface and demanded satisfaction. From that evening she seemed to have\nforgotten all that had happened to her. She no longer complained of her\nposition, did not say a word about the past, and no longer feared to\nmake happy plans for the future. She spoke little of Pierre, but when\nPrincess Mary mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled\nin her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile.\n\nThe change that took place in Nat\xc3\xa1sha at first surprised Princess Mary;\nbut when she understood its meaning it grieved her. \xe2\x80\x9cCan she have loved\nmy brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?\xe2\x80\x9d she thought\nwhen she reflected on the change. But when she was with Nat\xc3\xa1sha she was\nnot vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reawakened power\nof life that had seized Nat\xc3\xa1sha was so evidently irrepressible and\nunexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had\nno right to reproach her even in her heart.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that\nshe did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright\nand cheerful.\n\nWhen Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with\nPierre, Nat\xc3\xa1sha met her on the threshold.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\n\nAnd a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for\nher joy settled on Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnderstandable and touching as the look with which Nat\xc3\xa1sha gazed at\nher seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation,\nthese words pained her for a moment. She remembered her brother and his\nlove.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done? She can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the princess.\n\nAnd with a sad and rather stern look she told Nat\xc3\xa1sha all that Pierre\nhad said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg Nat\xc3\xa1sha was\nastounded.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Petersburg!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated as if unable to understand.\n\nBut noticing the grieved expression on Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s face she guessed\nthe reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9ctell me what I should do! I am afraid of being bad.\nWhatever you tell me, I will do. Tell me....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love him?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why are you crying? I am happy for your sake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary,\nwho because of those tears quite forgave Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s joy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t be just yet\xe2\x80\x94someday. Think what fun it will be when I am his\nwife and you marry Nicholas!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey were silent awhile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why go to Petersburg?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha suddenly asked, and hastily replied\nto her own question. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no, no, he must... Yes, Mary, He must....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE: 1813 - 20\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nSeven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had\nsubsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the\nmysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of\ntheir motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.\n\nThough the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the movement\nof humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Various groups\nof people formed and dissolved, the coming formation and dissolution of\nkingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation.\n\nThe sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as\npreviously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures were not\nborne by the waves from one shore to another as before. They now seemed\nto rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the head of armies,\nwho formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars,\ncampaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless movement by political\nand diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.\n\nThe historians call this activity of the historical figures \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nreaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical\npersonages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the\nreaction. All the well-known people of that period, from Alexander and\nNapoleon to Madame de Sta\xc3\xabl, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Chateaubriand,\nand the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or\ncondemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction.\n\nAccording to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in Russia\nalso, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who according\nto them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement\nof his reign, being the savior of Russia.\n\nThere is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to\nlearned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander for\nthings he did wrong at this period of his reign.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he did\nwell and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning of\nhis reign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution\nto Poland, forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to Arakch\xc3\xa9ev,\nfavoring Gol\xc3\xadtsyn and mysticism, and afterwards Shishk\xc3\xb3v and Photius.\nHe also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and\ndisbanding the Sem\xc3\xabnov regiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the\nhistorians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for\nhumanity.\n\nWhat do these reproaches mean?\n\nDo not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I\n(the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with\nNapoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813)\nflow from the same sources\xe2\x80\x94the circumstances of his birth, education,\nand life\xe2\x80\x94that made his personality what it was and from which the\nactions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoration of\nPoland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also flowed?\n\nIn what does the substance of those reproaches lie?\n\nIt lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I,\nstanding on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the\nblinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to those\nstrongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception\ninseparable from power; a character who at every moment of his life\nfelt a responsibility for all that was happening in Europe; and not\na fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal\nhabits, passions, and impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth\xe2\x80\x94that\nthis character\xe2\x80\x94though not lacking in virtue (the historians do not\naccuse him of that)\xe2\x80\x94had not the same conception of the welfare of\nhumanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his\nyouth upwards has been occupied with learning: that is, with books and\nlectures and with taking notes from them.\n\nBut even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was mistaken in\nhis view of what was good for the people, we must inevitably assume that\nthe historian who judges Alexander will also after the lapse of some\ntime turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity.\nThis assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because, watching\nthe movement of history, we see that every year and with each new\nwriter, opinion as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what\nonce seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa. And what is\nmore, we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to\nwhat is bad and what is good in history: some people regard giving a\nconstitution to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance as praiseworthy in\nAlexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.\n\nThe activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or\nharmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful.\nIf that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does\nnot agree with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether the\npreservation of my father\xe2\x80\x99s house in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian\narms, or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities, or the\nfreedom of Poland or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in\nEurope, or a certain kind of European culture called \xe2\x80\x9cprogress\xe2\x80\x9d appear\nto me to be good or bad, I must admit that besides these things the\naction of every historic character has other more general purposes\ninaccessible to me.\n\nBut let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all\ncontradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by\nwhich to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander\ncould have done everything differently; let us say that with guidance\nfrom those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the\nmovement of humanity, he might have arranged matters according to\nthe program his present accusers would have given him\xe2\x80\x94of nationality,\nfreedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the ground). Let\nus assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated,\nand that Alexander had acted on it. What would then have become of the\nactivity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in\nthe government\xe2\x80\x94an activity that in the opinion of the historians was\ngood and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: there would\nhave been no life, there would have been nothing.\n\nIf we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of\nlife is destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIf we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the\nattainment of certain ends\xe2\x80\x94the greatness of Russia or of France,\nthe balance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas of the\nRevolution, general progress, or anything else\xe2\x80\x94then it is impossible\nto explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of\nchance and genius.\n\nIf the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth\ncentury had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might have been\naccomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion. If\nthe aim was the aggrandizement of France, that might have been attained\nwithout the Revolution and without the Empire. If the aim was the\ndissemination of ideas, the printing press could have accomplished that\nmuch better than warfare. If the aim was the progress of civilization,\nit is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization\nmore expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives.\n\nWhy did it happen in this and not in some other way?\n\nBecause it happened so! \xe2\x80\x9cChance created the situation; genius utilized\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d says history.\n\nBut what is chance? What is genius?\n\nThe words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and\ntherefore cannot be defined. Those words only denote a certain stage of\nunderstanding of phenomena. I do not know why a certain event occurs; I\nthink that I cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk about\nchance. I see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary\nhuman agencies; I do not understand why this occurs and I talk of\ngenius.\n\nTo a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a\nspecial enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others\nmust seem to be a genius. And it must appear an astonishing conjunction\nof genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram,\nwho instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a\nspecial enclosure where there are oats\xe2\x80\x94that this very ram, swelling with\nfat, is killed for meat.\n\nBut the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them\nhappens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they need only\nadmit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken,\nand they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened\nto the ram that was fattened. Even if they do not know for what purpose\nthey are fattened, they will at least know that all that happened to the\nram did not happen accidentally, and will no longer need the conceptions\nof chance or genius.\n\nOnly by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately\nintelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our\nken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of\nhistoric characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce\n(incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and then the words\nchance and genius become superfluous.\n\nWe need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European\nconvulsions and that we know only the facts\xe2\x80\x94that is, the murders, first\nin France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in Spain,\nand in Russia\xe2\x80\x94and that the movements from the west to the east and from\nthe east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events, and\nnot only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in\nNapoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them to\nbe anything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have\nrecourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made\nthese people what they were, but it will be clear that all those small\nevents were inevitable.\n\nBy discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall\nclearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for\nany single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it is\nimpossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the\nsmallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, than Napoleon and\nAlexander with all their antecedents.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe fundamental and essential significance of the European events of the\nbeginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of\nthe European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west.\nThe commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east.\nFor the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement\nto Moscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves into\na military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike\nmilitary group of the east, (2) that they should abandon all established\ntraditions and customs, and (3) that during their military movement they\nshould have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them\nthe deceptions, robberies, and murders which would have to be committed\nduring that movement.\n\nAnd beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately large\ngroup was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions, and step\nby step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and\ntraditions, and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the\ncoming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done.\n\nA man without convictions, without habits, without traditions, without\na name, and not even a Frenchman, emerges\xe2\x80\x94by what seem the strangest\nchances\xe2\x80\x94from among all the seething French parties, and without joining\nany one of them is borne forward to a prominent position.\n\nThe ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance of\nhis opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling and\nself-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the\narmy. The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to Italy,\nhis opponents\xe2\x80\x99 reluctance to fight, and his own childish audacity and\nself-confidence secure him military fame. Innumerable so-called chances\naccompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he falls with the\nrulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts to avoid his\npredestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received into the Russian\nservice, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothing. During\nthe war in Italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and\neach time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various diplomatic\nconsiderations the Russian armies\xe2\x80\x94just those which might have destroyed\nhis prestige\xe2\x80\x94do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there.\n\nOn his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process\nof dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped\nout and destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerous position\npresents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition\nto Africa. Again so-called chance accompanies him. Impregnable Malta\nsurrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes are crowned with\nsuccess. The enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fleet, which subsequently did not let a single boat\npass, allows his entire army to elude it. In Africa a whole series of\noutrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants. And the\nmen who commit these crimes, especially their leader, assure themselves\nthat this is admirable, this is glory\xe2\x80\x94it resembles Caesar and Alexander\nthe Great and is therefore good.\n\nThis ideal of glory and grandeur\xe2\x80\x94which consists not merely in\nconsidering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every\ncrime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural\nsignificance\xe2\x80\x94that ideal, destined to guide this man and his associates,\nhad scope for its development in Africa. Whatever he does succeeds. The\nplague does not touch him. The cruelty of murdering prisoners is not\nimputed to him as a fault. His childishly rash, uncalled-for, and\nignoble departure from Africa, leaving his comrades in distress, is\nset down to his credit, and again the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s fleet twice lets him slip\npast. When, intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully,\nhe reaches Paris, the dissolution of the republican government, which a\nyear earlier might have ruined him, has reached its extreme limit, and\nhis presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can\nonly serve to exalt him\xe2\x80\x94and though he himself has no plan, he is quite\nready for his new r\xc3\xb4le.\n\nHe had no plan, he was afraid of everything, but the parties snatched at\nhim and demanded his participation.\n\nHe alone\xe2\x80\x94with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy and\nEgypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness in crime and frankness in\nlying\xe2\x80\x94he alone could justify what had to be done.\n\nHe is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart from\nhis will and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his\nmistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and\nthe conspiracy is crowned with success.\n\nHe is pushed into a meeting of the legislature. In alarm he wishes to\nflee, considering himself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon and\nsays senseless things that should have ruined him. But the once proud\nand shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played out, are\neven more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they should have\nsaid to destroy him and retain their power.\n\nChance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as if by\nagreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the characters\nof the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms the character\nof Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; chance contrives\na plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his\npower. Chance puts the Duc d\xe2\x80\x99Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly\ncauses him to kill him\xe2\x80\x94thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than\nin any other way that he had the right, since he had the might.\nChance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an\nexpedition against England (which would inevitably have ruined him) he\nnever carries out that intention, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and\nthe Austrians, who surrender without a battle. Chance and genius give\nhim the victory at Austerlitz; and by chance all men, not only the\nFrench but all Europe\xe2\x80\x94except England which does not take part in the\nevents about to happen\xe2\x80\x94despite their former horror and detestation of\nhis crimes, now recognize his authority, the title he has given\nhimself, and his ideal of grandeur and glory, which seems excellent and\nreasonable to them all.\n\nAs if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement, the\nwestern forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 1807,\nand 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of people that\nhad formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Central\nEurope. The strength of the justification of the man who stands at the\nhead of the movement grows with the increased size of the group. During\nthe ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all\nthe crowned heads of Europe. The discredited rulers of the world can\noppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of\nglory and grandeur. One after another they hasten to display their\ninsignificance before him. The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek\nthe great man\xe2\x80\x99s mercy; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that\nthis man receives a daughter of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the\nguardian of all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the\naggrandizement of the great man. It is not Napoleon who prepares himself\nfor the accomplishment of his role, so much as all those round him who\nprepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is\nhappening and has to happen. There is no step, no crime or petty fraud\nhe commits, which in the mouths of those around him is not at once\nrepresented as a great deed. The most suitable f\xc3\xaate the Germans can\ndevise for him is a celebration of Jena and Auerst\xc3\xa4dt. Not only is he\ngreat, but so are his ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his\nbrothers-in-law. Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his\nreason and to prepare him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so\ntoo are the forces.\n\nThe invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal\xe2\x80\x94Moscow. That\ncity is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing\narmies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Wagram. But\nsuddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had\nso consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the\npredestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur\xe2\x80\x94from\nthe cold in his head at Borodin\xc3\xb3 to the sparks which set Moscow on\nfire, and the frosts\xe2\x80\x94and instead of genius, stupidity and immeasurable\nbaseness become evident.\n\nThe invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are now\nnot for Napoleon but always against him.\n\nA countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a\nremarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.\nAttempted drives from east to west\xe2\x80\x94similar to the contrary movements of\n1805, 1807, and 1809\xe2\x80\x94precede the great westward movement; there is the\nsame coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion\nof the people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation\nmidway, and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached.\n\nParis, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army\nare destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his\nactions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance\noccurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of\ntheir sufferings. Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his\ncraft exposed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten\nyears previously and one year later\xe2\x80\x94an outlawed brigand. But by some\nstrange chance no one perceives this. His part is not yet ended. The man\nwho ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand\nis sent to an island two days\xe2\x80\x99 sail from France, which for some reason\nis presented to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and\nmillions of money are paid him.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels. The\nwaves of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface eddies are\nformed in which float the diplomatists, who imagine that they have\ncaused the floods to abate.\n\nBut the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The diplomatists\nthink that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure\nof natural forces; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; the\nposition seems to them insoluble. But the wave they feel to be rising\ndoes not come from the quarter they expect. It rises again from the same\npoint as before\xe2\x80\x94Paris. The last backwash of the movement from the west\noccurs: a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable\ndiplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of\nhistory.\n\nThe man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without any\nconspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by\nstrange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they\ncursed the day before and will curse again a month later.\n\nThis man is still needed to justify the final collective act.\n\nThat act is performed.\n\nThe last r\xc3\xb4le is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his\npowder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.\n\nAnd some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself\nin solitude on his island, justifying his actions by intrigues and lies\nwhen the justification is no longer needed, and displaying to the whole\nworld what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an\nunseen hand directed his actions.\n\nThe manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor\nshows him to us.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what you believed in! This is he! Do you now see that it was not he\nbut I who moved you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut dazed by the force of the movement, it was long before people\nunderstood this.\n\nStill greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of\nAlexander I, the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from\neast to west.\n\nWhat was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the head of\nthat movement from east to west?\n\nWhat was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with European\naffairs, but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; a moral\nsuperiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated with him;\na mild and attractive personality; and a personal grievance against\nNapoleon. And all this was found in Alexander I; all this had been\nprepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life: his education,\nhis early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded him, and by\nAusterlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.\n\nDuring the national war he was inactive because he was not needed. But\nas soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he\nappeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the nations of\nEurope, led them to the goal.\n\nThe goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses all\npossible power. How does he use it?\n\nAlexander I\xe2\x80\x94the pacifier of Europe, the man who from his early years\nhad striven only for his people\xe2\x80\x99s welfare, the originator of the liberal\ninnovations in his fatherland\xe2\x80\x94now that he seemed to possess the utmost\npower and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the\nwelfare of his peoples\xe2\x80\x94at the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing\nup childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy\nhad he retained power\xe2\x80\x94Alexander I, having fulfilled his mission and\nfeeling the hand of God upon him, suddenly recognizes the insignificance\nof that supposed power, turns away from it, and gives it into the hands\nof contemptible men whom he despises, saying only:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!... I too am a man like the\nrest of you. Let me live like a man and think of my soul and of God.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself, and\nyet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to\ncomprehend, so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet\nhas them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man.\n\nA bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child is afraid\nof bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires the\nbee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the\nfragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from\nflowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey.\nAnother beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely\nsays that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear\na queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices\nthat the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil\nfertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of the bee\xe2\x80\x99s\nexistence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices that the\nbee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpose of the\nbee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first,\nthe second, or any of the processes the human mind can discern. The\nhigher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes,\nthe more obvious it becomes, that the ultimate purpose is beyond our\ncomprehension.\n\nAll that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to\nother manifestations of life. And so it is with the purpose of historic\ncharacters and nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s wedding to Bez\xc3\xbakhov, which took place in 1813, was the last\nhappy event in the family of the old Rost\xc3\xb3vs. Count Ily\xc3\xa1 Rost\xc3\xb3v died\nthat same year and, as always happens, after the father\xe2\x80\x99s death the\nfamily group broke up.\n\nThe events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the flight\nfrom it, the death of Prince Andrew, Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s despair, P\xc3\xa9tya\xe2\x80\x99s death,\nand the old countess\xe2\x80\x99 grief fell blow after blow on the old count\xe2\x80\x99s\nhead. He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these\nevents, and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and\ninviting further blows which would finish him. He seemed now frightened\nand distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising.\n\nThe arrangements for Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s marriage occupied him for a while. He\nordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful, but\nhis cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the contrary it\nevoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him.\n\nWhen Pierre and his wife had left, he grew very quiet and began to\ncomplain of depression. A few days later he fell ill and took to his\nbed. He realized from the first that he would not get up again, despite\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement. The countess passed a fortnight in an\narmchair by his pillow without undressing. Every time she gave him\nhis medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand. On his last day,\nsobbing, he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having\ndissipated their property\xe2\x80\x94that being the chief fault of which he was\nconscious. After receiving communion and unction he quietly died; and\nnext day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects\nto the deceased filled the house rented by the Rost\xc3\xb3vs. All these\nacquaintances, who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so\noften laughed at him, now said, with a common feeling of self-reproach\nand emotion, as if justifying themselves: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, whatever he may have\nbeen he was a most worthy man. You don\xe2\x80\x99t meet such men nowadays.... And\nwhich of us has not weaknesses of his own?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was just when the count\xe2\x80\x99s affairs had become so involved that it was\nimpossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he\nunexpectedly died.\n\nNicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death reached him. He at once resigned his commission, and\nwithout waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to\nMoscow. The state of the count\xe2\x80\x99s affairs became quite obvious a month\nafter his death, surprising everyone by the immense total of small\ndebts the existence of which no one had suspected. The debts amounted to\ndouble the value of the property.\n\nFriends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance. But\nhe regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father\xe2\x80\x99s memory, which he\nheld sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the\ninheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts.\n\nThe creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a vague\nbut powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the count\xe2\x80\x99s\ncareless good nature, all proceeded to enforce their claims at once. As\nalways happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get\npaid first, and those who like M\xc3\xadtenka held promissory notes given them\nas presents now became the most exacting of the creditors. Nicholas was\nallowed no respite and no peace, and those who had seemed to pity\nthe old man\xe2\x80\x94the cause of their losses (if they were losses)\xe2\x80\x94now\nremorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the\ndebts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them.\n\nNot one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold by\nauction for half its value, and half the debts still remained\nunpaid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his\nbrother-in-law Bez\xc3\xbakhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due\nfor value received. And to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder, as\nthe creditors threatened, he re-entered the government service.\n\nHe could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at\nthe next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on\nlife; and so despite his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people who\nhad known him before, and despite his abhorrence of the civil service,\nhe accepted a post in Moscow in that service, doffed the uniform of\nwhich he was so fond, and moved with his mother and S\xc3\xb3nya to a small\nhouse on the S\xc3\xadvtsev Vrazh\xc3\xb3k.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had no\nclear idea of Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 circumstances. Having borrowed money from his\nbrother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him.\nHis position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve\nhundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and S\xc3\xb3nya,\nbut had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. The\ncountess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she\nhad been used to from childhood and, unable to realize how hard it was\nfor her son, kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep) to\nsend for a friend, now some expensive article of food for herself, or\nwine for her son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for Nat\xc3\xa1sha or\nS\xc3\xb3nya, or for Nicholas himself.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up with her\nwhims and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their poverty\nfrom the old countess. Nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted\nto S\xc3\xb3nya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her\npatience and devotion, but tried to keep aloof from her.\n\nHe seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect, and\nbecause there was nothing to reproach her with. She had all that people\nare valued for, but little that could have made him love her. He felt\nthat the more he valued her the less he loved her. He had taken her at\nher word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all\nthat had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in\nany case be renewed.\n\nNicholas\xe2\x80\x99 position became worse and worse. The idea of putting something\naside out of his salary proved a dream. Not only did he not save\nanything, but to comply with his mother\xe2\x80\x99s demands he even incurred some\nsmall debts. He could see no way out of this situation. The idea of\nmarrying some rich woman, which was suggested to him by his female\nrelations, was repugnant to him. The other way out\xe2\x80\x94his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\ndeath\xe2\x80\x94never entered his head. He wished for nothing and hoped\nfor nothing, and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern\nsatisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position. He tried\nto avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive\noffers of assistance; he avoided all distraction and recreation, and\neven at home did nothing but play cards with his mother, pace silently\nup and down the room, and smoke one pipe after another. He seemed\ncarefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled\nhim to endure his position.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAt the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow. From reports\ncurrent in town she learned how the Rost\xc3\xb3vs were situated, and how \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nson has sacrificed himself for his mother,\xe2\x80\x9d as people were saying.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never expected anything else of him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Princess Mary to herself,\nfeeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering her friendly\nrelations with all the Rost\xc3\xb3vs which had made her almost a member of the\nfamily, she thought it her duty to go to see them. But remembering her\nrelations with Nicholas in Vor\xc3\xb3nezh she was shy about doing so. Making\na great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her\narrival in Moscow.\n\nNicholas was the first to meet her, as the countess\xe2\x80\x99 room could only be\nreached through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure as she\nhad expected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold, stiff,\nproud expression she had not seen on it before. He inquired about her\nhealth, led the way to his mother, and having sat there for five minutes\nleft the room.\n\nWhen the princess came out of the countess\xe2\x80\x99 room Nicholas met her again,\nand with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom.\nTo her remarks about his mother\xe2\x80\x99s health he made no reply. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that\nto you? Leave me in peace,\xe2\x80\x9d his looks seemed to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does she come prowling here? What does she want? I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear these\nladies and all these civilities!\xe2\x80\x9d said he aloud in S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\nevidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princess\xe2\x80\x99 carriage\nhad disappeared.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?\xe2\x80\x9d cried S\xc3\xb3nya, hardly able to\nconceal her delight. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any\nmore. But after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a\nday.\n\nShe sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her, expressed\na wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored when she\nbegan to talk about her.\n\nNicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess,\nbut his silence irritated her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a very admirable and excellent young woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\nmust go and call on her. You would at least be seeing somebody, and I\nthink it must be dull for you only seeing us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least want to, Mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou used to want to, and now you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Really I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\nmy dear. One day you are dull, and the next you refuse to see anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I never said I was dull.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you said yourself you don\xe2\x80\x99t want even to see her. She is a very\nadmirable young woman and you always liked her, but now suddenly you\nhave got some notion or other in your head. You hide everything from\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, Mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were asking you to do something disagreeable now\xe2\x80\x94but I only ask\nyou to return a call. One would think mere politeness required it....\nWell, I have asked you, and now I won\xe2\x80\x99t interfere any more since you\nhave secrets from your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go if you wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a\npatience, trying to divert his mother\xe2\x80\x99s attention to another topic.\n\nThe same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the\nday after that.\n\nAfter her visit to the Rost\xc3\xb3vs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by\nNicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had been right in\nnot wishing to be the first to call.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expected nothing else,\xe2\x80\x9d she told herself, calling her pride to her\naid. \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the\nold lady, who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many\nobligations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a feeling akin\nto remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit. Though she had\nfirmly resolved not to call on the Rost\xc3\xb3vs again and to forget the whole\nmatter, she felt herself all the time in an awkward position. And when\nshe asked herself what distressed her, she had to admit that it was her\nrelation to Rost\xc3\xb3v. His cold, polite manner did not express his feeling\nfor her (she knew that) but it concealed something, and until she could\ndiscover what that something was, she felt that she could not be at\nease.\n\nOne day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her\nnephew\xe2\x80\x99s lessons, she was informed that Rost\xc3\xb3v had called. With a firm\nresolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent\nfor Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.\n\nHer first glance at Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 face told her that he had only come to\nfulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain\nthe tone in which he addressed her.\n\nThey spoke of the countess\xe2\x80\x99 health, of their mutual friends, of the\nlatest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety had\nelapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say good-by.\n\nWith Mademoiselle Bourienne\xe2\x80\x99s help the princess had maintained the\nconversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he rose,\nshe was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and her\nmind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little\nhappiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still, her\nluminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he had risen.\n\nNicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her\nabstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then\nagain looked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of\nsuffering on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was\nvaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face\nexpressed. He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could\nthink of nothing to say.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, Princess!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\nShe started, flushed, and sighed deeply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as if waking up. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going\nalready, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the\ncountess!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she\nleft the room.\n\nThey both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, \xe2\x80\x9cit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\nseem long ago since we first met at Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, but how much water\nhas flowed since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then, yet\nI would give much to bring back that time... but there\xe2\x80\x99s no bringing it\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrincess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones\nas he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of\nhis words which would explain his feeling for her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you have no reason to regret the past, Count.\nAs I understand your present life, I think you will always recall it\nwith satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills it now...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot accept your praise,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted her hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the\ncontrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an\ninteresting or cheerful subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. But the\nprincess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved, and it\nwas to him that she now spoke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you would allow me to tell you this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had come\nso near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would not\nconsider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d and suddenly her\nvoice trembled. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, recovering herself,\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut you used to be different, and...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a thousand reasons why,\xe2\x80\x9d laying special emphasis on the why.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d he added softly. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes it is hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why! That\xe2\x80\x99s why!\xe2\x80\x9d a voice whispered in Princess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s soul.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only that\nhandsome exterior, that I loved in him. I divined his noble, resolute,\nself-sacrificing spirit too,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is poor now\nand I am rich.... Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only reason.... Yes, were it not for\nthat...\xe2\x80\x9d And remembering his former tenderness, and looking now at his\nkind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why, Count, why?\xe2\x80\x9d she almost cried, unconsciously moving closer to\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Tell me. You must tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your why, Count,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for\nme... I confess it. For some reason you wish to deprive me of our former\nfriendship. And that hurts me.\xe2\x80\x9d There were tears in her eyes and in her\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard\nfor me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d and suddenly she began to cry\nand was hurrying from the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, trying to stop her.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe turned round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\xe2\x80\x94and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became\npossible, inevitable, and very near.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIn the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved to Bald\nHills with his wife, his mother, and S\xc3\xb3nya.\n\nWithin four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without\nselling any of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s property, and having received a small\ninheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well.\n\nIn another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs that he\nwas able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating\nto buy back Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe\xe2\x80\x94that being his pet dream.\n\nHaving started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it\nthat it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was\na plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones\nthen coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate\nmanagement, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products,\nand the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any\nparticular part of the work on his estate. He always had before his\nmind\xe2\x80\x99s eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it. The\nchief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen\nin the air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important\nagent by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made\neffective\xe2\x80\x94the peasant laborer. When Nicholas first began farming\nand began to understand its different branches, it was the serf who\nespecially attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely\na tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself. At first\nhe watched the serfs, trying to understand their aims and what they\nconsidered good and bad, and only pretended to direct them and give\norders while in reality learning from them their methods, their manner\nof speech, and their judgment of what was good and bad. Only when he\nhad understood the peasants\xe2\x80\x99 tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk\ntheir language, to grasp the hidden meaning of their words, and felt\nakin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to\nperform toward them the duties demanded of him. And Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 management\nproduced very brilliant results.\n\nGuided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the\nestates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and\ndelegate, the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they\nhad the right to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before\nanalyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and\ncredit (as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle the\npeasants had and increased the number by all possible means. He kept the\npeasant families together in the largest groups possible, not allowing\nthe family groups to divide into separate households. He was hard alike\non the lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled\nfrom the commune.\n\nHe was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants\xe2\x80\x99 hay\nand corn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown\nand harvested so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did\nNicholas.\n\nHe disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cdrones\xe2\x80\x9d\nas he called them\xe2\x80\x94and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity. When\na decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf, especially if one\nhad to be punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in\nthe house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted\ninstead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He\nnever felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his\nevery decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions.\n\nHe did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to\nmake things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined\nto do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he\nshould or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in\nhis own mind.\n\nOften, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he would\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can one do with our Russian peasants?\xe2\x80\x9d and imagined that he\ncould not bear them.\n\nYet he loved \xe2\x80\x9cour Russian peasants\xe2\x80\x9d and their way of life with his whole\nsoul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one\nway and manner of farming which produced good results.\n\nCountess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s and regretted\nthat she could not share it; but she could not understand the joys and\nvexations he derived from that world, to her so remote and alien. She\ncould not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy\nwhen, after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the\nfields or on the threshing floor, he returned from the sowing or mowing\nor reaping to have tea with her. She did not understand why he spoke\nwith such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and\nwell-to-do peasant Matthew Erm\xc3\xadshin, who with his family had carted\ncorn all night; or of the fact that his (Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99) sheaves were already\nstacked before anyone else had his harvest in. She did not understand\nwhy he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his\nmustache and winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall\non the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why when the wind\ncarried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return\nfrom the barn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of\nwormwood and gentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, one more day and my grain and the peasants\xe2\x80\x99 will all be\nunder cover.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStill less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready to\nanticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she brought\nhim a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her\nto be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should obstinately\nrefuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her\nbusiness. She felt he had a world apart, which he loved passionately and\nwhich had laws she had not fathomed.\n\nSometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work he\nwas doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: \xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least;\nit never entered my head and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that for their good! That\xe2\x80\x99s\nall poetry and old wives\xe2\x80\x99 talk\xe2\x80\x94all that doing good to one\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor!\nWhat I want is that our children should not have to go begging. I must\nput our affairs in order while I am alive, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. And to do that,\norder and strictness are essential.... That\xe2\x80\x99s all about it!\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\nclenching his vigorous fist. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd fairness, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\nif the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse, he\ncan do no good either for himself or for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd all Nicholas did was fruitful\xe2\x80\x94probably just because he refused to\nallow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtue\xe2\x80\x99s\nsake. His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring estates came\nto beg him to buy them, and long after his death the memory of his\nadministration was devoutly preserved among the serfs. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a\nmaster... the peasants\xe2\x80\x99 affairs first and then his own. Of course he was\nnot to be trifled with either\xe2\x80\x94in a word, he was a real master!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOne matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas, and\nthat was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making\nfree use of his fists. At first he saw nothing reprehensible in\nthis, but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of\npunishment suddenly changed.\n\nOnce in summer he had sent for the village elder from Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo, a\nman who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of\ndishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the porch\nto question him, and immediately after the elder had given a few replies\nthe sound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas\nwent up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery\nframe, and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that\nmorning. Among other things he spoke of the Boguch\xc3\xa1rovo elder. Countess\nMary turned red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and\nlips compressed and gave her husband no reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch an insolent scoundrel!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, growing hot again at the mere\nrecollection of him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he had told me he was drunk and did not see...\nBut what is the matter with you, Mary?\xe2\x80\x9d he suddenly asked.\n\nCountess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked\ndown again and her lips puckered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, whatever is the matter, my dearest?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when she was in\ntears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always from sorrow or\npity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm.\n\nThe moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself\nand began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nshe covered her face with her hands.\n\nNicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and paced up\nand down the room. He understood what she was weeping about, but could\nnot in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded\nfrom childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it just\nsentimentality, old wives\xe2\x80\x99 tales, or is she right?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself.\nBefore he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with\nlove and pain, and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he\nhad long been sinning against himself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary,\xe2\x80\x9d he said softly, going up to her, \xe2\x80\x9cit will never happen again;\nI give you my word. Never,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy\nasking for forgiveness.\n\nThe tears flowed faster still from the countess\xe2\x80\x99 eyes. She took his hand\nand kissed it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas, when did you break your cameo?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked to change the\nsubject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of\nLaoco\xc3\xb6n\xe2\x80\x99s head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x94it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, don\xe2\x80\x99t remind me of it!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nagain he flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cI give you my word of honor it shan\xe2\x80\x99t occur again,\nand let this always be a reminder to me,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed to the broken\nring.\n\nAfter that, when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the\nblood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench, Nicholas would\nturn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the\nman who was making him angry. But he did forget himself once or twice\nwithin a twelvemonth, and then he would go and confess to his wife, and\nwould again promise that this should really be the very last time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, you must despise me!\xe2\x80\x9d he would say. \xe2\x80\x9cI deserve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should go, go away at once, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel strong enough to\ncontrol yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her husband.\n\nAmong the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked.\nHe did not concern himself with the interests of his own class, and\nconsequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid. The\nwhole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with the work\non his farm. In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same\nbusiness-like seriousness\xe2\x80\x94leaving home for a month, or even two, with\nhis hunt. In winter he visited his other villages or spent his time\nreading. The books he read were chiefly historical, and on these he\nspent a certain sum every year. He was collecting, as he said, a serious\nlibrary, and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought.\nHe would sit in his study with a grave air, reading\xe2\x80\x94a task he first\nimposed upon himself as a duty, but which afterwards became a habit\naffording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of\nbeing occupied with serious matters. In winter, except for business\nexcursions, he spent most of his time at home making himself one with\nhis family and entering into all the details of his children\xe2\x80\x99s relations\nwith their mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew closer and\ncloser and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her.\n\nFrom the time of his marriage S\xc3\xb3nya had lived in his house. Before\nthat, Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and\nS\xc3\xb3nya, blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess Mary to\nbe gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized the wrong he\nhad done S\xc3\xb3nya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined that her\nwealth had influenced Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 choice. She could not find fault with\nS\xc3\xb3nya in any way and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-will\ntoward her which she could not overcome.\n\nOnce she had a talk with her friend Nat\xc3\xa1sha about S\xc3\xb3nya and about her\nown injustice toward her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have read the Gospels a great deal\xe2\x80\x94there\nis a passage in them that just fits S\xc3\xb3nya.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Countess Mary, surprised.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be\ntaken away.\xe2\x80\x99 You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\nPerhaps she lacks egotism, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but from her is taken away, and\neverything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dreadfully sorry for her.\nFormerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always had\na sort of presentiment that it would not come off. She is a sterile\nflower, you know\xe2\x80\x94like some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I am sorry for\nher, and sometimes I think she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel it as you or I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough Countess Mary told Nat\xc3\xa1sha that those words in the Gospel must be\nunderstood differently, yet looking at S\xc3\xb3nya she agreed with Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\nexplanation. It really seemed that S\xc3\xb3nya did not feel her position\ntrying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower.\nShe seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a\nwhole. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the people but to the\nhome. She waited on the old countess, petted and spoiled the children,\nwas always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift,\nand all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient\ngratitude.\n\nThe country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not on the same\nscale as under the old prince.\n\nThe buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than\nsimple. The immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood,\nplastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and was furnished with\nvery simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own\nserf carpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was spacious\nand had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole\nfamilies of the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\xe2\x80\x99 and Bolk\xc3\xb3nskis\xe2\x80\x99 relations sometimes came to\nBald Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for\nmonths. Besides that, four times a year, on the name days and birthdays\nof the hosts, as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day\nor two. The rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its\nordinary occupations, and its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers,\nprovided out of the produce of the estate.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nIt was the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820. Nat\xc3\xa1sha had\nbeen staying at her brother\xe2\x80\x99s with her husband and children since early\nautumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three\nweeks as he said, but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was\nexpected back every minute.\n\nBesides the Bez\xc3\xbakhov family, Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 old friend the retired General\nVas\xc3\xadli Dm\xc3\xadtrich Den\xc3\xadsov was staying with the Rost\xc3\xb3vs this fifth of\nDecember.\n\nOn the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of\nvisitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for\na tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to\nthe new church he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to\ncongratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the elections\nof the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve\nof that day in his usual way. He examined the bailiff\xe2\x80\x99s accounts of\nthe village in Ryaz\xc3\xa1n which belonged to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s nephew, wrote two\nbusiness letters, and walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and\nstables before dinner. Having taken precautions against the general\ndrunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saint\xe2\x80\x99s\nday, he returned to dinner, and without having time for a private talk\nwith his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons, at\nwhich the whole household had assembled. At that table were his mother,\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x99s old lady companion Bel\xc3\xb3va, his wife, their three children\nwith their governess and tutor, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s nephew with his tutor, S\xc3\xb3nya,\nDen\xc3\xadsov, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, her three children, their governess, and old Michael\nIv\xc3\xa1novich, the late prince\xe2\x80\x99s architect, who was living on in retirement\nat Bald Hills.\n\nCountess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husband took\nhis place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after taking\nup his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing\nbefore him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case when\nhe came in to dinner straight from the farm\xe2\x80\x94especially before the soup.\nCountess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself was in\na good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then\nbegan to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his\nill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should\nbe angry with her without any reason, and she felt unhappy. She asked\nhim where he had been. He replied. She again inquired whether\neverything was going well on the farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince\nunpleasantly and he replied hastily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Countess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is he cross with\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d She concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished\nto end the conversation. She knew her remarks sounded unnatural, but\ncould not refrain from asking some more questions.\n\nThanks to Den\xc3\xadsov the conversation at table soon became general and\nlively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the table\nand went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary held out her\nhand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry with her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always have such strange fancies! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even think of being\nangry,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\n\nBut the word always seemed to her to imply: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am angry but I won\xe2\x80\x99t\ntell you why.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even S\xc3\xb3nya and the\nold countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree,\ncould find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their\nmoments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they\nhad been happiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement\nand hostility, which occurred most frequently during Countess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\npregnancies, and this was such a time.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, messieurs et mesdames,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas loudly and with apparent\ncheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to\nvex her), \xe2\x80\x9cI have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I\nshall have to suffer, so today I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and\nlay down on the sofa.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s always the way,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Countess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe talks to everyone\nexcept me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially when I\nam in this condition.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked down at her expanded figure and in the\nglass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked\nlarger than ever.\n\nAnd everything annoyed her\xe2\x80\x94Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s shouting and laughter, Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\ntalk, and especially a quick glance S\xc3\xb3nya gave her.\n\nS\xc3\xb3nya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling\nirritated.\n\nHaving sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of\nwhat they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the nursery.\n\nThe children were playing at \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to Moscow\xe2\x80\x9d in a carriage made of\nchairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with\nthem a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable\ncrossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with\ndifficulty, went to the small sitting room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he is not asleep; I\xe2\x80\x99ll have an explanation with him,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nsaid to herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother,\nfollowed her on tiptoe. She did not notice him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, dear, I think he is asleep\xe2\x80\x94he was so tired,\xe2\x80\x9d said S\xc3\xb3nya, meeting\nher in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that she\ncrossed her path everywhere). \xe2\x80\x9cAndrew may wake him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCountess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that\nS\xc3\xb3nya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident\ndifficulty refrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but\nto avoid obeying S\xc3\xb3nya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went\nto the door. S\xc3\xb3nya went away by another door. From the room in which\nNicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every\nslightest tone of which was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it\nshe saw before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his\nwhole face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night\nwhen he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at\nthat moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: \xe2\x80\x9cPapa! Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s\nstanding here!\xe2\x80\x9d Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs\nto the boy. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to\nCountess Mary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through\nthe door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and\nhis voice said crossly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t get a moment\xe2\x80\x99s peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring\nhim here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the\ndoor and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little\nblack-eyed three-year-old Nat\xc3\xa1sha, her father\xe2\x80\x99s pet, having learned from\nher brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran\nto her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly\nopened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic steps of\nher sturdy little legs, and having examined the position of her father,\nwho was asleep with his back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand\nwhich lay under his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his\nface.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha, Nat\xc3\xa1sha!\xe2\x80\x9d came Countess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s frightened whisper from the\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cPapa wants to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mamma, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said little Nat\xc3\xa1sha with\nconviction. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s laughing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his arms.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his wife.\n\nShe went in and sat down by her husband.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not notice him following me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said timidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI just looked\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHolding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at his wife and,\nseeing her guilty expression, put his other arm around her and kissed\nher hair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I kiss Mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha smiled bashfully.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain!\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot\nwhere Nicholas had placed the kiss.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you think I am cross,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas, replying to the\nquestion he knew was in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when you are like\nthat. It always seems to me...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d he\nsaid gaily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to be that you can\xe2\x80\x99t love me, that I am so plain... always...\nand now... in this cond...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, it\xe2\x80\x99s love that\nmakes us see beauty. It is only Malv\xc3\xadnas and women of that kind who are\nloved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I don\xe2\x80\x99t love her, but...\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to put it. Without you, or when something comes between\nus like this, I seem lost and can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything. Now do I love my\nfinger? I don\xe2\x80\x99t love it, but just try to cut it off!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not like that myself, but I understand. So you\xe2\x80\x99re not angry with\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully angry!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling and getting up. And smoothing his hair\nhe began to pace the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Mary, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d he began, immediately\nthinking aloud in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s presence now that they had made it up.\n\nHe did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not care. A\nthought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also. And he told\nher of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till spring.\n\nCountess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and in\nher turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the children.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can see the woman in her already,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in French, pointing to\nlittle Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cYou reproach us women with being illogical. Here is our\nlogic. I say: \xe2\x80\x98Papa wants to sleep!\xe2\x80\x99 but she says, \xe2\x80\x98No, he\xe2\x80\x99s laughing.\xe2\x80\x99\nAnd she was right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Countess Mary with a happy smile.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d And Nicholas, taking his little daughter in his strong hand,\nlifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, held her by the legs, and\npaced the room with her. There was an expression of carefree happiness\non the faces of both father and daughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of this one,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife\nwhispered in French.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in\nthe hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody has come.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Countess Mary and left\nthe room.\n\nIn her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a\ngallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the laughing child quickly\nfrom his shoulder and pressed her to his heart. His capers reminded\nhim of dancing, and looking at the child\xe2\x80\x99s round happy little face he\nthought of what she would be like when he was an old man, taking her\ninto society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had\ndanced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is he, it is he, Nicholas!\xe2\x80\x9d said Countess Mary, re-entering the room\na few minutes later. \xe2\x80\x9cNow our Nat\xc3\xa1sha has come to life. You should have\nseen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed away so long.\nWell, come along now, quick, quick! It\xe2\x80\x99s time you two were parted,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nadded, looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.\n\nNicholas went out holding the child by the hand.\n\nCountess Mary remained in the sitting room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should never, never have believed that one could be so happy,\xe2\x80\x9d she\nwhispered to herself. A smile lit up her face but at the same time she\nsighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she\nfelt, through her happiness, that there is another sort of happiness\nunattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that\ninstant.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha had married in the early spring of 1813, and in 1820 already had\nthree daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was\nnow nursing. She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was difficult\nto recognize in this robust, motherly woman the slim, lively Nat\xc3\xa1sha of\nformer days. Her features were more defined and had a calm, soft,\nand serene expression. In her face there was none of the ever-glowing\nanimation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm.\nNow her face and body were often all that one saw, and her soul was\nnot visible at all. All that struck the eye was a strong, handsome, and\nfertile woman. The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now. That\nhappened only when, as was the case that day, her husband returned home,\nor a sick child was convalescent, or when she and Countess Mary spoke of\nPrince Andrew (she never mentioned him to her husband, who she imagined\nwas jealous of Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s memory), or on the rare occasions when\nsomething happened to induce her to sing, a practice she had quite\nabandoned since her marriage. At the rare moments when the old fire\ndid kindle in her handsome, fully developed body she was even more\nattractive than in former days.\n\nSince their marriage Nat\xc3\xa1sha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in\nPetersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is to\nsay, in Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 house. The young Countess Bez\xc3\xbakhova was not often seen\nin society, and those who met her there were not pleased with her\nand found her neither attractive nor amiable. Not that Nat\xc3\xa1sha liked\nsolitude\xe2\x80\x94she did not know whether she liked it or not, she even thought\nthat she did not\xe2\x80\x94but with her pregnancies, her confinements, the nursing\nof her children, and sharing every moment of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s life, she had\ndemands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society.\nAll who had known Nat\xc3\xa1sha before her marriage wondered at the change\nin her as at something extraordinary. Only the old countess with her\nmaternal instinct had realized that all Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s outbursts had been due\nto her need of children and a husband\xe2\x80\x94as she herself had once exclaimed\nat Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe not so much in fun as in earnest\xe2\x80\x94and her mother was now\nsurprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, and she kept saying that she had always known that Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nwould make an exemplary wife and mother.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all\nbounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess, \xe2\x80\x9cso that it even becomes absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk,\nespecially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself\ngo when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, should be\neven more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried, and\nshould fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her\nhusband. Nat\xc3\xa1sha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery,\nof which her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She gave it up\njust because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pains with\nher manners or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show\nherself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avoid\ninconveniencing him by being too exacting. She acted in contradiction\nto all those rules. She felt that the allurements instinct had formerly\ntaught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of\nher husband, to whom she had from the first moment given herself up\nentirely\xe2\x80\x94that is, with her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden\nfrom him. She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained\nby the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her, but by something\nelse\xe2\x80\x94indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul.\n\nTo fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing romantic\nsongs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn\nherself to attract herself. To adorn herself for others might perhaps\nhave been agreeable\xe2\x80\x94she did not know\xe2\x80\x94but she had no time at all for it.\nThe chief reason for devoting no time either to singing, to dress, or\nto choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these\nthings.\n\nWe know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in\na subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so\ntrivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one\xe2\x80\x99s entire\nattention is devoted to it.\n\nThe subject which wholly engrossed Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s attention was her family:\nthat is, her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong\nentirely to her and to the home, and the children whom she had to bear,\nbring into the world, nurse, and bring up.\n\nAnd the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her whole\nsoul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger\ndid that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers\nappear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet\nwas unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.\n\nThere were then as now conversations and discussions about women\xe2\x80\x99s\nrights, the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights,\nthough these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now; but\nthese topics were not merely uninteresting to Nat\xc3\xa1sha, she positively\ndid not understand them.\n\nThese questions, then as now, existed only for those who see nothing in\nmarriage but the pleasure married people get from one another, that is,\nonly the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance, which\nlies in the family.\n\nDiscussions and questions of that kind, which are like the question of\nhow to get the greatest gratification from one\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, did not then\nand do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the\nnourishment it affords; and the purpose of marriage is the family.\n\nIf the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats two\ndinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his\npurpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.\n\nIf the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to have\nmany wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in that\ncase will not have a family.\n\nIf the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the\nfamily, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one\ncan digest, and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for\nthe family\xe2\x80\x94that is, one wife or one husband. Nat\xc3\xa1sha needed a husband. A\nhusband was given her and he gave her a family. And she not only saw no\nneed of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her soul\nwere intent on serving that husband and family, she could not imagine\nand saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were\ndifferent.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the\nsociety of her relatives\xe2\x80\x94Countess Mary, and her brother, her mother, and\nS\xc3\xb3nya. She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding\ndisheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and with joyful face\nshow a yellow instead of a green stain on baby\xe2\x80\x99s napkin, and from whom\nshe could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better.\n\nTo such an extent had Nat\xc3\xa1sha let herself go that the way she dressed\nand did her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy\xe2\x80\x94she was jealous\nof S\xc3\xb3nya, of the governess, and of every woman, pretty or plain\xe2\x80\x94were\nhabitual subjects of jest to those about her. The general opinion was\nthat Pierre was under his wife\xe2\x80\x99s thumb, which was really true. From the\nvery first days of their married life Nat\xc3\xa1sha had announced her demands.\nPierre was greatly surprised by his wife\xe2\x80\x99s view, to him a perfectly\nnovel one, that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the\nfamily. His wife\xe2\x80\x99s demands astonished him, but they also flattered him,\nand he submitted to them.\n\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not\nflirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did\nnot dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a\nwhim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time, except on\nbusiness\xe2\x80\x94in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which\nshe did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great\nimportance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had the right to\nregulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose. At\nhome Nat\xc3\xa1sha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband,\nand the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied\xe2\x80\x94that is, was\nreading or writing in his study. Pierre had but to show a partiality for\nanything to get just what he liked done always. He had only to express a\nwish and Nat\xc3\xa1sha would jump up and run to fulfill it.\n\nThe entire household was governed according to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s supposed orders,\nthat is, by his wishes which Nat\xc3\xa1sha tried to guess. Their way of\nlife and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s\noccupations, the children\xe2\x80\x99s upbringing, were all selected not merely\nwith regard to Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s expressed wishes, but to what Nat\xc3\xa1sha from the\nthoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be. And she\ndeduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly, and having once\narrived at them clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to\nchange his mind she would fight him with his own weapons.\n\nThus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their\nfirst child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet nurse\nthree times and Nat\xc3\xa1sha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her\nof Rousseau\xe2\x80\x99s view, with which he quite agreed, that to have a wet\nnurse is unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born, despite\nthe opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband\nhimself\xe2\x80\x94who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself,\na thing then unheard of and considered injurious\xe2\x80\x94she insisted on having\nher own way, and after that nursed all her babies herself.\n\nIt very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife\nwould have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and\ndelight would find in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s ideas and actions the very thought\nagainst which she had argued, but divested of everything superfluous\nthat in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his\nopinion.\n\nAfter seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm\nconsciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he saw\nhimself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within himself\ninextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really good in\nhim was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was rejected.\nAnd this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and\nmysterious reflection.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTwo months previously when Pierre was already staying with the Rost\xc3\xb3vs\nhe had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to come\nto Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being\ndiscussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal\nfounders.\n\nOn reading that letter (she always read her husband\xe2\x80\x99s letters) Nat\xc3\xa1sha\nherself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though she would feel\nhis absence very acutely. She attributed immense importance to all\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual and abstract interests though she did not\nunderstand them, and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such\nmatters. To Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she\nreplied by asking him to go, but to fix a definite date for his return.\nHe was given four weeks\xe2\x80\x99 leave of absence.\n\nEver since that leave of absence had expired, more than a fortnight\nbefore, Nat\xc3\xa1sha had been in a constant state of alarm, depression, and\nirritability.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with\nthe present state of affairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He\nlooked at Nat\xc3\xa1sha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a\nperson once dear. A dull, dejected look, random replies, and talk about\nthe nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha was sad and irritable all that time, especially when her mother,\nher brother, S\xc3\xb3nya, or Countess Mary in their efforts to console her\ntried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense, all rubbish\xe2\x80\x94those discussions which lead to nothing\nand all those idiotic societies!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha declared of the very affairs\nin the immense importance of which she firmly believed.\n\nAnd she would go to the nursery to nurse P\xc3\xa9tya, her only boy. No one\nelse could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this\nlittle three-month-old creature when he lay at her breast and she was\nconscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little\nnose. That creature said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are angry, you are jealous, you would\nlike to pay him out, you are afraid\xe2\x80\x94but here am I! And I am he...\xe2\x80\x9d and\nthat was unanswerable. It was more than true.\n\nDuring that fortnight of anxiety Nat\xc3\xa1sha resorted to the baby for\ncomfort so often, and fussed over him so much, that she overfed him and\nhe fell ill. She was terrified by his illness, and yet that was just\nwhat she needed. While attending to him she bore the anxiety about her\nhusband more easily.\n\nShe was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s sleigh was heard\nat the front door, and the old nurse\xe2\x80\x94knowing how to please her\nmistress\xe2\x80\x94entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming\nface.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he come?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move lest\nshe should rouse the dozing baby.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s come, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the nurse.\n\nThe blood rushed to Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face and her feet involuntarily moved, but\nshe could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened his eyes and\nlooked at her. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re here?\xe2\x80\x9d he seemed to be saying, and again lazily\nsmacked his lips.\n\nCautiously withdrawing her breast, Nat\xc3\xa1sha rocked him a little, handed\nhim to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door. But at the\ndoor she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in\nher joy left the child too soon, and she glanced round. The nurse with\nraised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, go!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, smiling, with the kind of\nfamiliarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.\n\nDen\xc3\xadsov, who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his\npipe, now for the first time recognized the old Nat\xc3\xa1sha. A flood of\nbrilliant, joyful light poured from her transfigured face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s come!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed as she ran past, and Den\xc3\xadsov felt that he too\nwas delighted that Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had returned.\n\nOn reaching the vestibule Nat\xc3\xa1sha saw a tall figure in a fur coat\nunwinding his scarf. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s he! It\xe2\x80\x99s really he! He has come!\xe2\x80\x9d she said\nto herself, and rushing at him embraced him, pressed his head to her\nbreast, and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy, happy face,\ncovered with hoarfrost. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is he, happy and contented....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had\nexperienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her\nface vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of\nreproaches and angry words.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for you. You are pleased, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a good\ntime.... But what about me? You might at least have shown consideration\nfor the children. I am nursing and my milk was spoiled.... P\xc3\xa9tya was at\ndeath\xe2\x80\x99s door. But you were enjoying yourself. Yes, enjoying...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre knew he was not to blame, for he could not have come sooner; he\nknew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two;\nabove all he knew that he himself was bright and happy. He wanted\nto smile but dared not even think of doing so. He made a piteous,\nfrightened face and bent down.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could not, on my honor. But how is P\xc3\xa9tya?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right now. Come along! I wonder you\xe2\x80\x99re not ashamed! If only you\ncould see what I was like without you, how I suffered!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are well?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, not letting go of his arm. And they went to\ntheir rooms.\n\nWhen Nicholas and his wife came to look for Pierre he was in the nursery\nholding his baby son, who was again awake, on his huge right palm and\ndandling him. A blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby\xe2\x80\x99s broad face\nwith its toothless open mouth. The storm was long since over and there\nwas bright, joyous sunshine on Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s face as she gazed tenderly at\nher husband and child.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you talked everything well over with Prince Theodore?\xe2\x80\x9d she\nasked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, capitally.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, he holds it up.\xe2\x80\x9d (She meant the baby\xe2\x80\x99s head.) \xe2\x80\x9cBut how he did\nfrighten me... You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the princess? Is it true she\xe2\x80\x99s in love with\nthat...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, just fancy...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in. Pierre with the baby\non his hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to their inquiries. But\nin spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the baby\nwith the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his\nattention.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow sweet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Countess Mary, looking at and playing with the baby.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Nicholas,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, turning to her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand\nhow it is you don\xe2\x80\x99t see the charm of these delicious marvels.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t and can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nicholas, looking coldly at the baby. \xe2\x80\x9cA\nlump of flesh. Come along, Pierre!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet he\xe2\x80\x99s such an affectionate father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Countess Mary,\nvindicating her husband, \xe2\x80\x9cbut only after they are a year old or so...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Pierre nurses them splendidly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says his hand is\njust made for a baby\xe2\x80\x99s seat. Just look!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly not for this...\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh, and\nshifting the baby he gave him to the nurse.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAs in every large household, there were at Bald Hills several perfectly\ndistinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole, though each\nretained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others. Every\nevent, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all\nthese worlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve\nover that occurrence independently of the others.\n\nFor instance, Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s return was a joyful and important event and they\nall felt it to be so.\n\nThe servants\xe2\x80\x94the most reliable judges of their masters because they\njudge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their\nacts and way of life\xe2\x80\x94were glad of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s return because they knew that\nwhen he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to attend\nto the estate, and would be in better spirits and temper, and also\nbecause they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays.\n\nThe children and their governesses were glad of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s return because\nno one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did.\nHe alone could play on the clavichord that \xc3\xa9cossaise (his only piece)\nto which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced, and they felt\nsure he had brought presents for them all.\n\nYoung Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent,\nwith curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because\nUncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and\npassionate affection. No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre\nwhom he saw only occasionally. Countess Mary who had brought him up\nhad done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him, and\nlittle Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him with just a shade of\ncontempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or\na Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned,\nwise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s presence his face always shone\nwith pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to\nhim. He did not miss a single word he uttered, and would afterwards,\nwith Dessalles or by himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of\neverything Pierre had said. Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s past life and his unhappiness prior\nto 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from\nsome words he had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity,\nPlat\xc3\xb3n Karat\xc3\xa1ev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Nat\xc3\xa1sha\n(of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s\nfriendship with the father whom Nicholas could not remember\xe2\x80\x94all this\nmade Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint.\n\nFrom broken remarks about Nat\xc3\xa1sha and his father, from the emotion with\nwhich Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent\ntenderness with which Nat\xc3\xa1sha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just\nbeginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had\nloved Nat\xc3\xa1sha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father\nwhom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not\nbe pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and\ntears of sadness and rapture. So the boy also was happy that Pierre had\narrived.\n\nThe guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite\nany company he was in.\n\nThe grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were\npleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly\nand peacefully.\n\nThe old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and\nespecially that Nat\xc3\xa1sha would now be herself again.\n\nPierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made\nhaste to satisfy all their expectations.\n\nThough the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the aid\nof a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not forgetting\nhis mother\xe2\x80\x94and brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s commissions, nor the dress material for\na present to Bel\xc3\xb3va, nor toys for his wife\xe2\x80\x99s nephews. In the early days\nof his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect\nhim not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy, and he\nhad been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he\nforgot everything. But in time he grew used to this demand. Knowing that\nNat\xc3\xa1sha asked nothing for herself, and gave him commissions for others\nonly when he himself had offered to undertake them, he now found an\nunexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for\neveryone in the house, and never forgot anything. If he now incurred\nNat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive\nthings. To her other defects (as most people thought them, but which\nto Pierre were qualities) of untidiness and neglect of herself, she now\nadded stinginess.\n\nFrom the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing\nentailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he\nspent only half as much as before, and that his affairs\xe2\x80\x94which had been\nin disorder of late, chiefly because of his first wife\xe2\x80\x99s debts\xe2\x80\x94had begun\nto improve.\n\nLife was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive\nluxury, the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no\nlonger his nor did he wish for it. He felt that his way of life had now\nbeen settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in\nhis power, and so that way of life proved economical.\n\nWith a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of this?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, unrolling a piece of stuff like a\nshopman.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her\nlap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he\nshowed her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s for Bel\xc3\xb3va? Excellent!\xe2\x80\x9d She felt the quality of the material.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre told her the price.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo dear!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow pleased the children will be and\nMamma too! Only you need not have bought me this,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, unable to\nsuppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls,\nof a kind then just coming into fashion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAd\xc3\xa8le tempted me: she kept on telling me to buy it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen am I to wear it?\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat\xc3\xa1sha stuck it in her coil of hair. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\nI take little M\xc3\xa1sha into society? Perhaps they will be fashionable again\nby then. Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s go now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to\nthe old countess\xe2\x80\x99 rooms.\n\nThe countess was sitting with her companion Bel\xc3\xb3va, playing\ngrand-patience as usual, when Pierre and Nat\xc3\xa1sha came into the drawing\nroom with parcels under their arms.\n\nThe countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with a\nfrill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper lip\nhad sunk in, and her eyes were dim.\n\nAfter the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession, she\nfelt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left\nwithout aim or object for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or kept\nawake, but did not live. Life gave her no new impressions. She wanted\nnothing from life but tranquillity, and that tranquillity only death\ncould give her. But until death came she had to go on living, that is,\nto use her vital forces. A peculiarity one sees in very young children\nand very old people was particularly evident in her. Her life had\nno external aims\xe2\x80\x94only a need to exercise her various functions and\ninclinations was apparent. She had to eat, sleep, think, speak, weep,\nwork, give vent to her anger, and so on, merely because she had a\nstomach, a brain, muscles, nerves, and a liver. She did these things not\nunder any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do,\nwhen behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their\nfunctions remains unnoticed. She talked only because she physically\nneeded to exercise her tongue and lungs. She cried as a child does,\nbecause her nose had to be cleared, and so on. What for people in their\nfull vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext.\n\nThus in the morning\xe2\x80\x94especially if she had eaten anything rich the day\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest\npretext Bel\xc3\xb3va\xe2\x80\x99s deafness.\n\nShe would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end\nof the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a little warmer today, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she would murmur.\n\nAnd when Bel\xc3\xb3va replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, they\xe2\x80\x99ve come,\xe2\x80\x9d she would mutter\nangrily: \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnother pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or too damp\nor not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability her face\nwould grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when Bel\xc3\xb3va\nwould again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the countess\xe2\x80\x99 face yellow. Just\nas she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise\nher still-existing faculty of thinking\xe2\x80\x94and the pretext for that was a\ngame of patience. When she needed to cry, the deceased count would be\nthe pretext. When she wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health\nwould be the pretext, and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the\npretext would be Countess Mary. When her vocal organs needed exercise,\nwhich was usually toward seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock when she had had an after-dinner\nrest in a darkened room, the pretext would be the retelling of the same\nstories over and over again to the same audience.\n\nThe old lady\xe2\x80\x99s condition was understood by the whole household though no\none ever spoke of it, and they all made every possible effort to satisfy\nher needs. Only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile\nbetween Nicholas, Pierre, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, and Countess Mary was the common\nunderstanding of her condition expressed.\n\nBut those glances expressed something more: they said that she had\nplayed her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole self,\nthat we must all become like her, and that they were glad to yield to\nher, to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as\nfull of life as themselves, but now so much to be pitied. \xe2\x80\x9cMemento\nmori,\xe2\x80\x9d said these glances.\n\nOnly the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and the\nlittle children failed to understand this and avoided her.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nWhen Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in\none of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of\nplaying patience, and so\xe2\x80\x94though by force of habit she greeted him with\nthe words she always used when Pierre or her son returned after an\nabsence: \xe2\x80\x9cHigh time, my dear, high time! We were all weary of waiting\nfor you. Well, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d and received her presents with another\ncustomary remark: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the gift that\xe2\x80\x99s precious, my dear, but that\nyou give it to me, an old woman...\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94yet it was evident that she was\nnot pleased by Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s arrival at that moment when it diverted her\nattention from the unfinished game.\n\nShe finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents.\nThey consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a\nbright-blue S\xc3\xa8vres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with\na lid, and a gold snuffbox with the count\xe2\x80\x99s portrait on the lid which\nPierre had had done by a miniaturist in Petersburg. The countess had\nlong wished for such a box, but as she did not want to cry just then she\nglanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to\nthe box for cards.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,\xe2\x80\x9d said she as she always\ndid. \xe2\x80\x9cBut best of all you have brought yourself back\xe2\x80\x94for I never saw\nanything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are we\nto do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see\nanything, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remember anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, repeating her usual\nphrases. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, Anna Timof\xc3\xa9evna,\xe2\x80\x9d she added to her companion, \xe2\x80\x9csee what\na box for cards my son has brought us!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBel\xc3\xb3va admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material.\n\nThough Pierre, Nat\xc3\xa1sha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and Den\xc3\xadsov had much to\ntalk about that they could not discuss before the old countess\xe2\x80\x94not\nthat anything was hidden from her, but because she had dropped so\nfar behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her\npresence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to\nrepeat what they had already told her many times: that so-and-so was\ndead and so-and-so was married, which she would again be unable to\nremember\xe2\x80\x94yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from\nhabit, and Pierre answered the countess\xe2\x80\x99 questions as to whether Prince\nVas\xc3\xadli had aged and whether Countess Mary Alex\xc3\xa9evna had sent greetings\nand still thought of them, and other matters that interested no one and\nto which she herself was indifferent.\n\nConversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable,\ncontinued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the family\nwere assembled near the round tea table at which S\xc3\xb3nya presided beside\nthe samovar. The children with their tutors and governesses had had\ntea and their voices were audible from the next room. At tea all sat\nin their accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small table\nwhere his tea was handed to him; M\xc3\xadlka, the old gray borzoi bitch\n(daughter of the first M\xc3\xadlka), with a quite gray face and large black\neyes that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on the armchair beside\nhim; Den\xc3\xadsov, whose curly hair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half\ngray, sat beside countess Mary with his general\xe2\x80\x99s tunic unbuttoned;\nPierre sat between his wife and the old countess. He spoke of what he\nknew might interest the old lady and that she could understand. He\ntold her of external social events and of the people who had formed\nthe circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real, living, and\ndistinct group, but who were now for the most part scattered about the\nworld and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they\nhad sown in earlier years. But to the old countess those contemporaries\nof hers seemed to be the only serious and real society. Nat\xc3\xa1sha saw by\nPierre\xe2\x80\x99s animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had\nmuch to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess. Den\xc3\xadsov,\nnot being a member of the family, did not understand Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s caution\nand being, as a malcontent, much interested in what was occurring in\nPetersburg, kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in\nthe Sem\xc3\xabnovsk regiment, then about Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, and then about the Bible\nSociety. Once or twice Pierre was carried away and began to speak of\nthese things, but Nicholas and Nat\xc3\xa1sha always brought him back to the\nhealth of Prince Iv\xc3\xa1n and Countess Mary Alex\xc3\xa9evna.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and all this idiocy\xe2\x80\x94Gossner and Tat\xc3\xa1winova?\xe2\x80\x9d Den\xc3\xadsov asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\nthat weally still going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing on?\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy more than ever! The Bible Society is\nthe whole government now!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that, mon cher ami?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the countess, who had finished her\ntea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nare you saying about the government? I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, Maman,\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholas interposed, knowing how to translate\nthings into his mother\xe2\x80\x99s language, \xe2\x80\x9cPrince Alexander Gol\xc3\xadtsyn has\nfounded a society and in consequence has great influence, they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cArakch\xc3\xa9ev and Gol\xc3\xadtsyn,\xe2\x80\x9d incautiously remarked Pierre, \xe2\x80\x9care now the\nwhole government! And what a government! They see treason everywhere and\nare afraid of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a most estimable\nman. I used to meet him at Mary Ant\xc3\xb3novna\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said the countess in an\noffended tone; and still more offended that they all remained silent,\nshe went on: \xe2\x80\x9cNowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel Society! Well, and\nwhat harm is there in that?\xe2\x80\x9d and she rose (everybody else got up too)\nand with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting\nroom.\n\nThe melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some jolly\nexcitement was going on there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinished, finished!\xe2\x80\x9d little Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s gleeful yell rose above them all.\n\nPierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (Nat\xc3\xa1sha he\nnever lost sight of) and smiled happily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s delightful music!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means that Anna Mak\xc3\xa1rovna has finished her stocking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Countess\nMary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, jumping up. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\nstopping at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy I\xe2\x80\x99m especially fond of that music? It is\nalways the first thing that tells me all is well. When I was driving\nhere today, the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As I\nentered the anteroom I heard Andr\xc3\xbasha\xe2\x80\x99s peals of laughter and that meant\nthat all was well.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know! I know that feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go\nthere\xe2\x80\x94those stockings are to be a surprise for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew still\nlouder.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Anna Mak\xc3\xa1rovna,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard saying, \xe2\x80\x9ccome here into\nthe middle of the room and at the word of command, \xe2\x80\x98One, two,\xe2\x80\x99 and\nwhen I say \xe2\x80\x98three\xe2\x80\x99... You stand here, and you in my arms\xe2\x80\x94well now! One,\ntwo!...\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, and a silence followed: \xe2\x80\x9cthree!\xe2\x80\x9d and a rapturously\nbreathless cry of children\xe2\x80\x99s voices filled the room. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo, two!\xe2\x80\x9d they\nshouted.\n\nThis meant two stockings, which by a secret process known only to\nherself Anna Mak\xc3\xa1rovna used to knit at the same time on the same\nneedles, and which, when they were ready, she always triumphantly drew,\none out of the other, in the children\xe2\x80\x99s presence.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nSoon after this the children came in to say good night. They kissed\neveryone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and they went out.\nOnly young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles whispered to the\nboy to come downstairs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\nNicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski also in a whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa tante, please let me stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, going up to his aunt.\n\nHis face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary\nglanced at him and turned to Pierre.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are here he can\xe2\x80\x99t tear himself away,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. Good night!\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to young\nNicholas with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything of one another\nyet.... How like he is growing, Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing Countess\nMary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike my father?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the boy, flushing crimson and looking up at\nPierre with bright, ecstatic eyes.\n\nPierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the\nchildren had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork; Nat\xc3\xa1sha\ndid not take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and Den\xc3\xadsov rose, asked\nfor their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from S\xc3\xb3nya\xe2\x80\x94who sat weary\nbut resolute at the samovar\xe2\x80\x94and questioned Pierre. The curly-headed,\ndelicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner, starting\nevery now and then and muttering something to himself, and evidently\nexperiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head,\nwith his thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar, toward the place\nwhere Pierre sat.\n\nThe conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power,\nin which most people see the chief interest of home politics. Den\xc3\xadsov,\ndissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments\nin the service, heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg\nwhich seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and sharp comments on what\nPierre told them.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne used to have to be a German\xe2\x80\x94now one must dance with Tat\xc3\xa1winova\nand Madame Kw\xc3\xbcdener, and wead Ecka\xe2\x80\x99tshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they\nshould let that fine fellow Bonaparte loose\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99d knock all this nonsense\nout of them! Fancy giving the command of the Sem\xc3\xabnov wegiment to a\nfellow like that Schwa\xe2\x80\x99tz!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\n\nNicholas, though free from Den\xc3\xadsov\xe2\x80\x99s readiness to find fault with\neverything, also thought that discussion of the government was a very\nserious and weighty matter, and the fact that A had been appointed\nMinister of This and B Governor General of That, and that the Emperor\nhad said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed to him very\nimportant. And so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these\nthings and to question Pierre. The questions put by these two kept the\nconversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the\nhigher government circles.\n\nBut Nat\xc3\xa1sha, knowing all her husband\xe2\x80\x99s ways and ideas, saw that he had\nlong been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to\nanother channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of\nwhich he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince\nTheodore, and she helped him by asking how his affairs with Prince\nTheodore had gone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was it about?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, looking round at his listeners.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be\nallowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to\ncounteract it as far as they can.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can decent men do?\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\ncan be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome into my study,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby, now\nheard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary\nfollowed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\nfollowed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table\nin a shady corner by the window.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what would you do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Den\xc3\xadsov.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways some fantastic schemes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy this,\xe2\x80\x9d began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room,\nsometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: \xe2\x80\x9cthe position\nin Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything. He\nhas abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism\xe2\x80\x9d (Pierre could not\ntolerate mysticism in anyone now). \xe2\x80\x9cHe seeks only for peace, and only\nthese people sans foi ni loi * can give it him\xe2\x80\x94people who recklessly\nhack at and strangle everything\xe2\x80\x94Magn\xc3\xadtski, Arakch\xc3\xa9ev, and tutti\nquanti.... You will agree that if you did not look after your estates\nyourself but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher your steward was the\nmore readily your object might be attained,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Nicholas.\n\n    * Without faith or law.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what does that lead up to?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law courts, in the\narmy nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the\npeople are tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young and\nhonest is crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on. Everything is\nstrained to such a degree that it will certainly break,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre (as\nthose who examine the actions of any government have always said since\ngovernments began). \xe2\x80\x9cI told them just one thing in Petersburg.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTold whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know whom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under\nhis brows. \xe2\x80\x9cPrince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and\nphilanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in the\npresent circumstances something else is needed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face\ndarkened and he went up to the boy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Let him be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and\ncontinuing. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not enough, I told them. Something else is needed.\nWhen you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment,\nwhen everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as many as\npossible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general\ncalamity. Everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and\ndepraved. One is lured by women, another by honors, a third by ambition\nor money, and they go over to that camp. No independent men, such as you\nor I, are left. What I say is widen the scope of our society, let the\nmot d\xe2\x80\x99ordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an armchair, sat\ndown in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and frowning\nmore and more.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut action with what aim?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what position will you adopt\ntoward the government?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret if the\ngovernment allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to government, but\nit is a society of true conservatives\xe2\x80\x94a society of gentlemen in the full\nmeaning of that word. It is only to prevent some Pugach\xc3\xabv or other from\nkilling my children and yours, and Arakch\xc3\xa9ev from sending me off to some\nMilitary Settlement. We join hands only for the public welfare and the\ngeneral safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one\nwhich can only cause harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe\xe2\x80\x9d (they did not then venture\nto suggest that Russia had saved Europe) \xe2\x80\x9cdo any harm? The Tugendbund\nis an alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it is what Christ\npreached on the Cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at\nher husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased her\xe2\x80\x94that did not\neven interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple\nand that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she\nknew that it sprang from Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s whole soul), but it was his animated\nand enthusiastic appearance that made her glad.\n\nThe boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down collar\xe2\x80\x94whom\neveryone had forgotten\xe2\x80\x94gazed at Pierre with even greater and more\nrapturous joy. Every word of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s burned into his heart, and with a\nnervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax\nand quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s table.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not at all what you suppose; but that is what the German\nTugendbund was, and what I am proposing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters,\nbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it and can\xe2\x80\x99t even pwonounce it,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed\nDen\xc3\xadsov in a loud and resolute voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI agwee that evewything here is\nwotten and howwible, but the Tugendbund I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. If we\xe2\x80\x99re\nnot satisfied, let us have a bunt of our own. That\xe2\x80\x99s all wight. Je suis\nvot\xe2\x80\x99e homme!\xe2\x80\x9d *\n\n    * \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m your man.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nPierre smiled, Nat\xc3\xa1sha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted his brows\nstill more and began proving to Pierre that there was no prospect of\nany great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his\nimagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, and as his mental faculties\nwere greater and more resourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered. This\nmade him still angrier, for he was fully convinced, not by reasoning\nbut by something within him stronger than reason, of the justice of his\nopinion.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rising and trying with nervously\ntwitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally\nabandoning the attempt. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t prove it to you. You say that\neverything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I don\xe2\x80\x99t\nsee it. But you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional\nmatter, and to that I reply: \xe2\x80\x98You are my best friend, as you know,\nbut if you formed a secret society and began working against the\ngovernment\xe2\x80\x94be it what it may\xe2\x80\x94I know it is my duty to obey the\ngovernment. And if Arakch\xc3\xa9ev ordered me to lead a squadron against you\nand cut you down, I should not hesitate an instant, but should do it.\xe2\x80\x99\nAnd you may argue about that as you like!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAn awkward silence followed these words. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was the first to speak,\ndefending her husband and attacking her brother. Her defense was weak\nand inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was resumed, and\nno longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99 last remark.\n\nWhen they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski went\nup to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Pierre, you... no... If Papa were alive... would he agree with\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\nAnd Pierre suddenly realized what a special, independent, complex, and\npowerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in\nthis boy during that conversation, and remembering all he had said he\nregretted that the lad should have heard him. He had, however, to give\nhim an answer.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said reluctantly, and left the study.\n\nThe lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he\nhad done to the things on the table. He flushed and went up to Nicholas.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to\nthe broken sealing wax and pens.\n\nNicholas started angrily.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, throwing the bits under the table.\n\nAnd evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he turned away\nfrom the boy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought not to have been here at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nThe conversation at supper was not about politics or societies, but\nturned on the subject Nicholas liked best\xe2\x80\x94recollections of 1812. Den\xc3\xadsov\nstarted these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about\nthem. The family separated on the most friendly terms.\n\nAfter supper Nicholas, having undressed in his study and given\ninstructions to the steward who had been waiting for him, went to the\nbedroom in his dressing gown, where he found his wife still at her\ntable, writing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you writing, Mary?\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholas asked.\n\nCountess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she was writing would\nnot be understood or approved by her husband.\n\nShe had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but at the same\ntime was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to\ntell him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA diary, Nicholas,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, handing him a blue exercise book\nfilled with her firm, bold writing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA diary?\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, and he took up the\nbook.\n\nIt was in French.\n\n\nDecember 4. Today when Andr\xc3\xbasha (her eldest boy) woke up he did not\nwish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me. He was naughty and\nobstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew angrier. Then I took the\nmatter in hand: I left him alone and began with nurse\xe2\x80\x99s help to get the\nother children up, telling him that I did not love him. For a long time\nhe was silent, as if astonished, then he jumped out of bed, ran to me in\nhis shirt, and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long time.\nIt was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me.\nAfterwards in the evening when I gave him his ticket, he again began\ncrying piteously and kissing me. One can do anything with him by\ntenderness.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a \xe2\x80\x98ticket\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholas inquired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, showing how\nthey have behaved.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and\ncontinued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary was set down\neverything in the children\xe2\x80\x99s lives that seemed noteworthy to their\nmother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections\non educational methods. They were for the most part quite insignificant\ntrifles, but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either, now\nthat he read this diary about his children for the first time.\n\nUnder the date \xe2\x80\x9c5\xe2\x80\x9d was entered:\n\n\nM\xc3\xadtya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to have no pudding. He had\nnone, but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were\neating! I think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only\ndevelops their greediness. Must tell Nicholas this.\n\nNicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant eyes\ngazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her\ndiary? There could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his\nadmiration for his wife.\n\nPerhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or even\ndone at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of which the\nsole aim was the children\xe2\x80\x99s moral welfare delighted him. Had Nicholas\nbeen able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady,\ntender, and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at\nher spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost beyond his reach,\nin which she had her being.\n\nHe was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own\ninsignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the\nmore that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of\nhimself.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite, quite approve, my dearest!\xe2\x80\x9d said he with a significant look,\nand after a short pause he added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I behaved badly today. You\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t in the study. We began disputing\xe2\x80\x94Pierre and I\xe2\x80\x94and I lost my\ntemper. But he is impossible: such a child! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what would\nbecome of him if Nat\xc3\xa1sha didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep him in hand.... Have you any idea\nwhy he went to Petersburg? They have formed...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Countess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cNat\xc3\xa1sha told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Nicholas went on, growing hot at the mere\nrecollection of their discussion, \xe2\x80\x9che wanted to convince me that it is\nevery honest man\xe2\x80\x99s duty to go against the government, and that the oath\nof allegiance and duty... I am sorry you weren\xe2\x80\x99t there. They all fell on\nme\xe2\x80\x94Den\xc3\xadsov and Nat\xc3\xa1sha... Nat\xc3\xa1sha is absurd. How she rules over him! And\nyet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own\nbut only repeats his sayings...\xe2\x80\x9d added Nicholas, yielding to that\nirresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and\ndearest to us. He forgot that what he was saying about Nat\xc3\xa1sha could\nhave been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have noticed that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Countess Mary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he\nstarted proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not there\xe2\x80\x94what\nwould you have said?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I see it you were quite right, and I told Nat\xc3\xa1sha so. Pierre says\neverybody is suffering, tortured, and being corrupted, and that it\nis our duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is right there,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nCountess Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us,\nduties indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might expose\nourselves to risks we must not risk our children.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it! That\xe2\x80\x99s just what I said to him,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Nicholas, who\nfancied he really had said it. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they insisted on their own view:\nlove of one\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor and Christianity\xe2\x80\x94and all this in the presence of\nyoung Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all my things.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little Nicholas,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Countess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is such an exceptional boy. I am afraid I\nneglect him in favor of my own: we all have children and relations while\nhe has no one. He is constantly alone with his thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you need reproach yourself on his account. All that\nthe fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for\nhim, and of course I am glad of it. He is a fine lad, a fine lad! This\nevening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and fancy\xe2\x80\x94as we were\ngoing in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table to\nbits, and he told me of it himself at once! I never knew him to tell an\nuntruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Nicholas, who at heart was\nnot fond of Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski but was always anxious to recognize that\nhe was a fine lad.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, I am not the same as his own mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Countess Mary. \xe2\x80\x9cI\nfeel I am not the same and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am\ndreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for him to have companions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell it won\xe2\x80\x99t be for long. Next summer I\xe2\x80\x99ll take him to Petersburg,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid Nicholas. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pierre always was a dreamer and always will be,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe continued, returning to the talk in the study which had evidently\ndisturbed him. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what business is it of mine what goes on\nthere\xe2\x80\x94whether Arakch\xc3\xa9ev is bad, and all that? What business was it of\nmine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with\nprison, and had a mother who could not see or understand it? And\nthen there are you and the children and our affairs. Is it for my own\npleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?\nNo, but I know I must work to comfort my mother, to repay you, and not\nto leave the children such beggars as I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCountess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone\nand that he attached too much importance to these matters. But she knew\nshe must not say this and that it would be useless to do so. She only\ntook his hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of approval and\na confirmation of his thoughts, and after a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 reflection\ncontinued to think aloud.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Mary, today Elias Mitrof\xc3\xa1nych\xe2\x80\x9d (this was his overseer) \xe2\x80\x9ccame\nback from the Tamb\xc3\xb3v estate and told me they are already offering eighty\nthousand rubles for the forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAnd with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of\nrepurchasing Otr\xc3\xa1dnoe before long, and added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnother ten years of life\nand I shall leave the children... in an excellent position.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCountess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told\nher. She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes\nask her what he had been saying, and be vexed if he noticed that she\nhad been thinking about something else. But she had to force herself to\nattend, for what he was saying did not interest her at all. She looked\nat him and did not think, but felt, about something different. She felt\na submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all\nthat she understood, and this seemed to make her love for him still\nstronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness. Besides this\nfeeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following\nthe details of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s plans, thoughts that had no connection with\nwhat he was saying flitted through her mind. She thought of her nephew.\nHer husband\xe2\x80\x99s account of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s agitation while Pierre was speaking\nstruck her forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive\ncharacter recurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she\nthought also of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but\ncompared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt\nwith regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young\nNicholas.\n\nSometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the\ndifference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and\npromised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible\xe2\x80\x94in\nthis life to love her husband, her children, little Nicholas, and all\nher neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess Mary\xe2\x80\x99s soul always\nstrove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and could\ntherefore never be at peace. A stern expression of the lofty, secret\nsuffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face. Nicholas\ngazed at her. \xe2\x80\x9cO God! What will become of us if she dies, as I always\nfear when her face is like that?\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, and placing himself before\nthe icon he began to say his evening prayers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only a husband\nand wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity,\nunderstanding and expressing each other\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts in ways contrary to\nall rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or conclusions, and in\na quite peculiar way. Nat\xc3\xa1sha was so used to this kind of talk with her\nhusband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong\nbetween them if Pierre followed a line of logical reasoning. When he\nbegan proving anything, or talking argumentatively and calmly and she,\nled on by his example, began to do the same, she knew that they were on\nthe verge of a quarrel.\n\nFrom the moment they were alone and Nat\xc3\xa1sha came up to him with\nwide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her\nbosom, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cNow you are all mine, mine! You won\xe2\x80\x99t escape!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94from that\nmoment this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic and\ncontrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at\none and the same time. This simultaneous discussion of many topics did\nnot prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest\nsign that they fully understood one another.\n\nJust as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, and\ncontradictory, except the feeling that guides the dream, so in this\nintercourse contrary to all laws of reason, the words themselves were\nnot consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha spoke to Pierre about her brother\xe2\x80\x99s life and doings, of how she\nhad suffered and lacked life during his own absence, and of how she\nwas fonder than ever of Mary, and how Mary was in every way better than\nherself. In saying this Nat\xc3\xa1sha was sincere in acknowledging Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\nsuperiority, but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on\nPierre that he should, all the same, prefer her to Mary and to all\nother women, and that now, especially after having seen many women in\nPetersburg, he should tell her so afresh.\n\nPierre, answering Nat\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s words, told her how intolerable it had been\nfor him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\nsimply dull. Besides, I was very busy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha looked intently at him and went on:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary is so splendid,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow she understands children! It is as\nif she saw straight into their souls. Yesterday, for instance, M\xc3\xadtya was\nnaughty...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow like his father he is,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre interjected.\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha knew why he mentioned M\xc3\xadtya\xe2\x80\x99s likeness to Nicholas: the\nrecollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and\nhe wanted to know what Nat\xc3\xa1sha thought of it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally\naccepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a fresh line,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsaid she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are\nan amusement\xe2\x80\x94almost a pastime,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre. \xe2\x80\x9cFor instance, he is\ncollecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book\ntill he has read what he had already bought\xe2\x80\x94Sismondi and Rousseau and\nMontesquieu,\xe2\x80\x9d he added with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know how much I...\xe2\x80\x9d he began\nto soften down what he had said; but Nat\xc3\xa1sha interrupted him to show\nthat this was unnecessary.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you say ideas are an amusement to him....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in Petersburg I\nsaw everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all else is\nmere amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there when you met the children,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nNat\xc3\xa1sha. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich was most delighted? Lisa, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind. \xe2\x80\x9cNicholas\nsays we ought not to think. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. Besides, when I was in\nPetersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole affair would go\nto pieces without me\xe2\x80\x94everyone was pulling his own way. But I succeeded\nin uniting them all; and then my idea is so clear and simple. You see,\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t say that we ought to oppose this and that. We may be mistaken.\nWhat I say is: \xe2\x80\x98Join hands, you who love the right, and let there be but\none banner\xe2\x80\x94that of active virtue.\xe2\x80\x99 Prince Serg\xc3\xa9y is a fine fellow and\nclever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNat\xc3\xa1sha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierre\xe2\x80\x99s idea,\nbut one thing disconcerted her. \xe2\x80\x9cCan a man so important and necessary to\nsociety be also my husband? How did this happen?\xe2\x80\x9d She wished to express\nthis doubt to him. \xe2\x80\x9cNow who could decide whether he is really cleverer\nthan all the others?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked herself, and passed in review all those\nwhom Pierre most respected. Judging by what he had said there was no one\nhe had respected so highly as Plat\xc3\xb3n Karat\xc3\xa1ev.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I am thinking about?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAbout Plat\xc3\xb3n\nKarat\xc3\xa1ev. Would he have approved of you now, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood his\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s line of thought.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlat\xc3\xb3n Karat\xc3\xa1ev?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely\ntrying to imagine Karat\xc3\xa1ev\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would not have\nunderstood... yet perhaps he would.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you awfully!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha suddenly said. \xe2\x80\x9cAwfully, awfully!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he would not have approved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre, after reflection. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nhe would have approved of is our family life. He was always so anxious\nto find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and I should\nhave been proud to let him see us. There now\xe2\x80\x94you talk of my absence,\nbut you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe what a special feeling I have for you after a\nseparation....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I should think...\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha began.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that. I never leave off loving you. And one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t love\nmore, but this is something special.... Yes, of course\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he did not\nfinish because their eyes meeting said the rest.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha suddenly exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cabout honeymoons,\nand that the greatest happiness is at first! On the contrary, now is\nthe best of all. If only you did not go away! Do you remember how\nwe quarreled? And it was always my fault. Always mine. And what we\nquarreled about\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t even remember!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways about the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pierre with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cJealo...\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say it! I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it!\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha cried, and her eyes glittered\ncoldly and vindictively. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you see her?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after a pause.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, and if I had I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have recognized her.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey were silent for a while.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do you know? While you were talking in the study I was looking at\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat\xc3\xa1sha began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had\ncome over them. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are as like him as two peas\xe2\x80\x94like the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d (She\nmeant her little son.) \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go to him.... The milk\xe2\x80\x99s\ncome.... But I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly turning to one\nanother at the same time they both began to speak. Pierre began with\nself-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Nat\xc3\xa1sha with a quiet, happy smile.\nHaving interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other\ncontinue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. What did you say? Go on, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you go on, I was talking nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha.\n\nPierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his complacent\nreflections on his success in Petersburg. At that moment it seemed to\nhim that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of Russian\nsociety and to the whole world.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always\nsimple ones. My whole idea is that if vicious people are united and\nconstitute a power, then honest folk must do the same. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s simple\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what were you going to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Only nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh nothing, only a trifle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\xc3\xa1sha, smiling still more brightly.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only wanted to tell you about P\xc3\xa9tya: today nurse was coming to take\nhim from me, and he laughed, shut his eyes, and clung to me. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure\nhe thought he was hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now he\xe2\x80\x99s crying. Well,\ngood-by!\xe2\x80\x9d and she left the room.\n\n\nMeanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolk\xc3\xb3nski\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom a little lamp\nwas burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark and they could\nnot cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his\nRoman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring. Little Nicholas, who had\njust waked up in a cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed before him\nwith wide-open eyes. He had awaked from a terrible dream. He had dreamed\nthat he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as were depicted in\nhis Plutarch, were leading a huge army. The army was made up of white\nslanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in\nautumn and which Dessalles called les fils de la Vi\xc3\xa8rge. In front was\nGlory, which was similar to those threads but rather thicker. He and\nPierre were borne along lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer to their\ngoal. Suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become\nentangled and it grew difficult to move. And Uncle Nicholas stood before\nthem in a stern and threatening attitude.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you done this?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to some broken sealing wax and\npens. \xe2\x80\x9cI loved you, but I have orders from Arakch\xc3\xa9ev and will kill\nthe first of you who moves forward.\xe2\x80\x9d Little Nicholas turned to look\nat Pierre but Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his\nfather\xe2\x80\x94Prince Andrew\xe2\x80\x94and his father had neither shape nor form, but he\nexisted, and when little Nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love:\nhe felt himself powerless, limp, and formless. His father caressed and\npitied him. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them. Terror\nseized young Nicholas and he awoke.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of Prince\nAndrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human form.) \xe2\x80\x9cMy\nfather has been with me and caressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle\nPierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. Mucius Scaevola burned\nhis hand. Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know\nthey want me to learn. And I will learn. But someday I shall have\nfinished learning, and then I will do something. I only pray God that\nsomething may happen to me such as happened to Plutarch\xe2\x80\x99s men, and I\nwill act as they did. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, love me,\nand be delighted with me!\xe2\x80\x9d And suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and\nhe began to cry.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d he heard Dessalles\xe2\x80\x99 voice asking.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is good and kind and I am fond of him!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought of Dessalles.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And my father? Oh,\nFather, Father! Yes, I will do something with which even he would be\nsatisfied....\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nHistory is the life of nations and of humanity. To seize and put into\nwords, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single\nnation, appears impossible.\n\nThe ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe\nand seize the apparently elusive\xe2\x80\x94the life of a people. They described\nthe activity of individuals who ruled the people, and regarded the\nactivity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation.\n\nThe question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by\nwhat was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients\nmet by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of\na chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish\nends that were predestined.\n\nFor the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct\nparticipation of the Deity in human affairs.\n\nModern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.\n\nIt would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man\xe2\x80\x99s\nsubjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations\nare led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but\nthe causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having\nin theory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them\nin practice.\n\nInstead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by\nthe will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with\nextraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various\nkinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. Instead of the\nformer divinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations,\nwhich ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of\nhumanity, modern history has postulated its own aims\xe2\x80\x94the welfare of the\nFrench, German, or English people, or, in its highest abstraction, the\nwelfare and civilization of humanity in general, by which is usually\nmeant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a\nlarge continent.\n\nModern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without\nreplacing them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has\nobliged the historians, after they had apparently rejected the divine\nauthority of the kings and the \xe2\x80\x9cfate\xe2\x80\x9d of the ancients, to reach the same\nconclusion by another road, that is, to recognize (1) nations guided\nby individual men, and (2) the existence of a known aim to which these\nnations and humanity at large are tending.\n\nAt the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon to\nBuckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of\ntheir outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions.\n\nIn the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals\nwho in his opinion have directed humanity (one historian considers\nonly monarchs, generals, and ministers as being such men, while another\nincludes also orators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, and poets).\nSecondly, it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led\nis known to the historians: to one of them this goal is the greatness of\nthe Roman, Spanish, or French realm; to another it is liberty, equality,\nand a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called\nEurope.\n\nIn 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is expressed\nby a movement of peoples from west to east. Several times it moves\neastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward.\nIn 1812 it reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with remarkable\nsymmetry, a countermovement occurs from east to west, attracting to\nit, as the first movement had done, the nations of middle Europe. The\ncounter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the\nwest\xe2\x80\x94Paris\xe2\x80\x94and subsides.\n\nDuring that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left\nuntilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions\nof men migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions\nof Christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one\nanother.\n\nWhat does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those people burn\nhouses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes of these events?\nWhat force made men act so? These are the instinctive, plain, and\nmost legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the\nmonuments and tradition of that period.\n\nFor a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the\nscience of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know\nthemselves.\n\nIf history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have\nsaid that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and\ndirected his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply\nwould have been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve\nin the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone believing in\nit there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that\nperiod, nor would there have been any contradictions.\n\nBut modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit the\nconception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity\nin human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other answers.\n\nModern history replying to these questions says: you want to know what\nthis movement means, what caused it, and what force produced these\nevents? Then listen:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such and such\nmistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly. His\ndescendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly. And they had\nsuch and such favorites and such and such mistresses. Moreover, certain\nmen wrote some books at that time. At the end of the eighteenth century\nthere were a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all\nmen being free and equal. This caused people all over France to begin\nto slash at and drown one another. They killed the king and many other\npeople. At that time there was in France a man of genius\xe2\x80\x94Napoleon. He\nconquered everybody everywhere\xe2\x80\x94that is, he killed many people because\nhe was a great genius. And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and\nkilled them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to\nFrance he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all obeyed him. Having\nbecome an Emperor he again went out to kill people in Italy, Austria,\nand Prussia. And there too he killed a great many. In Russia there\nwas an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and\ntherefore fought against Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends\nwith him, but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many\npeople. Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured\nMoscow; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor\nAlexander, helped by the advice of Stein and others, united Europe to\narm against the disturber of its peace. All Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s allies suddenly\nbecame his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he\nraised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to\nabdicate, and sent him to the island of Elba, not depriving him of the\ntitle of Emperor and showing him every respect, though five years before\nand one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand.\nThen Louis XVIII, who till then had been the laughingstock both of the\nFrench and the Allies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears\nbefore his Old Guards, renounced the throne and went into exile. Then\nthe skillful statesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand, who\nmanaged to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and\nthereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by\nthese conversations made the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the\ndiplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of\nagain ordering their armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon\narrived in France with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating\nhim, immediately all submitted to him. But the Allied monarchs were\nangry at this and went to fight the French once more. And they defeated\nthe genius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent him\nto the island of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the beloved\nFrance so dear to his heart, died a lingering death on that rock and\nbequeathed his great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reaction\noccurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their\nsubjects.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt would be a mistake to think that this is ironic\xe2\x80\x94a caricature of the\nhistorical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild expression of\nthe contradictory replies, not meeting the questions, which all the\nhistorians give, from the compilers of memoirs and the histories\nof separate states to the writers of general histories and the new\nhistories of the culture of that period.\n\nThe strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that\nmodern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has asked.\n\nIf the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of\nhumanity and of the peoples, the first question\xe2\x80\x94in the absence of a\nreply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible\xe2\x80\x94is: what is the\npower that moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously replies\neither that Napoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was very\nproud, or that certain writers wrote certain books.\n\nAll that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it is not\nwhat was asked. All that would be interesting if we recognized a divine\npower based on itself and always consistently directing its nations\nthrough Napoleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we do not acknowledge such\na power, and therefore before speaking about Napoleons, Louis-es, and\nauthors, we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men\nand the movement of the nations.\n\nIf instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, it should\nbe explained in what this new force consists, for the whole interest of\nhistory lies precisely in that force.\n\nHistory seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to\neveryone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as known, anyone\nreading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new\nforce, so variously understood by the historians themselves, is really\nquite well known to everybody.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nWhat force moves the nations?\n\nBiographical historians and historians of separate nations understand\nthis force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their narration\nevents occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and Alexander, or in\ngeneral of the persons they describe. The answers given by this kind\nof historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are\nsatisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event.\nAs soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin\nto describe the same event, the replies they give immediately lose all\nmeaning, for this force is understood by them all not only differently\nbut often in quite contradictory ways. One historian says that an\nevent was produced by Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s power, another that it was produced by\nAlexander\xe2\x80\x99s, a third that it was due to the power of some other person.\nBesides this, historians of that kind contradict each other even\nin their statement as to the force on which the authority of some\nparticular person was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\npower was based on his virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it\nwas based on his trickery and deception of the people. So the historians\nof this class, by mutually destroying one another\xe2\x80\x99s positions, destroy\nthe understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no\nreply to history\xe2\x80\x99s essential question.\n\nWriters of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to\nrecognize how erroneous is the specialist historians\xe2\x80\x99 view of the force\nwhich produces events. They do not recognize it as a power inherent in\nheroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously\ndirected forces. In describing a war or the subjugation of a people, a\ngeneral historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power\nof one man, but in the interaction of many persons connected with the\nevent.\n\nAccording to this view the power of historical personages, represented\nas the product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded\nas a force that itself produces events. Yet in most cases universal\nhistorians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself\nproduces events, and treat it as their cause. In their exposition, an\nhistoric character is first the product of his time, and his power only\nthe resultant of various forces, and then his power is itself a force\nproducing events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at one\ntime prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution, of the ideas of\n1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812\nand other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\nmisdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their\ndevelopment by Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the\ngeneral temper of the age produced Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s power. But Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s\npower suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of\nthe age.\n\nThis curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur at\nevery step, but the universal historians\xe2\x80\x99 accounts are all made up of\na chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs because after\nentering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway.\n\nTo find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force, the\nsum of the components must equal the resultant. This condition is never\nobserved by the universal historians, and so to explain the resultant\nforces they are obliged to admit, in addition to the insufficient\ncomponents, another unexplained force affecting the resultant action.\n\nSpecialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration\nof the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the\nwill of Alexander. But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this\nopinion of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of\n1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside\nAlexander\xe2\x80\x99s will\xe2\x80\x94such as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame de\nSta\xc3\xabl, Talleyrand, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The historian\nevidently decomposes Alexander\xe2\x80\x99s power into the components: Talleyrand,\nChateaubriand, and the rest\xe2\x80\x94but the sum of the components, that is,\nthe interactions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Sta\xc3\xabl, and the\nothers, evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon\nof millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand,\nMadame de Sta\xc3\xabl, and others spoke certain words to one another only\naffected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission\nof millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs\nthe submission of millions of people resulted\xe2\x80\x94that is, how component\nforces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A\xe2\x80\x94the\nhistorian is again obliged to fall back on power\xe2\x80\x94the force he had\ndenied\xe2\x80\x94and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he\nhas to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And that is\njust what the universal historians do, and consequently they not only\ncontradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves.\n\nPeasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according to\nwhether they want rain or fine weather: \xe2\x80\x9cThe wind has blown the clouds\naway,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cThe wind has brought up the clouds.\xe2\x80\x9d And in the same way the\nuniversal historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in with\ntheir theory, say that power is the result of events, and sometimes,\nwhen they want to prove something else, say that power produces events.\n\nA third class of historians\xe2\x80\x94the so-called historians of\nculture\xe2\x80\x94following the path laid down by the universal historians who\nsometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events\xe2\x80\x94again\ntake that force to be something quite different. They see it in what is\ncalled culture\xe2\x80\x94in mental activity.\n\nThe historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their\nprogenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical\nevents may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one\nanother in such and such ways, why not explain them by the fact that\nsuch and such people wrote such and such books? Of the immense number of\nindications accompanying every vital phenomenon, these historians select\nthe indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is\nthe cause. But despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events\nlies in intellectual activity, only by a great stretch can one admit\nthat there is any connection between intellectual activity and the\nmovement of peoples, and in no case can one admit that intellectual\nactivity controls people\xe2\x80\x99s actions, for that view is not confirmed by\nsuch facts as the very cruel murders of the French Revolution resulting\nfrom the doctrine of the equality of man, or the very cruel wars and\nexecutions resulting from the preaching of love.\n\nBut even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with\nwhich these histories are filled\xe2\x80\x94admitting that nations are governed by\nsome undefined force called an idea\xe2\x80\x94history\xe2\x80\x99s essential question still\nremains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs and to the\ninfluence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal\nhistorians, another, newer force\xe2\x80\x94the idea\xe2\x80\x94is added, the connection of\nwhich with the masses needs explanation. It is possible to understand\nthat Napoleon had power and so events occurred; with some effort one may\neven conceive that Napoleon together with other influences was the cause\nof an event; but how a book, Le Contrat Social, had the effect of making\nFrenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an\nexplanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event.\n\nUndoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously,\nand so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual\nactivity of men and their historical movements, just as such a\nconnection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce,\nhandicraft, gardening, or anything else you please. But why intellectual\nactivity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or\nexpression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand.\nOnly the following considerations can have led the historians to such\na conclusion: (1) that history is written by learned men, and so it is\nnatural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class\nsupplies the basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a similar\nbelief is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers\n(if they do not express it, that is merely because traders and soldiers\ndo not write history), and (2) that spiritual activity, enlightenment,\ncivilization, culture, ideas, are all indistinct, indefinite conceptions\nunder whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less\ndefinite meaning, and which can therefore be readily introduced into any\ntheory.\n\nBut not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind\n(which may possibly even be of use to someone for something) the\nhistories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and more\nto approximate, are significant from the fact that after seriously\nand minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and political\ndoctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to describe an\nactual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance, they\ninvoluntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power\xe2\x80\x94and say\nplainly that that was the result of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s will. Speaking so, the\nhistorians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves, and show that\nthe new force they have devised does not account for what happens in\nhistory, and that history can only be explained by introducing a power\nwhich they apparently do not recognize.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA locomotive is moving. Someone asks: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat moves it?\xe2\x80\x9d A peasant says\nthe devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive moves because its\nwheels go round. A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in\nthe smoke which the wind carries away.\n\nThe peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation. To\nrefute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil,\nor another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil\nbut a German, who moves the locomotive. Only then, as a result of the\ncontradiction, will they see that they are both wrong. But the man who\nsays that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself, for\nhaving once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why\nthe wheels go round; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the\nmovement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler, he\nhas no right to stop in his search for the cause. The man who explains\nthe movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has\nnoticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the\nfirst sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an\nexplanation.\n\nThe only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is\nthat of a force commensurate with the movement observed.\n\nThe only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that\nof some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples.\n\nYet to supply this conception various historians take forces of\ndifferent kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement\nobserved. Some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, as the\npeasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force resulting\nfrom several other forces, like the movement of the wheels; others again\nas an intellectual influence, like the smoke that is blown away.\n\nSo long as histories are written of separate individuals, whether\nCaesars, Alexanders, Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories\nof all, absolutely all those who take part in an event, it is quite\nimpossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception\nof a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end.\nAnd the only such conception known to historians is that of power.\n\nThis conception is the one handle by means of which the material of\nhistory, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who\nbreaks that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other method\nof treating historical material, merely deprives himself of the one\npossible way of dealing with it. The necessity of the conception of\npower as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by\nthe universal historians and historians of culture themselves, for they\nprofessedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at\nevery step.\n\nIn dealing with humanity\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry, the science of history up to now\nis like money in circulation\xe2\x80\x94paper money and coin. The biographies and\nspecial national histories are like paper money. They can be used and\ncan circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even\nadvantageously, as long as no one asks what is the security behind them.\nYou need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events, and\nsuch histories as Thiers\xe2\x80\x99 will be interesting and instructive and may\nperhaps even possess a tinge of poetry. But just as doubts of the real\nvalue of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, too much\nof it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold, so also\ndoubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because\ntoo many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart\nsomeone inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?\xe2\x80\x94that is, wants\nto exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual\ncomprehension.\n\nThe writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are\nlike people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to\nsubstitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity\nof gold. It may indeed make jingling coin, but will do no more than\nthat. Paper money may deceive the ignorant, but nobody is deceived by\ntokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle. As gold is\ngold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use,\nso universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to\nhistory\xe2\x80\x99s essential question: what is power? The universal historians\ngive contradictory replies to that question, while the historians of\nculture evade it and answer something quite different. And as counters\nof imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to\naccept them as gold, or among those who do not know the nature of\ngold, so universal historians and historians of culture, not answering\nhumanity\xe2\x80\x99s essential question, serve as currency for some purposes of\ntheir own, only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a\ntaste for what they call \xe2\x80\x9cserious reading.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nHaving abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine\nsubjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection\nof that man\xe2\x80\x99s will to the Deity, history cannot without contradictions\ntake a single step till it has chosen one of two things: either a return\nto the former belief in the direct intervention of the Deity in human\naffairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing\nhistorical events and termed \xe2\x80\x9cpower.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; and\nso it is essential to explain what is meant by power.\n\nNapoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. We are so\naccustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question:\nwhy did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon uttered\ncertain words, seems to us senseless. He had the power and so what he\nordered was done.\n\nThis reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given\nhim by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes essential to\ndetermine what is this power of one man over others.\n\nIt cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one\xe2\x80\x94a\ndomination based on the application or threat of physical force, like\nthe power of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect of moral force,\nas in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading\nfigures in history are heroes, that is, men gifted with a special\nstrength of soul and mind called genius. This power cannot be based on\nthe predominance of moral strength, for, not to mention heroes such as\nNapoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely, history\nshows us that neither a Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled over\nmillions of people, had any particular moral qualities, but on the\ncontrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they\nruled over.\n\nIf the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral\nqualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for\nelsewhere\xe2\x80\x94in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power.\n\nAnd that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence,\nthat exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history\xe2\x80\x99s\nunderstanding of power for true gold.\n\nPower is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or\ntacit consent, to their chosen rulers.\n\nIn the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how a\nstate and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to\nbe arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that\ndefinition of power needs explanation.\n\nThe science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients\nregarded fire\xe2\x80\x94namely, as something existing absolutely. But for history,\nthe state and power are merely phenomena, just as for modern physics\nfire is not an element but a phenomenon.\n\nFrom this fundamental difference between the view held by history and\nthat held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell\nminutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what\npower\xe2\x80\x94existing immutably outside time\xe2\x80\x94is, but to history\xe2\x80\x99s questions\nabout the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer\nnothing.\n\nIf power be the collective will of the people transferred to their\nruler, was Pugach\xc3\xabv a representative of the will of the people? If not,\nthen why was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon III a criminal when he was\ntaken prisoner at Boulogne, and why, later on, were those criminals whom\nhe arrested?\n\nDo palace revolutions\xe2\x80\x94in which sometimes only two or three people take\npart\xe2\x80\x94transfer the will of the people to a new ruler? In international\nrelations, is the will of the people also transferred to their\nconqueror? Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine transferred\nto Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Russian people transferred\nto Napoleon in 1809, when our army in alliance with the French went to\nfight the Austrians?\n\nTo these questions three answers are possible:\n\nEither to assume (1) that the will of the people is always\nunconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and\nthat therefore every emergence of a new power, every struggle\nagainst the power once appointed, should be absolutely regarded as an\ninfringement of the real power; or (2) that the will of the people\nis transferred to the rulers conditionally, under definite and known\nconditions, and to show that all limitations, conflicts, and even\ndestructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the\nconditions under which their power was entrusted to them; or (3) that\nthe will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally, but\nthat the conditions are unknown and indefinite, and that the appearance\nof several authorities, their struggles and their falls, result solely\nfrom the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown\nconditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some\npeople to others.\n\nAnd these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the\nrelation of the people to their rulers.\n\nSome historians\xe2\x80\x94those biographical and specialist historians already\nreferred to\xe2\x80\x94in their simplicity failing to understand the question of\nthe meaning of power, seem to consider that the collective will of\nthe people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons, and\ntherefore when describing some single state they assume that particular\npower to be the one absolute and real power, and that any other force\nopposing this is not a power but a violation of power\xe2\x80\x94mere violence.\n\nTheir theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history,\nhas the inconvenience\xe2\x80\x94in application to complex and stormy periods in\nthe life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and\nstruggle with one another\xe2\x80\x94that a Legitimist historian will prove\nthat the National Convention, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere\ninfringers of the true power, while a Republican and a Bonapartist will\nprove: the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the\nreal power, and that all the others were violations of power.\nEvidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually\ncontradictory can only satisfy young children.\n\nRecognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of\nhistorians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will\nof the people to their rulers, and that historical leaders have power\nonly conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the\npeople has by tacit agreement prescribed to them. But what this program\nconsists in these historians do not say, or if they do they continually\ncontradict one another.\n\nEach historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation\xe2\x80\x99s\nprogress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom,\nor enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country. But not\nto mention the historians\xe2\x80\x99 contradictions as to the nature of this\nprogram\xe2\x80\x94or even admitting that some one general program of these\nconditions exists\xe2\x80\x94the facts of history almost always contradict that\ntheory. If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the\nwealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis\nXIV and Iv\xc3\xa1n the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI\nand Charles I are executed by their people? To this question historians\nreply that Louis XIV\xe2\x80\x99s activity, contrary to the program, reacted on\nLouis XVI. But why did it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XV\xe2\x80\x94why\nshould it react just on Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for such\nreactions? To these questions there are and can be no answers. Equally\nlittle does this view explain why for several centuries the collective\nwill is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs, and\nthen suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the\nConvention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII,\nto Napoleon again, to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican\ngovernment, and to Napoleon III. When explaining these rapid transfers\nof the people\xe2\x80\x99s will from one individual to another, especially in view\nof international relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians are\nobliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations\nof the people\xe2\x80\x99s will but are accidents dependent on cunning, on\nmistakes, on craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, a ruler, or a\nparty leader. So that the greater part of the events of history\xe2\x80\x94civil\nwars, revolutions, and conquests\xe2\x80\x94are presented by these historians\nnot as the results of free transferences of the people\xe2\x80\x99s will, but as\nresults of the ill-directed will of one or more individuals, that is,\nonce again, as usurpations of power. And so these historians also see\nand admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory.\n\nThese historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some\nplants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that all\nthat grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the palm, the\nmushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth and no longer\nresemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.\n\nHistorians of the third class assume that the will of the people\nis transferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the\nconditions are unknown to us. They say that historical personages have\npower only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been\ndelegated to them.\n\nBut in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the\nhistoric leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have\nthose leaders?\n\nThe leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people:\nthe activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people.\n\nBut in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the\nleaders serves as an expression of the people\xe2\x80\x99s will or only some part\nof it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of\nthe people\xe2\x80\x99s will, as some historians suppose, then all the details\nof the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or\na Catherine serve to express the life of the nation, which is evident\nnonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an\nhistorical leader which serves to express the people\xe2\x80\x99s life, as other\nso-called \xe2\x80\x9cphilosophical\xe2\x80\x9d historians believe, then to determine which\nside of the activity of a leader expresses the nation\xe2\x80\x99s life, we have\nfirst of all to know in what the nation\xe2\x80\x99s life consists.\n\nMet by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most\nobscure, impalpable, and general abstraction which can cover all\nconceivable occurrences, and declare this abstraction to be the aim of\nhumanity\xe2\x80\x99s movement. The most usual generalizations adopted by almost\nall the historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment, progress,\ncivilization, and culture. Postulating some generalization as the goal\nof the movement of humanity, the historians study the men of whom the\ngreatest number of monuments have remained: kings, ministers, generals,\nauthors, reformers, popes, and journalists, to the extent to which in\ntheir opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction.\nBut as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in\nfreedom, equality, enlightenment, or civilization, and as the connection\nof the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based\non the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is\nalways transferred to the men whom we have noticed, it happens that the\nactivity of the millions who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture,\nand destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the\nactivity of some dozen people who did not burn houses, practice\nagriculture, or slay their fellow creatures.\n\nHistory proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples of\nthe west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward\nexplained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, their mistresses\nand ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau, Diderot,\nBeaumarchais, and others?\n\nIs the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kaz\xc3\xa1n and Siberia\nexpressed by details of the morbid character of Iv\xc3\xa1n the Terrible and by\nhis correspondence with K\xc3\xbarbski?\n\nIs the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by\nthe life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies?\nFor us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without\nleaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit, remains\nincomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that\nmovement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusade\xe2\x80\x94the deliverance\nof Jerusalem\xe2\x80\x94had been clearly defined by historic leaders. Popes, kings,\nand knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the people\ndid not go, for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to\ngo no longer existed. The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers\ncan evidently not cover the life of the peoples. And the history of the\nGodfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys\nand Minnesingers, but the history of the life of the peoples and their\nimpulses has remained unknown.\n\nStill less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the\nlife of the peoples.\n\nThe history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of\nlife and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had\na hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was\nsuspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after\nthe Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the\nFrench Revolution they guillotined one another.\n\nIf we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest\nhistorians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not\nthe history of the life of the peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for\nthe connection between those men and the nations has not been found.\nThe theory that this connection is based on the transference of the\ncollective will of a people to certain historical personages is an\nhypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history.\n\nThe theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to\nhistoric persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence\nand be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as\nsoon as revolutions, conquests, or civil wars occur\xe2\x80\x94that is, as soon as\nhistory begins\xe2\x80\x94that theory explains nothing.\n\nThe theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.\n\nWhatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the\ntheory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because\nthe collective will was transferred to him.\n\nThe replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the\nreplies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and\npaying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different\nparts of the field, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute\nthe direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads\nit and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that\nleader.\xe2\x80\x9d This is what historians of the first class say\xe2\x80\x94those who assume\nthe unconditional transference of the people\xe2\x80\x99s will.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the\ncollective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to\nanother, according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in\nthe direction selected by the whole herd.\xe2\x80\x9d Such is the reply historians\nwho assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to\nrulers under conditions which they regard as known. (With this method\nof observation it often happens that the observer, influenced by the\ndirection he himself prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s change of direction, are no longer in front, but on one side,\nor even in the rear.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of\nthe whole herd is constantly altered, this is because in order to follow\na given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that\nhave attracted our attention, and to study the movements of the herd\nwe must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all\nsides of the herd.\xe2\x80\x9d So say the third class of historians who regard all\nhistorical persons, from monarchs to journalists, as the expression of\ntheir age.\n\nThe theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic\npersons is merely a paraphrase\xe2\x80\x94a restatement of the question in other\nwords.\n\nWhat causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the\ncollective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what\ncondition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On\ncondition that that person expresses the will of the whole people. That\nis, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which\nwe do not understand.\n\nIf the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning,\nthen having subjected to criticism the explanation of \xe2\x80\x9cpower\xe2\x80\x9d that\njuridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely\na word and has no real existence. But to understand phenomena man\nhas, besides abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies his\nreflections. And experience tells us that power is not merely a word but\nan actually existing phenomenon.\n\nNot to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity\nof men can do without the conception of power, the existence of power is\nproved both by history and by observing contemporary events.\n\nWhenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear, by whose will the\nevent seems to have taken place. Napoleon III issues a decree and the\nFrench go to Mexico. The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue decrees and\nan army enters Bohemia. Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters\nRussia. Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the\nBourbons. Experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always\nrelated to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it.\n\nThe historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine\nintervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of events in\nthe expression of the will of someone endowed with power, but that\nsupposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience.\n\nOn the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man\xe2\x80\x99s will\xe2\x80\x94his\nwords\xe2\x80\x94are only part of the general activity expressed in an event,\nas for instance in a war or a revolution, and so without assuming an\nincomprehensible, supernatural force\xe2\x80\x94a miracle\xe2\x80\x94one cannot admit that\nwords can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men.\nOn the other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the cause\nof events, history shows that the expression of the will of historical\npersonages does not in most cases produce any effect, that is to say,\ntheir commands are often not executed, and sometimes the very opposite\nof what they order occurs.\n\nWithout admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we\ncannot regard \xe2\x80\x9cpower\xe2\x80\x9d as the cause of events.\n\nPower, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation that\nexists between the expression of someone\xe2\x80\x99s will and the execution of\nthat will by others.\n\nTo explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a\nconception of the expression of will, referring it to man and not to the\nDeity.\n\nIf the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient history\ntells us, the expression of that will is independent of time and is not\ncaused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by an event. But\nspeaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting\nin time and in relation to one another, to explain the connection of\ncommands with events we must restore: (1) the condition of all that\ntakes place: the continuity of movement in time both of the events and\nof the person who commands, and (2) the inevitability of the connection\nbetween the person commanding and those who execute his command.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nOnly the expression of the will of the Deity, not dependent on time, can\nrelate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or\ncenturies, and only the Deity, independent of everything, can by His\nsole will determine the direction of humanity\xe2\x80\x99s movement; but man acts\nin time and himself takes part in what occurs.\n\nReinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that no\ncommand can be executed without some preceding order having been given\nrendering the execution of the last command possible.\n\nNo command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series\nof occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers\nto a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.\n\nWhen, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war,\nwe combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive\ncommands dependent one on another. Napoleon could not have commanded\nan invasion of Russia and never did so. Today he ordered such and such\npapers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg;\ntomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army, the fleet, the\ncommissariat, and so on and so on\xe2\x80\x94millions of commands, which formed\na whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the\nFrench armies into Russia.\n\nIf throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion\nof England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort,\nand yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that\ndesign but undertook an expedition into Russia, with which country he\nconsidered it desirable to be in alliance (a conviction he repeatedly\nexpressed)\xe2\x80\x94this came about because his commands did not correspond to\nthe course of events in the first case, but did so correspond in the\nlatter.\n\nFor an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should\norder what can be executed. But to know what can and what cannot be\nexecuted is impossible, not only in the case of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s invasion of\nRussia in which millions participated, but even in the simplest event,\nfor in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its\nexecution. Every order executed is always one of an immense number\nunexecuted. All the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of\nevents remain unexecuted. Only the possible ones get linked up with a\nconsecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events, and\nare executed.\n\nOur false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes\nit is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of\nthousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that\nevent have been executed, we forget about the others that were not\nexecuted because they could not be. Apart from that, the chief source\nof our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical\naccounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such\nfor instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia, is\ngeneralized into one event in accord with the result produced by that\nseries of events, and corresponding with this generalization the whole\nseries of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will.\n\nWe say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. In\nreality in all Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s activity we never find anything resembling an\nexpression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or expressions of\nhis will, very variously and indefinitely directed. Amid a long series\nof unexecuted orders of Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s one series, for the campaign of 1812,\nwas carried out\xe2\x80\x94not because those orders differed in any way from the\nother, unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of\nevents that led the French army into Russia; just as in stencil work\nthis or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from\nthis side or in that way, but because it was laid on from all sides over\nthe figure cut in the stencil.\n\nSo that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events,\nwe find that a command can never be the cause of the event, but that a\ncertain definite dependence exists between the two.\n\nTo understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to\nreinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from\nthe Deity but from a man, which is, that the man who gives the command\nhimself takes part in the event.\n\nThis relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is\ncalled power. This relation consists in the following:\n\nFor common action people always unite in certain combinations, in which\nregardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action, the\nrelation between those taking part in it is always the same.\n\nMen uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward\none another that the larger number take a more direct share, and the\nsmaller number a less direct share, in the collective action for which\nthey have combined.\n\nOf all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of\nthe most striking and definite examples is an army.\n\nEvery army is composed of lower grades of the service\xe2\x80\x94the rank and\nfile\xe2\x80\x94of whom there are always the greatest number; of the next higher\nmilitary rank\xe2\x80\x94corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are\nfewer, and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer,\nand so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one\nperson.\n\nA military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone, of\nwhich the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file;\nthe next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next\nhigher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point of which\nwill represent the commander in chief.\n\nThe soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section of\nthe cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, hacking,\nburning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for these actions\nfrom men above him; he himself never gives an order. The noncommissioned\nofficers (of whom there are fewer) perform the action itself less\nfrequently than the soldiers, but they already give commands. An\nofficer still less often acts directly himself, but commands still more\nfrequently. A general does nothing but command the troops, indicates the\nobjective, and hardly ever uses a weapon himself. The commander in chief\nnever takes direct part in the action itself, but only gives general\norders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops. A similar\nrelation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men\nfor common activity\xe2\x80\x94in agriculture, trade, and every administration.\n\nAnd so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of\na cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions in\nany administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the\nhighest, we see a law by which men, to take associated action, combine\nin such relations that the more directly they participate in performing\nthe action the less they can command and the more numerous they are,\nwhile the less their direct participation in the action itself, the more\nthey command and the fewer of them there are; rising in this way from\nthe lowest ranks to the man at the top, who takes the least direct share\nin the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding.\n\nThis relation of the men who command to those they command is what\nconstitutes the essence of the conception called power.\n\nHaving restored the condition of time under which all events occur,\nwe find that a command is executed only when it is related to a\ncorresponding series of events. Restoring the essential condition of\nrelation between those who command and those who execute, we find that\nby the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part\nin the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to\ncommanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nWhen an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes\nabout it, and as the event results from the collective activity of\nmany people, some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be\nfulfilled if but approximately. When one of the opinions expressed\nis fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event as a command\npreceding it.\n\nMen are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion as to how and\nwhere to haul it. They haul the log away, and it happens that this is\ndone as one of them said. He ordered it. There we have command and power\nin their primary form. The man who worked most with his hands could not\nthink so much about what he was doing, or reflect on or command what\nwould result from the common activity; while the man who commanded\nmore would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater\nverbal activity.\n\nWhen some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim\nthere is a yet sharper division of those who, because their activity is\ngiven to directing and commanding, take less part in the direct work.\n\nWhen a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which\nas it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his present\nactivity, and guide him in planning his future actions. Just the same is\ndone by a concourse of people, allowing those who do not take a direct\npart in the activity to devise considerations, justifications, and\nsurmises concerning their collective activity.\n\nFor reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill\none another. And corresponding to the event its justification appears in\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s belief that this was necessary for the welfare of France, for\nliberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill one another, and\nthis event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a\ncentralization of power, resistance to Europe, and so on. Men went\nfrom the west to the east killing their fellow men, and the event\nwas accompanied by phrases about the glory of France, the baseness of\nEngland, and so on. History shows us that these justifications of the\nevents have no common sense and are all contradictory, as in the case of\nkilling a man as the result of recognizing his rights, and the killing\nof millions in Russia for the humiliation of England. But these\njustifications have a very necessary significance in their own day.\n\nThese justifications release those who produce the events from moral\nresponsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front\nof a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they clear\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s moral responsibilities from their path.\n\nWithout such justification there would be no reply to the simplest\nquestion that presents itself when examining each historical event. How\nis it that millions of men commit collective crimes\xe2\x80\x94make war, commit\nmurder, and so on?\n\nWith the present complex forms of political and social life in Europe\ncan any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by monarchs,\nministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? Is there any\ncollective action which cannot find its justification in political\nunity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization? So\nthat every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed\nwish and, receiving a justification, presents itself as the result of\nthe will of one man or of several men.\n\nIn whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves it cuts\nwill always be noticeable ahead of it. To those on board the ship the\nmovement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion.\n\nOnly by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and\ncomparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that\nevery bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship,\nand that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were\nimperceptibly moving.\n\nWe see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical\ncharacters (that is, re-establish the inevitable condition of all that\noccurs\xe2\x80\x94the continuity of movement in time) and do not lose sight of the\nessential connection of historical persons with the masses.\n\nWhen the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave\nahead of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns\nfrequently. But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave\nanticipating its movement.\n\nWhatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen\nand decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water which neither\ndirects nor increases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a distance\nseems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship\xe2\x80\x99s\nmovement also.\n\nExamining only those expressions of the will of historical persons\nwhich, as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed\nthat the events depended on those commands. But examining the events\nthemselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to\nthe people, we have found that they and their orders were dependent on\nevents. The incontestable proof of this deduction is that, however many\ncommands were issued, the event does not take place unless there are\nother causes for it, but as soon as an event occurs\xe2\x80\x94be it what it\nmay\xe2\x80\x94then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people\nsome will always be found which by their meaning and their time of\nutterance are related as commands to the events.\n\nArriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to\nthese two essential questions of history:\n\n(1) What is power?\n\n(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?\n\n(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals,\nin which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and\njustifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is\nhis participation in that action.\n\n(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by intellectual\nactivity, nor even by a combination of the two as historians have\nsupposed, but by the activity of all the people who participate in\nthe events, and who always combine in such a way that those taking\nthe largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least\nresponsibility and vice versa.\n\nMorally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically\nit is those who submit to the power. But as the moral activity is\ninconceivable without the physical, the cause of the event is neither in\nthe one nor in the other but in the union of the two.\n\nOr in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the\nphenomena we are examining.\n\nIn the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity\xe2\x80\x94that final limit\nto which in every domain of thought man\xe2\x80\x99s reason arrives if it is not\nplaying with the subject. Electricity produces heat, heat produces\nelectricity. Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another.\n\nSpeaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we\ncannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is\ninconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law. The\nsame applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we do\nnot know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action,\npeople combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and\nwe say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other\nwords that it is a law.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nIf history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this\nsimple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our\nargument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter\ncannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion\nand that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history,\nsays plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law.\n\nThe presence of the problem of man\xe2\x80\x99s free will, though unexpressed, is\nfelt at every step of history.\n\nAll seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this\nquestion. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the\nfalse path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of\na solution of that question.\n\nIf the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he\npleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.\n\nIf in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that\nis, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that man\xe2\x80\x99s\nin violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the\npossibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity.\n\nIf there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot\nexist, for then man\xe2\x80\x99s will is subject to that law.\n\nIn this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most\nancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient\ntimes has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.\n\nThe problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation\nfrom whatever point of view\xe2\x80\x94theological, historical, ethical, or\nphilosophic\xe2\x80\x94we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all\nthat exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves as what\nwe are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free.\n\nThis consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and\nindependent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself, but only\nthrough consciousness does he know himself.\n\nApart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason\nis conceivable.\n\nTo understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of all be\nconscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of himself as\na living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is conscious of\nhis volition. But his will\xe2\x80\x94which forms the essence of his life\xe2\x80\x94man\nrecognizes (and can but recognize) as free.\n\nIf, observing himself, man sees that his will is always directed by\none and the same law (whether he observes the necessity of taking\nfood, using his brain, or anything else) he cannot recognize this\nnever-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of\nit. Were it not free it could not be limited. A man\xe2\x80\x99s will seems to him\nto be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free.\n\nYou say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand and let it fall.\nEveryone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable\ndemonstration of freedom.\n\nThat reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to\nreason.\n\nIf the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent\nsource of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and\nto experience, but in fact such subjection does not exist and is\ninconceivable.\n\nA series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he, as\nan object of observation, is subject to certain laws, and man submits to\nthem and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he\nhas become acquainted with them. But the same series of experiments\nand arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is\nconscious in himself is impossible, and that his every action depends\non his organization, his character, and the motives acting upon him; yet\nman never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments.\nHaving learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls\ndownwards, a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law\nthat he has learned to be fulfilled.\n\nBut learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does\nnot and cannot believe this.\n\nHowever often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the\nsame conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as\nbefore, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character\nhe approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the\nsame way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment\nthat he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however\nincontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is\nimpossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the\nsame conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which\nconstitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels\nthat however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception\nof freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would\nbe unable to live for a single moment.\n\nHe could not live, because all man\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, all his impulses to life,\nare only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame and\nobscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, health and\ndisease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion and hunger,\nvirtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom.\n\nA man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of\nlife.\n\nIf the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless\ncontradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and\nthe same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, that only\nproves that consciousness is not subject to reason.\n\nThis unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom, uncontrolled by\nexperiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone\nwithout exception, this consciousness without which no conception of man\nis possible constitutes the other side of the question.\n\nMan is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God.\nWhat is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness of\nman\xe2\x80\x99s freedom? That is a question for theology.\n\nThe actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in\nstatistics. What is man\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to society, the conception of\nwhich results from the conception of freedom? That is a question for\njurisprudence.\n\nMan\xe2\x80\x99s actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting\nupon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and wrong\nin actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom? That is a\nquestion for ethics.\n\nMan in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject\nto laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from that\nconnection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations and\nof humanity be regarded\xe2\x80\x94as the result of the free, or as the result of\nthe constrained, activity of man? That is a question for history.\n\nOnly in our self-confident day of the popularization of knowledge\xe2\x80\x94thanks\nto that most powerful engine of ignorance, the diffusion of printed\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94has the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on\nwhich the question itself cannot exist. In our time the majority of\nso-called advanced people\xe2\x80\x94that is, the crowd of ignoramuses\xe2\x80\x94have taken\nthe work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a\nsolution of the whole problem.\n\nThey say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist,\nfor the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular\nmovements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves; the soul and\nfree will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang\nfrom the apes. They say this, not at all suspecting that thousands of\nyears ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now\ntrying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely\nacknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers, but has never\nbeen denied. They do not see that the role of the natural sciences in\nthis matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination\nof one side of it. For the fact that, from the point of view of\nobservation, reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain, and\nthat man following the general law may have developed from lower animals\nat some unknown period of time, only explains from a fresh side\nthe truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and\nphilosophic theories\xe2\x80\x94that from the point of view of reason man is\nsubject to the law of necessity; but it does not advance by a hair\xe2\x80\x99s\nbreadth the solution of the question, which has another, opposite, side,\nbased on the consciousness of freedom.\n\nIf men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, that is\nas comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a\ncertain period of time (in the first case the unknown quantity is the\ntime, in the second case it is the origin); and the question of how\nman\xe2\x80\x99s consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of\nnecessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative\nphysiology and zoology, for in a frog, a rabbit, or an ape, we can\nobserve only the muscular nervous activity, but in man we observe\nconsciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity.\n\nThe naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve this\nquestion, are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of\na church who, availing themselves of the absence of the chief\nsuperintendent of the work, should in an access of zeal plaster over the\nwindows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttressed walls, and should be\ndelighted that from their point of view as plasterers, everything is now\nso smooth and regular.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nFor the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, history\nhas this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the\nquestion is dealt with, that for history this question does not refer\nto the essence of man\xe2\x80\x99s free will but its manifestation in the past and\nunder certain conditions.\n\nIn regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences as\nexperimental science stands to abstract science.\n\nThe subject for history is not man\xe2\x80\x99s will itself but our presentation of\nit.\n\nAnd so for history, the insoluble mystery presented by the\nincompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does\nfor theology, ethics, and philosophy. History surveys a presentation of\nman\xe2\x80\x99s life in which the union of these two contradictions has already\ntaken place.\n\nIn actual life each historic event, each human action, is very clearly\nand definitely understood without any sense of contradiction, although\neach event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory.\n\nTo solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and\nwhat constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the philosophy\nof history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other\nsciences. Instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and\ninevitability in themselves, and then ranging the phenomena of life\nunder those definitions, history should deduce a definition of the\nconception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense\nquantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear\ndependent on these two elements.\n\nWhatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual\nwe may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of man\xe2\x80\x99s free\nwill and partly of the law of inevitability.\n\nWhether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions\nof the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someone\xe2\x80\x99s\naction an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his\nwalk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The degree of freedom and\ninevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined\nfor us.\n\nOur conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to\ndifferences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but\nevery human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and\ninevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure of\nfreedom and a certain measure of inevitability. And always the more\nfreedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive, and\nthe more inevitability the less freedom.\n\nThe proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases\naccording to the point of view from which the action is regarded, but\ntheir relation is always one of inverse proportion.\n\nA sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry mother\nexhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man trained\nto discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless\nman\xe2\x80\x94seem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject to the law of\nnecessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were\nplaced, and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself\ndrowning, that the mother was hungry, that the soldier was in the ranks,\nand so on. Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and\nhas since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty\nand his action more due to the law of inevitability, to someone who\nconsiders his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who\nexamined it the day after it was committed. And in the same way every\naction of an insane, intoxicated, or highly excited man appears less\nfree and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him\nwho committed the action, and seems more free and less inevitable to one\nwho does not know it. In all these cases the conception of freedom\nis increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is\ncorrespondingly decreased or increased, according to the point of view\nfrom which the action is regarded. So that the greater the conception of\nnecessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa.\n\nReligion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence,\nand history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and\nfreedom.\n\nAll cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and\nnecessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:\n\n(1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds.\n\n(2) His relation to time.\n\n(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.\n\nThe first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man\xe2\x80\x99s\nrelation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness\nof our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man\nin relation to everything coexisting with him. This is what makes it\nevident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity\nthan one standing on dry ground, and that makes the actions of a man\nclosely connected with others in a thickly populated district, or of one\nbound by family, official, or business duties, seem certainly less free\nand more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and\nseclusion.\n\nIf we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around\nhim, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his relation\nto anything around him, if we see his connection with anything\nwhatever\xe2\x80\x94with a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on\nwhich he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or the light that\nfalls on the things about him\xe2\x80\x94we see that each of these circumstances\nhas an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity.\nAnd the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of\nhis freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that\nweighs on him increases.\n\nThe second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of\nthe man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s action occupies in time. That is the ground which makes the\nfall of the first man, resulting in the production of the human race,\nappear evidently less free than a man\xe2\x80\x99s entry into marriage today. It is\nthe reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago\nand are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life\nof a contemporary, the consequences of which are still unknown to me.\n\nThe degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this\nrespect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance\nof the action and our judgment of it.\n\nIf I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same\ncircumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me undoubtedly\nfree. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then being in\ndifferent circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if that act had\nnot been committed much that resulted from it\xe2\x80\x94good, agreeable, and even\nessential\xe2\x80\x94would not have taken place. If I reflect on an action still\nmore remote, ten years ago or more, then the consequences of my action\nare still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have\nhappened had that action not been performed. The farther I go back\nin memory, or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my\njudgment, the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my\naction.\n\nIn history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning\nthe part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. A\ncontemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the\nknown participants, but with a more remote event we already see its\ninevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible.\nAnd the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do\nthey appear.\n\nThe Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the\ncrafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still seem\nto us, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their heroes\xe2\x80\x99\nwill. But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite\nplace in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history\nof Europe, though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared\nas merely due to the will of certain people. In regard to the migration\nof the peoples it does not enter anyone\xe2\x80\x99s head today to suppose that\nthe renovation of the European world depended on Attila\xe2\x80\x99s caprice. The\nfarther back in history the object of our observation lies, the more\ndoubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and\nthe more manifest the law of inevitability.\n\nThe third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that\nendless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, in which each\nphenomenon comprehended, and therefore man\xe2\x80\x99s every action, must have\nits definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of\nwhat will follow.\n\nThe better we are acquainted with the physiological, psychological, and\nhistorical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled,\nand the more correctly we perceive the physiological, psychological,\nand historical causes of the action, and the simpler the action we are\nobserving and the less complex the character and mind of the man in\nquestion, the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our\nactions and those of others appear.\n\nWhen we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a\ncrime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe a\ngreater amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime we most urgently\ndemand the punishment for such an act; in the case of a virtuous act we\nrate its merit most highly. In an indifferent case we recognize in it\nmore individuality, originality, and independence. But if even one of\nthe innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain\nelement of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime,\nor the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom\nof the apparently original action. That a criminal was reared among\nmalefactors mitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father\nor mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, is more\ncomprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems less\ndeserving of sympathy and less the result of free will. The founder of a\nsect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less when we know how or by\nwhat the way was prepared for his activity. If we have a large range\nof examples, if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the\ncorrelation of cause and effect in people\xe2\x80\x99s actions, their actions\nappear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we\nconnect the effects with the causes. If we examined simple actions and\nhad a vast number of such actions under observation, our conception of\ntheir inevitability would be still greater. The dishonest conduct of the\nson of a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman who had fallen\ninto bad company, a drunkard\xe2\x80\x99s relapse into drunkenness, and so on are\nactions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause.\nIf the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of\nmental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpleton\xe2\x80\x94then,\nknowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and\nintelligence in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so\nlittle free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action\nwe can foretell the result.\n\nOn these three considerations alone is based the conception of\nirresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted\nby all legislative codes. The responsibility appears greater or less\naccording to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in\nwhich the man was placed whose action is being judged, and according\nto the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the\naction and its investigation, and according to the greater or lesser\nunderstanding of the causes that led to the action.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes\nor increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the\nexternal world, the greater or lesser remoteness of time, and the\ngreater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we\ncontemplate a man\xe2\x80\x99s life.\n\nSo that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the\nexternal world is well known, where the time between the action and\nits examination is great, and where the causes of the action are most\naccessible, we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a\nminimum of free will. If we examine a man little dependent on external\nconditions, whose action was performed very recently, and the causes of\nwhose action are beyond our ken, we get the conception of a minimum of\ninevitability and a maximum of freedom.\n\nIn neither case\xe2\x80\x94however we may change our point of view, however plain\nwe may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external\nworld, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or short the\nperiod of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes\nof the action may be\xe2\x80\x94can we ever conceive either complete freedom or\ncomplete necessity.\n\n(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the\ninfluence of the external world, we never get a conception of freedom\nin space. Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds\nhim and by his own body. I lift my arm and let it fall. My action seems\nto me free; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every\ndirection, I see that I raised it in the direction in which there was\nleast obstruction to that action either from things around me or from\nthe construction of my own body. I chose one out of all the possible\ndirections because in it there were fewest obstacles. For my action\nto be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles. To\nconceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space, which is\nevidently impossible.\n\n(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the\ndeed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. For if I examine\nan action committed a second ago I must still recognize it as not\nbeing free, for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was\ncommitted. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, but ask myself: could I have\nabstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed? To\nconvince myself of this I do not lift it the next moment. But I am\nnot now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when I asked the\nquestion. Time has gone by which I could not detain, the arm I then\nlifted is no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting,\nnor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me. The\nmoment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable, and at that\nmoment I could make only one movement, and whatever movement I made\nwould be the only one. That I did not lift my arm a moment later does\nnot prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then. And since I\ncould make only one movement at that single moment of time, it could not\nhave been any other. To imagine it as free, it is necessary to imagine\nit in the present, on the boundary between the past and the future\xe2\x80\x94that\nis, outside time, which is impossible.\n\n(3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be\nincreased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, that is,\nan absence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the\nexpression of will in any action, our own or another\xe2\x80\x99s, the first demand\nof reason is the assumption of and search for a cause, for without a\ncause no phenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to perform an action\nindependently of any cause, but my wish to perform an action without a\ncause is the cause of my action.\n\nBut even if\xe2\x80\x94imagining a man quite exempt from all influences, examining\nonly his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any cause\xe2\x80\x94we were\nto admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled\nzero, we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete\nfreedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by the external world, standing\noutside of time and independent of cause, is no longer a man.\n\nIn the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of\nfreedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.\n\n(1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space\nin which man is situated, that knowledge can never be complete, for the\nnumber of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space. And\ntherefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined,\nthere is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom\nremains.\n\n(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are\nexamining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite, while\ntime is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never be absolute\ninevitability.\n\n(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action, we\nshall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and so again we\nnever reach absolute inevitability.\n\nBut besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to\nequal zero, we assumed in some given case\xe2\x80\x94as for instance in that of a\ndying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot\xe2\x80\x94complete absence of freedom, by\nso doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are\nexamining, for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man. And\nso the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of\ninevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as\nthe conception of a man\xe2\x80\x99s completely free action.\n\nAnd so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of\ninevitability without any freedom, we must assume the knowledge of an\ninfinite number of space relations, an infinitely long period of time,\nand an infinite series of causes.\n\nTo imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of\ninevitability, we must imagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond time,\nand free from dependence on cause.\n\nIn the first case, if inevitability were possible without freedom\nwe should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of\ninevitability itself, that is, a mere form without content.\n\nIn the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability we\nshould have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, and\ncause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would\nbe nothing, or mere content without form.\n\nWe should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhole outlook on the universe is constructed\xe2\x80\x94the incomprehensible\nessence of life, and the laws defining that essence.\n\nReason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it\nvisibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time is\ninfinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise.\n(3) The connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can\nhave no end.\n\nConsciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is but me,\nconsequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time by the fixed\nmoment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as living,\nconsequently I am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I feel myself\nto be the cause of every manifestation of my life.\n\nReason gives expression to the laws of inevitability. Consciousness\ngives expression to the essence of freedom.\n\nFreedom not limited by anything is the essence of life, in man\xe2\x80\x99s\nconsciousness. Inevitability without content is man\xe2\x80\x99s reason in its\nthree forms.\n\nFreedom is the thing examined. Inevitability is what examines. Freedom\nis the content. Inevitability is the form.\n\nOnly by separating the two sources of cognition, related to one another\nas form to content, do we get the mutually exclusive and separately\nincomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability.\n\nOnly by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man\xe2\x80\x99s life.\n\nApart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one\nanother as form and content, no conception of life is possible.\n\nAll that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free\nwill to inevitability, that is, of consciousness to the laws of reason.\n\nAll that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain\nrelation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence of\nlife to the laws of reason.\n\nThe great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of\nthem; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal\nforce, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of life in man and\nwe call that freedom.\n\nBut just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but\nfelt by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which we\nknow the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the first\nknowledge that all bodies have weight, up to Newton\xe2\x80\x99s law), so too the\nforce of free will, incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is\nconscious, is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of\ninevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that every man dies,\nup to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws).\n\nAll knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the\nlaws of reason.\n\nMan\xe2\x80\x99s free will differs from every other force in that man is directly\nconscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from\nany other force. The forces of gravitation, electricity, or chemical\naffinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are\ndifferently defined by reason. Just so the force of man\xe2\x80\x99s free will\nis distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the\ndefinition reason gives it. Freedom, apart from necessity, that is,\napart from the laws of reason that define it, differs in no way from\ngravitation, or heat, or the force that makes things grow; for reason,\nit is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life.\n\nAnd as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies,\nthe undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity, or\nof chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of\nastronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the\nsame way does the force of free will form the content of history.\nBut just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this\nunknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the\nsubject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of the force of free will\nin human beings in space, in time, and in dependence on cause forms\nthe subject of history, while free will itself is the subject of\nmetaphysics.\n\nIn the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of\ninevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital force is\nonly an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know\nof the essence of life.\n\nSo also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability,\nwhat is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an\nexpression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of\nhuman life.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nHistory examines the manifestations of man\xe2\x80\x99s free will in connection\nwith the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it\ndefines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science\nonly in so far as this free will is defined by those laws.\n\nThe recognition of man\xe2\x80\x99s free will as something capable of influencing\nhistorical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for\nhistory as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies\nwould be for astronomy.\n\nThat assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws,\nthat is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body\nmoving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no\nconception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If\nany single action is due to free will, then not a single historical law\ncan exist, nor any conception of historical events.\n\nFor history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end\nof which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a\nconsciousness of man\xe2\x80\x99s will in the present moves in space, time, and\ndependence on cause.\n\nThe more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more\nevident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define those laws\nis the problem of history.\n\nFrom the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its\nsubject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in\nman\xe2\x80\x99s free will, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible,\nfor however man\xe2\x80\x99s free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize\nit as a force not subject to law, the existence of law becomes\nimpossible.\n\nOnly by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that\nis, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince\nourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then\ninstead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of laws as\nits problem.\n\nThe search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of\nthought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously\nwith the self-destruction toward which\xe2\x80\x94ever dissecting and dissecting\nthe causes of phenomena\xe2\x80\x94the old method of history is moving.\n\nAll human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at\ninfinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the\nprocess of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration\nof unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception\nof cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all\nunknown, infinitely small, elements.\n\nIn another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences\nhave proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say\nthat the sun or the earth had a property of attraction; he said that all\nbodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting\none another, that is, leaving aside the question of the cause of the\nmovement of the bodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies\nfrom the infinitely large to the infinitely small. The same is done by\nthe natural sciences: leaving aside the question of cause, they seek for\nlaws. History stands on the same path. And if history has for its object\nthe study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the\nnarration of episodes in the lives of individuals, it too, setting\naside the conception of cause, should seek the laws common to all the\ninseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nFrom the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, the mere\nrecognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves\nsufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients. By disproving\nthat law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of\nthe movements of the bodies, but without disproving it, it would seem\nimpossible to continue studying the Ptolemaic worlds. But even after\nthe discovery of the law of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still\nstudied for a long time.\n\nFrom the time the first person said and proved that the number of births\nor of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this or that\nmode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic\nconditions, and that certain relations of population to soil produce\nmigrations of peoples, the foundations on which history had been built\nwere destroyed in their essence.\n\nBy refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been\nretained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue\nstudying historic events as the results of man\xe2\x80\x99s free will. For if a\ncertain mode of government was established or certain migrations\nof peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic,\nethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will of those\nindividuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government\nor occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause.\n\nAnd yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the\nlaws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative philology,\nand geology, which directly contradict its assumptions.\n\nThe struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly\nfought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on guard for the\nold views and accused the new of violating revelation. But when truth\nconquered, theology established itself just as firmly on the new\nfoundation.\n\nJust as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between\nthe old and the new conception of history, and theology in the same way\nstands on guard for the old view, and accuses the new view of subverting\nrevelation.\n\nIn the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle provokes\npassion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear and regret for\nthe loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages, on the other\nis the passion for destruction.\n\nTo the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy,\nit seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in\nGod, in the creation of the firmament, and in the miracle of Joshua the\nson of Nun. To the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and Newton, to\nVoltaire for example, it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed\nreligion, and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against\nreligion.\n\nJust so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of\ninevitability, to destroy the conception of the soul, of good and evil,\nand all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on\nthose conceptions.\n\nSo too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of\ninevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion, though\nthe law of inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus in\nastronomy, far from destroying, even strengthens the foundation on which\nthe institutions of state and church are erected.\n\nAs in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of history\nnow, the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or\nnonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the measure of visible\nphenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability of the earth, in history\nit is the independence of personality\xe2\x80\x94free will.\n\nAs with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth\nlay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s fixity and of\nthe motion of the planets, so in history the difficulty of recognizing\nthe subjection of personality to the laws of space, time, and cause\nlies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of one\xe2\x80\x99s own\npersonality. But as in astronomy the new view said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that we\ndo not feel the movement of the earth, but by admitting its immobility\nwe arrive at absurdity, while by admitting its motion (which we do not\nfeel) we arrive at laws,\xe2\x80\x9d so also in history the new view says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\ntrue that we are not conscious of our dependence, but by admitting our\nfree will we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting our dependence on\nthe external world, on time, and on cause, we arrive at laws.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an\nunreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel;\nin the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom\nthat does not exist, and to recognize a dependence of which we are not\nconscious.\n\n\n\n'
