I\nexpected to receive a powerful esthetic pleasure, but having read, one\nafter the other, works regarded as his best: "King Lear," "Romeo and\nJuliet," "Hamlet" and "Macbeth," not only did I feel no delight, but I\nfelt an irresistible repulsion and tedium, and doubted as to whether I\nwas senseless in feeling works regarded as the summit of perfection by\nthe whole of the civilized world to be trivial and positively bad, or\nwhether the significance which this civilized world attributes to the\nworks of Shakespeare was itself senseless. My consternation was\nincreased by the fact that I always keenly felt the beauties of\npoetry in every form; then why should artistic works recognized by the\nwhole world as those of a genius,--the works of Shakespeare,--not only\nfail to please me, but be disagreeable to me? For a long time I could\nnot believe in myself, and during fifty years, in order to test\nmyself, I several times recommenced reading Shakespeare in every\npossible form, in Russian, in English, in German and in Schlegel\'s\ntranslation, as I was advised. Several times I read the dramas and the\ncomedies and historical plays, and I invariably underwent the same\nfeelings: repulsion, weariness, and bewilderment. At the present time,\nbefore writing this preface, being desirous once more to test myself,\nI have, as an old man of seventy-five, again read the whole of\nShakespeare, including the historical plays, the "Henrys," "Troilus\nand Cressida," the "Tempest," "Cymbeline," and I have felt, with even\ngreater force, the same feelings,--this time, however, not of\nbewilderment, but of firm, indubitable conviction that the\nunquestionable glory of a great genius which Shakespeare enjoys, and\nwhich compels writers of our time to imitate him and readers and\nspectators to discover in him non-existent merits,--thereby\ndistorting their esthetic and ethical understanding,--is a great evil,\nas is every untruth.\n\nAltho I know that the majority of people so firmly believe in the\ngreatness of Shakespeare that in reading this judgment of mine they will\nnot admit even the possibility of its justice, and will not give it the\nslightest attention, nevertheless I will endeavor, as well as I can, to\nshow why I believe that Shakespeare can not be recognized either as a\ngreat genius, or even as an average author.\n\nFor illustration of my purpose I will take one of Shakespeare\'s most\nextolled dramas, "King Lear," in the enthusiastic praise of which, the\nmajority of critics agree.\n\n"The tragedy of Lear is deservedly celebrated among the dramas of\nShakespeare," says Dr. Johnson. "There is perhaps no play which keeps\nthe attention so strongly fixed, which so much agitates our passions,\nand interests our curiosity."\n\n"We wish that we could pass this play over and say nothing about it,"\nsays Hazlitt, "all that we can say must fall far short of the subject,\nor even of what we ourselves conceive of it. To attempt to give a\ndescription of the play itself, or of its effects upon the mind, is mere\nimpertinence; yet we must say something. It is, then, the best of\nShakespeare\'s plays, for it is the one in which he was the most in\nearnest."\n\n"If the originality of invention did not so much stamp almost every play\nof Shakespeare," says Hallam, "that to name one as the most original\nseems a disparagement to others, we might say that this great\nprerogative of genius, was exercised above all in \'Lear.\' It diverges\nmore from the model of regular tragedy than \'Macbeth,\' or \'Othello,\' and\neven more than \'Hamlet,\' but the fable is better constructed than in the\nlast of these and it displays full as much of the almost superhuman\ninspiration of the poet as the other two."\n\n"\'King Lear\' may be recognized as the perfect model of the dramatic art\nof the whole world," says Shelley.\n\n"I am not minded to say much of Shakespeare\'s Arthur," says Swinburne.\n"There are one or two figures in the world of his work of which there\nare no words that would be fit or good to say. Another of these is\nCordelia. The place they have in our lives and thoughts is not one for\ntalk. The niche set apart for them to inhabit in our secret hearts is\nnot penetrable by the lights and noises of common day. There are chapels\nin the cathedrals of man\'s highest art, as in that of his inmost life,\nnot made to be set open to the eyes and feet of the world. Love, and\nDeath, and Memory, keep charge for us in silence of some beloved names.\nIt is the crowning glory of genius, the final miracle and transcendent\ngift of poetry, that it can add to the number of these and engrave on\nthe very heart of our remembrance fresh names and memories of its own\ncreation."\n\n"Lear is the occasion for Cordelia," says Victor Hugo. "Maternity of the\ndaughter toward the father; profound subject; maternity venerable among\nall other maternities, so admirably rendered by the legend of that Roman\ngirl, who, in the depths of a prison, nurses her old father. The young\nbreast near the white beard! There is not a spectacle more holy. This\nfilial breast is Cordelia. Once this figure dreamed of and found,\nShakespeare created his drama.... Shakespeare, carrying Cordelia in his\nthoughts, created that tragedy like a god who, having an aurora to put\nforward, makes a world expressly for it."\n\n"In \'King Lear,\' Shakespeare\'s vision sounded the abyss of horror to its\nvery depths, and his spirit showed neither fear, nor giddiness, nor\nfaintness, at the sight," says Brandes. "On the threshold of this work,\na feeling of awe comes over one, as on the threshold of the Sistine\nChapel, with its ceiling of frescoes by Michael Angelo,--only that the\nsuffering here is far more intense, the wail wilder, and the harmonies\nof beauty more definitely shattered by the discords of despair."\n\nSuch are the judgments of the critics about this drama, and therefore I\nbelieve I am not wrong in selecting it as a type of Shakespeare\'s best.\n\nAs impartially as possible, I will endeavor to describe the contents of\nthe drama, and then to show why it is not that acme of perfection it is\nrepresented to be by critics, but is something quite different.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe drama of "Lear" begins with a scene giving the conversation between\ntwo courtiers, Kent and Gloucester. Kent, pointing to a young man\npresent, asks Gloucester whether that is not his son. Gloucester says\nthat he has often blushed to acknowledge the young man as his son, but\nhas now ceased doing so. Kent says he "can not conceive him." Then\nGloucester in the presence of this son of his says: "The fellow\'s mother\ncould, and grew round-wombed, and had a son for her cradle ere she had a\nhusband for her bed." "I have another, a legitimate son," continues\nGloucester, "but altho this one came into the world before he was sent\nfor, his mother was fair and there was good sport at his making, and\ntherefore I acknowledge this one also."\n\nSuch is the introduction. Not to mention the coarseness of these words\nof Gloucester, they are, farther, out of place in the mouth of a person\nintended to represent a noble character. One can not agree with the\nopinion of some critics that these words are given to Gloucester in\norder to show the contempt for his illegitimacy from which Edmund\nsuffers. Were this so, it would first have been unnecessary to make the\nfather express the contempt felt by men in general, and, secondly,\nEdmund, in his monolog about the injustice of those who despise him for\nhis birth, would have mentioned such words from his father. But this is\nnot so, and therefore these words of Gloucester at the very beginning of\nthe piece, were merely intended as a communication to the public--in a\nhumorous form--of the fact that Gloucester has a legitimate son and an\nillegitimate one.\n\nAfter this, trumpets are blown, and King Lear enters with his daughters\nand sons-in-law, and utters a speech to the effect that, owing to old\nage, he wishes to retire from the cares of business and divide his\nkingdom between his daughters. In order to know how much he should give\nto each daughter, he announces that to the one who says she loves him\nmost he will give most. The eldest daughter, Goneril, says that words\ncan not express the extent of her love, that she loves her father more\nthan eyesight, space, and liberty, loves him so much that it "makes her\nbreath poor." King Lear immediately allots his daughter on the map, her\nportion of fields, woods, rivers, and meadows, and asks the same\nquestion of the second daughter. The second daughter, Regan, says that\nher sister has correctly expressed her own feelings, only not strongly\nenough. She, Regan, loves her father so much that everything is\nabhorrent to her except his love. The king rewards this daughter, also,\nand then asks his youngest, the favorite, in whom, according to his\nexpression, are "interess\'d the vines of France and the milk of\nBurgundy," that is, whose hand is being claimed by the King of France\nand the Duke of Burgundy,--he asks Cordelia how she loves him. Cordelia,\nwho personifies all the virtues, as the eldest two all the vices, says,\nquite out of place, as if on purpose to irritate her father, that altho\nshe loves and honors him, and is grateful to him, yet if she marries,\nall her love will not belong to her father, but she will also love her\nhusband.\n\nHearing these words, the King loses his temper, and curses this favorite\ndaughter with the most dreadful and strange maledictions, saying, for\ninstance, that he will henceforth love his daughter as little as he\nloves the man who devours his own children.\n\n                      "The barbarous Scythian,\n    Or he that makes his generation messes\n    To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\n    Be as well neighbour\'d, pitied, and relieved.\n    As thou, my sometime daughter."\n\nThe courtier, Kent, defends Cordelia, and desiring to appease the King,\nrebukes him for his injustice, and says reasonable things about the evil\nof flattery. Lear, unmoved by Kent, banishes him under pain of death,\nand calling to him Cordelia\'s two suitors, the Duke of Burgundy and the\nKing of France, proposes to them in turn to take Cordelia without dowry.\nThe Duke of Burgundy frankly says that without dowry he will not take\nCordelia, but the King of France takes her without dowry and leads her\naway. After this, the elder sisters, there and then entering into\nconversation, prepare to injure their father who had endowed them. Thus\nends the first scene.\n\nNot to mention the pompous, characterless language of King Lear, the\nsame in which all Shakespeare\'s Kings speak, the reader, or spectator,\ncan not conceive that a King, however old and stupid he may be, could\nbelieve the words of the vicious daughters, with whom he had passed his\nwhole life, and not believe his favorite daughter, but curse and banish\nher; and therefore the spectator, or reader, can not share the feelings\nof the persons participating in this unnatural scene.\n\nThe second scene opens with Edmund, Gloucester\'s illegitimate son,\nsoliloquizing on the injustice of men, who concede rights and respect to\nthe legitimate son, but deprive the illegitimate son of them, and he\ndetermines to ruin Edgar, and to usurp his place. For this purpose, he\nforges a letter to himself as from Edgar, in which the latter expresses\na desire to murder his father. Awaiting his father\'s approach, Edmund,\nas if against his will, shows him this letter, and the father\nimmediately believes that his son Edgar, whom he tenderly loves, desires\nto kill him. The father goes away, Edgar enters and Edmund persuades him\nthat his father for some reason desires to kill him. Edgar immediately\nbelieves this and flees from his parent.\n\nThe relations between Gloucester and his two sons, and the feelings of\nthese characters are as unnatural as Lear\'s relation to his daughters,\nor even more so, and therefore it is still more difficult for the\nspectator to transport himself into the mental condition of Gloucester\nand his sons and sympathize with them, than it is to do so into that of\nLear and his daughters.\n\nIn the fourth scene, the banished Kent, so disguised that Lear does not\nrecognize him, presents himself to Lear, who is already staying with\nGoneril. Lear asks who he is, to which Kent answers, one doesn\'t know\nwhy, in a tone quite inappropriate to his position: "A very\nhonest-hearted fellow and as poor as the King."--"If thou be as poor for\na subject as he is for a King, thou art poor enough--How old art thou?"\nasks the King. "Not so young, Sir, to love a woman, _etc._, nor so old\nto dote on her." To this the King says, "If I like thee no worse after\ndinner, I will not part from thee yet."\n\nThese speeches follow neither from Lear\'s position, nor his relation to\nKent, but are put into the mouths of Lear and Kent, evidently because\nthe author regards them as witty and amusing.\n\nGoneril\'s steward appears, and behaves rudely to Lear, for which Kent\nknocks him down. The King, still not recognizing Kent, gives him money\nfor this and takes him into his service. After this appears the fool,\nand thereupon begins a prolonged conversation between the fool and the\nKing, utterly unsuited to the position and serving no purpose. Thus, for\ninstance, the fool says, "Give me an egg and I\'ll give thee two crowns."\nThe King asks, "What crowns shall they be?"--"Why," says the fool,\n"after I have cut the egg i\' the middle, and eat up the meat, the two\ncrowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i\' the middle, and gavest\naway both parts, thou borest thine ass on thy back o\'er the dirt: thou\nhadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden one away.\nIf I speak like myself in this, let him be whipp\'d that first finds it\nso."\n\nIn this manner lengthy conversations go on calling forth in the\nspectator or reader that wearisome uneasiness which one experiences when\nlistening to jokes which are not witty.\n\nThis conversation was interrupted by the approach of Goneril. She\ndemands of her father that he should diminish his retinue; that he\nshould be satisfied with fifty courtiers instead of a hundred. At this\nsuggestion, Lear gets into a strange and unnatural rage, and asks:\n\n    "Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:\n     Does Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?\n     Either his notion weakens, his discernings\n     Are lethargied. Ha! \'tis not so.\n     Who is it that can tell me who I am?"\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nWhile this goes on the fool does not cease to interpolate his humorless\njokes. Goneril\'s husband then enters and wishes to appease Lear, but\nLear curses Goneril, invoking for her either sterility or the birth of\nsuch an infant-monster as would return laughter and contempt for her\nmotherly cares, and would thus show her all the horror and pain caused\nby a child\'s ingratitude.\n\nThese words which express a genuine feeling, might have been touching\nhad they stood alone. But they are lost among long and high-flown\nspeeches, which Lear keeps incessantly uttering quite inappropriately.\nHe either invokes "blasts and fogs" upon the head of his daughter, or\ndesires his curse to "pierce every sense about her," or else appealing\nto his own eyes, says that should they weep, he will pluck them out and\n"cast them with the waters that they lose to temper clay." And so on.\n\nAfter this, Lear sends Kent, whom he still fails to recognize, to his\nother daughter, and notwithstanding the despair he has just manifested,\nhe talks with the fool, and elicits his jokes. The jokes continue to be\nmirthless and besides creating an unpleasant feeling, similar to shame,\nthe usual effect of unsuccessful witticisms, they are also so drawn out\nas to be positively dull. Thus the fool asks the King whether he can\ntell why one\'s nose stands in the middle of one\'s face? Lear says he can\nnot.--\n\n     "Why, to keep one\'s eyes of either side \'s nose, that what a\n     man can not smell out, he may spy out."\n\n     "Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?"\n\n     "No."\n\n     "Nor I either; but I can tell why a snail has a house."\n\n     "Why?"\n\n     "Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his\n     daughters and leave his horns without a case."\n\n     "----Be my horses ready?"\n\n     "Thy asses are gone about \'em. The reason why the seven\n     stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason."\n\n     "Because they are not eight?"\n\n     "Yes, indeed: thou would\'st make a good fool."\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAfter this lengthy scene, a gentleman enters and announces that the\nhorses are ready. The fool says:\n\n    "She that\'s a maid now, and laughs at my departure,\n     Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter."\n\nThe second part of the first scene of the second act begins by the\nvillain Edmund persuading his brother, when their father enters, to\npretend that they are fighting with their swords. Edgar consents, altho\nit is utterly incomprehensible why he should do so. The father finds\nthem fighting. Edgar flies and Edmund scratches his arm to draw blood\nand persuades his father that Edgar was working charms for the purpose\nof killing his father and had desired Edmund to help him, but that he,\nEdmund, had refused and that then Edgar flew at him and wounded his arm.\nGloucester believes everything, curses Edgar and transfers all the\nrights of the elder and legitimate son to the illegitimate Edmund. The\nDuke, hearing of this, also rewards Edmund.\n\nIn the second scene, in front of Gloucester\'s palace, Lear\'s new\nservant, Kent, still unrecognized by Lear, without any reason, begins to\nabuse Oswald, Goneril\'s steward, calling him,--"A knave, a rascal, an\neater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,\nhundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave;--the son and heir of a\nmongrel bitch." And so on. Then drawing his sword, he demands that\nOswald should fight with him, saying that he will make a "sop o\' the\nmoonshine" of him,--words which no commentators can explain. When he is\nstopped, he continues to give vent to the strangest abuse, saying that a\ntailor made Oswald, as "a stone-cutter or a painter could not have made\nhim so ill, tho they had been but two hours o\' the trade!" He further\nsays that, if only leave be given him, he will "tread this unbolted\nvillain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him."\n\nThus Kent, whom nobody recognizes, altho both the King and the Duke of\nCornwall, as well as Gloucester who is present, ought to know him well,\ncontinues to brawl, in the character of Lear\'s new servant, until he is\ntaken and put in the stocks.\n\nThe third scene takes place on a heath. Edgar, flying from the\npersecutions of his father, hides in a wood and tells the public what\nkind of lunatics exist there--beggars who go about naked, thrust wooden\npricks and pins into their flesh, scream with wild voices and enforce\ncharity, and says that he wishes to simulate such a lunatic in order to\nsave himself from persecution. Having communicated this to the public,\nhe retires.\n\nThe fourth scene is again before Gloucester\'s castle. Enter Lear and the\nfool. Lear sees Kent in the stocks, and, still not recognizing him, is\ninflamed with rage against those who dared so to insult his messenger,\nand calls for the Duke and Regan. The fool goes on with his jokes.\n\nLear with difficulty restrains his ire. Enter the Duke and Regan. Lear\ncomplains of Goneril but Regan justifies her sister. Lear curses\nGoneril, and, when Regan tells him he had better return to her sister,\nhe is indignant and says: "Ask her forgiveness?" and falls down on his\nknees demonstrating how indecent it would be if he were abjectly to beg\nfood and clothing as charity from his own daughter, and he curses\nGoneril with the strangest curses and asks who put his servant in the\nstocks. Before Regan can answer, Goneril arrives. Lear becomes yet more\nexasperated and again curses Goneril, but when he is told that it was\nthe Duke himself who ordered the stocks, he does not say anything,\nbecause, at this moment, Regan tells him that she can not receive him\nnow and that he had best return to Goneril, and that in a month\'s time\nshe herself will receive him, with, however, not a hundred but fifty\nservants. Lear again curses Goneril and does not want to go to her,\ncontinuing to hope that Regan will accept him with the whole hundred\nservants. But Regan says she will receive him only with twenty-five and\nthen Lear makes up his mind to go back to Goneril who admits fifty. But\nwhen Goneril says that even twenty-five are too many, Lear pours forth a\nlong argument about the superfluous and the needful being relative and\nsays that if man is not allowed more than he needs, he is not to be\ndistinguished from a beast. Lear, or rather the actor who plays Lear\'s\npart, adds that there is no need for a lady\'s finery, which does not\nkeep her warm. After this he flies into a mad fury and says that to take\nvengeance on his daughters he will do something dreadful but that he\nwill not weep, and so he departs. A storm begins.\n\nSuch is the second act, full of unnatural events, and yet more unnatural\nspeeches, not flowing from the position of the characters,--and\nfinishing with a scene between Lear and his daughters which might have\nbeen powerful if it had not been permeated with the most absurdly\nfoolish, unnatural speeches--which, moreover, have no relation to the\nsubject,--put into the mouth of Lear. Lear\'s vacillations between pride,\nanger, and the hope of his daughters\' giving in, would be exceedingly\ntouching if it were not spoilt by the verbose absurdities to which he\ngives vent, about being ready to divorce himself from Regan\'s dead\nmother, should Regan not be glad to receive him,--or about his calling\ndown "fen suck\'d frogs" which he invokes, upon the head of his daughter,\nor about the heavens being obliged to patronize old people because they\nthemselves are old.\n\nThe third act begins with thunder, lightning, a storm of some special\nkind such as, according to the words of the characters in the piece, had\nnever before taken place. On the heath, a gentleman tells Kent that\nLear, banished by his daughters from their homes, is running about the\nheath alone, tearing his hair and throwing it to the wind, and that none\nbut the fool is with him. In return Kent tells the gentleman that the\ndukes have quarrelled, and that the French army has landed at Dover,\nand, having communicated this intelligence, he dispatches the gentleman\nto Dover to meet Cordelia.\n\nThe second scene of the third act also takes place on the heath, but in\nanother part of it. Lear walks about the heath and says words which are\nmeant to express his despair: he desires that the winds should blow so\nhard that they should crack their cheeks and that the rain should flood\neverything, that lightning should singe his white head, and the thunder\nflatten the world and destroy all germens "that make ungrateful man!"\nThe fool keeps uttering still more senseless words. Enter Kent. Lear\nsays that for some reason during this storm all criminals shall be found\nout and convicted. Kent, still unrecognized by Lear, endeavors to\npersuade him to take refuge in a hovel. At this point the fool\npronounces a prophecy in no wise related to the situation and they all\ndepart.\n\nThe third scene is again transferred to Gloucester\'s castle. Gloucester\ntells Edmund that the French King has already landed with his troops,\nand intends to help Lear. Learning this, Edmund decides to accuse his\nfather of treason in order that he may get his heritage.\n\nThe fourth scene is again on the heath in front of the hovel. Kent\ninvites Lear into the hovel, but Lear answers that he has no reason to\nshelter himself from the tempest, that he does not feel it, having a\ntempest in his mind, called forth by the ingratitude of his daughters,\nwhich extinguishes all else. This true feeling, expressed in simple\nwords, might elicit sympathy, but amidst the incessant, pompous raving\nit escapes one and loses its significance.\n\nThe hovel into which Lear is led, turns out to be the same which Edgar\nhas entered, disguised as a madman, _i.e._, naked. Edgar comes out of\nthe hovel, and, altho all have known him, no one recognizes him,--as no\none recognizes Kent,--and Edgar, Lear, and the fool begin to say\nsenseless things which continue with interruptions for many pages. In\nthe middle of this scene, enter Gloucester, who also does not recognize\neither Kent or his son Edgar, and tells them how his son Edgar wanted to\nkill him.\n\nThis scene is again cut short by another in Gloucester\'s castle, during\nwhich Edmund betrays his father and the Duke promises to avenge himself\non Gloucester. Then the scene shifts back to Lear. Kent, Edgar,\nGloucester, Lear, and the fool are at a farm and talking. Edgar says:\n"Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of\ndarkness...." The fool says: "Tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or\na yeoman?" Lear, having lost his mind, says that the madman is a king.\nThe fool says no, the madman is the yeoman who has allowed his son to\nbecome a gentleman. Lear screams: "To have a thousand with red burning\nspirits. Come hissing in upon \'em,"--while Edgar shrieks that the foul\nfiend bites his back. At this the fool remarks that one can not believe\n"in the tameness of a wolf, a horse\'s health, a boy\'s love, or a whore\'s\noath." Then Lear imagines he is judging his daughters. "Sit thou here,\nmost learned justicer," says he, addressing the naked Edgar; "Thou,\nsapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes." To this Edgar says: "Look\nwhere he stands and glares! Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?" "Come\no\'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,----" while the fool sings:\n\n    "Her boat hath a leak\n     And she must not speak\n     Why she dares not come over to thee."\n\nEdgar goes on in his own strain. Kent suggests that Lear should lie\ndown, but Lear continues his imaginary trial: "Bring in their evidence,"\nhe cries. "Thou robed man of justice, take thy place," he says to Edgar,\n"and thou" (to the fool) "his yoke-fellow of equity, bench by his side.\nYou are o\' the commission, sit you too," addressing Kent.\n\n"Purr, the cat is gray," shouts Edgar.\n\n"Arraign her first, \'tis Goneril," cries Lear. "I here take my oath\nbefore this honorable assembly, she kicked the poor king, her father."\n\n"Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?" says the fool, addressing\nthe seat.\n\n"And here\'s another," cries Lear. "Stop her there! arms, arms, sword,\nfire! Corruption in the place! False justice, why hast thou let her\n\'scape?"\n\nThis raving terminates by Lear falling asleep and Gloucester persuading\nKent, still without recognizing him, to carry Lear to Dover, and Kent\nand the fool carry off the King.\n\nThe scene is transferred to Gloucester\'s castle. Gloucester himself is\nabout to be accused of treason. He is brought forward and bound. The\nDuke of Cornwall plucks out one of his eyes and sets his foot on it.\nRegan says, "One side will mock another; the other too." The Duke wishes\nto pluck the other out also, but some servant, for some reason, suddenly\ntakes Gloucester\'s part and wounds the Duke. Regan kills the servant,\nwho, dying, says to Gloucester that he has "one eye left to see some\nmischief on him." The Duke says, "Lest it see more, prevent it," and he\ntears out Gloucester\'s other eye and throws it on the ground. Here Regan\nsays that it was Edmund who betrayed his father and then Gloucester\nimmediately understands that he has been deceived and that Edgar did not\nwish to kill him.\n\nThus ends the third act.\n\nThe fourth act is again on the heath. Edgar, still attired as a lunatic,\nsoliloquizes in stilted terms about the instability of fortune and the\nadvantages of a humble lot. Then there comes to him somehow into the\nvery place on the heath where he is, his father, the blinded Gloucester,\nled by an old man. In that characteristic Shakespearean language,--the\nchief peculiarity of which is that the thoughts are bred either by the\nconsonance or the contrasts of words,--Gloucester also speaks about the\ninstability of fortune. He tells the old man who leads him to leave him,\nbut the old man points out to him that he can not _see_ his way.\nGloucester says he has no way and therefore does not require _eyes_. And\nhe argues about his having stumbled when he _saw_, and about defects\noften proving commodities. "Ah! dear son Edgar," he adds, "might I but\nlive to _see_ thee in my touch, I\'d say I had _eyes_ again." Edgar\nnaked, and in the character of a lunatic, hearing this, still does not\ndisclose himself to his father. He takes the place of the aged guide and\ntalks with his father, who does not recognize his voice, but regards him\nas a wandering madman. Gloucester avails himself of the opportunity to\ndeliver himself of a witticism: "\'Tis the times\' plague when madmen lead\nthe blind," and he insists on dismissing the old man, obviously not from\nmotives which might be natural to Gloucester at that moment, but merely\nin order, when left alone with Edgar, to enact the later scene of the\nimaginary leaping from the cliff.\n\nNotwithstanding Edgar has just seen his blinded father, and has learnt\nthat his father repents of having banished him, he puts in utterly\nunnecessary interjections which Shakespeare might know, having read them\nin Haronet\'s book, but which Edgar had no means of becoming acquainted\nwith, and above all, which it was quite unnatural for him to repeat in\nhis present position. He says, "Five friends have been in poor Tom at\nonce: of lust, as Obidient; Hobbididance, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of\nstealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing; who\nsince possesses chambermaids and waiting women."\n\nHearing these words, Gloucester makes a present of his purse to Edgar,\nsaying:\n\n           "That I am so wretched\n    Makes thee the happier; heavens, deal so still,\n    Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,\n    That slaves your ordinance, that will not see\n    Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly.\n    So distribution should undo excess,\n    And each man have enough."\n\nHaving pronounced these strange words, the blind Gloucester requests\nEdgar to lead him to a certain cliff overhanging the sea, and they\ndepart.\n\nThe second scene of the fourth act takes place before the Duke of\nAlbany\'s palace. Goneril is not only cruel, but also depraved. She\ndespises her husband and discloses her love to the villain Edmund, who\nhas inherited the title of his father Gloucester. Edmund leaves, and a\nconversation takes place between Goneril and her husband. The Duke of\nAlbany, the only figure with human feelings, who had already previously\nbeen dissatisfied with his wife\'s treatment of her father, now\nresolutely takes Lear\'s side, but expresses his emotion in such words as\nto shake one\'s confidence in his feeling. He says that a bear would lick\nLear\'s reverence, that if the heavens do not send their visible spirits\nto tame these vile offenses, humanity must prey on itself like monsters,\netc.\n\nGoneril does not listen to him, and then he begins to abuse her:\n\n    "See thyself, devil!\n     Proper deformity seems not in the fiend\n     So horrid as in woman."\n\n"O vain fool," says Goneril. "Thou changed and self-cover\'d thing, for\nshame," continues the Duke:\n\n    "Be-monster not thy feature. Were\'t my fitness\n     To let these hands obey my blood,\n     They are apt enough to dislocate and tear\n     Thy flesh and bones; howe\'er thou art a fiend,\n     A woman\'s shape doth shield thee."\n\nAfter this a messenger enters, and announces that the Duke of Cornwall,\nwounded by his servant whilst plucking out Gloucester\'s eyes, had died.\nGoneril is glad but already anticipates with fear that Regan, now a\nwidow, will deprive her of Edmund. Here the second scene ends.\n\nThe third scene of the fourth act represents the French camp. From a\nconversation between Kent and a gentleman, the reader or spectator\nlearns that the King of France is not in the camp and that Cordelia has\nreceived a letter from Kent and is greatly grieved by what she has\nlearned about her father. The gentleman says that her face reminded one\nof sunshine and rain.\n\n                       "Her smiles and tears\n    Were like a better day; those happy smiles\n    That play\'d on her ripe lip seem\'d not to know\n    What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,\n    As pearls from diamonds dropp\'d."\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nThe gentleman says that Cordelia desires to see her father, but Kent\nsays that Lear is ashamed of seeing this daughter whom he has treated so\nunkindly.\n\nIn the fourth scene, Cordelia, talking with a physician, tells him that\nLear has been seen, that he is quite mad, wearing on his head a wreath\nof various weeds, that he is roaming about and that she has sent\nsoldiers in search of him, adding that she desires all secret remedies\nto spring with her tears, and the like.\n\nShe is informed that the forces of the Dukes are approaching, but she is\nconcerned only about her father and departs.\n\nThe fifth scene of the fourth act lies in Gloucester\'s castle. Regan is\ntalking with Oswald, Goneril\'s steward, who is carrying a letter from\nGoneril to Edmund, and she announces to him that she also loves Edmund\nand that, being a widow, it is better for her to marry him than for\nGoneril to do so, and she begs him to persuade her sister of this.\nFurther she tells him that it was very unreasonable to blind Gloucester\nand yet leave him alive, and therefore advises Oswald, should he meet\nGloucester, to kill him, promising him a great reward if he does this.\n\nIn the sixth scene, Gloucester again appears with his still unrecognized\nson Edgar, who (now in the guise of a peasant) pretends to lead his\nfather to the cliff. Gloucester is walking along on level land but Edgar\npersuades him that they are with difficulty ascending a steep hill.\nGloucester believes this. Edgar tells his father that the noise of the\nsea is heard; Gloucester believes this also. Edgar stops on a level\nplace and persuades his father that he has ascended the cliff and that\nin front of him lies a dreadful abyss, and leaves him alone. Gloucester,\naddressing the gods, says that he shakes off his affliction as he can\nbear it no longer, and that he does not condemn them--the gods. Having\nsaid this, he leaps on the level ground and falls, imagining that he has\njumped off the cliff. On this occasion, Edgar, soliloquizing, gives vent\nto a yet more entangled utterance:\n\n    "I know not how conceit may rob\n     The treasury of life when life itself\n     Yields to the theft; had he been where he thought,\n     By this had thought been past."\n\nHe approaches Gloucester, in the character of yet a different person,\nand expressing astonishment at the latter not being hurt by his fall\nfrom such a dreadful height. Gloucester believes that he has fallen and\nprepares to die, but he feels that he is alive and begins to doubt that\nhe has fallen from such a height. Then Edgar persuades him that he has\nindeed jumped from the dreadful height and tells him that the\nindividual who had been with him at the top was the devil, as he had\neyes like two full moons and a thousand noses and wavy horns. Gloucester\nbelieves this, and is persuaded that his despair was the work of the\ndevil, and therefore decides that he will henceforth despair no more,\nbut will quietly await death. Hereupon enters Lear, for some reason\ncovered with wild-flowers. He has lost his senses and says things wilder\nthan before. He speaks about coining, about the moon, gives some one a\nyard--then he cries that he sees a mouse, which he wishes to entice by a\npiece of cheese. Then he suddenly demands the password from Edgar, and\nEdgar immediately answers him with the words "Sweet marjoram." Lear\nsays, "Pass," and the blind Gloucester, who has not recognized either\nhis son or Kent, recognizes the King\'s voice.\n\nThen the King, after his disconnected utterances, suddenly begins to\nspeak ironically about flatterers, who agreed to all he said, "Ay, and\nno, too, was no good divinity," but, when he got into a storm without\nshelter, he saw all this was not true; and then goes on to say that as\nall creation addicts itself to adultery, and Gloucester\'s bastard son\nhad treated his father more kindly than his daughters had treated him\n(altho Lear, according to the development of the drama, could not know\nhow Edmund had treated Gloucester), therefore, let dissoluteness\nprosper, the more so as, being a King, he needs soldiers. He here\naddresses an imaginary hypocritically virtuous lady who acts the prude,\nwhereas\n\n    "The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to\'t\n     With a more riotous appetite.\n     All women inherit the gods only to the girdle\n     Beneath is all the fiend\'s"--\n\nand, saying this, Lear screams and spits from horror. This monolog is\nevidently meant to be addressed by the actor to the audience, and\nprobably produces an effect on the stage, but it is utterly uncalled for\nin the mouth of Lear, equally with his words: "It smells of mortality,"\nuttered while wiping his hand, as Gloucester expresses a desire to kiss\nit. Then Gloucester\'s blindness is referred to, which gives occasion for\na play of words on _eyes_, about blind Cupid, at which Lear says to\nGloucester, "No _eyes_ in your head, nor no money in your _purse_? Your\n_eyes_ are in a _heavy_ case, your purse in a _light_." Then Lear\ndeclaims a monolog on the unfairness of legal judgment, which is quite\nout of place in the mouth of the insane Lear. After this, enter a\ngentleman with attendants sent by Cordelia to fetch her father. Lear\ncontinues to act as a madman and runs away. The gentleman sent to fetch\nLear, does not run after him, but lengthily describes to Edgar the\nposition of the French and British armies. Oswald enters, and seeing\nGloucester, and desiring to receive the reward promised by Regan,\nattacks him, but Edgar with his club kills Oswald, who, in dying,\ntransmits to his murderer, Edgar, Goneril\'s letter to Edmund, the\ndelivery of which would insure reward. In this letter Goneril promises\nto kill her husband and marry Edmund. Edgar drags out Oswald\'s body by\nthe legs and then returns and leads his father away.\n\nThe seventh scene of the fourth act takes place in a tent in the French\ncamp. Lear is asleep on a bed. Enter Cordelia and Kent, still in\ndisguise. Lear is awakened by the music, and, seeing Cordelia, does not\nbelieve she is a living being, thinks she is an apparition, does not\nbelieve that he himself is alive. Cordelia assures him that she is his\ndaughter, and begs him to bless her. He falls on his knees before her,\nbegs her pardon, acknowledges that he is as old and foolish, says he is\nready to take poison, which he thinks she has probably prepared for him,\nas he is persuaded she must hate him. ("For your sisters," he says,\n"have done me wrong: you have some cause, they have not.") Then he\ngradually comes to his senses and ceases to rave. His daughter suggests\nthat he should take a walk. He consents and says: "You must bear with\nme. Pray you now forget and forgive: I am old and foolish." They depart.\nThe gentleman and Kent, remaining on the scene, hold a conversation\nwhich explains to the spectator that Edmund is at the head of the troops\nand that a battle must soon begin between Lear\'s defenders and his\nenemies. So the fourth act closes.\n\nIn this fourth act, the scene between Lear and his daughter might have\nbeen touching if it had not been preceded in the course of the earlier\nacts by the tediously drawn out, monotonous ravings of Lear, and if,\nmoreover, this expression of his feelings constituted the last scene.\nBut the scene is not the last.\n\nIn the fifth act, the former coldly pompous, artificial ravings of Lear\ngo on again, destroying the impression which the previous scene might\nhave produced.\n\nThe first scene of the fifth act at first represents Edmund and Regan;\nthe latter is jealous of her sister and makes an offer. Then come\nGoneril, her husband, and some soldiers. The Duke of Albany, altho\npitying Lear, regards it as his duty to fight with the French who have\ninvaded his country, and so he prepares for battle.\n\nThen Edgar enters, still disguised, and hands to the Duke of Albany the\nletter he had received from Goneril\'s dying steward, and tells him if he\ngains the victory to sound the trumpet, saying that he can produce a\nchampion who will confirm the contents of the letter.\n\nIn the second scene, Edgar enters leading his father Gloucester, seats\nhim by a tree, and goes away himself. The noise of battle is heard,\nEdgar runs back and says that the battle is lost and Lear and Cordelia\nare prisoners. Gloucester again falls into despair. Edgar, still\nwithout disclosing himself to his father, counsels endurance, and\nGloucester immediately agrees with him.\n\nThe third scene opens with a triumphal progress of the victor Edmund.\nLear and Cordelia are prisoners. Lear, altho no longer insane, continues\nto utter the same senseless, inappropriate words, as, for example, that\nin prison he will sing with Cordelia, she will ask his blessing, and he\nwill kneel down (this process of kneeling down is repeated three times)\nand will ask her forgiveness. And he further says that, while they are\nliving in prison, they will wear out "packs and sects of great ones";\nthat he and Cordelia are sacrifices upon which the gods will throw\nincense, and that he that parts them "shall bring a brand from heaven\nand fire them like foxes; that he will not weep, and that the plague\nshall sooner devour his eyes, flesh and fell, than they shall make them\nweep."\n\nEdmund orders Lear and his daughter to be led away to prison, and,\nhaving called the officer to do this, says he requires another duty and\nasks him whether he\'ll do it? The captain says he can not draw a cart\nnor eat dried oats, but if it be men\'s work he can do it. Enter the Duke\nof Albany, Goneril, and Regan. The Duke of Albany wishes to champion\nLear, but Edmund does not allow it. The daughters take part in the\ndialog and begin to abuse each other, being jealous of Edmund. Here\neverything becomes so confused that it is difficult to follow the\naction. The Duke of Albany wishes to arrest Edmund, and tells Regan that\nEdmund has long ago entered into guilty relations with his wife, and\nthat, therefore, Regan must give up her claims on Edmund, and if she\nwishes to marry, should marry him, the Duke of Albany.\n\nHaving said this, the Duke of Albany calls Edmund, orders the trumpet to\nbe sounded, saying that, if no one appears, he will fight him himself.\n\nHere Regan, whom Goneril has evidently poisoned, falls deadly sick.\nTrumpets are sounded and Edgar enters with a vizor concealing his face,\nand, without giving his name, challenges Edmund. Edgar abuses Edmund;\nEdmund throws all the abuses back on Edgar\'s head. They fight and Edmund\nfalls. Goneril is in despair. The Duke of Albany shows Goneril her\nletter. Goneril departs.\n\nThe dying Edmund discovers that his opponent was his brother. Edgar\nraises his vizor and pronounces a moral lesson to the effect that,\nhaving begotten his illegitimate son Edmund, the father has paid for it\nwith his eyesight. After this Edgar tells the Duke of Albany his\nadventures and how he has only just now, before entering on the recent\ncombat, disclosed everything to his father, and the father could not\nbear it and died from emotion. Edmund is not yet dead, and wants to know\nall that has taken place.\n\nThen Edgar relates that, while he was sitting over his father\'s body, a\nman came and closely embraced him, and, shouting as loudly as if he\nwished to burst heaven, threw himself on the body of Edgar\'s father, and\ntold the most piteous tale about Lear and himself, and that while\nrelating this the strings of life began to crack, but at this moment the\ntrumpet sounded twice and Edgar left him "tranced"--and this was Kent.\n\nEdgar has hardly finished this narrative when a gentleman rushes in with\na bloody knife, shouting "Help!" In answer to the question, "Who is\nkilled?" the gentleman says that Goneril has been killed, having\npoisoned her sister, she has confessed it.\n\nEnters Kent, and at this moment the corpses of Goneril and Regan are\nbrought in. Edmund here says that the sisters evidently loved him, as\none has poisoned the other for his sake, and then slain herself. At the\nsame time he confesses that he had given orders to kill Lear and to hang\nCordelia in prison, and pretend that she had taken her own life; but now\nhe wishes to prevent these deeds, and having said this he dies, and is\ncarried away.\n\nAfter this enters Lear with the dead Cordelia in his arms, altho he is\nmore than eighty years old and ill. Again begins Lear\'s awful ravings,\nat which one feels ashamed as at unsuccessful jokes. Lear demands that\nall should howl, and, alternately, believes that Cordelia is dead and\nthat she is alive.\n\n"Had I your tongues and eyes," he says "I\'d use them so that heaven\'s\nvault should crack."\n\nThen he says that he killed the slave who hanged Cordelia. Next he says\nthat his eyes see badly, but at the same time he recognizes Kent whom\nall along he had not recognized.\n\nThe Duke of Albany says that he will resign during the life of Lear and\nthat he will reward Edgar and Kent and all who have been faithful to\nhim. At this moment the news is brought that Edmund is dead, and Lear,\ncontinuing his ravings, begs that they will undo one of his buttons--the\nsame request which he had made when roaming about the heath. He\nexpresses his thanks for this, tells everyone to look at something, and\nthereupon dies.\n\nIn conclusion, the Duke of Albany, having survived the others, says:\n\n    "The weight of this sad time we must obey;\n     Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\n     The oldest hath borne most: we that are young\n     Shall never see so much, nor live so long."\n\nAll depart to the music of a dead march. Thus ends the fifth act and the\ndrama.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nSuch is this celebrated drama. However absurd it may appear in my\nrendering (which I have endeavored to make as impartial as possible), I\nmay confidently say that in the original it is yet more absurd. For any\nman of our time--if he were not under the hypnotic suggestion that this\ndrama is the height of perfection--it would be enough to read it to its\nend (were he to have sufficient patience for this) to be convinced that\nfar from being the height of perfection, it is a very bad, carelessly\ncomposed production, which, if it could have been of interest to a\ncertain public at a certain time, can not evoke among us anything but\naversion and weariness. Every reader of our time, who is free from the\ninfluence of suggestion, will also receive exactly the same impression\nfrom all the other extolled dramas of Shakespeare, not to mention the\nsenseless, dramatized tales, "Pericles," "Twelfth Night," "The\nTempest," "Cymbeline," "Troilus and Cressida."\n\nBut such free-minded individuals, not inoculated with\nShakespeare-worship, are no longer to be found in our Christian society.\nEvery man of our society and time, from the first period of his\nconscious life, has been inoculated with the idea that Shakespeare is a\ngenius, a poet, and a dramatist, and that all his writings are the\nheight of perfection. Yet, however hopeless it may seem, I will endeavor\nto demonstrate in the selected drama--"King Lear"--all those faults\nequally characteristic also of all the other tragedies and comedies of\nShakespeare, on account of which he not only is not representing a model\nof dramatic art, but does not satisfy the most elementary demands of art\nrecognized by all.\n\nDramatic art, according to the laws established by those very critics\nwho extol Shakespeare, demands that the persons represented in the play\nshould be, in consequence of actions proper to their characters, and\nowing to a natural course of events, placed in positions requiring them\nto struggle with the surrounding world to which they find themselves in\nopposition, and in this struggle should display their inherent\nqualities.\n\nIn "King Lear" the persons represented are indeed placed externally in\nopposition to the outward world, and they struggle with it. But their\nstrife does not flow from the natural course of events nor from their\nown characters, but is quite arbitrarily established by the author, and\ntherefore can not produce on the reader the illusion which represents\nthe essential condition of art.\n\nLear has no necessity or motive for his abdication; also, having lived\nall his life with his daughters, has no reason to believe the words of\nthe two elders and not the truthful statement of the youngest; yet upon\nthis is built the whole tragedy of his position.\n\nSimilarly unnatural is the subordinate action: the relation of\nGloucester to his sons. The positions of Gloucester and Edgar flow from\nthe circumstance that Gloucester, just like Lear, immediately believes\nthe coarsest untruth and does not even endeavor to inquire of his\ninjured son whether what he is accused of be true, but at once curses\nand banishes him. The fact that Lear\'s relations with his daughters are\nthe same as those of Gloucester to his sons makes one feel yet more\nstrongly that in both cases the relations are quite arbitrary, and do\nnot flow from the characters nor the natural course of events. Equally\nunnatural, and obviously invented, is the fact that all through the\ntragedy Lear does not recognize his old courtier, Kent, and therefore\nthe relations between Lear and Kent fail to excite the sympathy of the\nreader or spectator. The same, in a yet greater degree, holds true of\nthe position of Edgar, who, unrecognized by any one, leads his blind\nfather and persuades him that he has leapt off a cliff, when in reality\nGloucester jumps on level ground.\n\nThese positions, into which the characters are placed quite arbitrarily,\nare so unnatural that the reader or spectator is unable not only to\nsympathize with their sufferings but even to be interested in what he\nreads or sees. This in the first place.\n\nSecondly, in this, as in the other dramas of Shakespeare, all the\ncharacters live, think, speak, and act quite unconformably with the\ngiven time and place. The action of "King Lear" takes place 800 years\nB.C., and yet the characters are placed in conditions possible only in\nthe Middle Ages: participating in the drama are kings, dukes, armies,\nand illegitimate children, and gentlemen, courtiers, doctors, farmers,\nofficers, soldiers, and knights with vizors, etc. It is possible that\nsuch anachronisms (with which Shakespeare\'s dramas abound) did not\ninjure the possibility of illusion in the sixteenth century and the\nbeginning of the seventeenth, but in our time it is no longer possible\nto follow with interest the development of events which one knows could\nnot take place in the conditions which the author describes in detail.\nThe artificiality of the positions, not flowing from the natural course\nof events, or from the nature of the characters, and their want of\nconformity with time and space, is further increased by those coarse\nembellishments which are continually added by Shakespeare and intended\nto appear particularly touching. The extraordinary storm during which\nKing Lear roams about the heath, or the grass which for some reason he\nputs on his head--like Ophelia in "Hamlet"--or Edgar\'s attire, or the\nfool\'s speeches, or the appearance of the helmeted horseman, Edgar--all\nthese effects not only fail to enhance the impression, but produce an\nopposite effect. "Man sieht die Absicht und man wird verstimmt," as\nGoethe says. It often happens that even during these obviously\nintentional efforts after effect, as, for instance, the dragging out by\nthe legs of half a dozen corpses, with which all Shakespeare\'s tragedies\nterminate, instead of feeling fear and pity, one is tempted rather to\nlaugh.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nBut it is not enough that Shakespeare\'s characters are placed in tragic\npositions which are impossible, do not flow from the course of events,\nare inappropriate to time and space--these personages, besides this, act\nin a way which is out of keeping with their definite character, and is\nquite arbitrary. It is generally asserted that in Shakespeare\'s dramas\nthe characters are specially well expressed, that, notwithstanding their\nvividness, they are many-sided, like those of living people; that, while\nexhibiting the characteristics of a given individual, they at the same\ntime wear the features of man in general; it is usual to say that the\ndelineation of character in Shakespeare is the height of perfection.\n\nThis is asserted with such confidence and repeated by all as\nindisputable truth; but however much I endeavored to find confirmation\nof this in Shakespeare\'s dramas, I always found the opposite. In\nreading any of Shakespeare\'s dramas whatever, I was, from the very\nfirst, instantly convinced that he was lacking in the most important, if\nnot the only, means of portraying characters: individuality of language,\n_i.e._, the style of speech of every person being natural to his\ncharacter. This is absent from Shakespeare. All his characters speak,\nnot their own, but always one and the same Shakespearian, pretentious,\nand unnatural language, in which not only they could not speak, but in\nwhich no living man ever has spoken or does speak.\n\nNo living men could or can say, as Lear says, that he would divorce his\nwife in the grave should Regan not receive him, or that the heavens\nwould crack with shouting, or that the winds would burst, or that the\nwind wishes to blow the land into the sea, or that the curled waters\nwish to flood the shore, as the gentleman describes the storm, or that\nit is easier to bear one\'s grief and the soul leaps over many sufferings\nwhen grief finds fellowship, or that Lear has become childless while I\nam fatherless, as Edgar says, or use similar unnatural expressions with\nwhich the speeches of all the characters in all Shakespeare\'s dramas\noverflow.\n\nAgain, it is not enough that all the characters speak in a way in which\nno living men ever did or could speak--they all suffer from a common\nintemperance of language. Those who are in love, who are preparing for\ndeath, who are fighting, who are dying, all alike speak much and\nunexpectedly about subjects utterly inappropriate to the occasion, being\nevidently guided rather by consonances and play of words than by\nthoughts. They speak all alike. Lear raves exactly as does Edgar when\nfeigning madness. Both Kent and the fool speak alike. The words of one\nof the personages might be placed in the mouth of another, and by the\ncharacter of the speech it would be impossible to distinguish who\nspeaks. If there is a difference in the speech of Shakespeare\'s various\ncharacters, it lies merely in the different dialogs which are pronounced\nfor these characters--again by Shakespeare and not by themselves. Thus\nShakespeare always speaks for kings in one and the same inflated, empty\nlanguage. Also in one and the same Shakespearian, artificially\nsentimental language speak all the women who are intended to be poetic:\nJuliet, Desdemona, Cordelia, Imogen, Marina. In the same way, also, it\nis Shakespeare alone who speaks for his villains: Richard, Edmund, Iago,\nMacbeth, expressing for them those vicious feelings which villains never\nexpress. Yet more similar are the speeches of the madmen with their\nhorrible words, and those of fools with their mirthless puns. So that in\nShakespeare there is no language of living individuals--that language\nwhich in the drama is the chief means of setting forth character. If\ngesticulation be also a means of expressing character, as in ballets,\nthis is only a secondary means. Moreover, if the characters speak at\nrandom and in a random way, and all in one and the same diction, as is\nthe case in Shakespeare\'s work, then even the action of gesticulation is\nwasted. Therefore, whatever the blind panegyrists of Shakespeare may\nsay, in Shakespeare there is no expression of character. Those\npersonages who, in his dramas, stand out as characters, are characters\nborrowed by him from former works which have served as the foundation of\nhis dramas, and they are mostly depicted, not by the dramatic method\nwhich consists in making each person speak with his own diction, but in\nthe epic method of one person describing the features of another.\n\nThe perfection with which Shakespeare expresses character is asserted\nchiefly on the ground of the characters of Lear, Cordelia, Othello,\nDesdemona, Falstaff, and Hamlet. But all these characters, as well as\nall the others, instead of belonging to Shakespeare, are taken by him\nfrom dramas, chronicles, and romances anterior to him. All these\ncharacters not only are not rendered more powerful by him, but, in most\ncases, they are weakened and spoilt. This is very striking in this drama\nof "King Lear," which we are examining, taken by him from the drama\n"King Leir," by an unknown author. The characters of this drama, that of\nKing Lear, and especially of Cordelia, not only were not created by\nShakespeare, but have been strikingly weakened and deprived of force by\nhim, as compared with their appearance in the older drama.\n\nIn the older drama, Leir abdicates because, having become a widower, he\nthinks only of saving his soul. He asks his daughters as to their love\nfor him--that, by means of a certain device he has invented, he may\nretain his favorite daughter on his island. The elder daughters are\nbetrothed, while the youngest does not wish to contract a loveless union\nwith any of the neighboring suitors whom Leir proposes to her, and he is\nafraid that she may marry some distant potentate.\n\nThe device which he has invented, as he informs his courtier, Perillus\n(Shakespeare\'s Kent), is this, that when Cordelia tells him that she\nloves him more than any one or as much as her elder sisters do, he will\ntell her that she must, in proof of her love, marry the prince he will\nindicate on his island. All these motives for Lear\'s conduct are absent\nin Shakespeare\'s play. Then, when, according to the old drama, Leir asks\nhis daughters about their love for him, Cordelia does not say, as\nShakespeare has it, that she will not give her father all her love, but\nwill love her husband, too, should she marry--which is quite\nunnatural--but simply says that she can not express her love in words,\nbut hopes that her actions will prove it. Goneril and Regan remark that\nCordelia\'s answer is not an answer, and that the father can not meekly\naccept such indifference, so that what is wanting in\nShakespeare--_i.e._, the explanation of Lear\'s anger which caused him to\ndisinherit his youngest daughter,--exists in the old drama. Leir is\nannoyed by the failure of his scheme, and the poisonous words of his\neldest daughters irritate him still more. After the division of the\nkingdom between the elder daughters, there follows in the older drama a\nscene between Cordelia and the King of Gaul, setting forth, instead of\nthe colorless Cordelia of Shakespeare, a very definite and attractive\ncharacter of the truthful, tender, and self-sacrificing youngest\ndaughter. While Cordelia, without grieving that she has been deprived of\na portion of the heritage, sits sorrowing at having lost her father\'s\nlove, and looking forward to earn her bread by her labor, there comes\nthe King of Gaul, who, in the disguise of a pilgrim, desires to choose a\nbride from among Leir\'s daughters. He asks Cordelia why she is sad. She\ntells him the cause of her grief. The King of Gaul, still in the guise\nof a pilgrim, falls in love with her, and offers to arrange a marriage\nfor her with the King of Gaul, but she says she will marry only a man\nwhom she loves. Then the pilgrim, still disguised, offers her his hand\nand heart and Cordelia confesses she loves the pilgrim and consents to\nmarry him, notwithstanding the poverty that awaits her. Then the pilgrim\ndiscloses to her that he it is who is the King of Gaul, and Cordelia\nmarries him. Instead of this scene, Lear, according to Shakespeare,\noffers Cordelia\'s two suitors to take her without dowry, and one\ncynically refuses, while the other, one does not know why, accepts her.\nAfter this, in the old drama, as in Shakespeare\'s, Leir undergoes the\ninsults of Goneril, into whose house he has removed, but he bears these\ninsults in a very different way from that represented by Shakespeare: he\nfeels that by his conduct toward Cordelia, he has deserved this, and\nhumbly submits. As in Shakespeare\'s drama, so also in the older drama,\nthe courtiers, Perillus--Kent--who had interceded for Cordelia and was\ntherefore banished--comes to Leir and assures him of his love, but under\nno disguise, but simply as a faithful old servant who does not abandon\nhis king in a moment of need. Leir tells him what, according to\nShakespeare, he tells Cordelia in the last scene, that, if the daughters\nwhom he has benefited hate him, a retainer to whom he has done no good\ncan not love him. But Perillus--Kent--assures the King of his love\ntoward him, and Leir, pacified, goes on to Regan. In the older drama\nthere are no tempests nor tearing out of gray hairs, but there is the\nweakened and humbled old man, Leir, overpowered with grief, and banished\nby his other daughter also, who even wishes to kill him. Turned out by\nhis elder daughters, Leir, according to the older drama, as a last\nresource, goes with Perillus to Cordelia. Instead of the unnatural\nbanishment of Lear during the tempest, and his roaming about the heath,\nLeir, with Perillus, in the older drama, during their journey to France,\nvery naturally reach the last degree of destitution, sell their clothes\nin order to pay for their crossing over the sea, and, in the attire of\nfishermen, exhausted by cold and hunger, approach Cordelia\'s house.\nHere, again, instead of the unnatural combined ravings of the fool,\nLear, and Edgar, as represented by Shakespeare, there follows in the\nolder drama a natural scene of reunion between the daughter and the\nfather. Cordelia--who, notwithstanding her happiness, has all the time\nbeen grieving about her father and praying to God to forgive her sisters\nwho had done him so much wrong--meets her father in his extreme want,\nand wishes immediately to disclose herself to him, but her husband\nadvises her not to do this, in order not to agitate her weak father. She\naccepts the counsel and takes Leir into her house without disclosing\nherself to him, and nurses him. Leir gradually revives, and then the\ndaughter asks him who he is and how he lived formerly:\n\n    "If from the first," says Leir, "I should relate the cause,\n     I would make a heart of adamant to weep.\n     And thou, poor soul, kind-hearted as thou art,\n     Dost weep already, ere I do begin."\n\n    Cordelia: "For God\'s love tell it, and when you have done\n     I\'ll tell the reason why I weep so soon."\n\nAnd Leir relates all he has suffered from his elder daughters, and says\nthat now he wishes to find shelter with the child who would be in the\nright even were she to condemn him to death. "If, however," he says,\n"she will receive me with love, it will be God\'s and her work, but not\nmy merit." To this Cordelia says: "Oh, I know for certain that thy\ndaughter will lovingly receive thee."--"How canst thou know this without\nknowing her?" says Leir. "I know," says Cordelia, "because not far from\nhere, I had a father who acted toward me as badly as thou hast acted\ntoward her, yet, if I were only to see his white head, I would creep to\nmeet him on my knees."--"No, this can not be," says Leir, "for there are\nno children in the world so cruel as mine."--"Do not condemn all for the\nsins of some," says Cordelia, and falls on her knees. "Look here, dear\nfather," she says, "look on me: I am thy loving daughter." The father\nrecognizes her and says: "It is not for thee, but for me, to beg thy\npardon on my knees for all my sins toward thee."\n\nIs there anything approaching this exquisite scene in Shakespeare\'s\ndrama?\n\nHowever strange this opinion may seem to worshipers of Shakespeare, yet\nthe whole of this old drama is incomparably and in every respect\nsuperior to Shakespeare\'s adaptation. It is so, first, because it has\nnot got the utterly superfluous characters of the villain Edmund and\nunlifelike Gloucester and Edgar, who only distract one\'s attention;\nsecondly because it has not got the completely false "effects" of Lear\nrunning about the heath, his conversations with the fool, and all these\nimpossible disguises, failures to recognize, and accumulated deaths;\nand, above all, because in this drama there is the simple, natural, and\ndeeply touching character of Leir and the yet more touching and clearly\ndefined character of Cordelia, both absent in Shakespeare. Therefore,\nthere is in the older drama, instead of Shakespeare\'s long-drawn scene\nof Lear\'s interview with Cordelia and of Cordelia\'s unnecessary murder,\nthe exquisite scene of the interview between Leir and Cordelia,\nunequaled by any in all Shakespeare\'s dramas.\n\nThe old drama also terminates more naturally and more in accordance with\nthe moral demands of the spectator than does Shakespeare\'s, namely, by\nthe King of the Gauls conquering the husbands of the elder sisters, and\nCordelia, instead of being killed, restoring Leir to his former\nposition.\n\nThus it is in the drama we are examining, which Shakespeare has borrowed\nfrom the drama "King Leir." So it is also with Othello, taken from an\nItalian romance, the same also with the famous Hamlet. The same with\nAntony, Brutus, Cleopatra, Shylock, Richard, and all Shakespeare\'s\ncharacters, all taken from some antecedent work. Shakespeare, while\nprofiting by characters already given in preceding dramas, or romances,\nchronicles, or, Plutarch\'s "Lives," not only fails to render them more\ntruthful and vivid, as his eulogists affirm, but, on the contrary,\nalways weakens them and often completely destroys them, as with Lear,\ncompelling his characters to commit actions unnatural to them, and,\nabove all, to utter speeches natural neither to them nor to any one\nwhatever. Thus, in "Othello," altho that is, perhaps, I will not say the\nbest, but the least bad and the least encumbered by pompous volubility,\nthe characters of Othello, Iago, Cassio, Emilia, according to\nShakespeare, are much less natural and lifelike than in the Italian\nromance. Shakespeare\'s Othello suffers from epilepsy, of which he has an\nattack on the stage; moreover, in Shakespeare\'s version, Desdemona\'s\nmurder is preceded by the strange vow of the kneeling Othello. Othello,\naccording to Shakespeare, is a negro and not a Moor. All this is\nerratic, inflated, unnatural, and violates the unity of the character.\nAll this is absent in the romance. In that romance the reasons for\nOthello\'s jealousy are represented more naturally than in Shakespeare.\nIn the romance, Cassio, knowing whose the handkerchief is, goes to\nDesdemona to return it, but, approaching the back-door of Desdemona\'s\nhouse, sees Othello and flies from him. Othello perceives the escaping\nCassio, and this, more than anything, confirms his suspicions.\nShakespeare has not got this, and yet this casual incident explains\nOthello\'s jealousy more than anything else. With Shakespeare, this\njealousy is founded entirely on Iago\'s persistent, successful\nmachinations and treacherous words, which Othello blindly believes.\nOthello\'s monolog over the sleeping Desdemona, about his desiring her\nwhen killed to look as she is alive, about his going to love her even\ndead, and now wishing to smell her "balmy breath," etc., is utterly\nimpossible. A man who is preparing for the murder of a beloved being,\ndoes not utter such phrases, still less after committing the murder\nwould he speak about the necessity of an eclipse of sun and moon, and of\nthe globe yawning; nor can he, negro tho he may be, address devils,\ninviting them to burn him in hot sulphur and so forth. Lastly, however\neffective may be the suicide, absent in the romance, it completely\ndestroys the conception of his clearly defined character. If he indeed\nsuffered from grief and remorse, he would not, intending to kill\nhimself, pronounce phrases about his own services, about the pearl, and\nabout his eyes dropping tears "_as fast as the Arabian trees their\nmedicinal gum_"; and yet less about the Turk\'s beating an Italian and\nhow he, Othello, smote him--_thus!_ So that notwithstanding the powerful\nexpression of emotion in Othello when, under the influence of Iago\'s\nhints, jealousy rises in him, and again in his scenes with Desdemona,\none\'s conception of Othello\'s character is constantly infringed by his\nfalse pathos and the unnatural speeches he pronounces.\n\nSo it is with the chief character, Othello, but notwithstanding its\nalteration and the disadvantageous features which it is made thereby to\npresent in comparison with the character from which it was taken in the\nromance, this character still remains a character, but all the other\npersonages are completely spoiled by Shakespeare.\n\nIago, according to Shakespeare, is an unmitigated villain, deceiver, and\nthief, a robber who robs Roderigo and always succeeds even in his most\nimpossible designs, and therefore is a person quite apart from real\nlife. In Shakespeare, the motive of his villainy is, first, that Othello\ndid not give him the post he desired; secondly, that he suspects Othello\nof an intrigue with his wife and, thirdly, that, as he says, he feels a\nstrange kind of love for Desdemona. There are many motives, but they are\nall vague. Whereas in the romance there is but one simple and clear\nmotive, Iago\'s passionate love for Desdemona, transmitted into hatred\ntoward her and Othello after she had preferred the Moor to him and\nresolutely repulsed him. Yet more unnatural is the utterly unnecessary\nRoderigo whom Iago deceives and robs, promising him Desdemona\'s love,\nand whom he forces to fulfil all he commands: to intoxicate Cassio,\nprovoke and then kill Cassio. Emilia, who says anything it may occur to\nthe author to put into her mouth, has not even the slightest semblance\nof a live character.\n\n"But Falstaff, the wonderful Falstaff," Shakespeare\'s eulogists will\nsay, "of him, at all events, one can not say that he is not a living\ncharacter, or that, having been taken from the comedy of an unknown\nauthor, it has been weakened."\n\nFalstaff, like all Shakespeare\'s characters, was taken from a drama or\ncomedy by an unknown author, written on a really living person, Sir John\nOldcastle, who had been the friend of some duke. This Oldcastle had once\nbeen convicted of heresy, but had been saved by his friend the duke. But\nafterward he was condemned and burned at the stake for his religious\nbeliefs, which did not conform with Catholicism. It was on this same\nOldcastle that an anonymous author, in order to please the Catholic\npublic, wrote a comedy or drama, ridiculing this martyr for his faith\nand representing him as a good-for-nothing man, the boon companion of\nthe duke, and it is from this comedy that Shakespeare borrowed, not\nonly the character of Falstaff, but also his own ironical attitude\ntoward it. In Shakespeare\'s first works, when this character appeared,\nit was frankly called "Oldcastle," but later, in Elizabeth\'s time, when\nProtestantism again triumphed, it was awkward to bring out with mockery\na martyr in the strife with Catholicism, and, besides, Oldcastle\'s\nrelatives had protested, and Shakespeare accordingly altered the name of\nOldcastle to that of Falstaff, also a historical figure, known for\nhaving fled from the field of battle at Agincourt.\n\nFalstaff is, indeed, quite a natural and typical character; but then it\nis perhaps the only natural and typical character depicted by\nShakespeare. And this character is natural and typical because, of all\nShakespeare\'s characters, it alone speaks a language proper to itself.\nAnd it speaks thus because it speaks in that same Shakespearian\nlanguage, full of mirthless jokes and unamusing puns which, being\nunnatural to all Shakespeare\'s other characters, is quite in harmony\nwith the boastful, distorted, and depraved character of the drunken\nFalstaff. For this reason alone does this figure truly represent a\ndefinite character. Unfortunately, the artistic effect of this character\nis spoilt by the fact that it is so repulsive by its gluttony,\ndrunkenness, debauchery, rascality, deceit, and cowardice, that it is\ndifficult to share the feeling of gay humor with which the author treats\nit. Thus it is with Falstaff.\n\nBut in none of Shakespeare\'s figures is his, I will not say incapacity\nto give, but utter indifference to giving, his personages a typical\ncharacter so strikingly manifest as in Hamlet; and in connection with\nnone of Shakespeare\'s works do we see so strikingly displayed that blind\nworship of Shakespeare, that unreasoning state of hypnotism owing to\nwhich the mere thought even is not admitted that any of Shakespeare\'s\nproductions can be wanting in genius, or that any of the principal\npersonages in his dramas can fail to be the expression of a new and\ndeeply conceived character.\n\nShakespeare takes an old story, not bad in its way, relating:\n\n"Avec quelle ruse Amlette qui depuis fut Roy de Dannemarch, vengea la\nmort de son pere Horwendille, occis par Fengon son frere, et autre\noccurrence de son histoire," or a drama which was written on this theme\nfifteen years before him. On this subject he writes his own drama,\nintroducing quite inappropriately (as indeed he always does) into the\nmouth of the principal person all those thoughts of his own which\nappeared to him worthy of attention. And putting into the mouth of his\nhero these thoughts: about life (the grave-digger), about death (To be\nor not to be)--the same which are expressed in his sixty-sixth\nsonnet--about the theater, about women. He is utterly unconcerned as to\nthe circumstances under which these words are said, and it naturally\nturns out that the person expressing all these thoughts is a mere\nphonograph of Shakespeare, without character, whose actions and words do\nnot agree.\n\nIn the old legend, Hamlet\'s personality is quite comprehensible: he is\nindignant at his mother\'s and his uncle\'s deeds, and wishes to revenge\nhimself upon them, but is afraid his uncle may kill him as he had killed\nhis father. Therefore he simulates insanity, desiring to bide his time\nand observe all that goes on in the palace. Meanwhile, his uncle and\nmother, being afraid of him, wish to test whether he is feigning or is\nreally mad, and send to him a girl whom he loves. He persists, then sees\nhis mother in private, kills a courtier who was eavesdropping, and\nconvicts his mother of her sin. Afterward he is sent to England, but\nintercepts letters and, returning from England, takes revenge of his\nenemies, burning them all.\n\nAll this is comprehensible and flows from Hamlet\'s character and\nposition. But Shakespeare, putting into Hamlet\'s mouth speeches which he\nhimself wishes to express, and making him commit actions which are\nnecessary to the author in order to produce scenic effects, destroys all\nthat constitutes the character of Hamlet and of the legend. During the\nwhole of the drama, Hamlet is doing, not what he would really wish to\ndo, but what is necessary for the author\'s plan. One moment he is\nawe-struck at his father\'s ghost, another moment he begins to chaff it,\ncalling it "old mole"; one moment he loves Ophelia, another moment he\nteases her, and so forth. There is no possibility of finding any\nexplanation whatever of Hamlet\'s actions or words, and therefore no\npossibility of attributing any character to him.\n\nBut as it is recognized that Shakespeare the genius can not write\nanything bad, therefore learned people use all the powers of their minds\nto find extraordinary beauties in what is an obvious and crying failure,\ndemonstrated with especial vividness in "Hamlet," where the principal\nfigure has no character whatever. And lo! profound critics declare that\nin this drama, in the person of Hamlet, is expressed singularly\npowerful, perfectly novel, and deep personality, existing in this person\nhaving no character; and that precisely in this absence of character\nconsists the genius of creating a deeply conceived character. Having\ndecided this, learned critics write volumes upon volumes, so that the\npraise and explanation of the greatness and importance of the\nrepresentation of the character of a man who has no character form in\nvolume a library. It is true that some of the critics timidly express\nthe idea that there is something strange in this figure, that Hamlet is\nan unsolved riddle, but no one has the courage to say (as in Hans\nAndersen\'s story) that the King is naked--_i.e._, that it is as clear as\nday that Shakespeare did not succeed and did not even wish to give any\ncharacter to Hamlet, did not even understand that this was necessary.\nAnd learned critics continue to investigate and extol this puzzling\nproduction, which reminds one of the famous stone with an inscription\nwhich Pickwick found near a cottage doorstep, and which divided the\nscientific world into two hostile camps.\n\nSo that neither do the characters of Lear nor Othello nor Falstaff nor\nyet Hamlet in any way confirm the existing opinion that Shakespeare\'s\npower consists in the delineation of character.\n\nIf in Shakespeare\'s dramas one does meet figures having certain\ncharacteristic features, for the most part secondary figures, such as\nPolonius in "Hamlet" and Portia in "The Merchant of Venice," these few\nlifelike characters among five hundred or more other secondary figures,\nwith the complete absence of character in the principal figures, do not\nat all prove that the merit of Shakespeare\'s dramas consists in the\nexpression of character.\n\nThat a great talent for depicting character is attributed to Shakespeare\narises from his actually possessing a peculiarity which, for superficial\nobservers and in the play of good actors, may appear to be the capacity\nof depicting character. This peculiarity consists in the capacity of\nrepresentative scenes expressing the play of emotion. However unnatural\nthe positions may be in which he places his characters, however improper\nto them the language which he makes them speak, however featureless they\nare, the very play of emotion, its increase, and alteration, and the\ncombination of many contrary feelings, as expressed correctly and\npowerfully in some of Shakespeare\'s scenes, and in the play of good\nactors, evokes even, if only for a time, sympathy with the persons\nrepresented. Shakespeare, himself an actor, and an intelligent man, knew\nhow to express by the means not only of speech, but of exclamation,\ngesture, and the repetition of words, states of mind and developments or\nchanges of feeling taking place in the persons represented. So that, in\nmany instances, Shakespeare\'s characters, instead of speaking, merely\nmake an exclamation, or weep, or in the middle of a monolog, by means of\ngestures, demonstrate the pain of their position (just as Lear asks some\none to unbutton him), or, in moments of great agitation, repeat a\nquestion several times, or several times demand the repetition of a word\nwhich has particularly struck them, as do Othello, Macduff, Cleopatra,\nand others. Such clever methods of expressing the development of\nfeeling, giving good actors the possibility of demonstrating their\npowers, were, and are, often mistaken by many critics for the expression\nof character. But however strongly the play of feeling may be expressed\nin one scene, a single scene can not give the character of a figure when\nthis figure, after a correct exclamation or gesture, begins in a\nlanguage not its own, at the author\'s arbitrary will, to volubly utter\nwords which are neither necessary nor in harmony with its character.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n"Well, but the profound utterances and sayings expressed by\nShakespeare\'s characters," Shakespeare\'s panegyrists will retort. "See\nLear\'s monolog on punishment, Kent\'s speech about vengeance, or Edgar\'s\nabout his former life, Gloucester\'s reflections on the instability of\nfortune, and, in other dramas, the famous monologs of Hamlet, Antony,\nand others."\n\nThoughts and sayings may be appreciated, I will answer, in a prose work,\nin an essay, a collection of aphorisms, but not in an artistic dramatic\nproduction, the object of which is to elicit sympathy with that which is\nrepresented. Therefore the monologs and sayings of Shakespeare, even did\nthey contain very many deep and new thoughts, which they do not, do not\nconstitute the merits of an artistic, poetic production. On the\ncontrary, these speeches, expressed in unnatural conditions, can only\nspoil artistic works.\n\nAn artistic, poetic work, particularly a drama, must first of all excite\nin the reader or spectator the illusion that whatever the person\nrepresented is living through, or experiencing, is lived through or\nexperienced by himself. For this purpose it is as important for the\ndramatist to know precisely what he should make his characters both do\nand say as what he should not make them say and do, so as not to destroy\nthe illusion of the reader or spectator. Speeches, however eloquent and\nprofound they may be, when put into the mouth of dramatic characters, if\nthey be superfluous or unnatural to the position and character, destroy\nthe chief condition of dramatic art--the illusion, owing to which the\nreader or spectator lives in the feelings of the persons represented.\nWithout putting an end to the illusion, one may leave much unsaid--the\nreader or spectator will himself fill this up, and sometimes, owing to\nthis, his illusion is even increased, but to say what is superfluous is\nthe same as to overthrow a statue composed of separate pieces and\nthereby scatter them, or to take away the lamp from a magic lantern: the\nattention of the reader or spectator is distracted, the reader sees the\nauthor, the spectator sees the actor, the illusion disappears, and to\nrestore it is sometimes impossible; therefore without the feeling of\nmeasure there can not be an artist, and especially a dramatist.\n\nShakespeare is devoid of this feeling. His characters continually do and\nsay what is not only unnatural to them, but utterly unnecessary. I do\nnot cite examples of this, because I believe that he who does not\nhimself see this striking deficiency in all Shakespeare\'s dramas will\nnot be persuaded by any examples and proofs. It is sufficient to read\n"King Lear," alone, with its insanity, murders, plucking out of eyes,\nGloucester\'s jump, its poisonings, and wranglings--not to mention\n"Pericles," "Cymbeline," "The Winter\'s Tale," "The Tempest"--to be\nconvinced of this. Only a man devoid of the sense of measure and of\ntaste could produce such types as "Titus Andronicus" or "Troilus and\nCressida," or so mercilessly mutilate the old drama "King Leir."\n\nGervinus endeavors to prove that Shakespeare possessed the feeling of\nbeauty, "Schoenheit\'s sinn," but all Gervinus\'s proofs prove only that he\nhimself, Gervinus, is completely destitute of it. In Shakespeare\neverything is exaggerated: the actions are exaggerated, so are their\nconsequences, the speeches of the characters are exaggerated, and\ntherefore at every step the possibility of artistic impression is\ninterfered with. Whatever people may say, however they may be enraptured\nby Shakespeare\'s works, whatever merits they may attribute to them, it\nis perfectly certain that he was not an artist and that his works are\nnot artistic productions. Without the sense of measure, there never was\nnor can be an artist, as without the feeling of rhythm there can not be\na musician. Shakespeare might have been whatever you like, but he was\nnot an artist.\n\n"But one should not forget the time at which Shakespeare wrote," say his\nadmirers. "It was a time of cruel and coarse habits, a time of the then\nfashionable euphemism, _i.e._, artificial way of expressing oneself--a\ntime of forms of life strange to us, and therefore, to judge about\nShakespeare, one should have in view the time when he wrote. In Homer,\nas in Shakespeare, there is much which is strange to us, but this does\nnot prevent us from appreciating the beauties of Homer," say these\nadmirers. But in comparing Shakespeare with Homer, as does Gervinus,\nthat infinite distance which separates true poetry from its semblance\nmanifests itself with especial force. However distant Homer is from us,\nwe can, without the slightest effort, transport ourselves into the life\nhe describes, and we can thus transport ourselves because, however alien\nto us may be the events Homer describes, he believes in what he says and\nspeaks seriously, and therefore he never exaggerates, and the sense of\nmeasure never abandons him. This is the reason why, not to speak of the\nwonderfully distinct, lifelike, and beautiful characters of Achilles,\nHector, Priam, Odysseus, and the eternally touching scenes of Hector\'s\nleave-taking, of Priam\'s embassy, of Odysseus\'s return, and others--the\nwhole of the "Iliad" and still more the "Odyssey" are so humanly near to\nus that we feel as if we ourselves had lived, and are living, among its\ngods and heroes. Not so with Shakespeare. From his first words,\nexaggeration is seen: the exaggeration of events, the exaggeration of\nemotion, and the exaggeration of effects. One sees at once that he does\nnot believe in what he says, that it is of no necessity to him, that he\ninvents the events he describes, and is indifferent to his\ncharacters--that he has conceived them only for the stage and therefore\nmakes them do and say only what may strike his public; and therefore we\ndo not believe either in the events, or in the actions, or in the\nsufferings of the characters. Nothing demonstrates so clearly the\ncomplete absence of esthetic feeling in Shakespeare as comparison\nbetween him and Homer. The works which we call the works of Homer are\nartistic, poetic, original works, lived through by the author or\nauthors; whereas the works of Shakespeare--borrowed as they are, and,\nexternally, like mosaics, artificially fitted together piecemeal from\nbits invented for the occasion--have nothing whatever in common with art\nand poetry.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nBut, perhaps, the height of Shakespeare\'s conception of life is such\nthat, tho he does not satisfy the esthetic demands, he discloses to us a\nview of life so new and important for men that, in consideration of its\nimportance, all his failures as an artist become imperceptible. So,\nindeed, say Shakespeare\'s admirers. Gervinus says distinctly that\nbesides Shakespeare\'s significance in the sphere of dramatic poetry in\nwhich, according to his opinion, Shakespeare equals "Homer in the sphere\nof Epos, Shakespeare being the very greatest judge of the human soul,\nrepresents a teacher of most indisputable ethical authority and the most\nselect leader in the world and in life."\n\nIn what, then, consists this indisputable authority of the most select\nleader in the world and in life? Gervinus devotes the concluding chapter\nof his second volume, about fifty pages, to an explanation of this.\n\nThe ethical authority of this supreme teacher of life consists in the\nfollowing: The starting point of Shakespeare\'s conception of life, says\nGervinus, is that man is gifted with powers of activity, and therefore,\nfirst of all, according to Gervinus, Shakespeare regarded it as good and\nnecessary for man that he should act (as if it were possible for a man\nnot to act):\n\n"Die thatkraeftigen Maenner, Fortinbras, Bolingbroke, Alcibiades, Octavius\nspielen hier die gegensaetzlichen Rollen gegen die verschiedenen\nthatlosen; nicht ihre Charaktere verdienen ihnen Allen ihr Glueck und\nGedeihen etwa durch eine grosse Ueberlegenheit ihrer Natur, sondern\ntrotz ihrer geringeren Anlage stellt sich ihre Thatkraft an sich ueber\ndie Unthaetigkeit der Anderen hinaus, gleichviel aus wie schoener Quelle\ndiese Passivitaet, aus wie schlechter jene Thaetigkeit fliesse."\n\n_I.e._, active people, like Fortinbras, Bolingbroke, Alcibiades,\nOctavius, says Gervinus, are placed in contrast, by Shakespeare, with\nvarious characters who do not exhibit energetic activity. And happiness\nand success, according to Shakespeare, are attained by individuals\npossessing this active character, not at all owing to the superiority\nof their nature; on the contrary, notwithstanding their inferior gifts,\nthe capacity of activity itself always gives them the advantage over\ninactivity, quite independent of any consideration whether the\ninactivity of some persons flows from excellent impulses and the\nactivity of others from bad ones. "Activity is good, inactivity is evil.\nActivity transforms evil into good," says Shakespeare, according to\nGervinus. Shakespeare prefers the principle of Alexander (of Macedonia)\nto that of Diogenes, says Gervinus. In other words, he prefers death and\nmurder due to ambition, to abstinence and wisdom.\n\nAccording to Gervinus, Shakespeare believes that humanity need not set\nup ideals, but that only healthy activity and the golden mean are\nnecessary in everything. Indeed, Shakespeare is so penetrated by this\nconviction that, according to Gervinus\'s assertion, he allows himself to\ndeny even Christian morality, which makes exaggerated demands on human\nnature. Shakespeare, as we read, did not approve of limits of duty\nexceeding the intentions of nature. He teaches the golden mean between\nheathen hatred to one\'s enemies and Christian love toward them (pp.\n561, 562). How far Shakespeare was penetrated with this fundamental\nprinciple of _reasonable moderation_, says Gervinus, can be seen from\nthe fact that he has the courage to express himself even against the\nChristian rules which prompt human nature to the excessive exertion of\nits powers. He did not admit that the limits of duties should exceed the\nbiddings of Nature. Therefore he preached a reasonable mean natural to\nman, between Christian and heathen precepts, of love toward one\'s\nenemies on the one hand, and hatred toward them on the other.\n\nThat one may do too much good (exceed the reasonable limits of good) is\nconvincingly proved by Shakespeare\'s words and examples. Thus excessive\ngenerosity ruins Timon, while Antonio\'s moderate generosity confers\nhonor; normal ambition makes Henry V. great, whereas it ruins Percy, in\nwhom it has risen too high; excessive virtue leads Angelo to\ndestruction, and if, in those who surround him, excessive severity\nbecomes harmful and can not prevent crime, on the other hand the divine\nelement in man, even charity, if it be excessive, can create crime.\n\nShakespeare taught, says Gervinus, that one _may be too good_.\n\nHe teaches that morality, like politics, is a matter in which, owing to\nthe complexity of circumstances and motives, one can not establish any\nprinciples (p. 563), and in this he agrees with Bacon and\nAristotle--there are no positive religious and moral laws which may\ncreate principles for correct moral conduct suitable for all cases.\n\nGervinus most clearly expresses the whole of Shakespeare\'s moral theory\nby saying that Shakespeare does not write for those classes for whom\ndefinite religious principles and laws are suitable (_i.e._, for nine\nhundred and ninety-nine one-thousandths of men) but for the educated:\n\n"There are classes of men whose morality is best guarded by the positive\nprecepts of religion and state law; to such persons Shakespeare\'s\ncreations are inaccessible. They are comprehensible and accessible only\nto the educated, from whom one can expect that they should acquire the\nhealthy tact of life and self-consciousness by means of which the innate\nguiding powers of conscience and reason, uniting with the will, lead us\nto the definite attainment of worthy aims in life. But even for such\neducated people, Shakespeare\'s teaching is not always without danger.\nThe condition on which his teaching is quite harmless is that it should\nbe accepted in all its completeness, in all its parts, without any\nomission. Then it is not only without danger, but is the most clear and\nfaultless and therefore the most worthy of confidence of all moral\nteaching" (p. 564).\n\nIn order thus to accept all, one should understand that, according to\nhis teaching, it is stupid and harmful for the individual to revolt\nagainst, or endeavor to overthrow, the limits of established religious\nand state forms. "Shakespeare," says Gervinus, "would abhor an\nindependent and free individual who, with a powerful spirit, should\nstruggle against all convention in politics and morality and overstep\nthat union between religion and the State which has for thousands of\nyears supported society. According to his views, the practical wisdom of\nmen could not have a higher object than the introduction into society of\nthe greatest spontaneity and freedom, but precisely because of this one\nshould safeguard as sacred and irrefragable the natural laws of\nsociety--one should respect the existing order of things and,\ncontinually verifying it, inculcate its rational sides, not overlooking\nnature for the sake of culture, or _vice versa_" (p. 566). Property, the\nfamily, the state, are sacred; but aspiration toward the recognition of\nthe equality of men is insanity. Its realization would bring humanity to\nthe greatest calamities. No one struggled more than Shakespeare against\nthe privileges of rank and position, but could this freethinking man\nresign himself to the privileges of the wealthy and educated being\ndestroyed in order to give room to the poor and ignorant? How could a\nman who so eloquently attracts people toward honors, permit that the\nvery aspiration toward that which was great be crushed together with\nrank and distinction for services, and, with the destruction of all\ndegrees, "the motives for all high undertakings be stifled"? Even if the\nattraction of honors and false power treacherously obtained were to\ncease, could the poet admit of the most dreadful of all violence, that\nof the ignorant crowd? He saw that, thanks to this equality now\npreached, everything may pass into violence, and violence into arbitrary\nacts and thence into unchecked passion which will rend the world as the\nwolf does its prey, and in the end the world will swallow itself up.\nEven if this does not happen with mankind when it attains equality--if\nthe love of nations and eternal peace prove not to be that impossible\n"nothing," as Alonso expressed it in "The Tempest"--but if, on the\ncontrary, the actual attainment of aspirations toward equality is\npossible, then the poet would deem that the old age and extinction of\nthe world had approached, and that, therefore, for active individuals,\nit is not worth while to live (pp. 571, 572).\n\nSuch is Shakespeare\'s view of life as demonstrated by his greatest\nexponent and admirer.\n\nAnother of the most modern admirers of Shakespeare, George Brandes,\nfurther sets forth:[2]\n\n"No one, of course, can conserve his life quite pure from evil, from\ndeceit, and from the injury of others, but evil and deceit are not\nalways vices, and even the evil caused to others, is not necessarily a\nvice: it is often merely a necessity, a legitimate weapon, a right. And\nindeed, Shakespeare always held that there are no unconditional\nprohibitions, nor unconditional duties. For instance, he did not doubt\nHamlet\'s right to kill the King, nor even his right to stab Polonius to\ndeath, and yet he could not restrain himself from an overwhelming\nfeeling of indignation and repulsion when, looking around, he saw\neverywhere how incessantly the most elementary moral laws were being\ninfringed. Now, in his mind there was formed, as it were, a closely\nriveted ring of thoughts concerning which he had always vaguely felt:\nsuch unconditional commandments do not exist; the quality and\nsignificance of an act, not to speak of a character, do not depend upon\ntheir enactment or infringement; the whole substance lies in the\ncontents with which the separate individual, at the moment of his\ndecision and on his own responsibility, fills up the form of these\nlaws."\n\nIn other words, Shakespeare at last clearly saw that the moral of the\n_aim_ is the only true and possible one; so that, according to Brandes,\nShakespeare\'s fundamental principle, for which he extols him, is that\n_the end justifies the means_--action at all costs, the absence of all\nideals, moderation in everything, the conservation of the forms of life\nonce established, and the end justifying the means. If you add to this a\nChauvinist English patriotism, expressed in all the historical dramas, a\npatriotism according to which the English throne is something sacred,\nEnglishmen always vanquishing the French, killing thousands and losing\nonly scores, Joan of Arc regarded as a witch, and the belief that Hector\nand all the Trojans, from whom the English came, are heroes, while the\nGreeks are cowards and traitors, and so forth,--such is the view of life\nof the wisest teacher of life according to his greatest admirers. And he\nwho will attentively read Shakespeare\'s works can not fail to recognize\nthat the description of this Shakespearian view of life by his admirers\nis quite correct.\n\nThe merit of every poetic work depends on three things:\n\n(1) The subject of the work: the deeper the subject, _i.e._, the more\nimportant it is to the life of mankind, the higher is the work.\n\n(2) The external beauty achieved by technical methods proper to the\nparticular kind of art. Thus, in dramatic art, the technical method will\nbe a true individuality of language, corresponding to the characters, a\nnatural, and at the same time touching plot, a correct scenic rendering\nof the demonstration and development of emotion, and the feeling of\nmeasure in all that is represented.\n\n(3) Sincerity, _i.e._, that the author should himself keenly feel what\nhe expresses. Without this condition there can be no work of art, as the\nessence of art consists in the contemplation of the work of art being\ninfected with the author\'s feeling. If the author does not actually feel\nwhat he expresses, then the recipient can not become infected with the\nfeeling of the author, does not experience any feeling, and the\nproduction can no longer be classified as a work of art.\n\nThe subject of Shakespeare\'s pieces, as is seen from the demonstrations\nof his greatest admirers, is the lowest, most vulgar view of life, which\nregards the external elevation of the lords of the world as a genuine\ndistinction, despises the crowd, _i.e._, the working\nclasses--repudiates not only all religious, but also all humanitarian,\nstrivings directed to the betterment of the existing order.\n\nThe second condition also, with the exception of the rendering of the\nscenes in which the movement of feelings is expressed, is quite absent\nin Shakespeare. He does not grasp the natural character of the positions\nof his personages, nor the language of the persons represented, nor the\nfeeling of measure without which no work can be artistic.\n\nThe third and most important condition, sincerity, is completely absent\nin all Shakespeare\'s works. In all of them one sees intentional\nartifice; one sees that he is not _in earnest_, but that he is playing\nwith words.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nShakespeare\'s works do not satisfy the demands of all art, and, besides\nthis, their tendency is of the lowest and most immoral. What then\nsignifies the great fame these works have enjoyed for more than a\nhundred years?\n\nMany times during my life I have had occasion to argue about Shakespeare\nwith his admirers, not only with people little sensitive to poetry, but\nwith those who keenly felt poetic beauty, such as Turgenef, Fet,[3] and\nothers, and every time I encountered one and the same attitude toward my\nobjection to the praises of Shakespeare. I was not refuted when I\npointed out Shakespeare\'s defects; they only condoled with me for my\nwant of comprehension, and urged upon me the necessity of recognizing\nthe extraordinary supernatural grandeur of Shakespeare, and they did not\nexplain to me in what the beauties of Shakespeare consisted, but were\nmerely vaguely and exaggeratedly enraptured with the whole of\nShakespeare, extolling some favorite passages: the unbuttoning of Lear\'s\nbutton, Falstaff\'s lying, Lady Macbeth\'s ineffaceable spots, Hamlet\'s\nexhortation to his father\'s ghost, "forty thousand brothers," etc.\n\n"Open Shakespeare," I used to say to these admirers, "wherever you like,\nor wherever it may chance, you will see that you will never find ten\nconsecutive lines which are comprehensible, unartificial, natural to the\ncharacter that says them, and which produce an artistic impression."\n(This experiment may be made by any one. And either at random, or\naccording to their own choice.) Shakespeare\'s admirers opened pages in\nShakespeare\'s dramas, and without paying any attention to my criticisms\nas to why the selected ten lines did not satisfy the most elementary\ndemands of esthetic and common sense, they were enchanted with the very\nthing which to me appeared absurd, incomprehensible, and inartistic. So\nthat, in general, when I endeavored to get from Shakespeare\'s worshipers\nan explanation of his greatness, I met in them exactly the same\nattitude which I have met, and which is usually met, in the defenders of\nany dogmas accepted not through reason, but through faith. It is this\nattitude of Shakespeare\'s admirers toward their object--an attitude\nwhich may be seen also in all the mistily indefinite essays and\nconversations about Shakespeare--which gave me the key to the\nunderstanding of the cause of Shakespeare\'s fame. There is but one\nexplanation of this wonderful fame: it is one of those epidemic\n"suggestions" to which men constantly have been and are subject. Such\n"suggestion" always has existed and does exist in the most varied\nspheres of life. As glaring instances, considerable in scope and in\ndeceitful influence, one may cite the medieval Crusades which afflicted,\nnot only adults, but even children, and the individual "suggestions,"\nstartling in their senselessness, such as faith in witches, in the\nutility of torture for the discovery of the truth, the search for the\nelixir of life, the philosopher\'s stone, or the passion for tulips\nvalued at several thousand guldens a bulb which took hold of Holland.\nSuch irrational "suggestions" always have been existing, and still\nexist, in all spheres of human life--religious, philosophical,\npolitical, economical, scientific, artistic, and, in general,\nliterary--and people clearly see the insanity of these suggestions only\nwhen they free themselves from them. But, as long as they are under\ntheir influence, the suggestions appear to them so certain, so true,\nthat to argue about them is regarded as neither necessary nor possible.\nWith the development of the printing press, these epidemics became\nespecially striking.\n\nWith the development of the press, it has now come to pass that so soon\nas any event, owing to casual circumstances, receives an especially\nprominent significance, immediately the organs of the press announce\nthis significance. As soon as the press has brought forward the\nsignificance of the event, the public devotes more and more attention to\nit. The attention of the public prompts the press to examine the event\nwith greater attention and in greater detail. The interest of the public\nfurther increases, and the organs of the press, competing with one\nanother, satisfy the public demand. The public is still more\ninterested; the press attributes yet more significance to the event. So\nthat the importance of the event, continually growing, like a lump of\nsnow, receives an appreciation utterly inappropriate to its real\nsignificance, and this appreciation, often exaggerated to insanity, is\nretained so long as the conception of life of the leaders of the press\nand of the public remains the same. There are innumerable examples of\nsuch an inappropriate estimation which, in our time, owing to the mutual\ninfluence of press and public on one another, is attached to the most\ninsignificant subjects. A striking example of such mutual influence of\nthe public and the press was the excitement in the case of Dreyfus,\nwhich lately caught hold of the whole world.\n\nThe suspicion arose that some captain of the French staff was guilty of\ntreason. Whether because this particular captain was a Jew, or because\nof some special internal party disagreements in French society, the\npress attached a somewhat prominent interest to this event, whose like\nis continually occurring without attracting any one\'s attention, and\nwithout being able to interest even the French military, still less the\nwhole world. The public turned its attention to this incident, the\norgans of the press, mutually competing, began to describe, examine,\ndiscuss the event; the public was yet more interested; the press\nanswered to the demand of the public, and the lump of snow began to grow\nand grow, till before our eyes it attained such a bulk that there was\nnot a family where controversies did not rage about "l\'affaire." The\ncaricature by Caran d\'Ache representing at first a peaceful family\nresolved to talk no more about Dreyfus, and then, like exasperated\nfuries, members of the same family fighting with each other, quite\ncorrectly expressed the attitude of the whole of the reading world to\nthe question about Dreyfus. People of foreign nationalities, who could\nnot be interested in the question whether a French officer was a traitor\nor not--people, moreover, who could know nothing of the development of\nthe case--all divided themselves for and against Dreyfus, and the moment\nthey met they talked and argued about Dreyfus, some asserting his guilt\nwith assurance, others denying it with equal assurance. Only after the\nlapse of some years did people begin to awake from the "suggestion" and\nto understand that they could not possibly know whether Dreyfus was\nguilty or not, and that each one had thousands of subjects much more\nnear to him and interesting than the case of Dreyfus.\n\nSuch infatuations take place in all spheres, but they are especially\nnoticeable in the sphere of literature, as the press naturally occupies\nitself the more keenly with the affairs of the press, and they are\nparticularly powerful in our time when the press has received such an\nunnatural development. It continually happens that people suddenly begin\nto extol some most insignificant works, in exaggerated language, and\nthen, if these works do not correspond to the prevailing view of life,\nthey suddenly become utterly indifferent to them, and forget both the\nworks themselves and their former attitude toward them.\n\nSo within my recollection, in the forties, there was in the sphere of\nart the laudation and glorification of Eugene Sue, and Georges Sand; and\nin the social sphere Fourier; in the philosophical sphere, Comte and\nHegel; in the scientific sphere, Darwin.\n\nSue is quite forgotten, Georges Sand is being forgotten and replaced by\nthe writings of Zola and the Decadents, Beaudelaire, Verlaine,\nMaeterlinck, and others. Fourier with his phalansteries is quite\nforgotten, his place being taken by Marx. Hegel, who justified the\nexisting order, and Comte, who denied the necessity of religious\nactivity in mankind, and Darwin with his law of struggle, still hold on,\nbut are beginning to be forgotten, being replaced by the teaching of\nNietzsche, which, altho utterly extravagant, unconsidered, misty, and\nvicious in its bearing, yet corresponds better with existing tendencies.\nThus sometimes artistic, philosophic, and, in general, literary crazes\nsuddenly arise and are as quickly forgotten. But it also happens that\nsuch crazes, having arisen in consequence of special reasons\naccidentally favoring to their establishment, correspond in such a\ndegree to the views of life spread in society, and especially in\nliterary circles, that they are maintained for a long time. As far back\nas in the time of Rome, it was remarked that often books have their own\nvery strange fates: consisting in failure notwithstanding their high\nmerits, and in enormous undeserved success notwithstanding their\ntriviality. The saying arose: "pro captu lectoris habent sua fata\nlibelli"--_i.e._, that the fate of books depends on the understanding of\nthose who read them. There was harmony between Shakespeare\'s writings\nand the view of life of those amongst whom his fame arose. And this fame\nhas been, and still is, maintained owing to Shakespeare\'s works\ncontinuing to correspond to the life concept of those who support this\nfame.\n\nUntil the end of the eighteenth century Shakespeare not only failed to\ngain any special fame in England, but was valued less than his\ncontemporary dramatists: Ben Jonson, Fletcher, Beaumont, and others. His\nfame originated in Germany, and thence was transferred to England. This\nhappened for the following reason:\n\nArt, especially dramatic art, demanding for its realization great\npreparations, outlays, and labor, was always religious, _i.e._, its\nobject was to stimulate in men a clearer conception of that relation of\nman to God which had, at that time, been attained by the leading men of\nthe circles interested in art.\n\nSo it was bound to be from its own nature, and so, as a matter of fact,\nhas it always been among all nations--Egyptians, Hindus, Chinese,\nGreeks--commencing in some remote period of human life. And it has\nalways happened that, with the coarsening of religious forms, art has\nmore and more diverged from its original object (according to which it\ncould be regarded as an important function--almost an act of worship),\nand, instead of serving religious objects, it strove for worldly aims,\nseeking to satisfy the demands of the crowd or of the powerful, _i.e._,\nthe aims of recreation and amusement. This deviation of art from its\ntrue and high vocation took place everywhere, and even in connection\nwith Christianity.\n\nThe first manifestations of Christian art were services in churches: in\nthe administration of the sacraments and the ordinary liturgy. When, in\ncourse of time, the forms of art as used in worship became insufficient,\nthere appeared the Mysteries, describing those events which were\nregarded as the most important in the Christian religious view of life.\nWhen, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the center of gravity\nof Christian teaching was more and more transferred, the worship of\nChrist as God, and the interpretation and following of His teaching, the\nform of Mysteries describing external Christian events became\ninsufficient, and new forms were demanded. As the expression of the\naspirations which gave rise to these changes, there appeared the\nMoralities, dramatic representations in which the characters were\npersonifications of Christian virtues and their opposite vices.\n\nBut allegories, owing to the very fact of their being works of art of a\nlower order, could not replace the former religious dramas, and yet no\nnew forms of dramatic art corresponding to the conception now\nentertained of Christianity, according to which it was regarded as a\nteaching of life, had yet been found. Hence, dramatic art, having no\nfoundation, came in all Christian countries to swerve farther and\nfarther from its proper use and object, and, instead of serving God, it\ntook to serving the crowd (by crowd, I mean, not simply the masses of\ncommon people, but the majority of immoral or unmoral men, indifferent\nto the higher problems of human life). This deviation was, moreover,\nencouraged by the circumstance that, at this very time, the Greek\nthinkers, poets, and dramatists, hitherto unknown in the Christian\nworld, were discovered and brought back into favor. From all this it\nfollowed that, not having yet had time to work out their own form of\ndramatic art corresponding to the new conception entertained of\nChristianity as being a teaching of life, and, at the same time,\nrecognizing the previous form of Mysteries and Moralities as\ninsufficient, the writers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in\ntheir search for a new form, began to imitate the newly discovered Greek\nmodels, attracted by their elegance and novelty.\n\nSince those who could principally avail themselves of dramatic\nrepresentations were the powerful of this world: kings, princes,\ncourtiers, the least religious people, not only utterly indifferent to\nthe questions of religion, but in most cases completely\ndepraved--therefore, in satisfying the demands of its audience, the\ndrama of the fifteenth and sixteenth and seventeenth centuries entirely\ngave up all religious aim. It came to pass that the drama, which\nformerly had such a lofty and religious significance, and which can, on\nthis condition alone, occupy an important place in human life, became,\nas in the time of Rome, a spectacle, an amusement, a recreation--_only_\nwith this difference, that in Rome the spectacles existed for the whole\npeople, whereas in the Christian world of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and\nseventeenth centuries they were principally meant for depraved kings and\nthe higher classes. Such was the case with the Spanish, English,\nItalian, and French drama.\n\nThe dramas of that time, principally composed, in all these countries,\naccording to ancient Greek models, or taken from poems, legends, or\nbiographies, naturally reflected the characteristics of their respective\nnationalities: in Italy comedies were chiefly elaborated, with humorous\npositions and persons. In Spain there flourished the worldly drama, with\ncomplicated plots and historical heroes. The peculiarities of the\nEnglish drama were the coarse incidents of murders, executions, and\nbattles taking place on the stage, and popular, humorous interludes.\nNeither the Italian nor the Spanish nor the English drama had European\nfame, but they all enjoyed success in their own countries. General fame,\nowing to the elegance of its language and the talent of its writers,\nwas possessed only by the French drama, distinguished by its strict\nadherence to the Greek models, and especially to the law of the three\nUnities.\n\nSo it continued till the end of the eighteenth century, at which time\nthis happened: In Germany, which had not produced even passable dramatic\nwriters (there was a weak and little known writer, Hans Sachs), all\neducated people, together with Frederick the Great, bowed down before\nthe French pseudo-classical drama. Yet at this very time there appeared\nin Germany a group of educated and talented writers and poets, who,\nfeeling the falsity and coldness of the French drama, endeavored to find\na new and freer dramatic form. The members of this group, like all the\nupper classes of the Christian world at that time, were under the charm\nand influence of the Greek classics, and, being utterly indifferent to\nreligious questions, they thought that if the Greek drama, describing\nthe calamities and sufferings and strife of its heroes, represented the\nhighest dramatic ideal, then such a description of the sufferings and\nthe struggles of heroes would be a sufficient subject in the Christian\nworld, too, if only the narrow demands of pseudo-classicalism were\nrejected. These men, not understanding that, for the Greeks, the strife\nand sufferings of their heroes had a religious significance, imagined\nthat they needed only to reject the inconvenient law of the three\nUnities, without introducing into the drama any religious element\ncorresponding to their time, in order that the drama should have\nsufficient scope in the representation of various moments in the lives\nof historical personages and, in general, of strong human passions.\nExactly this kind of drama existed at that time among the kindred\nEnglish people, and, becoming acquainted with it, the Germans decided\nthat precisely such should be the drama of the new period.\n\nThereupon, because of the clever development of scenes which constituted\nShakespeare\'s peculiarity, they chose Shakespeare\'s dramas in preference\nto all other English dramas, excluding those which were not in the least\ninferior, but were even superior, to Shakespeare. At the head of the\ngroup stood Goethe, who was then the dictator of public opinion in\nesthetic questions. He it was who, partly owing to a desire to destroy\nthe fascination of the false French art, partly owing to his desire to\ngive a greater scope to his own dramatic writing, but chiefly through\nthe agreement of his view of life with Shakespeare\'s, declared\nShakespeare a great poet. When this error was announced by an authority\nlike Goethe, all those esthetic critics who did not understand art threw\nthemselves on it like crows on carrion and began to discover in\nShakespeare beauties which did not exist, and to extol them. These men,\nGerman esthetic critics, for the most part utterly devoid of esthetic\nfeeling, without that simple, direct artistic sensibility which, for\npeople with a feeling for art, clearly distinguishes esthetic\nimpressions from all others, but believing the authority which had\nrecognized Shakespeare as a great poet, began to praise the whole of\nShakespeare indiscriminately, especially distinguishing such passages as\nstruck them by their effects, or which expressed thoughts corresponding\nto their views of life, imagining that these effects and these thoughts\nconstitute the essence of what is called art. These men acted as blind\nmen would act who endeavored to find diamonds by touch among a heap of\nstones they were fingering. As the blind man would for a long time\nstrenuously handle the stones and in the end would come to no other\nconclusion than that all stones are precious and especially so the\nsmoothest, so also these esthetic critics, without artistic feeling,\ncould not but come to similar results in relation to Shakespeare. To\ngive the greater force to their praise of the whole of Shakespeare, they\ninvented esthetic theories according to which it appeared that no\ndefinite religious view of life was necessary for works of art in\ngeneral, and especially for the drama; that for the purpose of the drama\nthe representation of human passions and characters was quite\nsufficient; that not only was an internal religious illumination of what\nwas represented unnecessary, but art should be objective, _i.e._, should\nrepresent events quite independently of any judgment of good and evil.\nAs these theories were founded on Shakespeare\'s own views of life, it\nnaturally turned out that the works of Shakespeare satisfied these\ntheories and therefore were the height of perfection.\n\nIt is these people who are chiefly responsible for Shakespeare\'s fame.\nIt was principally owing to their writings that the interaction took\nplace between writers and public which expressed itself, and is still\nexpressing itself, in an insane worship of Shakespeare which has no\nrational foundation. These esthetic critics have written profound\ntreatises about Shakespeare. Eleven thousand volumes have been written\nabout him, and a whole science of Shakespearology composed; while the\npublic, on the one hand, took more and more interest, and the learned\ncritics, on the other hand, gave further and further explanations,\nadding to the confusion.\n\nSo that the first cause of Shakespeare\'s fame was that the Germans\nwished to oppose to the cold French drama, of which they had grown\nweary, and which, no doubt, was tedious enough, a livelier and freer\none. The second cause was that the young German writers required a model\nfor writing their own dramas. The third and principal cause was the\nactivity of the learned and zealous esthetic German critics without\nesthetic feeling, who invented the theory of objective art,\ndeliberately rejecting the religious essence of the drama.\n\n"But," I shall be asked, "what do you understand by the word\'s religious\nessence of the drama? May not what you are demanding for the drama,\nreligious instruction, or didactics, be called \'tendency,\' a thing\nincompatible with true art?" I reply that by the religious essence of\nart I understand not the direct inculcation of any religious truths in\nan artistic guise, and not an allegorical demonstration of these truths,\nbut the exhibition of a definite view of life corresponding to the\nhighest religious understanding of a given time, which, serving as the\nmotive for the composition of the drama, penetrates, to the knowledge of\nthe author, through all of his work. So it has always been with true\nart, and so it is with every true artist in general and especially the\ndramatist. Hence--as it was when the drama was a serious thing, and as\nit should be according to the essence of the matter--that man alone can\nwrite a drama who has something to say to men, and something which is of\nthe greatest importance for them: about man\'s relation to God, to the\nUniverse, to the All, the Eternal, the Infinite. But when, thanks to\nthe German theories about objective art, the idea was established that,\nfor the drama, this was quite unnecessary, then it is obvious how a\nwriter like Shakespeare--who had not got developed in his mind the\nreligious convictions proper to his time, who, in fact, had no\nconvictions at all, but heaped up in his drama all possible events,\nhorrors, fooleries, discussions, and effects--could appear to be a\ndramatic writer of the greatest genius.\n\nBut these are all external reasons. The fundamental inner cause of\nShakespeare\'s fame was and is this: that his dramas were "pro captu\nlectoris," _i.e._, they corresponded to the irreligious and immoral\nframe of mind of the upper classes of his time.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nAt the beginning of the last century, when Goethe was dictator of\nphilosophic thought and esthetic laws, a series of casual circumstances\nmade him praise Shakespeare. The esthetic critics caught up this praise\nand took to writing their lengthy, misty, learned articles, and the\ngreat European public began to be enchanted with Shakespeare. The\ncritics, answering to the popular interest, and endeavoring to compete\nwith one another, wrote new and ever new essays about Shakespeare; the\nreaders and spectators on their side were increasingly confirmed in\ntheir admiration, and Shakespeare\'s fame, like a lump of snow, kept\ngrowing and growing, until in our time it has attained that insane\nworship which obviously has no other foundation than "suggestion."\n\nShakespeare finds no rival, not even approximately, either among the old\nor the new writers. Here are some of the tributes paid to him.\n\n"Poetic truth is the brightest flower in the crown of Shakespeare\'s\nmerits;" "Shakespeare is the greatest moralist of all times;"\n"Shakespeare exhibits such many-sidedness and such objectivism that they\ncarry him beyond the limits of time and nationality;" "Shakespeare is\nthe greatest genius that has hitherto existed;" "For the creation of\ntragedy, comedy, history, idyll, idyllistic comedy, esthetic idyll, for\nthe profoundest presentation, or for any casually thrown off, passing\npiece of verse, he is the only man. He not only wields an unlimited\npower over our mirth and our tears, over all the workings of passion,\nhumor, thought, and observation, but he possesses also an infinite\nregion full of the phantasy of fiction, of a horrifying and an amusing\ncharacter. He possesses penetration both in the world of fiction and of\nreality, and above this reigns one and the same truthfulness to\ncharacter and to nature, and the same spirit of humanity;" "To\nShakespeare the epithet of Great comes of itself; and if one adds that\nindependently of his greatness he has, further, become the reformer of\nall literature, and, moreover, has in his works not only expressed the\nphenomenon of life as it was in his day, but also, by the genius of\nthought which floated in the air has prophetically forestalled the\ndirection that the social spirit was going to take in the future (of\nwhich we see a striking example in Hamlet),--one may, without\nhesitation, say that Shakespeare was not only a great poet, but the\ngreatest of all poets who ever existed, and that in the sphere of poetic\ncreation his only worthy rival was that same life which in his works he\nexpressed to such perfection."\n\nThe obvious exaggeration of this estimate proves more conclusively than\nanything that it is the consequence, not of common sense, but of\nsuggestion. The more trivial, the lower, the emptier a phenomenon is, if\nonly it has become the subject of suggestion, the more supernatural and\nexaggerated is the significance attributed to it. The Pope is not merely\nsaintly, but most saintly, and so forth. So Shakespeare is not merely a\ngood writer, but the greatest genius, the eternal teacher of man kind.\n\nSuggestion is always a deceit, and every deceit is an evil. In truth,\nthe suggestion that Shakespeare\'s works are great works of genius,\npresenting the height of both esthetic and ethical perfection, has\ncaused, and is causing, great injury to men.\n\nThis injury is twofold: first, the fall of the drama, and the\nreplacement of this important weapon of progress by an empty and immoral\namusement; and secondly, the direct depravation of men by presenting to\nthem false models for imitation.\n\nHuman life is perfected only through the development of the religious\nconsciousness, the only element which permanently unites men. The\ndevelopment of the religious consciousness of men is accomplished\nthrough all the sides of man\'s spiritual activity. One direction of this\nactivity is in art. One section of art, perhaps the most influential, is\nthe drama.\n\nTherefore the drama, in order to deserve the importance attributed to\nit, should serve the development of religious consciousness. Such has\nthe drama always been, and such it was in the Christian world. But upon\nthe appearance of Protestantism in its broader sense, _i.e._, the\nappearance of a new understanding of Christianity as of a teaching of\nlife, the dramatic art did not find a form corresponding to the new\nunderstanding of Christianity, and the men of the Renaissance were\ncarried away by the imitation of classical art. This was most natural,\nbut the tendency was bound to pass, and art had to discover, as indeed\nit is now beginning to do, its new form corresponding to the change in\nthe understanding of Christianity.\n\nBut the discovery of this new form was arrested by the teaching arising\namong German writers at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the\nnineteenth centuries--as to so-called objective art, _i.e._, art\nindifferent to good or evil--and therein the exaggerated praise of\nShakespeare\'s dramas, which partly corresponded to the esthetic teaching\nof the Germans, and partly served as material for it. If there had not\nbeen exaggerated praise of Shakespeare\'s dramas, presenting them as the\nmost perfect models, the men of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\nwould have had to understand that the drama, to have a right to exist\nand to be a serious thing, must serve, as it always has served and can\nnot but do otherwise, the development of the religious consciousness.\nAnd having understood this, they would have searched for a new form of\ndrama corresponding to their religious understanding.\n\nBut when it was decided that the height of perfection was Shakespeare\'s\ndrama, and that we ought to write as he did, not only without any\nreligious, but even without any moral, significance, then all writers of\ndramas in imitation of him began to compose such empty pieces as are\nthose of Goethe, Schiller, Hugo, and, in Russia, of Pushkin, or the\nchronicles of Ostrovski, Alexis Tolstoy, and an innumerable number of\nother more or less celebrated dramatic productions which fill all the\ntheaters, and can be prepared wholesale by any one who happens to have\nthe idea or desire to write a play. It is only thanks to such a low,\ntrivial understanding of the significance of the drama that there\nappears among us that infinite quantity of dramatic works describing\nmen\'s actions, positions, characters, and frames of mind, not only void\nof any spiritual substance, but often of any human sense.\n\nLet not the reader think that I exclude from this estimate of\ncontemporary drama the theatrical pieces I have myself incidentally\nwritten. I recognize them, as well as all the rest, as not having that\nreligious character which must form the foundation of the drama of the\nfuture.\n\nThe drama, then, the most important branch of art, has, in our time,\nbecome the trivial and immoral amusement of a trivial and immoral crowd.\nThe worst of it is, moreover, that to dramatic art, fallen as low as it\nis possible to fall, is still attributed an elevated significance no\nlonger appropriate to it. Dramatists, actors, theatrical managers, and\nthe press--this last publishing in the most serious tone reports of\ntheaters and operas--and the rest, are all perfectly certain that they\nare doing something very worthy and important.\n\nThe drama in our time is a great man fallen, who has reached the last\ndegree of his degradation, and at the same time continues to pride\nhimself on his past of which nothing now remains. The public of our time\nis like those who mercilessly amuse themselves over this man once so\ngreat and now in the lowest stage of his fall.\n\nSuch is one of the mischievous effects of the epidemic suggestion about\nthe greatness of Shakespeare. Another deplorable result of this worship\nis the presentation to men of a false model for imitation. If people\nwrote of Shakespeare that for his time he was a good writer, that he had\na fairly good turn for verse, was an intelligent actor and good stage\nmanager--even were this appreciation incorrect and somewhat\nexaggerated--if only it were moderately true, people of the rising\ngeneration might remain free from Shakespeare\'s influence. But when\nevery young man entering into life in our time has presented to him, as\nthe model of moral perfection, not the religious and moral teachers of\nmankind, but first of all Shakespeare, concerning whom it has been\ndecided and is handed down by learned men from generation to generation,\nas an incontestable truth, that he was the greatest poet, the greatest\nteacher of life, the young man can not remain free from this pernicious\ninfluence. When he is reading or listening to Shakespeare the question\nfor him is no longer whether Shakespeare be good or bad, but only: In\nwhat consists that extraordinary beauty, both esthetic and ethical, of\nwhich he has been assured by learned men whom he respects, and which he\nhimself neither sees nor feels? And constraining himself, and distorting\nhis esthetic and ethical feeling, he tries to conform to the ruling\nopinion. He no longer believes in himself, but in what is said by the\nlearned people whom he respects. I have experienced all this. Then\nreading critical examinations of the dramas and extracts from books with\nexplanatory comments, he begins to imagine that he feels something of\nthe nature of an artistic impression. The longer this continues, the\nmore does his esthetical and ethical feeling become distorted. He ceases\nto distinguish directly and clearly what is artistic from an artificial\nimitation of art. But, above all, having assimilated the immoral view of\nlife which penetrates all Shakespeare\'s writings, he loses the capacity\nof distinguishing good from evil. And the error of extolling an\ninsignificant, inartistic writer--not only not moral, but directly\nimmoral--executes its destructive work.\n\nThis is why I think that the sooner people free themselves from the\nfalse glorification of Shakespeare, the better it will be.\n\nFirst, having freed themselves from this deceit, men will come to\nunderstand that the drama which has no religious element at its\nfoundation is not only not an important and good thing, as it is now\nsupposed to be, but the most trivial and despicable of things. Having\nunderstood this, they will have to search for, and work out, a new form\nof modern drama, a drama which will serve as the development and\nconfirmation of the highest stage of religious consciousness in men.\n\nSecondly, having freed themselves from this hypnotic state, men will\nunderstand that the trivial and immoral works of Shakespeare and his\nimitators, aiming merely at the recreation and amusement of the\nspectators, can not possibly represent the teaching of life, and that,\nwhile there is no true religious drama, the teaching of life should be\nsought for in other sources.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] This essay owes its origin to Leo Tolstoy\'s desire to contribute a\npreface to the article he here mentions by Ernest Crosby, which latter\nfollows in this volume.--(_Trans._)\n\n[2] "Shakespeare and His Writings," by George Brandes.\n\n[3] A Russian poet, remarkable for the delicacy of his works.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX CONTENTS\n\n\n I. SHAKESPEARE\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE\n    WORKING CLASSES, BY ERNEST CROSBY,             127\n\nII. LETTER FROM MR. G. BERNARD SHAW,               166\n\n\n\n\nSHAKESPEARE\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE WORKING CLASSES\n\nBY ERNEST CROSBY\n\n\n"Shakespeare was of us," cries Browning, in his "Lost Leader," while\nlamenting the defection of Wordsworth from the ranks of progress and\nliberalism--"Milton was for us, Burns, Shelley were with us--they watch\nfrom their graves!" There can, indeed, be no question of the fidelity to\ndemocracy of Milton, the republican pamphleteer, nor of Burns, the proud\nplowman, who proclaimed the fact that "a man\'s a man for a\' that," nor\nof Shelley, the awakened aristocrat, who sang to such as Burns\n\n    "Men of England, wherefore plow\n     For the lords who lay ye low?"\n\nBut Shakespeare?--Shakespeare?--where is there a line in Shakespeare to\nentitle him to a place in this brotherhood? Is there anything in his\nplays that is in the least inconsistent with all that is reactionary?\n\nA glance at Shakespeare\'s lists of _dramatis personae_ is sufficient to\nshow that he was unable to conceive of any situation rising to the\ndignity of tragedy in other than royal and ducal circles. It may be said\nin explanation of this partiality for high rank that he was only\nfollowing the custom of the dramatists of his time, but this is a poor\nplea for a man of great genius, whose business it is precisely to lead\nand not to follow. Nor is the explanation altogether accurate. In his\nplay, the "Pinner of Wakefield," first printed in 1599, Robert Greene\nmakes a hero, and a very stalwart one, of a mere pound-keeper, who\nproudly refuses knighthood at the hands of the king. There were other\nand earlier plays in vogue in Shakespeare\'s day treating of the triumphs\nof men of the people, one, for instance, which commemorated the rise of\nSir Thomas Gresham, the merchant\'s son, and another, entitled "The\nHistory of Richard Whittington, of his Low Birth, his Great Fortune";\nbut he carefully avoided such material in seeking plots for his dramas.\nCardinal Wolsey, the butcher\'s son, is indeed the hero of "Henry VIII.,"\nbut his humble origin is only mentioned incidentally as something to be\nashamed of. What greater opportunity for idealizing the common people\never presented itself to a dramatist than to Shakespeare when he\nundertook to draw the character of Joan of Arc in the second part of\n"Henry VI."? He knew how to create noble women--that is one of his\nspecial glories--but he not only refuses to see anything noble in the\npeasant girl who led France to victory, but he deliberately insults her\nmemory with the coarsest and most cruel calumnies. Surely the lapse of\nmore than a century and a half might have enabled a man of honor, if not\nof genius, to do justice to an enemy of the weaker sex, and if Joan had\nbeen a member of the French royal family we may be sure that she would\nhave received better treatment.\n\nThe question of the aristocratic tendency of the drama was an active one\nin Shakespeare\'s time. There was a good deal of democratic feeling in\nthe burghers of London-town, and they resented the courtly prejudices of\ntheir playwrights and their habit of holding up plain citizens to\nridicule upon the stage, whenever they deigned to present them at all.\nThe Prolog in Beaumont and Fletcher\'s "Knight of the Burning Pestle"\ngives sufficient evidence of this. The authors adopted the device of\nhaving a Citizen leap upon the stage and interrupt the Speaker of the\nProlog by shouting\n\n    "Hold your peace, goodman boy!"\n\n    Speaker of Prolog: "What do you mean, sir?"\n\n    Citizen: "That you have no good meaning; this seven\n     year there hath been plays at this house. I have observed\n     it, you have still girds at citizens."\n\nThe Citizen goes on to inform the Speaker of the Prolog that he is a\ngrocer, and to demand that he "present something notably in honor of the\ncommons of the city." For a hero he will have "a grocer, and he shall do\nadmirable things." But this proved to be a joke over too serious a\nmatter, for at the first representation of the play in 1611 it was cried\ndown by the citizens and apprentices, who did not appreciate its satire\nupon them, and it was not revived for many years thereafter. It will not\nanswer, therefore, to say that the idea of celebrating the middle and\nlower classes never occurred to Shakespeare, for it was a subject of\ndiscussion among his contemporaries.\n\nIt is hardly possible to construct a play with no characters but\nmonarchs and their suites, and at the same time preserve the\nverisimilitudes of life. Shakespeare was obliged to make some use of\nservants, citizens, and populace. How has he portrayed them? In one play\nalone has he given up the whole stage to them, and it is said that the\n"Merry Wives of Windsor" was only written at the request of Queen\nElizabeth, who wished to see Sir John Falstaff in love. It is from\nbeginning to end one prolonged "gird at citizens," and we can hardly\nwonder that they felt a grievance against the dramatic profession. In\nthe other plays of Shakespeare the humbler classes appear for the main\npart only occasionally and incidentally. His opinion of them is\nindicated more or less picturesquely by the names which he selects for\nthem. There are, for example, Bottom, the weaver; Flute, the\nbellows-maker; Snout and Sly, tinkers; Quince, the carpenter; Snug, the\njoiner; Starveling, the tailor; Smooth, the silkman; Shallow and\nSilence, country justices; Elbow and Hull, constables; Dogberry and\nVerges, Fang and Snare, sheriffs\' officers; Mouldy, Shadow, Wart, and\nBull-calf, recruits; Feebee, at once a recruit and a woman\'s tailor,\nPilch and Patch-Breech, fishermen (though these last two appellations\nmay be mere nicknames); Potpan, Peter Thump, Simple, Gobbo, and Susan\nGrindstone, servants; Speed, "a clownish servant"; Slender, Pistol, Nym,\nSneak, Doll Tear-sheet, Jane Smile, Costard, Oatcake, Seacoal, and\nvarious anonymous "clowns" and "fools." Shakespeare rarely gives names\nof this character to any but the lowly in life, altho perhaps we should\ncite as exceptions Sir Toby Belch and Sir Andrew Ague-Cheek in "Twelfth\nNight"; the vicar, Sir Oliver Mar-Text, in "As You Like It"; Moth, the\npage, in "Love\'s Labor Lost," and Froth, "a foolish gentleman," in\n"Measure for Measure," but none of these personages quite deserves to\nrank as an aristocrat. Such a system of nomenclature as we have exposed\nis enough of itself to fasten the stigma of absurdity upon the\ncharacters subjected to it, and their occupations. Most of the trades\nare held up for ridicule in "Midsummer Night\'s Dream"; Holofernes, the\nschoolmaster, is made ridiculous in "Love\'s Labor Lost," and we are told\nof the middle-class Nym, Pistol, and Bardolph that "three such antics do\nnot amount to a man" (Henry V., Act 3, Sc. 2). But it is not necessary\nto rehearse the various familiar scenes in which these fantastically\nnamed individuals raise a laugh at their own expense.\n\nThe language employed by nobility and royalty in addressing those of\ninferior station in Shakespeare\'s plays may be taken, perhaps, rather as\nan indication of the manners of the times than as an expression of his\nown feeling, but even so it must have been a little galling to the\npoorer of his auditors. "Whoreson dog," "whoreson peasant," "slave,"\n"you cur," "rogue," "rascal," "dunghill," "crack-hemp," and "notorious\nvillain"--these are a few of the epithets with which the plays abound.\nThe Duke of York accosts Thomas Horner, an armorer, as "base dunghill\nvillain and mechanical" (Henry VI., Part 2, Act 2, Sc. 3); Gloster\nspeaks of the warders of the Tower as "dunghill grooms" (Ib., Part 1,\nAct 1, Sc. 3), and Hamlet of the grave-digger as an "ass" and "rude\nknave." Valentine tells his servant, Speed, that he is born to be hanged\n(Two Gentlemen of Verona, Act 1, Sc. 1), and Gonzalo pays a like\ncompliment to the boatswain who is doing his best to save the ship in\nthe "Tempest" (Act 1, Sc. 1). This boatswain is not sufficiently\nimpressed by the grandeur of his noble cargo, and for his pains is\ncalled a "brawling, blasphemous, uncharitable dog," a "cur," a\n"whoreson, insolent noise-maker," and a "wide-chapped rascal." Richard\nIII.\'s Queen says to a gardener, who is guilty of nothing but giving a\ntrue report of her lord\'s deposition and who shows himself a\nkind-hearted fellow, "Thou little better thing than earth," "thou\nwretch"! Henry VIII. talks of a "lousy footboy," and the Duke of\nSuffolk, when he is about to be killed by his pirate captor at Dover,\ncalls him "obscure and lowly swain," "jaded groom," and "base slave,"\ndubs his crew "paltry, servile, abject drudges," and declares that his\nown head would\n\n         "sooner dance upon bloody pole\n    Than stand uncovered to a vulgar groom."\n                (Henry VI., Part 2, Act 4, Sc. 1.)\n\nPetruchio "wrings Grumio by the ear," and Katherine beats the same\nunlucky servant. His master indulges in such terms as "foolish knave,"\n"peasant swain," and "whoreson malthorse drudge" in addressing him;\ncries out to his servants, "off with my boots, you rogues, you\nvillains!" and strikes them. He pays his compliments to a tailor in the\nfollowing lines:\n\n    "O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble,\n     Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,\n     Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter cricket thou;\n     Braved in my own house by a skein of thread!\n     Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant!"\n                (Taming of the Shrew, Act 4, Sc. 3.)\n\nJoan of Arc speaks of her "contemptible estate" as a shepherd\'s\ndaughter, and afterward, denying her father, calls him "Decrepit miser!\nbase, ignoble wretch!" (Henry VI., Part 1, Act 1, Sc. 2, and Act 5, Sc.\n4.) It is hard to believe that Shakespeare would have so frequently\nallowed his characters to express their contempt for members of the\nlower orders of society if he had not had some sympathy with their\nopinions.\n\nShakespeare usually employs the common people whom he brings upon the\nstage merely to raise a laugh (as, for instance, the flea-bitten\ncarriers in the inn-yard at Rochester, in Henry IV., Part 1, Act 2, Sc.\n1), but occasionally they are scamps as well as fools. They amuse us\nwhen they become hopelessly entangled in their sentences (_vide_ Romeo\nand Juliet, Act 1, Sc. 2), or when Juliet\'s nurse blunderingly makes\nher think that Romeo is slain instead of Tybalt; but when this same\nlady, after taking Romeo\'s money, espouses the cause of the County\nParis--or when on the eve of Agincourt we are introduced to a group of\ncowardly English soldiers--or when Coriolanus points out the poltroonery\nof the Roman troops, and says that all would have been lost "but for our\ngentlemen," we must feel detestation for them. Juliet\'s nurse is not the\nonly disloyal servant. Shylock\'s servant, Launcelot Gobbo, helps Jessica\nto deceive her father, and Margaret, the Lady Hero\'s gentlewoman, brings\nabout the disgrace of her mistress by fraud. Olivia\'s waiting-woman in\n"Twelfth Night" is honest enough, but she is none too modest in her\nlanguage, but in this respect Dame Quickly in "Henry IV." can easily\nrival her. Peter Thump, when forced to a judicial combat with his\nmaster, displays his cowardice, altho in the end he is successful (Henry\nVI., Act 2, Part 2, Sc. 3), and Stephano, a drunken butler, adorns the\nstage in the "Tempest." We can not blame Shakespeare for making use of\ncutthroats and villains in developing his plots, but we might have been\nspared the jokes which the jailors of Posthumus perpetrate when they\ncome to lead him to the scaffold, and the ludicrous English of the clown\nwho supplies Cleopatra with an asp. The apothecary who is in such\nwretched plight that he sells poison to Romeo in spite of a Draconian\nlaw, gives us another unflattering picture of a tradesman; and when\nFalstaff declares, "I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or\nanything," we have a premature reflection on the Puritan, middle-class\nconscience and religion. In "As You Like It," Shakespeare came near\ndrawing a pastoral sketch of shepherds and shepherdesses on conventional\nlines. If he failed to do so, it was as much from lack of respect for\nthe keeping of sheep as for the unrealities of pastoral poetry. Rosalind\ndoes not scruple to call the fair Phebe "foul," and, as for her hands,\nshe says:\n\n    "I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,\n     A freestone colored hand; I verily did think\n     That her old gloves were on, but \'twas her hands;\n     She has a housewife\'s hand."\n\nNo one with a high respect for housewifery could have written that line.\nWhen in the same play Jaques sees the pair of rural lovers, Touchstone\nand Audrey, approaching, he cries: "There is, sure, another flood, and\nthese couples are coming to the ark! Here come a pair of very strange\nbeasts, which in all tongues are called fools" (Act 5, Sc. 4). The\nclown, Touchstone, speaks of kissing the cow\'s dugs which his former\nsweetheart had milked, and then marries Audrey in a tempest of\nbuffoonery. Howbeit, Touchstone remains one of the few rustic characters\nof Shakespeare who win our affections, and at the same time he is witty\nenough to deserve the title which Jaques bestows upon him of a "rare\nfellow."\n\nOccasionally Shakespeare makes fun of persons who are somewhat above the\nlower classes in rank. I have mentioned those on whom he bestows\ncomical names. He indulges in humor also at the expense of the two\nScottish captains, Jamy and Macmorris, and the honest Welsh captain,\nFluellen (Henry V., Act 3, Sc. 2 _et passim_), and shall we forget the\ninimitable Falstaff? But, while making every allowance for these\ndiversions into somewhat nobler quarters (the former of which are\nexplained by national prejudices), do they form serious exceptions to\nthe rule, and can Falstaff be taken, for instance, as a representative\nof the real aristocracy? As Queen and courtiers watched his antics on\nthe stage, we may be sure that it never entered their heads that the\n"girds" were directed at them or their kind.\n\nThe appearance on Shakespeare\'s stage of a man of humble birth who is\nvirtuous without being ridiculous is so rare an event that it is worth\nwhile to enumerate the instances. Now and then a servant or other\nobscure character is made use of as a mere lay figure of which nothing\ngood or evil can be predicated, but usually they are made more or less\nabsurd. Only at long intervals do we see persons of this class at once\nserious and upright. As might have been expected, it is more often the\nservant than any other member of the lower classes to whom Shakespeare\nattributes good qualities, for the servant is a sort of attachment to\nthe gentleman and shines with the reflection of his virtues. The noblest\nquality which Shakespeare can conceive of in a servant is loyalty, and\nin "Richard II." (Act 5, Sc. 3) he gives us a good example in the\ncharacter of a groom who remains faithful to the king even when the\nlatter is cast into prison. In "Cymbeline" we are treated to loyalty _ad\nnauseam_. The king orders Pisanio, a trusty servant, to be tortured\nwithout cause, and his reply is,\n\n    "Sir, my life is yours.\n     I humbly set it at your will."\n                (Act 4, Sc. 3.)\n\nIn "King Lear" a good servant protests against the cruelty of Regan and\nCornwall toward Gloucester, and is killed for his courage. "Give me my\nsword," cries Regan. "A peasant stand up thus!" (Act 3, Sc. 7). And\nother servants also show sympathy for the unfortunate earl. We all\nremember the fool who, almost alone, was true to Lear, but, then, of\ncourse, he was a fool. In "Timon of Athens" we have an unusual array of\ngood servants, but it is doubtful if Shakespeare wrote the play, and\nthese characters make his authorship more doubtful. Flaminius, Timon\'s\nservant, rejects a bribe with scorn (Act 3, Sc. 1). Another of his\nservants expresses his contempt for his master\'s false friends (Act 3,\nSc. 3), and when Timon finally loses his fortune and his friends forsake\nhim, his servants stand by him. "Yet do our hearts wear Timon\'s livery"\n(Act 4, Sc. 2). Adam, the good old servant in "As You Like It," who\nfollows his young master Orlando into exile, is, like Lear\'s fool, a\nnoteworthy example of the loyal servitor.\n\n    "Master, go on, and I will follow thee\n     To the last gasp with truth and loyalty."\n                (Act 2, Sc. 3.)\n\nBut Shakespeare takes care to point out that such fidelity in servants\nis most uncommon and a relic of the good old times--\n\n    "O good old man, bow well in thee appears\n     The constant service of the antique world,\n     When service sweat for duty, nor for meed!\n     Thou art not for the fashion of these times,\n     When none will sweat but for promotion."\n\nOutside the ranks of domestic servants we find a few cases of honorable\npoverty in Shakespeare. In the play just quoted, Corin, the old\nshepherd, says:\n\n     "Sir, I am a true laborer; I earn that I eat, get that I\n     wear; owe no man hate, envy no man\'s happiness; glad of\n     other men\'s good, content with my harm; and the greatest of\n     my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck."\n                (As You Like It, Act 3, Sc. 2.)\n\nin short, an ideal proletarian from the point of view of the aristocrat.\n\nThe "Winter\'s Tale" can boast of another good shepherd (Act 3, Sc. 3),\nbut he savors a little of burlesque. "Macbeth" has several humble\nworthies. There is a good old man in the second act (Sc. 2), and a good\nmessenger in the fourth (Sc. 2). King Duncan praises highly the sergeant\nwho brings the news of Macbeth\'s victory, and uses language to him such\nas Shakespeare\'s yeomen are not accustomed to hear (Act 1, Sc. 2). And\nin "Antony and Cleopatra" we make the acquaintance of several exemplary\ncommon soldiers. Shakespeare puts flattering words into the mouth of\nHenry V. when he addresses the troops before Agincourt:\n\n    "For he to-day that sheds his blood with me\n     Shall be my brother; be he ne\'er so vile\n     This day shall gentle his condition."\n                (Act 4, Sc. 4.)\n\nAnd at Harfleur he is even more complaisant:\n\n    "And you, good yeomen,\n     Whose limbs were made in England, shew us here\n     The metal of your pasture; let us swear\n     That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not,\n     For there is none of you so mean and base\n     That hath not noble luster in your eyes." (Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nThe rank and file always fare well before a battle.\n\n    "Oh, it\'s \'Tommy this\' and \'Tommy that\' an\' \'Tommy, go away\';\n     But it\'s \'Thank you, Mr. Atkins,\' when the band begins to play."\n\nI should like to add some instances from Shakespeare\'s works of serious\nand estimable behavior on the part of individuals representing the lower\nclasses, or of considerate treatment of them on the part of their\n"betters," but I have been unable to find any, and the meager list must\nend here.\n\nBut to return to Tommy Atkins. He is no longer Mr. Atkins after the\nbattle. Montjoy, the French herald, comes to the English king under a\nflag of truce and asks that they be permitted to bury their dead and\n\n    "Sort our nobles from our common men;\n     For many of our princes (wo the while!)\n     Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood;\n     So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs\n     In blood of princes." (Henry V., Act 4, Sc. 7.)\n\nWith equal courtesy Richard III., on Bosworth field, speaks of his\nopponents to the gentlemen around him:\n\n    "Remember what you are to cope withal--\n     A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,\n     A scum of Bretagne and base lackey peasants."\n                (Act 5, Sc. 3.)\n\nBut Shakespeare does not limit such epithets to armies. Having, as we\nhave seen, a poor opinion of the lower classes, taken man by man, he\nthinks, if anything, still worse of them taken _en masse_, and at his\nhands a crowd of plain workingmen fares worst of all. "Hempen\nhome-spuns," Puck calls them, and again\n\n    "A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,\n     That work for bread upon Athenian stalls."\n\nBottom, their leader, is, according to Oberon, a "hateful fool," and\naccording to Puck, the "shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort"\n(Midsummer Night\'s Dream, Act 3, Scs. 1 and 2, Act 4, Sc. 1). Bottom\'s\nadvice to his players contains a small galaxy of compliments:\n\n     "In any case let Thisby have clean linen, and let not him\n     that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out\n     for the lion\'s claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onion or\n     garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt\n     to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy."\n                (Ib., Act 4, Sc. 2.)\n\nThe matter of the breath of the poor weighs upon Shakespeare and his\ncharacters. Cleopatra shudders at the thought that\n\n         "mechanic slaves,\n    With greasy aprons, rules and hammers, shall\n    Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths\n    Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,\n    And forced to drink their vapor."\n                (Antony and Cleopatra, Act 5, Sc. 2.)\n\nCoriolanus has his sense of smell especially developed. He talks of the\n"stinking breaths" of the people (Act 2, Sc. 1), and in another place\nsays:\n\n    "You common cry of curs, whose breath I hate\n     As reek of rotten fens, whose love I prize\n     As the dead carcasses of unburied men\n     That do corrupt the air, I banish you,"\n\nand he goes on to taunt them with cowardice (Act 3, Sc. 3). They are the\n"mutable, rank-scented many" (Act 3, Sc. 1). His friend Menenius is\nequally complimentary to his fellow citizens. "You are they," says he,\n\n    "That make the air unwholesome, when you cast\n     Your stinking, greasy caps, in hooting at\n     Coriolanus\'s exile."\n                (Act 4, Sc. 7.)\n\nAnd he laughs at the "apron-men" of Cominius and their "breath of\ngarlic-eaters" (Act 4, Sc. 7). When Coriolanus is asked to address the\npeople, he replies by saying: "Bid them wash their faces, and keep their\nteeth clean" (Act 2, Sc. 3). According to Shakespeare, the Roman\npopulace had made no advance in cleanliness in the centuries between\nCoriolanus and Caesar. Casca gives a vivid picture of the offer of the\ncrown to Julius, and his rejection of it: "And still as he refused it\nthe rabblement shouted, and clapped their chapped hands, and threw up\ntheir sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of stinking breath,\nbecause Caesar refused the crown, that it had almost choked Caesar, for he\nswooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part I durst not laugh,\nfor fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air." And he calls\nthem the "tag-rag people" (Julius Caesar, Act 1, Sc. 2). The play of\n"Coriolanus" is a mine of insults to the people and it becomes tiresome\nto quote them. The hero calls them the "beast with many heads" (Act 4,\nSc. 3), and again he says to the crowd:\n\n    "What\'s the matter, you dissentious rogues,\n     That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion\n     Make yourself scabs?\n\n    First Citizen. We have ever your good word.\n\n    Coriolanus. He that will give good words to ye will flatter\n     Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,\n     That like not peace nor war? The one affrights you,\n     The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,\n     Where he would find you lions, finds you hares;\n     Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,\n     Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,\n     Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is\n     To make him worthy whose offense subdues him,\n     And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness\n     Deserves your hate; and your affections are\n     A sick man\'s appetite, who desires most that\n     Which would increase his evil. He that depends\n     Upon your favors, swims with fins of lead,\n     And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?\n     With every minute you do change a mind,\n     And call him noble that was now your hate,\n     Him vile that was your garland."\n                (Act 1, Sc. 1.)\n\nHis mother, Volumnia, is of like mind. She calls the people "our general\nlouts" (Act 3, Sc. 2). She says to Junius Brutus, the tribune of the\npeople:\n\n    "\'Twas you incensed the rabble,\n     Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth\n     As I can of those mysteries which Heaven\n     Will not leave Earth to know."\n                (Act 4, Sc. 2).\n\nIn the same play Cominius talks of the "dull tribunes" and "fusty\nplebeians" (Act 1, Sc. 9). Menenius calls them "beastly plebeians" (Act\n2, Sc. 1), refers to their "multiplying spawn" (Act 2, Sc. 2), and says\nto the crowd:\n\n     "Rome and her rats are at the point of battle."\n                (Act 1, Sc. 2).\n\nThe dramatist makes the mob cringe before Coriolanus. When he appears,\nthe stage directions show that the "citizens steal away." (Act 1, Sc.\n1.)\n\nAs the Roman crowd of the time of Coriolanus is fickle, so is that of\nCaesar\'s. Brutus and Antony sway them for and against his assassins with\nease:\n\n      "First Citizen. This Caesar was a tyrant.\n\n       Second Citizen. Nay, that\'s certain.\n    We are blessed that Rome is rid of him....\n\n       First Citizen. (After hearing a description of the murder.)\n    O piteous spectacle!\n\n       2 Cit. O noble Caesar!\n\n       3 Cit. O woful day!\n\n       4 Cit. O traitors, villains!\n\n       1 Cit. O most bloody sight!\n\n       2 Cit. We will be revenged; revenge! about--seek--burn,\n    fire--kill--slay--let not a traitor live!" (Act 3, Sc. 2.)\n\nThe Tribune Marullus reproaches them with having forgotten Pompey, and\ncalls them\n\n    "You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things."\n\nHe persuades them not to favor Caesar, and when they leave him he asks\nhis fellow tribune, Flavius,\n\n    "See, whe\'r their basest metal be not moved?"\n                (Act 1, Sc. 1.)\n\nFlavius also treats them with scant courtesy:\n\n    "Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.\n     Is this a holiday? What! you know not,\n     Being mechanical, you ought not walk\n     Upon a laboring day without the sign\n     Of your profession?"\n                (Ib.)\n\nThe populace of England is as changeable as that of Rome, if Shakespeare\nis to be believed. The Archbishop of York, who had espoused the cause of\nRichard II. against Henry IV., thus soliloquizes:\n\n    "The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;\n     Their over greedy love hath surfeited;\n     An habitation giddy and unsure\n     Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.\n     O thou fond many! With what loud applause\n     Didst thou beat Heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,\n     Before he was what thou would\'st have him be!\n     And now being trimmed in thine own desires,\n     Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,\n     That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.\n     So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge\n     Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard,\n     And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,\n     And howlst to find it."\n                (Henry IV., Part 2, Act 1, Sc. 3.)\n\nGloucester in "Henry VI." (Part 2, Act 2, Sc. 4) notes the fickleness of\nthe masses. He says, addressing his absent wife:\n\n    "Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook\n     The abject people, gazing on thy face\n     With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,\n     That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels\n     When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets."\n\nWhen she arrives upon the scene in disgrace, she says to him:\n\n         "Look how they gaze;\n    See how the giddy multitude do point\n    And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee.\n    Ah, Gloster, hide thee from their hateful looks."\n\nAnd she calls the crowd a "rabble" (Ib.), a term also used in "Hamlet"\n(Act 4, Sc. 5). Again, in part III. of "Henry VI.," Clifford, dying on\nthe battlefield while fighting for King Henry, cries:\n\n    "The common people swarm like summer flies,\n     And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?\n     And who shines now but Henry\'s enemies?"\n                (Act 2, Sc. 6.)\n\nAnd Henry himself, conversing with the keepers who have imprisoned him\nin the name of Edward IV., says:\n\n    "Ah, simple men! you know not what you swear.\n     Look, as I blow this feather from my face,\n     And as the air blows it to me again,\n     Obeying with my wind when I do blow,\n     And yielding to another when it blows,\n     Commanded always by the greater gust,\n     Such is the lightness of you common men."\n                (Ib., Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nSuffolk, in the First Part of the same trilogy (Act 5, Sc. 5), talks of\n"worthless peasants," meaning, perhaps, "property-less peasants," and\nwhen Salisbury comes to present the demands of the people, he calls him\n\n         "the Lord Ambassador\n    Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king,"\n                (Part 2, Act 3, Sc. 2.)\n\nand says:\n\n    "\'Tis like the Commons, rude unpolished hinds\n     Could send such message to their sovereign."\n\nCardinal Beaufort mentions the "uncivil kernes of Ireland" (Ib., Part 2,\nAct 3, Sc. 1), and in the same play the crowd makes itself ridiculous by\nshouting, "A miracle," when the fraudulent beggar Simpcox, who had\npretended to be lame and blind, jumps over a stool to escape a whipping\n(Act 2, Sc. 1). Queen Margaret receives petitioners with the words\n"Away, base cullions" (Ib., Act 1, Sc. 3), and among other flattering\nremarks applied here and there to the lower classes we may cite the\nepithets "ye rascals, ye rude slaves," addressed to a crowd by a porter\nin Henry VIII., and that of "lazy knaves" given by the Lord Chamberlain\nto the porters for having let in a "trim rabble" (Act 5, Sc. 3). Hubert,\nin King John, presents us with an unvarnished picture of the common\npeople receiving the news of Prince Arthur\'s death:\n\n    "I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,\n     The whilst his iron did on his anvil cool,\n     With open mouth swallowing a tailor\'s news;\n     Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,\n     Standing on slippers (which his nimble haste\n     Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet),\n     Told of a many thousand warlike French\n     That were embattailed and rank\'d in Kent.\n     Another lean, unwashed artificer,\n     Cuts off his tale, and talks of Arthur\'s death."\n                (Act 4, Sc. 2.)\n\nMacbeth, while sounding the murderers whom he intends to employ, and who\nsay to him, "We are men, my liege," answers:\n\n    "Ay, in the catalogue, ye go for men\n     As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\n     Shoughs, water-sugs, and demi-wolves, are cleped\n     All by the name of dogs."\n                (Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nAs Coriolanus is held up to our view as a pattern of noble bearing\ntoward the people, so Richard II. condemns the courteous behavior of the\nfuture Henry IV. on his way into banishment. He says:\n\n    "Ourselves, and Bushy, Bagot here and Green\n     Observed his courtship to the common people;\n     How he did seem to dive into their hearts\n     With humble and familiar courtesy;\n     What reverence he did throw away on slaves;\n     Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles\n     And patient overbearing of his fortune,\n     As \'twere to banish their effects with him.\n     Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;\n     A brace of draymen did God speed him well\n     And had the tribute of his supple knee,\n     With \'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends.\'"\n                (Richard II., Act 1, Sc. 4.)\n\nThe King of France, in "All\'s Well that Ends Well," commends to Bertram\nthe example of his late father in his relations with his inferiors:\n\n    "Who were below him\n     He used as creatures of another place,\n     And bowed his eminent top to their low ranks,\n     Making them proud of his humility\n     In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\n     Might be a copy to these younger times."\n                (Act 1, Sc. 2.)\n\nShakespeare had no fondness for these "younger times," with their\nincreasing suggestion of democracy. Despising the masses, he had no\nsympathy with the idea of improving their condition or increasing their\npower. He saw the signs of the times with foreboding, as did his hero,\nHamlet:\n\n"By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it; the\nage has grown so picked, that the toe of the peasant comes so near the\nheel of the courtier, he galls his kibe." There can easily be too much\nliberty, according to Shakespeare--"too much liberty, my Lucio,\nliberty" (Measure for Measure, Act 1, Sc. 3), but the idea of too much\nauthority is foreign to him. Claudio, himself under arrest, sings its\npraises:\n\n         "Thus can the demi-god, Authority,\n    Make us pay down for our offense by weight,--\n    The words of Heaven;--on whom it will, it will;\n    On whom it will not, so; yet still \'tis just."\n                (Ib.)\n\nUlysses, in "Troilus and Cressida" (Act 1, Sc. 3), delivers a long\npanegyric upon authority, rank, and degree, which may be taken as\nShakespeare\'s confession of faith:\n\n         "Degree being vizarded,\n    Th\' unworthiest shews as fairly in the mask.\n    The heavens themselves, the planets, and this center,\n    Observe degree, priority, and place,\n    Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,\n    Office and custom, in all line of order;\n    And therefore is the glorious planet, Sol,\n    In noble eminence enthroned and sphered\n    Amidst the other; whose med\'cinable eye\n    Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,\n    And posts, like the commandments of a king,\n    Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets,\n    In evil mixture, to disorder wander,\n    What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!\n    What raging of the sea, shaking of the earth,\n    Commotion of the winds, frights, changes, horrors,\n    Divert and crack, rend and deracinate\n    The unity and married calm of states\n    Quite from their fixture! Oh, when degree is shaked,\n    Which is the ladder of all high designs,\n    The enterprise is sick. How could communities,\n    Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,\n    Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,\n    The primogenity and due of birth,\n    Prerogative of age, crowns, scepters, laurels,\n    But by degree stand in authentic place?\n    Take but degree away, untune the string,\n    And hark, what discord follows! each thing meets\n    In mere oppugnancy; the bounded waters\n    Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,\n    And make a sop of all this solid globe;\n    Strength should be lord of imbecility,\n    And the rude son should strike his father dead;\n    Force should be right; or, rather, right and wrong,\n    (Between whose endless jar justice resides)\n    Should lose their names, and so should justice too.\n    Then everything includes itself in power.\n    Power into will, will into appetite;\n    And appetite, a universal wolf,\n    So doubly seconded with will and power,\n    Must make perforce an universal prey,\n    And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,\n    This chaos, when degree is suffocate,\n    Follows the choking;\n    And this neglection of degree it is,\n    That by a pace goes backward, in a purpose\n    It hath to climb. The General\'s disdained\n    By him one step below; he by the next;\n    That next by him beneath; so every step,\n    Exampled by the first pace that is sick\n    Of his superiors, grows to an envious fever\n    Of pale and bloodless emulation;\n    And \'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,\n    Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,\n    Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength."\n\nThere is no hint in this eloquent apostrophe of the difficulty of\ndetermining among men who shall be the sun and who the satellite, nor of\nthe fact that the actual arrangements, in Shakespeare\'s time, at any\nrate, depended altogether upon that very force which Ulysses\ndeprecates. In another scene in the same play the wily Ithacan again\ngives way to his passion for authority and eulogizes somewhat\nextravagantly the paternal, prying, omnipresent State:\n\n    "The providence that\'s in a watchful state\n     Knows almost every grain of Plutus\' gold,\n     Finds bottom in th\' incomprehensive deeps,\n     Keeps place with thought, and almost, like the gods,\n     Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.\n     There is a mystery (with which relation\n     Durst never meddle) in the soul of state,\n     Which hath an operation more divine\n     Than breath or pen can give expressure to."\n                (Act 3, Sc. 3.)\n\nThe State to which Ulysses refers is of course a monarchical State, and\nthe idea of democracy is abhorrent to Shakespeare. Coriolanus expresses\nhis opinion of it when he says to the people:\n\n                 "What\'s the matter,\n    That in these several places of the city\n    You cry against the noble Senate, who,\n    Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else\n    Would feed on one another?"\n                (Act 2, Sc. 1.)\n\nThe people should have no voice in the government--\n\n             "This double worship,--\n    Where one part does disdain with cause, the other\n    Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,\n    Can not conclude, but by the yea and no\n    Of general ignorance,--it must omit\n    Real necessities, and give away the while\n    To unstable slightness. Purpose so barred, it follows,\n    Nothing is done to purpose; therefore, beseech you,\n    You that will be less fearful than discreet,\n    That love the fundamental part of state\n    More than you doubt the change on\'t, that prefer\n    A noble life before a long, and wish\n    To jump a body with a dangerous physic\n    That\'s sure of death without it, at once pluck out\n    The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick\n    The sweet which is their poison."\n                (Ib. Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nIt is the nobility who should rule--\n\n    "It is a purposed thing and grows by plot\n     To curb the will of the nobility;\n     Suffer\'t and live with such as can not rule,\n     Nor ever will be ruled."\n                (Ib.)\n\nJunius Brutus tries in vain to argue with him, but Coriolanus has no\npatience with him, a "triton of the minnows"; and the very fact that\nthere should be tribunes appointed for the people disgusts him--\n\n    "Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,\n     Of their own choice; one\'s Junius Brutus,\n     Sicinus Velutus, and I know not--\'Sdeath!\n     The rabble should have first unroofed the city,\n     Ere so prevailed with me; it will in time\n     Win upon power, and throw forth greater themes."\n\nAnd again:\n\n    "The common file, a plague!--Tribunes for them!"\n                (Act 1, Sc. 6.)\n\nShakespeare took his material for the drama of "Coriolanus" from\nPlutarch\'s "Lives," and it is significant that he selected from that\nlist of worthies the most conspicuous adversary of the commonalty that\nRome produced. He presents him to us as a hero, and, so far as he can,\nenlists our sympathy for him from beginning to end. When Menenius says\nof him:\n\n    "His nature is too noble for the world,"\n                (Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nhe is evidently but registering the verdict of the author. Plutarch\'s\ntreatment of Coriolanus is far different. He exhibits his fine\nqualities, but he does not hesitate to speak of his "imperious temper\nand that savage manner which was too haughty for a republic." "Indeed,"\nhe adds, "there is no other advantage to be had from a liberal education\nequal to that of polishing and softening our nature by reason and\ndiscipline." He also tells us that Coriolanus indulged his "irascible\npassions on a supposition that they have something great and exalted in\nthem," and that he wanted "a due mixture of gravity and mildness, which\nare the chief political virtues and the fruits of reason and education."\n"He never dreamed that such obstinacy is rather the effect of the\nweakness and effeminacy of a distempered mind, which breaks out in\nviolent passions like so many tumors." Nor apparently did Shakespeare\never dream of it either, altho he had Plutarch\'s sage observations\nbefore him. It is a pity that the great dramatist did not select from\nPlutarch\'s works some hero who took the side of the people, some Agis or\nCleomenes, or, better yet, one of the Gracchi. What a tragedy he might\nhave based on the life of Tiberius, the friend of the people and the\nmartyr in their cause! But the spirit which guided Schiller in the\nchoice of William Tell for a hero was a stranger to Shakespeare\'s heart,\nand its promptings would have met with no response there.\n\nEven more striking is the treatment which the author of "Coriolanus"\nmetes out to English history. All but two of his English historical\ndramas are devoted to the War of the Roses and the incidental struggle\nover the French crown. The motive of this prolonged strife--so\nattractive to Shakespeare--had much the same dignity which distinguishes\nthe family intrigues of the Sublime Porte, and Shakespeare presents the\nhistory of his country as a mere pageant of warring royalties and their\ntrains. When the people are permitted to appear, as they do in Cade\'s\nrebellion, to which Shakespeare has assigned the character of the rising\nunder Wat Tyler, they are made the subject of burlesque. Two of the\npopular party speak as follows:\n\n       "John Holland. Well, I say, it was never merry world in\n     England since gentlemen came up.\n\n       George Bevis. O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in\n     handicraftsmen.\n\n       John. The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons."\n\nWhen Jack Cade, alias Wat Tyler, comes on the scene, he shows himself to\nbe a braggart and a fool. He says:\n\n     "Be brave then, for your captain is brave and vows\n     reformation. There shall be in England seven half-penny\n     loaves sold for a penny; the three-hooped pot shall have ten\n     hoops, and I will make it a felony to drink small beer. All\n     the realm shall be in common, and in Cheapside shall my\n     palfrey go to grass. And when I am king asking I will be--\n\n       All. God save your majesty!\n\n       Cade. I thank you, good people--there shall be no money; all\n     shall eat and drink on my score, and I will apparel them all\n     in one livery, that they may agree like brothers and worship\n     me their lord."\n                (Henry VI., Part 2, Act 4, Sc. 2.)\n\nThe crowd wishes to kill the clerk of Chatham because he can read,\nwrite, and cast accounts. (Cade. "O monstrous!") Sir Humphrey Stafford\ncalls them\n\n    "Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,\n     Marked for the gallows."\n                (Ib.)\n\nClifford succeeds without much difficulty in turning the enmity of the\nmob against France, and Cade ejaculates disconsolately, "Was ever a\nfeather so lightly blown to and fro as this multitude?" (Ib., Act 4, Sc.\n8.) In the stage directions of this scene, Shakespeare shows his own\nopinion of the mob by writing, "Enter Cade and his rabblement." One\nlooks in vain here as in the Roman plays for a suggestion that poor\npeople sometimes suffer wrongfully from hunger and want, that they\noccasionally have just grievances, and that their efforts to present\nthem, so far from being ludicrous, are the most serious parts of\nhistory, beside which the struttings of kings and courtiers sink into\ninsignificance.\n\nOne of the popular songs in Tyler\'s rebellion was the familiar couplet:\n\n    "When Adam delved and Eve span,\n     Who was then the gentleman?"\n\nShakespeare refers to it in "Hamlet," where the grave-diggers speak as\nfollows:\n\n       "First Clown. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentleman\n     but gardners, ditchers and grave-makers; they hold up Adam\'s\n     profession.\n\n       Second Clown. Was he a gentleman?\n\n       First Clown. He was the first that ever bore arms.\n\n       Second Clown. Why, he had none.\n\n       First Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand\n     the Scripture? The Scripture says, Adam digged; could he dig\n     without arms?"\n                (Act 5, Sc. 1.)\n\nThat Shakespeare\'s caricature of Tyler\'s rebellion is a fair indication\nof his view of all popular risings appears from the remarks addressed by\nWestmoreland to the Archbishop of York in the Second Part of "Henry IV."\n(Act 4, Sc. 1). Says he:\n\n              "If that rebellion\n    Came like itself, in base and abject routs,\n    Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,\n    And countenanced by boys and beggary;\n    I say if damned commotion so appeared,\n    In his true, native, and most proper shape,\n    You, Reverend Father, and these noble lords\n    Had not been here to dress the ugly form\n    Of base and bloody insurrection\n    With your fair honors."\n\nThe first and last of Shakespeare\'s English historical plays, "King\nJohn" and "Henry VIII.," lie beyond the limits of the civil wars, and\neach of them treats of a period momentous in the annals of English\nliberty, a fact which Shakespeare absolutely ignores. John as king had\ntwo great misfortunes--he suffered disgrace at the hands of his barons\nand of the pope. The first event, the wringing of Magna Charta from the\nking, Shakespeare passes over. A sense of national pride might have\nexcused the omission of the latter humiliation, but no, it was a triumph\nof authority, and as such Shakespeare must record it for the edification\nof his hearers, and consequently we have the king presented on the stage\nas meekly receiving the crown from the papal legate (Act 5, Sc. 1).\nEngland was freed from the Roman yoke in the reign of Henry VIII., and\nin the drama of that name Shakespeare might have balanced the indignity\nforced upon King John, but now he is silent. Nothing must be said\nagainst authority, even against that of the pope, and the play\nculminates in the pomp and parade of the christening of the infant\nElizabeth! Such is Shakespeare\'s conception of history! Who could guess\nfrom reading these English historical plays that throughout the period\nwhich they cover English freedom was growing, that justice and the\nrights of man were asserting themselves, while despotism was gradually\ncurbed and limited? This is the one great glory of English history,\nexhibiting itself at Runnymede, reflected in Wyclif and John Ball and\nWat Tyler, and shining dimly in the birth of a national church under the\neighth Henry. As Shakespeare wrote, it was preparing for a new and\nconspicuous outburst. When he died, Oliver Cromwell was already\nseventeen years of age and John Hampden twenty-two. The spirit of\nHampden was preeminently the English spirit--the spirit which has given\ndistinction to the Anglo-Saxon race--and he and Shakespeare were\ncontemporaries, and yet of this spirit not a vestige is to be found in\nthe English historical plays and no opportunities lost to obliterate or\ndistort its manifestations. Only in Brutus and his\nfellow-conspirators--of all Shakespearian characters--do we find the\nleast consideration for liberty, and even then he makes the common, and\nperhaps in his time the unavoidable, mistake of overlooking the\ngenuinely democratic leanings of Julius Caesar and the anti-popular\ncharacter of the successful plot against him.\n\nIt has in all ages been a pastime of noble minds to try to depict a\nperfect state of society. Forty years before Shakespeare\'s birth, Sir\nThomas More published his "Utopia" to the world. Bacon intended to do\nthe same thing in the "New Atlantis," but never completed the work,\nwhile Sir Philip Sidney gives us his dream in his "Arcadia." Montaigne\nmakes a similar essay, and we quote from Florio\'s translation, published\nin 1603, the following passage (Montaigne\'s "Essays," Book I, Chapter\n30):\n\n"It is a nation, would I answer Plato, that hath no kind of traffic, no\nknowledge of letters, no intelligence of numbers, no name of magistrate\nnor of political superiority; no use of service, of riches, or of\npoverty; no contracts, no succession, no dividences; no occupation, but\nidle; no respect of kindred, but common; no apparel, but natural; no\nmanuring of lands; no use of wine, corn, or metal. The very words that\nimport lying, falsehood, treason, dissimulation, covetousness, envy,\ndetraction, and pardon were never heard among them."\n\nWe may readily infer that Shakespeare found little to sympathize with in\nthis somewhat extravagant outline of a happy nation, but he goes out of\nhis way to travesty it. In "The Tempest" he makes Gonzalo, the noblest\ncharacter in the play, hold the following language to the inevitable\nking (Shakespeare can not imagine even a desert island without a king!):\n\n    "Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,\n     I\' th\' commonwealth I would by contraries\n     Execute all things; for no kind of traffic\n     Would I admit; no name of magistrate;\n     Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,\n     And use of service, none; contract, succession,\n     Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\n     No use of metal, corn or wine or oil;\n     No occupation; all men idle,--all,\n     And women too, but innocent and pure;\n     No sovereignty, ...\n\n       Sebastian. Yet he would be king on\'t.\n\n       Antonia. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets\n     the beginning.\n\n       Gonzalo. All things in common. Nature should produce\n     Without sweat or endeavor; treason, felony,\n     Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,\n     Would I not have; but Nature should bring forth\n     Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,\n     To feed my innocent people.\n\n       Seb. No marrying \'mong his subjects?\n\n       Ant. None, man; all idle, whores, and knaves.\n\n       Gon. I would with such perfection govern, sir,\n     To \'xcel the golden age.\n\n       Seb. \'Save his Majesty!\n\n       Ant. Long live Gonzalo!\n\n       Gon. And do you mark me, sir?\n\n       King. Pr\'ythee, no more; thou dost talk nothing to me.\n\n       Gon. I do well believe your Highness; and did it to\n     minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such\n     sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh\n     at nothing.\n\n       Ant. \'Twas you we laughed at.\n\n       Gon. Who, in this kind of merry fooling, am nothing\n     to you; so you may continue and laugh at nothing still."\n                (Tempest, Act 2, Sc. 1.)\n\nThat all things are not for the best in the best of all possible worlds\nwould seem to result from the wise remarks made by the fishermen who\nenliven the scene in "Pericles, Prince of Tyre." They compare landlords\nto whales who swallow up everything, and suggest that the land be purged\nof "these drones that rob the bee of her honey"; and Pericles, so far\nfrom being shocked at such revolutionary and vulgar sentiments, is\nimpressed by their weight, and speaks kindly of the humble philosophers,\nwho in their turn are hospitable to the shipwrecked prince--all of which\nun-Shakespearian matter adds doubt to the authenticity of this drama\n(Act 2, Sc. 1).\n\nHowever keen the insight of Shakespeare may have been into the hearts of\nhis high-born characters, he had no conception of the unity of the human\nrace. For him the prince and the peasant were not of the same blood.\n\n           "For princes are\n    A model, which heaven makes like to itself,"\n\nsays King Simonides in "Pericles," and here at least we seem to see the\nhand of Shakespeare (Act 2, Sc. 2). The two princes, Guiderius and\nArviragus, brought up secretly in a cave, show their royal origin\n(Cymbeline, Act 3, Sc. 3), and the servants who see Coriolanus in\ndisguise are struck by his noble figure (Coriolanus, Act 4, Sc. 5).\nBastards are villains as a matter of course, witness Edmund in "Lear"\nand John in "Much Ado about Nothing," and no degree of contempt is too\nhigh for a\n\n          "hedge-born swain\n    That doth presume to boast of gentle blood."\n                (Henry VI., Part 1, Act 4, Sc. 1.)\n\nCourage is only to be expected in the noble-born. The Duke of York says:\n\n    "Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,\n     And find no harbor in a royal heart."\n                (Henry VI., Part 2, Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nIn so far as the lower classes had any relation to the upper classes, it\nwas one, thought Shakespeare, of dependence and obligation. It was not\nthe tiller of the soil who fed the lord of the manor, but rather the\nlord who supported the peasant. Does not the king have to lie awake and\ntake thought for his subjects? Thus Henry V. complains that he can not\nsleep\n\n              "so soundly as the wretched slave,\n    Who with a body filled and vacant mind,\n    Gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread,\n    Never sees horrid night, the child of Hell,\n    But like a lackey, from the rise to set,\n    Sweats in the eye of Phoebus, and all night\n    Sleeps in Elysium....\n    The slave, a member of the country\'s peace,\n    Enjoys it, but in gross brain little wots\n    What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,\n    Whose hours the peasant best advantages."\n                (Henry V., Act 4, Sc. 1.)\n\nAnd these lines occur at the end of a passage in which the king laments\nthe "ceremony" that oppresses him and confesses that but for it he would\nbe "but a man." He makes this admission, however, in a moment of danger\nand depression. Henry IV. also invokes sleep (Part 2, Act 2, Sc. 1):\n\n    "O thou dull god! why liest thou with the vile\n     In loathsome beds?"\n\nBut plain people have to watch at times, and the French sentinel finds\noccasion to speak in the same strain:\n\n         "Thus are poor servitors\n    (When others sleep upon their quiet beds)\n    Constrained to watch in darkness, rain, and cold."\n                (Henry VI., Part 1, Act 2, Sc. 1.)\n\nHenry VI. is also attracted by the peasant\'s lot:\n\n    "O God, methinks it were a happy life,\n     To be no better than a homely swain....\n     ... The shepherd\'s homely curds,\n     His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,\n     His wonted sleep under a fresh tree\'s shade,\n     All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,\n     As far beyond a prince\'s delicates."\n                (Henry VI., Part 3, Act 2, Sc. 5.)\n\nAll of which is natural enough, but savors of cant in the mouths of men\nwho fought long and hard to maintain themselves upon their thrones.\n\nWe have already shown by references to the contemporary drama that the\nplea of custom is not sufficient to explain Shakespeare\'s attitude to\nthe lower classes, but if we widen our survey to the entire field of\nEnglish letters in his day, we shall see that he was running counter to\nall the best traditions of our literature. From the time of Piers\nPlowman down, the peasant had stood high with the great writers of\npoetry and prose alike. Chaucer\'s famous circle of story-tellers at the\nTabard Inn in Southwark was eminently democratic. With the knight and\nthe friar were gathered together\n\n    "An haberdasher and a carpenter,\n     A webbe, a deyer and tapiser,"\n\nand the tales of the cook and the miller take rank with those of the\nsquire and lawyer. The English Bible, too, was in Shakespeare\'s hands,\nand he must have been familiar with shepherd kings and\nfishermen-apostles. In the very year in which "Hamlet" first appeared, a\nwork was published in Spain which was at once translated into English, a\nwork as well known to-day as Shakespeare\'s own writings. If the\npeasantry was anywhere to be neglected and despised, where should it be\nrather than in proud, aristocratic Spain, and yet, to place beside\nShakespeare\'s Bottoms and Slys, Cervantes has given us the admirable\nSancho Panza, and has spread his loving humor in equal measure over\nservant and master. Are we to believe that the yeomen of England, who\nbeat back the Armada, were inferior to the Spanish peasantry whom they\novercame, or is it not rather true that the Spanish author had a deeper\ninsight into his country\'s heart than was allotted to the English\ndramatist? Cervantes, the soldier and adventurer, rose above the\nprejudices of his class, while Shakespeare never lifted his eyes beyond\nthe narrow horizon of the Court to which he catered. It was love that\nopened Cervantes\'s eye, and it is in all-embracing love that Shakespeare\nwas deficient. As far as the common people were concerned, he never held\nthe mirror up to nature.\n\nBut the book of all others which might have suggested to Shakespeare\nthat there was more in the claims of the lower classes than was dreamt\nof in his philosophy was More\'s "Utopia," which in its English form was\nalready a classic. More, the richest and most powerful man in England\nafter the king, not only believed in the workingman, but knew that he\nsuffered from unjust social conditions. He could never have represented\nthe down-trodden followers of Cade-Tyler nor the hungry mob in\n"Coriolanus" with the utter lack of sympathy which Shakespeare\nmanifests. "What justice is there in this," asks the great Lord\nChancellor, whose character stood the test of death--"what justice is\nthere in this, that a nobleman, a goldsmith, a banker, or any other man,\nthat either does nothing at all or at best is employed in things that\nare of no use to the public, should live in great luxury and splendor\nupon what is so ill acquired; and a mean man, a carter, a smith, a\nplowman, that works harder even than the beasts themselves, and is\nemployed on labors so necessary that no commonwealth could hold out a\nyear without them, can only earn so poor a livelihood, and must lead so\nmiserable a life, that the condition of the beasts is much better than\ntheirs?"\n\nHow different from this is Shakespeare\'s conception of the place of the\nworkingman in society! After a full and candid survey of his plays,\nBottom, the weaver with the ass\'s head, remains his type of the artizan\nand the "mutable, rank-scented many," his type of the masses. Is it\nunfair to take the misshapen "servant-monster" Caliban as his last word\non the subject?\n\n      "Prospero. We\'ll visit Caliban my slave who never\n    Yields us kind answer.\n\n      Miranda. \'Tis a villain, sir,\n    I do not love to look on.\n\n      Prospero. But as \'tis,\n    We can not miss him! he does make our fire,\n    Fetch in our wood, and serve in offices\n    That profit us." (Tempest, Act 1, Sc. 2.)\n\nTo which I would fain reply in the words of Edward Carpenter:\n\n    "Who art thou ...\n     With thy faint sneer for him who wins thee bread\n     And him who clothes thee, and for him who toils\n     Day-long and night-long dark in the earth for thee?"\n\n\n\n\nLETTER FROM MR. G. BERNARD SHAW\n\n(Extracts)\n\n\nAs you know, I have striven hard to open English eyes to the emptiness\nof Shakespeare\'s philosophy, to the superficiality and second-handedness\nof his morality, to his weakness and incoherence as a thinker, to his\nsnobbery, his vulgar prejudices, his ignorance, his disqualifications of\nall sorts for the philosophic eminence claimed for him.... The preface\nto my "Three Plays for Puritans" contains a section headed "Better than\nShakespeare?" which is, I think, the only utterance of mine on the\nsubject to be found in a book.... There is at present in the press a new\npreface to an old novel of mine called "The Irrational Knot." In that\npreface I define the first order in Literature as consisting of those\nworks in which the author, instead of accepting the current morality and\nreligion ready-made without any question as to their validity, writes\nfrom an original moral standpoint of his own, thereby making his book an\noriginal contribution to morals, religion, and sociology, as well as to\n_belles letters_. I place Shakespeare with Dickens, Scott, Dumas pere,\netc., in the second order, because, tho they are enormously\nentertaining, their morality is ready-made; and I point out that the one\nplay, "Hamlet," in which Shakespeare made an attempt to give as a hero\none who was dissatisfied with the ready-made morality, is the one which\nhas given the highest impression of his genius, altho Hamlet\'s revolt is\nunskillfully and inconclusively suggested and not worked out with any\nphilosophic competence.[4]\n\nMay I suggest that you should be careful not to imply that Tolstoy\'s\ngreat Shakespearian heresy has no other support than mine. The preface\nof Nicholas Rowe to his edition of Shakespeare, and the various prefaces\nof Dr. Johnson contain, on Rowe\'s part, an apology for him as a writer\nwith obvious and admitted shortcomings (very ridiculously ascribed by\nRowe to his working by "a mere light of nature"), and, on Johnson\'s, a\ngood deal of downright hard-hitting criticism. You should also look up\nthe history of the Ireland forgeries, unless, as is very probable,\nTolstoy has anticipated you in this. Among nineteenth-century poets\nByron and William Morris saw clearly that Shakespeare was enormously\noverrated intellectually. A French book, which has been translated into\nEnglish, has appeared within the last ten years, giving Napoleon\'s\nopinions of the drama. His insistence on the superiority of Corneille to\nShakespeare on the ground of Corneille\'s power of grasping a political\nsituation, and of seeing men in their relation to the state, is\ninteresting.\n\nOf course you know about Voltaire\'s criticisms, which are the more\nnoteworthy because Voltaire began with an extravagant admiration for\nShakespeare, and got more and more bitter against him as he grew older\nand less disposed to accept artistic merit as a cover for philosophic\ndeficiencies.\n\nFinally, I, for one, shall value Tolstoy\'s criticism all the more\nbecause it is criticism of a foreigner who can not possibly be enchanted\nby the mere word-music which makes Shakespeare so irresistible in\nEngland.[5] In Tolstoy\'s estimation, Shakespeare must fall or stand as a\nthinker, in which capacity I do not think he will stand a moment\'s\nexamination from so tremendously keen a critic and religious realist.\nUnfortunately, the English worship their great artists quite\nindiscriminately and abjectly; so that is quite impossible to make them\nunderstand that Shakespeare\'s extraordinary literary power, his fun, his\nmimicry, and the endearing qualities that earned him the title of "the\ngentle Shakespeare"--all of which, whatever Tolstoy may say, are quite\nunquestionable facts--do not stand or fall with his absurd reputation as\na thinker. Tolstoy will certainly treat that side of his reputation with\nthe severity it deserves; and you will find that the English press will\ninstantly announce that Tolstoy considers his own works greater than\nShakespeare\'s (which in some respects they most certainly are, by the\nway), and that he has attempted to stigmatize our greatest poet as a\nliar, a thief, a forger, a murderer, an incendiary, a drunkard, a\nlibertine, a fool, a madman, a coward, a vagabond, and even a man of\nquestionable gentility. You must not be surprised or indignant at this:\nit is what is called "dramatic criticism" in England and America. Only a\nfew of the best of our journalist-critics will say anything worth\nreading on the subject.\n\n        Yours faithfully,\n                G. BERNARD SHAW.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[4] Besides the prefaces here referred to, Mr. G. Bernard Shaw has at\nvarious times written other articles on the subject.--(V.

By certain external signs--movements,\n     lines, colors, sounds or arrangements of words--an artist\n     infects other people so that they share his feelings; thus,\n     "art is a means of union among men, joining them together\n     in the same feeling." Without adequate expression there is\n     no art, for there is no infection, no transference to\n     others of the author\'s feeling. The test of art is\n     infection. If an author has moved you so that you feel as\n     he felt, if you are so united to him in feeling that it\n     seems to you that he has expressed just what you have long\n     wished to express, the work that has so infected you is a\n     work of art.\n\n     A POWERFUL WORK FULL OF GENIUS AND ORIGINALITY\n\n          "The powerful personality of the author, the\n          startling originality of his views, grip the\n          reader and carry him, though his deepest\n          convictions be outraged, protesting through the\n          book."--_Pall Mall Gazette._\n\n          "The discussion is bound to shake the whole world\n          to its very center, and to result in a\n          considerable readjustment of\n          theories."--_Pittsburg Times._\n\n          "It is the ablest and most scholarly writing of a\n          great thinker."--_Chicago Inter Ocean._\n\n          "No recent book on the subject is so novel, so\n          readable, or so questionable."--_New York Times\n          Saturday Review._\n\n     Small 12mo, Cloth, 268 pp. 80 cts., post-paid\n\n     FUNK & WAGNALLS COMPANY, Publishers\n     NEW YORK and LONDON\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n  | Transcriber\'s Notes:                                         |\n  |                                                              |\n  | Page 7: Double quotes inside double quotes in Hallam         |\n  | quotation replaced with single quotes.                       |\n  | Page 9: Closing quotes moved from after "says Brandes" to    |\n  | follow "... at the sight."                                   |\n  | Page 20: strangset amended to strangest                      |\n  | Page 56: insteading amended to instead                       |\n  | Page 72: be amended to he ("he begins")                      |\n  | Page 80: "... the then fashionable euphemism": There is a    |\n  | possibility that "euphuism" should have been used, rather    |\n  | than "euphemism."                                            |\n  | Page 96: Closing quotes added after "... an artistic         |\n  | impression."                                                 |\n  | Page 102: Beaudelaire _sic_                                  |\n  | Page 165: Mirander amended to Miranda                        |\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\n'b'\n\n\n\n\n\n  +------------------------------------------------------------+\n  | Transcriber\'s Note:                                        |\n  |                                                            |\n  | Obvious typographical errors have been corrected in        |\n  | this text.

BERNARD SHAW,                             166\n\n\n\n\nPART I\n\nTOLSTOY ON SHAKESPEARE\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nMr. Crosby\'s article[1] on Shakespeare\'s attitude toward the working\nclasses suggested to me the idea of also expressing my own\nlong-established opinion about the works of Shakespeare, in direct\nopposition, as it is, to that established in all the whole European world.\nCalling to mind all the struggle of doubt and self-deceit,--efforts to\nattune myself to Shakespeare--which I went through owing to my complete\ndisagreement with this universal adulation, and, presuming that many have\nexperienced and are experiencing the same, I think that it may not be\nunprofitable to express definitely and frankly this view of mine, opposed\nto that of the majority, and the more so as the conclusions to which I\ncame, when examining the causes of my disagreement with the universally\nestablished opinion, are, it seems to me, not without interest and\nsignificance.\n\nMy disagreement with the established opinion about Shakespeare is not\nthe result of an accidental frame of mind, nor of a light-minded\nattitude toward the matter, but is the outcome of many years\' repeated\nand insistent endeavors to harmonize my own views of Shakespeare with\nthose established amongst all civilized men of the Christian world.\n\nI remember the astonishment I felt when I first read Shakespeare. I\nexpected to receive a powerful esthetic pleasure, but having read, one\nafter the other, works regarded as his best: "King Lear," "Romeo and\nJuliet," "Hamlet" and "Macbeth," not only did I feel no delight, but I\nfelt an irresistible repulsion and tedium, and doubted as to whether I\nwas senseless in feeling works regarded as the summit of perfection by\nthe whole of the civilized world to be trivial and positively bad, or\nwhether the significance which this civilized world attributes to the\nworks of Shakespeare was itself senseless. My consternation was\nincreased by the fact that I always keenly felt the beauties of\npoetry in every form; then why should artistic works recognized by the\nwhole world as those of a genius,--the works of Shakespeare,--not only\nfail to please me, but be disagreeable to me? For a long time I could\nnot believe in myself, and during fifty years, in order to test\nmyself, I several times recommenced reading Shakespeare in every\npossible form, in Russian, in English, in German and in Schlegel\'s\ntranslation, as I was advised. Several times I read the dramas and the\ncomedies and historical plays, and I invariably underwent the same\nfeelings: repulsion, weariness, and bewilderment. At the present time,\nbefore writing this preface, being desirous once more to test myself,\nI have, as an old man of seventy-five, again read the whole of\nShakespeare, including the historical plays, the "Henrys," "Troilus\nand Cressida," the "Tempest," "Cymbeline," and I have felt, with even\ngreater force, the same feelings,--this time, however, not of\nbewilderment, but of firm, indubitable conviction that the\nunquestionable glory of a great genius which Shakespeare enjoys, and\nwhich compels writers of our time to imitate him and readers and\nspectators to discover in him non-existent merits,--thereby\ndistorting their esthetic and ethical understanding,--is a great evil,\nas is every untruth.\n\nAltho I know that the majority of people so firmly believe in the\ngreatness of Shakespeare that in reading this judgment of mine they will\nnot admit even the possibility of its justice, and will not give it the\nslightest attention, nevertheless I will endeavor, as well as I can, to\nshow why I believe that Shakespeare can not be recognized either as a\ngreat genius, or even as an average author.\n\nFor illustration of my purpose I will take one of Shakespeare\'s most\nextolled dramas, "King Lear," in the enthusiastic praise of which, the\nmajority of critics agree.\n\n"The tragedy of Lear is deservedly celebrated among the dramas of\nShakespeare," says Dr. Johnson. "There is perhaps no play which keeps\nthe attention so strongly fixed, which so much agitates our passions,\nand interests our curiosity."\n\n"We wish that we could pass this play over and say nothing about it,"\nsays Hazlitt, "all that we can say must fall far short of the subject,\nor even of what we ourselves conceive of it. To attempt to give a\ndescription of the play itself, or of its effects upon the mind, is mere\nimpertinence; yet we must say something. It is, then, the best of\nShakespeare\'s plays, for it is the one in which he was the most in\nearnest."\n\n"If the originality of invention did not so much stamp almost every play\nof Shakespeare," says Hallam, "that to name one as the most original\nseems a disparagement to others, we might say that this great\nprerogative of genius, was exercised above all in \'Lear.\' It diverges\nmore from the model of regular tragedy than \'Macbeth,\' or \'Othello,\' and\neven more than \'Hamlet,\' but the fable is better constructed than in the\nlast of these and it displays full as much of the almost superhuman\ninspiration of the poet as the other two."\n\n"\'King Lear\' may be recognized as the perfect model of the dramatic art\nof the whole world," says Shelley.\n\n"I am not minded to say much of Shakespeare\'s Arthur," says Swinburne.\n"There are one or two figures in the world of his work of which there\nare no words that would be fit or good to say. Another of these is\nCordelia. The place they have in our lives and thoughts is not one for\ntalk. The niche set apart for them to inhabit in our secret hearts is\nnot penetrable by the lights and noises of common day. There are chapels\nin the cathedrals of man\'s highest art, as in that of his inmost life,\nnot made to be set open to the eyes and feet of the world. Love, and\nDeath, and Memory, keep charge for us in silence of some beloved names.\nIt is the crowning glory of genius, the final miracle and transcendent\ngift of poetry, that it can add to the number of these and engrave on\nthe very heart of our remembrance fresh names and memories of its own\ncreation."\n\n"Lear is the occasion for Cordelia," says Victor Hugo. "Maternity of the\ndaughter toward the father; profound subject; maternity venerable among\nall other maternities, so admirably rendered by the legend of that Roman\ngirl, who, in the depths of a prison, nurses her old father. The young\nbreast near the white beard! There is not a spectacle more holy. This\nfilial breast is Cordelia. Once this figure dreamed of and found,\nShakespeare created his drama.... Shakespeare, carrying Cordelia in his\nthoughts, created that tragedy like a god who, having an aurora to put\nforward, makes a world expressly for it."\n\n"In \'King Lear,\' Shakespeare\'s vision sounded the abyss of horror to its\nvery depths, and his spirit showed neither fear, nor giddiness, nor\nfaintness, at the sight," says Brandes. "On the threshold of this work,\na feeling of awe comes over one, as on the threshold of the Sistine\nChapel, with its ceiling of frescoes by Michael Angelo,--only that the\nsuffering here is far more intense, the wail wilder, and the harmonies\nof beauty more definitely shattered by the discords of despair."\n\nSuch are the judgments of the critics about this drama, and therefore I\nbelieve I am not wrong in selecting it as a type of Shakespeare\'s best.\n\nAs impartially as possible, I will endeavor to describe the contents of\nthe drama, and then to show why it is not that acme of perfection it is\nrepresented to be by critics, but is something quite different.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe drama of "Lear" begins with a scene giving the conversation between\ntwo courtiers, Kent and Gloucester. Kent, pointing to a young man\npresent, asks Gloucester whether that is not his son. Gloucester says\nthat he has often blushed to acknowledge the young man as his son, but\nhas now ceased doing so. Kent says he "can not conceive him." Then\nGloucester in the presence of this son of his says: "The fellow\'s mother\ncould, and grew round-wombed, and had a son for her cradle ere she had a\nhusband for her bed." "I have another, a legitimate son," continues\nGloucester, "but altho this one came into the world before he was sent\nfor, his mother was fair and there was good sport at his making, and\ntherefore I acknowledge this one also."\n\nSuch is the introduction. Not to mention the coarseness of these words\nof Gloucester, they are, farther, out of place in the mouth of a person\nintended to represent a noble character. One can not agree with the\nopinion of some critics that these words are given to Gloucester in\norder to show the contempt for his illegitimacy from which Edmund\nsuffers. Were this so, it would first have been unnecessary to make the\nfather express the contempt felt by men in general, and, secondly,\nEdmund, in his monolog about the injustice of those who despise him for\nhis birth, would have mentioned such words from his father. But this is\nnot so, and therefore these words of Gloucester at the very beginning of\nthe piece, were merely intended as a communication to the public--in a\nhumorous form--of the fact that Gloucester has a legitimate son and an\nillegitimate one.\n\nAfter this, trumpets are blown, and King Lear enters with his daughters\nand sons-in-law, and utters a speech to the effect that, owing to old\nage, he wishes to retire from the cares of business and divide his\nkingdom between his daughters. In order to know how much he should give\nto each daughter, he announces that to the one who says she loves him\nmost he will give most. The eldest daughter, Goneril, says that words\ncan not express the extent of her love, that she loves her father more\nthan eyesight, space, and liberty, loves him so much that it "makes her\nbreath poor." King Lear immediately allots his daughter on the map, her\nportion of fields, woods, rivers, and meadows, and asks the same\nquestion of the second daughter. The second daughter, Regan, says that\nher sister has correctly expressed her own feelings, only not strongly\nenough. She, Regan, loves her father so much that everything is\nabhorrent to her except his love. The king rewards this daughter, also,\nand then asks his youngest, the favorite, in whom, according to his\nexpression, are "interess\'d the vines of France and the milk of\nBurgundy," that is, whose hand is being claimed by the King of France\nand the Duke of Burgundy,--he asks Cordelia how she loves him. Cordelia,\nwho personifies all the virtues, as the eldest two all the vices, says,\nquite out of place, as if on purpose to irritate her father, that altho\nshe loves and honors him, and is grateful to him, yet if she marries,\nall her love will not belong to her father, but she will also love her\nhusband.\n\nHearing these words, the King loses his temper, and curses this favorite\ndaughter with the most dreadful and strange maledictions, saying, for\ninstance, that he will henceforth love his daughter as little as he\nloves the man who devours his own children.\n\n                      "The barbarous Scythian,\n    Or he that makes his generation messes\n    To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\n    Be as well neighbour\'d, pitied, and relieved.\n    As thou, my sometime daughter."\n\nThe courtier, Kent, defends Cordelia, and desiring to appease the King,\nrebukes him for his injustice, and says reasonable things about the evil\nof flattery. Lear, unmoved by Kent, banishes him under pain of death,\nand calling to him Cordelia\'s two suitors, the Duke of Burgundy and the\nKing of France, proposes to them in turn to take Cordelia without dowry.\nThe Duke of Burgundy frankly says that without dowry he will not take\nCordelia, but the King of France takes her without dowry and leads her\naway. After this, the elder sisters, there and then entering into\nconversation, prepare to injure their father who had endowed them. Thus\nends the first scene.\n\nNot to mention the pompous, characterless language of King Lear, the\nsame in which all Shakespeare\'s Kings speak, the reader, or spectator,\ncan not conceive that a King, however old and stupid he may be, could\nbelieve the words of the vicious daughters, with whom he had passed his\nwhole life, and not believe his favorite daughter, but curse and banish\nher; and therefore the spectator, or reader, can not share the feelings\nof the persons participating in this unnatural scene.\n\nThe second scene opens with Edmund, Gloucester\'s illegitimate son,\nsoliloquizing on the injustice of men, who concede rights and respect to\nthe legitimate son, but deprive the illegitimate son of them, and he\ndetermines to ruin Edgar, and to usurp his place. For this purpose, he\nforges a letter to himself as from Edgar, in which the latter expresses\na desire to murder his father. Awaiting his father\'s approach, Edmund,\nas if against his will, shows him this letter, and the father\nimmediately believes that his son Edgar, whom he tenderly loves, desires\nto kill him. The father goes away, Edgar enters and Edmund persuades him\nthat his father for some reason desires to kill him. Edgar immediately\nbelieves this and flees from his parent.\n\nThe relations between Gloucester and his two sons, and the feelings of\nthese characters are as unnatural as Lear\'s relation to his daughters,\nor even more so, and therefore it is still more difficult for the\nspectator to transport himself into the mental condition of Gloucester\nand his sons and sympathize with them, than it is to do so into that of\nLear and his daughters.\n\nIn the fourth scene, the banished Kent, so disguised that Lear does not\nrecognize him, presents himself to Lear, who is already staying with\nGoneril. Lear asks who he is, to which Kent answers, one doesn\'t know\nwhy, in a tone quite inappropriate to his position: "A very\nhonest-hearted fellow and as poor as the King."--"If thou be as poor for\na subject as he is for a King, thou art poor enough--How old art thou?"\nasks the King. "Not so young, Sir, to love a woman, _etc._, nor so old\nto dote on her." To this the King says, "If I like thee no worse after\ndinner, I will not part from thee yet."\n\nThese speeches follow neither from Lear\'s position, nor his relation to\nKent, but are put into the mouths of Lear and Kent, evidently because\nthe author regards them as witty and amusing.\n\nGoneril\'s steward appears, and behaves rudely to Lear, for which Kent\nknocks him down. The King, still not recognizing Kent, gives him money\nfor this and takes him into his service. After this appears the fool,\nand thereupon begins a prolonged conversation between the fool and the\nKing, utterly unsuited to the position and serving no purpose. Thus, for\ninstance, the fool says, "Give me an egg and I\'ll give thee two crowns."\nThe King asks, "What crowns shall they be?"--"Why," says the fool,\n"after I have cut the egg i\' the middle, and eat up the meat, the two\ncrowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i\' the middle, and gavest\naway both parts, thou borest thine ass on thy back o\'er the dirt: thou\nhadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gavest thy golden one away.\nIf I speak like myself in this, let him be whipp\'d that first finds it\nso."\n\nIn this manner lengthy conversations go on calling forth in the\nspectator or reader that wearisome uneasiness which one experiences when\nlistening to jokes which are not witty.\n\nThis conversation was interrupted by the approach of Goneril. She\ndemands of her father that he should diminish his retinue; that he\nshould be satisfied with fifty courtiers instead of a hundred. At this\nsuggestion, Lear gets into a strange and unnatural rage, and asks:\n\n    "Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:\n     Does Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?\n     Either his notion weakens, his discernings\n     Are lethargied. Ha! \'tis not so.\n     Who is it that can tell me who I am?"\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nWhile this goes on the fool does not cease to interpolate his humorless\njokes. Goneril\'s husband then enters and wishes to appease Lear, but\nLear curses Goneril, invoking for her either sterility or the birth of\nsuch an infant-monster as would return laughter and contempt for her\nmotherly cares, and would thus show her all the horror and pain caused\nby a child\'s ingratitude.\n\nThese words which express a genuine feeling, might have been touching\nhad they stood alone. But they are lost among long and high-flown\nspeeches, which Lear keeps incessantly uttering quite inappropriately.\nHe either invokes "blasts and fogs" upon the head of his daughter, or\ndesires his curse to "pierce every sense about her," or else appealing\nto his own eyes, says that should they weep, he will pluck them out and\n"cast them with the waters that they lose to temper clay." And so on.\n\nAfter this, Lear sends Kent, whom he still fails to recognize, to his\nother daughter, and notwithstanding the despair he has just manifested,\nhe talks with the fool, and elicits his jokes. The jokes continue to be\nmirthless and besides creating an unpleasant feeling, similar to shame,\nthe usual effect of unsuccessful witticisms, they are also so drawn out\nas to be positively dull. Thus the fool asks the King whether he can\ntell why one\'s nose stands in the middle of one\'s face? Lear says he can\nnot.--\n\n     "Why, to keep one\'s eyes of either side \'s nose, that what a\n     man can not smell out, he may spy out."\n\n     "Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?"\n\n     "No."\n\n     "Nor I either; but I can tell why a snail has a house."\n\n     "Why?"\n\n     "Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his\n     daughters and leave his horns without a case."\n\n     "----Be my horses ready?"\n\n     "Thy asses are gone about \'em. The reason why the seven\n     stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason."\n\n     "Because they are not eight?"\n\n     "Yes, indeed: thou would\'st make a good fool."\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAfter this lengthy scene, a gentleman enters and announces that the\nhorses are ready. The fool says:\n\n    "She that\'s a maid now, and laughs at my departure,\n     Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter."\n\nThe second part of the first scene of the second act begins by the\nvillain Edmund persuading his brother, when their father enters, to\npretend that they are fighting with their swords. Edgar consents, altho\nit is utterly incomprehensible why he should do so. The father finds\nthem fighting. Edgar flies and Edmund scratches his arm to draw blood\nand persuades his father that Edgar was working charms for the purpose\nof killing his father and had desired Edmund to help him, but that he,\nEdmund, had refused and that then Edgar flew at him and wounded his arm.\nGloucester believes everything, curses Edgar and transfers all the\nrights of the elder and legitimate son to the illegitimate Edmund. The\nDuke, hearing of this, also rewards Edmund.\n\nIn the second scene, in front of Gloucester\'s palace, Lear\'s new\nservant, Kent, still unrecognized by Lear, without any reason, begins to\nabuse Oswald, Goneril\'s steward, calling him,--"A knave, a rascal, an\neater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,\nhundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave;--the son and heir of a\nmongrel bitch." And so on. Then drawing his sword, he demands that\nOswald should fight with him, saying that he will make a "sop o\' the\nmoonshine" of him,--words which no commentators can explain. When he is\nstopped, he continues to give vent to the strangest abuse, saying that a\ntailor made Oswald, as "a stone-cutter or a painter could not have made\nhim so ill, tho they had been but two hours o\' the trade!" He further\nsays that, if only leave be given him, he will "tread this unbolted\nvillain into mortar and daub the wall of a jakes with him."\n\nThus Kent, whom nobody recognizes, altho both the King and the Duke of\nCornwall, as well as Gloucester who is present, ought to know him well,\ncontinues to brawl, in the character of Lear\'s new servant, until he is\ntaken and put in the stocks.\n\nThe third scene takes place on a heath. Edgar, flying from the\npersecutions of his father, hides in a wood and tells the public what\nkind of lunatics exist there--beggars who go about naked, thrust wooden\npricks and pins into their flesh, scream with wild voices and enforce\ncharity, and says that he wishes to simulate such a lunatic in order to\nsave himself from persecution. Having communicated this to the public,\nhe retires.\n\nThe fourth scene is again before Gloucester\'s castle. Enter Lear and the\nfool. Lear sees Kent in the stocks, and, still not recognizing him, is\ninflamed with rage against those who dared so to insult his messenger,\nand calls for the Duke and Regan. The fool goes on with his jokes.\n\nLear with difficulty restrains his ire. Enter the Duke and Regan. Lear\ncomplains of Goneril but Regan justifies her sister. Lear curses\nGoneril, and, when Regan tells him he had better return to her sister,\nhe is indignant and says: "Ask her forgiveness?" and falls down on his\nknees demonstrating how indecent it would be if he were abjectly to beg\nfood and clothing as charity from his own daughter, and he curses\nGoneril with the strangest curses and asks who put his servant in the\nstocks. Before Regan can answer, Goneril arrives. Lear becomes yet more\nexasperated and again curses Goneril, but when he is told that it was\nthe Duke himself who ordered the stocks, he does not say anything,\nbecause, at this moment, Regan tells him that she can not receive him\nnow and that he had best return to Goneril, and that in a month\'s time\nshe herself will receive him, with, however, not a hundred but fifty\nservants. Lear again curses Goneril and does not want to go to her,\ncontinuing to hope that Regan will accept him with the whole hundred\nservants. But Regan says she will receive him only with twenty-five and\nthen Lear makes up his mind to go back to Goneril who admits fifty. But\nwhen Goneril says that even twenty-five are too many, Lear pours forth a\nlong argument about the superfluous and the needful being relative and\nsays that if man is not allowed more than he needs, he is not to be\ndistinguished from a beast. Lear, or rather the actor who plays Lear\'s\npart, adds that there is no need for a lady\'s finery, which does not\nkeep her warm. After this he flies into a mad fury and says that to take\nvengeance on his daughters he will do something dreadful but that he\nwill not weep, and so he departs. A storm begins.\n\nSuch is the second act, full of unnatural events, and yet more unnatural\nspeeches, not flowing from the position of the characters,--and\nfinishing with a scene between Lear and his daughters which might have\nbeen powerful if it had not been permeated with the most absurdly\nfoolish, unnatural speeches--which, moreover, have no relation to the\nsubject,--put into the mouth of Lear. Lear\'s vacillations between pride,\nanger, and the hope of his daughters\' giving in, would be exceedingly\ntouching if it were not spoilt by the verbose absurdities to which he\ngives vent, about being ready to divorce himself from Regan\'s dead\nmother, should Regan not be glad to receive him,--or about his calling\ndown "fen suck\'d frogs" which he invokes, upon the head of his daughter,\nor about the heavens being obliged to patronize old people because they\nthemselves are old.\n\nThe third act begins with thunder, lightning, a storm of some special\nkind such as, according to the words of the characters in the piece, had\nnever before taken place. On the heath, a gentleman tells Kent that\nLear, banished by his daughters from their homes, is running about the\nheath alone, tearing his hair and throwing it to the wind, and that none\nbut the fool is with him. In return Kent tells the gentleman that the\ndukes have quarrelled, and that the French army has landed at Dover,\nand, having communicated this intelligence, he dispatches the gentleman\nto Dover to meet Cordelia.\n\nThe second scene of the third act also takes place on the heath, but in\nanother part of it. Lear walks about the heath and says words which are\nmeant to express his despair: he desires that the winds should blow so\nhard that they should crack their cheeks and that the rain should flood\neverything, that lightning should singe his white head, and the thunder\nflatten the world and destroy all germens "that make ungrateful man!"\nThe fool keeps uttering still more senseless words. Enter Kent. Lear\nsays that for some reason during this storm all criminals shall be found\nout and convicted. Kent, still unrecognized by Lear, endeavors to\npersuade him to take refuge in a hovel. At this point the fool\npronounces a prophecy in no wise related to the situation and they all\ndepart.\n\nThe third scene is again transferred to Gloucester\'s castle. Gloucester\ntells Edmund that the French King has already landed with his troops,\nand intends to help Lear. Learning this, Edmund decides to accuse his\nfather of treason in order that he may get his heritage.\n\nThe fourth scene is again on the heath in front of the hovel. Kent\ninvites Lear into the hovel, but Lear answers that he has no reason to\nshelter himself from the tempest, that he does not feel it, having a\ntempest in his mind, called forth by the ingratitude of his daughters,\nwhich extinguishes all else. This true feeling, expressed in simple\nwords, might elicit sympathy, but amidst the incessant, pompous raving\nit escapes one and loses its significance.\n\nThe hovel into which Lear is led, turns out to be the same which Edgar\nhas entered, disguised as a madman, _i.e._, naked. Edgar comes out of\nthe hovel, and, altho all have known him, no one recognizes him,--as no\none recognizes Kent,--and Edgar, Lear, and the fool begin to say\nsenseless things which continue with interruptions for many pages. In\nthe middle of this scene, enter Gloucester, who also does not recognize\neither Kent or his son Edgar, and tells them how his son Edgar wanted to\nkill him.\n\nThis scene is again cut short by another in Gloucester\'s castle, during\nwhich Edmund betrays his father and the Duke promises to avenge himself\non Gloucester. Then the scene shifts back to Lear. Kent, Edgar,\nGloucester, Lear, and the fool are at a farm and talking. Edgar says:\n"Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of\ndarkness...." The fool says: "Tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or\na yeoman?" Lear, having lost his mind, says that the madman is a king.\nThe fool says no, the madman is the yeoman who has allowed his son to\nbecome a gentleman. Lear screams: "To have a thousand with red burning\nspirits. Come hissing in upon \'em,"--while Edgar shrieks that the foul\nfiend bites his back. At this the fool remarks that one can not believe\n"in the tameness of a wolf, a horse\'s health, a boy\'s love, or a whore\'s\noath." Then Lear imagines he is judging his daughters. "Sit thou here,\nmost learned justicer," says he, addressing the naked Edgar; "Thou,\nsapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes." To this Edgar says: "Look\nwhere he stands and glares! Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?" "Come\no\'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,----" while the fool sings:\n\n    "Her boat hath a leak\n     And she must not speak\n     Why she dares not come over to thee."\n\nEdgar goes on in his own strain. Kent suggests that Lear should lie\ndown, but Lear continues his imaginary trial: "Bring in their evidence,"\nhe cries. "Thou robed man of justice, take thy place," he says to Edgar,\n"and thou" (to the fool) "his yoke-fellow of equity, bench by his side.\nYou are o\' the commission, sit you too," addressing Kent.\n\n"Purr, the cat is gray," shouts Edgar.\n\n"Arraign her first, \'tis Goneril," cries Lear. "I here take my oath\nbefore this honorable assembly, she kicked the poor king, her father."\n\n"Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?" says the fool, addressing\nthe seat.\n\n"And here\'s another," cries Lear. "Stop her there! arms, arms, sword,\nfire! Corruption in the place! False justice, why hast thou let her\n\'scape?"\n\nThis raving terminates by Lear falling asleep and Gloucester persuading\nKent, still without recognizing him, to carry Lear to Dover, and Kent\nand the fool carry off the King.\n\nThe scene is transferred to Gloucester\'s castle. Gloucester himself is\nabout to be accused of treason. He is brought forward and bound. The\nDuke of Cornwall plucks out one of his eyes and sets his foot on it.\nRegan says, "One side will mock another; the other too." The Duke wishes\nto pluck the other out also, but some servant, for some reason, suddenly\ntakes Gloucester\'s part and wounds the Duke. Regan kills the servant,\nwho, dying, says to Gloucester that he has "one eye left to see some\nmischief on him." The Duke says, "Lest it see more, prevent it," and he\ntears out Gloucester\'s other eye and throws it on the ground. Here Regan\nsays that it was Edmund who betrayed his father and then Gloucester\nimmediately understands that he has been deceived and that Edgar did not\nwish to kill him.\n\nThus ends the third act.\n\nThe fourth act is again on the heath. Edgar, still attired as a lunatic,\nsoliloquizes in stilted terms about the instability of fortune and the\nadvantages of a humble lot. Then there comes to him somehow into the\nvery place on the heath where he is, his father, the blinded Gloucester,\nled by an old man. In that characteristic Shakespearean language,--the\nchief peculiarity of which is that the thoughts are bred either by the\nconsonance or the contrasts of words,--Gloucester also speaks about the\ninstability of fortune. He tells the old man who leads him to leave him,\nbut the old man points out to him that he can not _see_ his way.\nGloucester says he has no way and therefore does not require _eyes_. And\nhe argues about his having stumbled when he _saw_, and about defects\noften proving commodities. "Ah! dear son Edgar," he adds, "might I but\nlive to _see_ thee in my touch, I\'d say I had _eyes_ again." Edgar\nnaked, and in the character of a lunatic, hearing this, still does not\ndisclose himself to his father. He takes the place of the aged guide and\ntalks with his father, who does not recognize his voice, but regards him\nas a wandering madman. Gloucester avails himself of the opportunity to\ndeliver himself of a witticism: "\'Tis the times\' plague when madmen lead\nthe blind," and he insists on dismissing the old man, obviously not from\nmotives which might be natural to Gloucester at that moment, but merely\nin order, when left alone with Edgar, to enact the later scene of the\nimaginary leaping from the cliff.\n\nNotwithstanding Edgar has just seen his blinded father, and has learnt\nthat his father repents of having banished him, he puts in utterly\nunnecessary interjections which Shakespeare might know, having read them\nin Haronet\'s book, but which Edgar had no means of becoming acquainted\nwith, and above all, which it was quite unnatural for him to repeat in\nhis present position. He says, "Five friends have been in poor Tom at\nonce: of lust, as Obidient; Hobbididance, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of\nstealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing; who\nsince possesses chambermaids and waiting women."\n\nHearing these words, Gloucester makes a present of his purse to Edgar,\nsaying:\n\n           "That I am so wretched\n    Makes thee the happier; heavens, deal so still,\n    Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,\n    That slaves your ordinance, that will not see\n    Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly.\n    So distribution should undo excess,\n    And each man have enough."\n\nHaving pronounced these strange words, the blind Gloucester requests\nEdgar to lead him to a certain cliff overhanging the sea, and they\ndepart.\n\nThe second scene of the fourth act takes place before the Duke of\nAlbany\'s palace. Goneril is not only cruel, but also depraved. She\ndespises her husband and discloses her love to the villain Edmund, who\nhas inherited the title of his father Gloucester. Edmund leaves, and a\nconversation takes place between Goneril and her husband. The Duke of\nAlbany, the only figure with human feelings, who had already previously\nbeen dissatisfied with his wife\'s treatment of her father, now\nresolutely takes Lear\'s side, but expresses his emotion in such words as\nto shake one\'s confidence in his feeling. He says that a bear would lick\nLear\'s reverence, that if the heavens do not send their visible spirits\nto tame these vile offenses, humanity must prey on itself like monsters,\netc.\n\nGoneril does not listen to him, and then he begins to abuse her:\n\n    "See thyself, devil!\n     Proper deformity seems not in the fiend\n     So horrid as in woman."\n\n"O vain fool," says Goneril. "Thou changed and self-cover\'d thing, for\nshame," continues the Duke:\n\n    "Be-monster not thy feature. Were\'t my fitness\n     To let these hands obey my blood,\n     They are apt enough to dislocate and tear\n     Thy flesh and bones; howe\'er thou art a fiend,\n     A woman\'s shape doth shield thee."\n\nAfter this a messenger enters, and announces that the Duke of Cornwall,\nwounded by his servant whilst plucking out Gloucester\'s eyes, had died.\nGoneril is glad but already anticipates with fear that Regan, now a\nwidow, will deprive her of Edmund. Here the second scene ends.\n\nThe third scene of the fourth act represents the French camp. From a\nconversation between Kent and a gentleman, the reader or spectator\nlearns that the King of France is not in the camp and that Cordelia has\nreceived a letter from Kent and is greatly grieved by what she has\nlearned about her father. The gentleman says that her face reminded one\nof sunshine and rain.\n\n                       "Her smiles and tears\n    Were like a better day; those happy smiles\n    That play\'d on her ripe lip seem\'d not to know\n    What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,\n    As pearls from diamonds dropp\'d."\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nThe gentleman says that Cordelia desires to see her father, but Kent\nsays that Lear is ashamed of seeing this daughter whom he has treated so\nunkindly.\n\nIn the fourth scene, Cordelia, talking with a physician, tells him that\nLear has been seen, that he is quite mad, wearing on his head a wreath\nof various weeds, that he is roaming about and that she has sent\nsoldiers in search of him, adding that she desires all secret remedies\nto spring with her tears, and the like.\n\nShe is informed that the forces of the Dukes are approaching, but she is\nconcerned only about her father and departs.\n\nThe fifth scene of the fourth act lies in Gloucester\'s castle. Regan is\ntalking with Oswald, Goneril\'s steward, who is carrying a letter from\nGoneril to Edmund, and she announces to him that she also loves Edmund\nand that, being a widow, it is better for her to marry him than for\nGoneril to do so, and she begs him to persuade her sister of this.\nFurther she tells him that it was very unreasonable to blind Gloucester\nand yet leave him alive, and therefore advises Oswald, should he meet\nGloucester, to kill him, promising him a great reward if he does this.\n\nIn the sixth scene, Gloucester again appears with his still unrecognized\nson Edgar, who (now in the guise of a peasant) pretends to lead his\nfather to the cliff. Gloucester is walking along on level land but Edgar\npersuades him that they are with difficulty ascending a steep hill.\nGloucester believes this. Edgar tells his father that the noise of the\nsea is heard; Gloucester believes this also. Edgar stops on a level\nplace and persuades his father that he has ascended the cliff and that\nin front of him lies a dreadful abyss, and leaves him alone. Gloucester,\naddressing the gods, says that he shakes off his affliction as he can\nbear it no longer, and that he does not condemn them--the gods. Having\nsaid this, he leaps on the level ground and falls, imagining that he has\njumped off the cliff. On this occasion, Edgar, soliloquizing, gives vent\nto a yet more entangled utterance:\n\n    "I know not how conceit may rob\n     The treasury of life when life itself\n     Yields to the theft; had he been where he thought,\n     By this had thought been past."\n\nHe approaches Gloucester, in the character of yet a different person,\nand expressing astonishment at the latter not being hurt by his fall\nfrom such a dreadful height. Gloucester believes that he has fallen and\nprepares to die, but he feels that he is alive and begins to doubt that\nhe has fallen from such a height. Then Edgar persuades him that he has\nindeed jumped from the dreadful height and tells him that the\nindividual who had been with him at the top was the devil, as he had\neyes like two full moons and a thousand noses and wavy horns. Gloucester\nbelieves this, and is persuaded that his despair was the work of the\ndevil, and therefore decides that he will henceforth despair no more,\nbut will quietly await death. Hereupon enters Lear, for some reason\ncovered with wild-flowers. He has lost his senses and says things wilder\nthan before. He speaks about coining, about the moon, gives some one a\nyard--then he cries that he sees a mouse, which he wishes to entice by a\npiece of cheese. Then he suddenly demands the password from Edgar, and\nEdgar immediately answers him with the words "Sweet marjoram." Lear\nsays, "Pass," and the blind Gloucester, who has not recognized either\nhis son or Kent, recognizes the King\'s voice.\n\nThen the King, after his disconnected utterances, suddenly begins to\nspeak ironically about flatterers, who agreed to all he said, "Ay, and\nno, too, was no good divinity," but, when he got into a storm without\nshelter, he saw all this was not true; and then goes on to say that as\nall creation addicts itself to adultery, and Gloucester\'s bastard son\nhad treated his father more kindly than his daughters had treated him\n(altho Lear, according to the development of the drama, could not know\nhow Edmund had treated Gloucester), therefore, let dissoluteness\nprosper, the more so as, being a King, he needs soldiers. He here\naddresses an imaginary hypocritically virtuous lady who acts the prude,\nwhereas\n\n    "The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to\'t\n     With a more riotous appetite.\n     All women inherit the gods only to the girdle\n     Beneath is all the fiend\'s"--\n\nand, saying this, Lear screams and spits from horror. This monolog is\nevidently meant to be addressed by the actor to the audience, and\nprobably produces an effect on the stage, but it is utterly uncalled for\nin the mouth of Lear, equally with his words: "It smells of mortality,"\nuttered while wiping his hand, as Gloucester expresses a desire to kiss\nit. Then Gloucester\'s blindness is referred to, which gives occasion for\na play of words on _eyes_, about blind Cupid, at which Lear says to\nGloucester, "No _eyes_ in your head, nor no money in your _purse_? Your\n_eyes_ are in a _heavy_ case, your purse in a _light_." Then Lear\ndeclaims a monolog on the unfairness of legal judgment, which is quite\nout of place in the mouth of the insane Lear. After this, enter a\ngentleman with attendants sent by Cordelia to fetch her father. Lear\ncontinues to act as a madman and runs away. The gentleman sent to fetch\nLear, does not run after him, but lengthily describes to Edgar the\nposition of the French and British armies. Oswald enters, and seeing\nGloucester, and desiring to receive the reward promised by Regan,\nattacks him, but Edgar with his club kills Oswald, who, in dying,\ntransmits to his murderer, Edgar, Goneril\'s letter to Edmund, the\ndelivery of which would insure reward. In this letter Goneril promises\nto kill her husband and marry Edmund. Edgar drags out Oswald\'s body by\nthe legs and then returns and leads his father away.\n\nThe seventh scene of the fourth act takes place in a tent in the French\ncamp. Lear is asleep on a bed. Enter Cordelia and Kent, still in\ndisguise. Lear is awakened by the music, and, seeing Cordelia, does not\nbelieve she is a living being, thinks she is an apparition, does not\nbelieve that he himself is alive. Cordelia assures him that she is his\ndaughter, and begs him to bless her. He falls on his knees before her,\nbegs her pardon, acknowledges that he is as old and foolish, says he is\nready to take poison, which he thinks she has probably prepared for him,\nas he is persuaded she must hate him. ("For your sisters," he says,\n"have done me wrong: you have some cause, they have not.") Then he\ngradually comes to his senses and ceases to rave. His daughter suggests\nthat he should take a walk. He consents and says: "You must bear with\nme. Pray you now forget and forgive: I am old and foolish." They depart.\nThe gentleman and Kent, remaining on the scene, hold a conversation\nwhich explains to the spectator that Edmund is at the head of the troops\nand that a battle must soon begin between Lear\'s defenders and his\nenemies. So the fourth act closes.\n\nIn this fourth act, the scene between Lear and his daughter might have\nbeen touching if it had not been preceded in the course of the earlier\nacts by the tediously drawn out, monotonous ravings of Lear, and if,\nmoreover, this expression of his feelings constituted the last scene.\nBut the scene is not the last.\n\nIn the fifth act, the former coldly pompous, artificial ravings of Lear\ngo on again, destroying the impression which the previous scene might\nhave produced.\n\nThe first scene of the fifth act at first represents Edmund and Regan;\nthe latter is jealous of her sister and makes an offer. Then come\nGoneril, her husband, and some soldiers. The Duke of Albany, altho\npitying Lear, regards it as his duty to fight with the French who have\ninvaded his country, and so he prepares for battle.\n\nThen Edgar enters, still disguised, and hands to the Duke of Albany the\nletter he had received from Goneril\'s dying steward, and tells him if he\ngains the victory to sound the trumpet, saying that he can produce a\nchampion who will confirm the contents of the letter.\n\nIn the second scene, Edgar enters leading his father Gloucester, seats\nhim by a tree, and goes away himself. The noise of battle is heard,\nEdgar runs back and says that the battle is lost and Lear and Cordelia\nare prisoners. Gloucester again falls into despair. Edgar, still\nwithout disclosing himself to his father, counsels endurance, and\nGloucester immediately agrees with him.\n\nThe third scene opens with a triumphal progress of the victor Edmund.\nLear and Cordelia are prisoners. Lear, altho no longer insane, continues\nto utter the same senseless, inappropriate words, as, for example, that\nin prison he will sing with Cordelia, she will ask his blessing, and he\nwill kneel down (this process of kneeling down is repeated three times)\nand will ask her forgiveness. And he further says that, while they are\nliving in prison, they will wear out "packs and sects of great ones";\nthat he and Cordelia are sacrifices upon which the gods will throw\nincense, and that he that parts them "shall bring a brand from heaven\nand fire them like foxes; that he will not weep, and that the plague\nshall sooner devour his eyes, flesh and fell, than they shall make them\nweep."\n\nEdmund orders Lear and his daughter to be led away to prison, and,\nhaving called the officer to do this, says he requires another duty and\nasks him whether he\'ll do it? The captain says he can not draw a cart\nnor eat dried oats, but if it be men\'s work he can do it. Enter the Duke\nof Albany, Goneril, and Regan. The Duke of Albany wishes to champion\nLear, but Edmund does not allow it. The daughters take part in the\ndialog and begin to abuse each other, being jealous of Edmund. Here\neverything becomes so confused that it is difficult to follow the\naction. The Duke of Albany wishes to arrest Edmund, and tells Regan that\nEdmund has long ago entered into guilty relations with his wife, and\nthat, therefore, Regan must give up her claims on Edmund, and if she\nwishes to marry, should marry him, the Duke of Albany.\n\nHaving said this, the Duke of Albany calls Edmund, orders the trumpet to\nbe sounded, saying that, if no one appears, he will fight him himself.\n\nHere Regan, whom Goneril has evidently poisoned, falls deadly sick.\nTrumpets are sounded and Edgar enters with a vizor concealing his face,\nand, without giving his name, challenges Edmund. Edgar abuses Edmund;\nEdmund throws all the abuses back on Edgar\'s head. They fight and Edmund\nfalls. Goneril is in despair. The Duke of Albany shows Goneril her\nletter. Goneril departs.\n\nThe dying Edmund discovers that his opponent was his brother. Edgar\nraises his vizor and pronounces a moral lesson to the effect that,\nhaving begotten his illegitimate son Edmund, the father has paid for it\nwith his eyesight. After this Edgar tells the Duke of Albany his\nadventures and how he has only just now, before entering on the recent\ncombat, disclosed everything to his father, and the father could not\nbear it and died from emotion. Edmund is not yet dead, and wants to know\nall that has taken place.\n\nThen Edgar relates that, while he was sitting over his father\'s body, a\nman came and closely embraced him, and, shouting as loudly as if he\nwished to burst heaven, threw himself on the body of Edgar\'s father, and\ntold the most piteous tale about Lear and himself, and that while\nrelating this the strings of life began to crack, but at this moment the\ntrumpet sounded twice and Edgar left him "tranced"--and this was Kent.\n\nEdgar has hardly finished this narrative when a gentleman rushes in with\na bloody knife, shouting "Help!" In answer to the question, "Who is\nkilled?" the gentleman says that Goneril has been killed, having\npoisoned her sister, she has confessed it.\n\nEnters Kent, and at this moment the corpses of Goneril and Regan are\nbrought in. Edmund here says that the sisters evidently loved him, as\none has poisoned the other for his sake, and then slain herself. At the\nsame time he confesses that he had given orders to kill Lear and to hang\nCordelia in prison, and pretend that she had taken her own life; but now\nhe wishes to prevent these deeds, and having said this he dies, and is\ncarried away.\n\nAfter this enters Lear with the dead Cordelia in his arms, altho he is\nmore than eighty years old and ill. Again begins Lear\'s awful ravings,\nat which one feels ashamed as at unsuccessful jokes. Lear demands that\nall should howl, and, alternately, believes that Cordelia is dead and\nthat she is alive.\n\n"Had I your tongues and eyes," he says "I\'d use them so that heaven\'s\nvault should crack."\n\nThen he says that he killed the slave who hanged Cordelia. Next he says\nthat his eyes see badly, but at the same time he recognizes Kent whom\nall along he had not recognized.\n\nThe Duke of Albany says that he will resign during the life of Lear and\nthat he will reward Edgar and Kent and all who have been faithful to\nhim. At this moment the news is brought that Edmund is dead, and Lear,\ncontinuing his ravings, begs that they will undo one of his buttons--the\nsame request which he had made when roaming about the heath. He\nexpresses his thanks for this, tells everyone to look at something, and\nthereupon dies.\n\nIn conclusion, the Duke of Albany, having survived the others, says:\n\n    "The weight of this sad time we must obey;\n     Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\n     The oldest hath borne most: we that are young\n     Shall never see so much, nor live so long."\n\nAll depart to the music of a dead march. Thus ends the fifth act and the\ndrama.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nSuch is this celebrated drama. However absurd it may appear in my\nrendering (which I have endeavored to make as impartial as possible), I\nmay confidently say that in the original it is yet more absurd. For any\nman of our time--if he were not under the hypnotic suggestion that this\ndrama is the height of perfection--it would be enough to read it to its\nend (were he to have sufficient patience for this) to be convinced that\nfar from being the height of perfection, it is a very bad, carelessly\ncomposed production, which, if it could have been of interest to a\ncertain public at a certain time, can not evoke among us anything but\naversion and weariness. Every reader of our time, who is free from the\ninfluence of suggestion, will also receive exactly the same impression\nfrom all the other extolled dramas of Shakespeare, not to mention the\nsenseless, dramatized tales, "Pericles," "Twelfth Night," "The\nTempest," "Cymbeline," "Troilus and Cressida."\n\nBut such free-minded individuals, not inoculated with\nShakespeare-worship, are no longer to be found in our Christian society.\nEvery man of our society and time, from the first period of his\nconscious life, has been inoculated with the idea that Shakespeare is a\ngenius, a poet, and a dramatist, and that all his writings are the\nheight of perfection. Yet, however hopeless it may seem, I will endeavor\nto demonstrate in the selected drama--"King Lear"--all those faults\nequally characteristic also of all the other tragedies and comedies of\nShakespeare, on account of which he not only is not representing a model\nof dramatic art, but does not satisfy the most elementary demands of art\nrecognized by all.\n\nDramatic art, according to the laws established by those very critics\nwho extol Shakespeare, demands that the persons represented in the play\nshould be, in consequence of actions proper to their characters, and\nowing to a natural course of events, placed in positions requiring them\nto struggle with the surrounding world to which they find themselves in\nopposition, and in this struggle should display their inherent\nqualities.\n\nIn "King Lear" the persons represented are indeed placed externally in\nopposition to the outward world, and they struggle with it. But their\nstrife does not flow from the natural course of events nor from their\nown characters, but is quite arbitrarily established by the author, and\ntherefore can not produce on the reader the illusion which represents\nthe essential condition of art.\n\nLear has no necessity or motive for his abdication; also, having lived\nall his life with his daughters, has no reason to believe the words of\nthe two elders and not the truthful statement of the youngest; yet upon\nthis is built the whole tragedy of his position.\n\nSimilarly unnatural is the subordinate action: the relation of\nGloucester to his sons. The positions of Gloucester and Edgar flow from\nthe circumstance that Gloucester, just like Lear, immediately believes\nthe coarsest untruth and does not even endeavor to inquire of his\ninjured son whether what he is accused of be true, but at once curses\nand banishes him. The fact that Lear\'s relations with his daughters are\nthe same as those of Gloucester to his sons makes one feel yet more\nstrongly that in both cases the relations are quite arbitrary, and do\nnot flow from the characters nor the natural course of events. Equally\nunnatural, and obviously invented, is the fact that all through the\ntragedy Lear does not recognize his old courtier, Kent, and therefore\nthe relations between Lear and Kent fail to excite the sympathy of the\nreader or spectator. The same, in a yet greater degree, holds true of\nthe position of Edgar, who, unrecognized by any one, leads his blind\nfather and persuades him that he has leapt off a cliff, when in reality\nGloucester jumps on level ground.\n\nThese positions, into which the characters are placed quite arbitrarily,\nare so unnatural that the reader or spectator is unable not only to\nsympathize with their sufferings but even to be interested in what he\nreads or sees. This in the first place.\n\nSecondly, in this, as in the other dramas of Shakespeare, all the\ncharacters live, think, speak, and act quite unconformably with the\ngiven time and place. The action of "King Lear" takes place 800 years\nB.C., and yet the characters are placed in conditions possible only in\nthe Middle Ages: participating in the drama are kings, dukes, armies,\nand illegitimate children, and gentlemen, courtiers, doctors, farmers,\nofficers, soldiers, and knights with vizors, etc. It is possible that\nsuch anachronisms (with which Shakespeare\'s dramas abound) did not\ninjure the possibility of illusion in the sixteenth century and the\nbeginning of the seventeenth, but in our time it is no longer possible\nto follow with interest the development of events which one knows could\nnot take place in the conditions which the author describes in detail.\nThe artificiality of the positions, not flowing from the natural course\nof events, or from the nature of the characters, and their want of\nconformity with time and space, is further increased by those coarse\nembellishments which are continually added by Shakespeare and intended\nto appear particularly touching. The extraordinary storm during which\nKing Lear roams about the heath, or the grass which for some reason he\nputs on his head--like Ophelia in "Hamlet"--or Edgar\'s attire, or the\nfool\'s speeches, or the appearance of the helmeted horseman, Edgar--all\nthese effects not only fail to enhance the impression, but produce an\nopposite effect. "Man sieht die Absicht und man wird verstimmt," as\nGoethe says. It often happens that even during these obviously\nintentional efforts after effect, as, for instance, the dragging out by\nthe legs of half a dozen corpses, with which all Shakespeare\'s tragedies\nterminate, instead of feeling fear and pity, one is tempted rather to\nlaugh.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nBut it is not enough that Shakespeare\'s characters are placed in tragic\npositions which are impossible, do not flow from the course of events,\nare inappropriate to time and space--these personages, besides this, act\nin a way which is out of keeping with their definite character, and is\nquite arbitrary. It is generally asserted that in Shakespeare\'s dramas\nthe characters are specially well expressed, that, notwithstanding their\nvividness, they are many-sided, like those of living people; that, while\nexhibiting the characteristics of a given individual, they at the same\ntime wear the features of man in general; it is usual to say that the\ndelineation of character in Shakespeare is the height of perfection.\n\nThis is asserted with such confidence and repeated by all as\nindisputable truth; but however much I endeavored to find confirmation\nof this in Shakespeare\'s dramas, I always found the opposite. In\nreading any of Shakespeare\'s dramas whatever, I was, from the very\nfirst, instantly convinced that he was lacking in the most important, if\nnot the only, means of portraying characters: individuality of language,\n_i.e._, the style of speech of every person being natural to his\ncharacter. This is absent from Shakespeare. All his characters speak,\nnot their own, but always one and the same Shakespearian, pretentious,\nand unnatural language, in which not only they could not speak, but in\nwhich no living man ever has spoken or does speak.\n\nNo living men could or can say, as Lear says, that he would divorce his\nwife in the grave should Regan not receive him, or that the heavens\nwould crack with shouting, or that the winds would burst, or that the\nwind wishes to blow the land into the sea, or that the curled waters\nwish to flood the shore, as the gentleman describes the storm, or that\nit is easier to bear one\'s grief and the soul leaps over many sufferings\nwhen grief finds fellowship, or that Lear has become childless while I\nam fatherless, as Edgar says, or use similar unnatural expressions with\nwhich the speeches of all the characters in all Shakespeare\'s dramas\noverflow.\n\nAgain, it is not enough that all the characters speak in a way in which\nno living men ever did or could speak--they all suffer from a common\nintemperance of language. Those who are in love, who are preparing for\ndeath, who are fighting, who are dying, all alike speak much and\nunexpectedly about subjects utterly inappropriate to the occasion, being\nevidently guided rather by consonances and play of words than by\nthoughts. They speak all alike. Lear raves exactly as does Edgar when\nfeigning madness. Both Kent and the fool speak alike. The words of one\nof the personages might be placed in the mouth of another, and by the\ncharacter of the speech it would be impossible to distinguish who\nspeaks. If there is a difference in the speech of Shakespeare\'s various\ncharacters, it lies merely in the different dialogs which are pronounced\nfor these characters--again by Shakespeare and not by themselves. Thus\nShakespeare always speaks for kings in one and the same inflated, empty\nlanguage. Also in one and the same Shakespearian, artificially\nsentimental language speak all the women who are intended to be poetic:\nJuliet, Desdemona, Cordelia, Imogen, Marina. In the same way, also, it\nis Shakespeare alone who speaks for his villains: Richard, Edmund, Iago,\nMacbeth, expressing for them those vicious feelings which villains never\nexpress. Yet more similar are the speeches of the madmen with their\nhorrible words, and those of fools with their mirthless puns. So that in\nShakespeare there is no language of living individuals--that language\nwhich in the drama is the chief means of setting forth character. If\ngesticulation be also a means of expressing character, as in ballets,\nthis is only a secondary means. Moreover, if the characters speak at\nrandom and in a random way, and all in one and the same diction, as is\nthe case in Shakespeare\'s work, then even the action of gesticulation is\nwasted. Therefore, whatever the blind panegyrists of Shakespeare may\nsay, in Shakespeare there is no expression of character. Those\npersonages who, in his dramas, stand out as characters, are characters\nborrowed by him from former works which have served as the foundation of\nhis dramas, and they are mostly depicted, not by the dramatic method\nwhich consists in making each person speak with his own diction, but in\nthe epic method of one person describing the features of another.\n\nThe perfection with which Shakespeare expresses character is asserted\nchiefly on the ground of the characters of Lear, Cordelia, Othello,\nDesdemona, Falstaff, and Hamlet. But all these characters, as well as\nall the others, instead of belonging to Shakespeare, are taken by him\nfrom dramas, chronicles, and romances anterior to him. All these\ncharacters not only are not rendered more powerful by him, but, in most\ncases, they are weakened and spoilt. This is very striking in this drama\nof "King Lear," which we are examining, taken by him from the drama\n"King Leir," by an unknown author. The characters of this drama, that of\nKing Lear, and especially of Cordelia, not only were not created by\nShakespeare, but have been strikingly weakened and deprived of force by\nhim, as compared with their appearance in the older drama.\n\nIn the older drama, Leir abdicates because, having become a widower, he\nthinks only of saving his soul. He asks his daughters as to their love\nfor him--that, by means of a certain device he has invented, he may\nretain his favorite daughter on his island. The elder daughters are\nbetrothed, while the youngest does not wish to contract a loveless union\nwith any of the neighboring suitors whom Leir proposes to her, and he is\nafraid that she may marry some distant potentate.\n\nThe device which he has invented, as he informs his courtier, Perillus\n(Shakespeare\'s Kent), is this, that when Cordelia tells him that she\nloves him more than any one or as much as her elder sisters do, he will\ntell her that she must, in proof of her love, marry the prince he will\nindicate on his island. All these motives for Lear\'s conduct are absent\nin Shakespeare\'s play. Then, when, according to the old drama, Leir asks\nhis daughters about their love for him, Cordelia does not say, as\nShakespeare has it, that she will not give her father all her love, but\nwill love her husband, too, should she marry--which is quite\nunnatural--but simply says that she can not express her love in words,\nbut hopes that her actions will prove it. Goneril and Regan remark that\nCordelia\'s answer is not an answer, and that the father can not meekly\naccept such indifference, so that what is wanting in\nShakespeare--_i.e._, the explanation of Lear\'s anger which caused him to\ndisinherit his youngest daughter,--exists in the old drama. Leir is\nannoyed by the failure of his scheme, and the poisonous words of his\neldest daughters irritate him still more. After the division of the\nkingdom between the elder daughters, there follows in the older drama a\nscene between Cordelia and the King of Gaul, setting forth, instead of\nthe colorless Cordelia of Shakespeare, a very definite and attractive\ncharacter of the truthful, tender, and self-sacrificing youngest\ndaughter. While Cordelia, without grieving that she has been deprived of\na portion of the heritage, sits sorrowing at having lost her father\'s\nlove, and looking forward to earn her bread by her labor, there comes\nthe King of Gaul, who, in the disguise of a pilgrim, desires to choose a\nbride from among Leir\'s daughters. He asks Cordelia why she is sad. She\ntells him the cause of her grief. The King of Gaul, still in the guise\nof a pilgrim, falls in love with her, and offers to arrange a marriage\nfor her with the King of Gaul, but she says she will marry only a man\nwhom she loves. Then the pilgrim, still disguised, offers her his hand\nand heart and Cordelia confesses she loves the pilgrim and consents to\nmarry him, notwithstanding the poverty that awaits her. Then the pilgrim\ndiscloses to her that he it is who is the King of Gaul, and Cordelia\nmarries him. Instead of this scene, Lear, according to Shakespeare,\noffers Cordelia\'s two suitors to take her without dowry, and one\ncynically refuses, while the other, one does not know why, accepts her.\nAfter this, in the old drama, as in Shakespeare\'s, Leir undergoes the\ninsults of Goneril, into whose house he has removed, but he bears these\ninsults in a very different way from that represented by Shakespeare: he\nfeels that by his conduct toward Cordelia, he has deserved this, and\nhumbly submits. As in Shakespeare\'s drama, so also in the older drama,\nthe courtiers, Perillus--Kent--who had interceded for Cordelia and was\ntherefore banished--comes to Leir and assures him of his love, but under\nno disguise, but simply as a faithful old servant who does not abandon\nhis king in a moment of need. Leir tells him what, according to\nShakespeare, he tells Cordelia in the last scene, that, if the daughters\nwhom he has benefited hate him, a retainer to whom he has done no good\ncan not love him. But Perillus--Kent--assures the King of his love\ntoward him, and Leir, pacified, goes on to Regan. In the older drama\nthere are no tempests nor tearing out of gray hairs, but there is the\nweakened and humbled old man, Leir, overpowered with grief, and banished\nby his other daughter also, who even wishes to kill him. Turned out by\nhis elder daughters, Leir, according to the older drama, as a last\nresource, goes with Perillus to Cordelia. Instead of the unnatural\nbanishment of Lear during the tempest, and his roaming about the heath,\nLeir, with Perillus, in the older drama, during their journey to France,\nvery naturally reach the last degree of destitution, sell their clothes\nin order to pay for their crossing over the sea, and, in the attire of\nfishermen, exhausted by cold and hunger, approach Cordelia\'s house.\nHere, again, instead of the unnatural combined ravings of the fool,\nLear, and Edgar, as represented by Shakespeare, there follows in the\nolder drama a natural scene of reunion between the daughter and the\nfather. Cordelia--who, notwithstanding her happiness, has all the time\nbeen grieving about her father and praying to God to forgive her sisters\nwho had done him so much wrong--meets her father in his extreme want,\nand wishes immediately to disclose herself to him, but her husband\nadvises her not to do this, in order not to agitate her weak father. She\naccepts the counsel and takes Leir into her house without disclosing\nherself to him, and nurses him. Leir gradually revives, and then the\ndaughter asks him who he is and how he lived formerly:\n\n    "If from the first," says Leir, "I should relate the cause,\n     I would make a heart of adamant to weep.\n     And thou, poor soul, kind-hearted as thou art,\n     Dost weep already, ere I do begin."\n\n    Cordelia: "For God\'s love tell it, and when you have done\n     I\'ll tell the reason why I weep so soon."\n\nAnd Leir relates all he has suffered from his elder daughters, and says\nthat now he wishes to find shelter with the child who would be in the\nright even were she to condemn him to death. "If, however," he says,\n"she will receive me with love, it will be God\'s and her work, but not\nmy merit." To this Cordelia says: "Oh, I know for certain that thy\ndaughter will lovingly receive thee."--"How canst thou know this without\nknowing her?" says Leir. "I know," says Cordelia, "because not far from\nhere, I had a father who acted toward me as badly as thou hast acted\ntoward her, yet, if I were only to see his white head, I would creep to\nmeet him on my knees."--"No, this can not be," says Leir, "for there are\nno children in the world so cruel as mine."--"Do not condemn all for the\nsins of some," says Cordelia, and falls on her knees. "Look here, dear\nfather," she says, "look on me: I am thy loving daughter." The father\nrecognizes her and says: "It is not for thee, but for me, to beg thy\npardon on my knees for all my sins toward thee."\n\nIs there anything approaching this exquisite scene in Shakespeare\'s\ndrama?\n\nHowever strange this opinion may seem to worshipers of Shakespeare, yet\nthe whole of this old drama is incomparably and in every respect\nsuperior to Shakespeare\'s adaptation. It is so, first, because it has\nnot got the utterly superfluous characters of the villain Edmund and\nunlifelike Gloucester and Edgar, who only distract one\'s attention;\nsecondly because it has not got the completely false "effects" of Lear\nrunning about the heath, his conversations with the fool, and all these\nimpossible disguises, failures to recognize, and accumulated deaths;\nand, above all, because in this drama there is the simple, natural, and\ndeeply touching character of Leir and the yet more touching and clearly\ndefined character of Cordelia, both absent in Shakespeare. Therefore,\nthere is in the older drama, instead of Shakespeare\'s long-drawn scene\nof Lear\'s interview with Cordelia and of Cordelia\'s unnecessary murder,\nthe exquisite scene of the interview between Leir and Cordelia,\nunequaled by any in all Shakespeare\'s dramas.\n\nThe old drama also terminates more naturally and more in accordance with\nthe moral demands of the spectator than does Shakespeare\'s, namely, by\nthe King of the Gauls conquering the husbands of the elder sisters, and\nCordelia, instead of being killed, restoring Leir to his former\nposition.\n\nThus it is in the drama we are examining, which Shakespeare has borrowed\nfrom the drama "King Leir." So it is also with Othello, taken from an\nItalian romance, the same also with the famous Hamlet. The same with\nAntony, Brutus, Cleopatra, Shylock, Richard, and all Shakespeare\'s\ncharacters, all taken from some antecedent work. Shakespeare, while\nprofiting by characters already given in preceding dramas, or romances,\nchronicles, or, Plutarch\'s "Lives," not only fails to render them more\ntruthful and vivid, as his eulogists affirm, but, on the contrary,\nalways weakens them and often completely destroys them, as with Lear,\ncompelling his characters to commit actions unnatural to them, and,\nabove all, to utter speeches natural neither to them nor to any one\nwhatever. Thus, in "Othello," altho that is, perhaps, I will not say the\nbest, but the least bad and the least encumbered by pompous volubility,\nthe characters of Othello, Iago, Cassio, Emilia, according to\nShakespeare, are much less natural and lifelike than in the Italian\nromance. Shakespeare\'s Othello suffers from epilepsy, of which he has an\nattack on the stage; moreover, in Shakespeare\'s version, Desdemona\'s\nmurder is preceded by the strange vow of the kneeling Othello. Othello,\naccording to Shakespeare, is a negro and not a Moor. All this is\nerratic, inflated, unnatural, and violates the unity of the character.\nAll this is absent in the romance. In that romance the reasons for\nOthello\'s jealousy are represented more naturally than in Shakespeare.\nIn the romance, Cassio, knowing whose the handkerchief is, goes to\nDesdemona to return it, but, approaching the back-door of Desdemona\'s\nhouse, sees Othello and flies from him. Othello perceives the escaping\nCassio, and this, more than anything, confirms his suspicions.\nShakespeare has not got this, and yet this casual incident explains\nOthello\'s jealousy more than anything else. With Shakespeare, this\njealousy is founded entirely on Iago\'s persistent, successful\nmachinations and treacherous words, which Othello blindly believes.\nOthello\'s monolog over the sleeping Desdemona, about his desiring her\nwhen killed to look as she is alive, about his going to love her even\ndead, and now wishing to smell her "balmy breath," etc., is utterly\nimpossible. A man who is preparing for the murder of a beloved being,\ndoes not utter such phrases, still less after committing the murder\nwould he speak about the necessity of an eclipse of sun and moon, and of\nthe globe yawning; nor can he, negro tho he may be, address devils,\ninviting them to burn him in hot sulphur and so forth. Lastly, however\neffective may be the suicide, absent in the romance, it completely\ndestroys the conception of his clearly defined character. If he indeed\nsuffered from grief and remorse, he would not, intending to kill\nhimself, pronounce phrases about his own services, about the pearl, and\nabout his eyes dropping tears "_as fast as the Arabian trees their\nmedicinal gum_"; and yet less about the Turk\'s beating an Italian and\nhow he, Othello, smote him--_thus!_ So that notwithstanding the powerful\nexpression of emotion in Othello when, under the influence of Iago\'s\nhints, jealousy rises in him, and again in his scenes with Desdemona,\none\'s conception of Othello\'s character is constantly infringed by his\nfalse pathos and the unnatural speeches he pronounces.\n\nSo it is with the chief character, Othello, but notwithstanding its\nalteration and the disadvantageous features which it is made thereby to\npresent in comparison with the character from which it was taken in the\nromance, this character still remains a character, but all the other\npersonages are completely spoiled by Shakespeare.\n\nIago, according to Shakespeare, is an unmitigated villain, deceiver, and\nthief, a robber who robs Roderigo and always succeeds even in his most\nimpossible designs, and therefore is a person quite apart from real\nlife. In Shakespeare, the motive of his villainy is, first, that Othello\ndid not give him the post he desired; secondly, that he suspects Othello\nof an intrigue with his wife and, thirdly, that, as he says, he feels a\nstrange kind of love for Desdemona. There are many motives, but they are\nall vague. Whereas in the romance there is but one simple and clear\nmotive, Iago\'s passionate love for Desdemona, transmitted into hatred\ntoward her and Othello after she had preferred the Moor to him and\nresolutely repulsed him. Yet more unnatural is the utterly unnecessary\nRoderigo whom Iago deceives and robs, promising him Desdemona\'s love,\nand whom he forces to fulfil all he commands: to intoxicate Cassio,\nprovoke and then kill Cassio. Emilia, who says anything it may occur to\nthe author to put into her mouth, has not even the slightest semblance\nof a live character.\n\n"But Falstaff, the wonderful Falstaff," Shakespeare\'s eulogists will\nsay, "of him, at all events, one can not say that he is not a living\ncharacter, or that, having been taken from the comedy of an unknown\nauthor, it has been weakened."\n\nFalstaff, like all Shakespeare\'s characters, was taken from a drama or\ncomedy by an unknown author, written on a really living person, Sir John\nOldcastle, who had been the friend of some duke. This Oldcastle had once\nbeen convicted of heresy, but had been saved by his friend the duke. But\nafterward he was condemned and burned at the stake for his religious\nbeliefs, which did not conform with Catholicism. It was on this same\nOldcastle that an anonymous author, in order to please the Catholic\npublic, wrote a comedy or drama, ridiculing this martyr for his faith\nand representing him as a good-for-nothing man, the boon companion of\nthe duke, and it is from this comedy that Shakespeare borrowed, not\nonly the character of Falstaff, but also his own ironical attitude\ntoward it. In Shakespeare\'s first works, when this character appeared,\nit was frankly called "Oldcastle," but later, in Elizabeth\'s time, when\nProtestantism again triumphed, it was awkward to bring out with mockery\na martyr in the strife with Catholicism, and, besides, Oldcastle\'s\nrelatives had protested, and Shakespeare accordingly altered the name of\nOldcastle to that of Falstaff, also a historical figure, known for\nhaving fled from the field of battle at Agincourt.\n\nFalstaff is, indeed, quite a natural and typical character; but then it\nis perhaps the only natural and typical character depicted by\nShakespeare. And this character is natural and typical because, of all\nShakespeare\'s characters, it alone speaks a language proper to itself.\nAnd it speaks thus because it speaks in that same Shakespearian\nlanguage, full of mirthless jokes and unamusing puns which, being\nunnatural to all Shakespeare\'s other characters, is quite in harmony\nwith the boastful, distorted, and depraved character of the drunken\nFalstaff. For this reason alone does this figure truly represent a\ndefinite character. Unfortunately, the artistic effect of this character\nis spoilt by the fact that it is so repulsive by its gluttony,\ndrunkenness, debauchery, rascality, deceit, and cowardice, that it is\ndifficult to share the feeling of gay humor with which the author treats\nit. Thus it is with Falstaff.\n\nBut in none of Shakespeare\'s figures is his, I will not say incapacity\nto give, but utter indifference to giving, his personages a typical\ncharacter so strikingly manifest as in Hamlet; and in connection with\nnone of Shakespeare\'s works do we see so strikingly displayed that blind\nworship of Shakespeare, that unreasoning state of hypnotism owing to\nwhich the mere thought even is not admitted that any of Shakespeare\'s\nproductions can be wanting in genius, or that any of the principal\npersonages in his dramas can fail to be the expression of a new and\ndeeply conceived character.\n\nShakespeare takes an old story, not bad in its way, relating:\n\n"Avec quelle ruse Amlette qui depuis fut Roy de Dannemarch, vengea la\nmort de son pere Horwendille, occis par Fengon son frere, et autre\noccurrence de son histoire," or a drama which was written on this theme\nfifteen years before him. On this subject he writes his own drama,\nintroducing quite inappropriately (as indeed he always does) into the\nmouth of the principal person all those thoughts of his own which\nappeared to him worthy of attention. And putting into the mouth of his\nhero these thoughts: about life (the grave-digger), about death (To be\nor not to be)--the same which are expressed in his sixty-sixth\nsonnet--about the theater, about women. He is utterly unconcerned as to\nthe circumstances under which these words are said, and it naturally\nturns out that the person expressing all these thoughts is a mere\nphonograph of Shakespeare, without character, whose actions and words do\nnot agree.\n\nIn the old legend, Hamlet\'s personality is quite comprehensible: he is\nindignant at his mother\'s and his uncle\'s deeds, and wishes to revenge\nhimself upon them, but is afraid his uncle may kill him as he had killed\nhis father. Therefore he simulates insanity, desiring to bide his time\nand observe all that goes on in the palace. Meanwhile, his uncle and\nmother, being afraid of him, wish to test whether he is feigning or is\nreally mad, and send to him a girl whom he loves. He persists, then sees\nhis mother in private, kills a courtier who was eavesdropping, and\nconvicts his mother of her sin. Afterward he is sent to England, but\nintercepts letters and, returning from England, takes revenge of his\nenemies, burning them all.\n\nAll this is comprehensible and flows from Hamlet\'s character and\nposition. But Shakespeare, putting into Hamlet\'s mouth speeches which he\nhimself wishes to express, and making him commit actions which are\nnecessary to the author in order to produce scenic effects, destroys all\nthat constitutes the character of Hamlet and of the legend. During the\nwhole of the drama, Hamlet is doing, not what he would really wish to\ndo, but what is necessary for the author\'s plan. One moment he is\nawe-struck at his father\'s ghost, another moment he begins to chaff it,\ncalling it "old mole"; one moment he loves Ophelia, another moment he\nteases her, and so forth. There is no possibility of finding any\nexplanation whatever of Hamlet\'s actions or words, and therefore no\npossibility of attributing any character to him.\n\nBut as it is recognized that Shakespeare the genius can not write\nanything bad, therefore learned people use all the powers of their minds\nto find extraordinary beauties in what is an obvious and crying failure,\ndemonstrated with especial vividness in "Hamlet," where the principal\nfigure has no character whatever. And lo! profound critics declare that\nin this drama, in the person of Hamlet, is expressed singularly\npowerful, perfectly novel, and deep personality, existing in this person\nhaving no character; and that precisely in this absence of character\nconsists the genius of creating a deeply conceived character. Having\ndecided this, learned critics write volumes upon volumes, so that the\npraise and explanation of the greatness and importance of the\nrepresentation of the character of a man who has no character form in\nvolume a library. It is true that some of the critics timidly express\nthe idea that there is something strange in this figure, that Hamlet is\nan unsolved riddle, but no one has the courage to say (as in Hans\nAndersen\'s story) that the King is naked--_i.e._, that it is as clear as\nday that Shakespeare did not succeed and did not even wish to give any\ncharacter to Hamlet, did not even understand that this was necessary.\nAnd learned critics continue to investigate and extol this puzzling\nproduction, which reminds one of the famous stone with an inscription\nwhich Pickwick found near a cottage doorstep, and which divided the\nscientific world into two hostile camps.\n\nSo that neither do the characters of Lear nor Othello nor Falstaff nor\nyet Hamlet in any way confirm the existing opinion that Shakespeare\'s\npower consists in the delineation of character.\n\nIf in Shakespeare\'s dramas one does meet figures having certain\ncharacteristic features, for the most part secondary figures, such as\nPolonius in "Hamlet" and Portia in "The Merchant of Venice," these few\nlifelike characters among five hundred or more other secondary figures,\nwith the complete absence of character in the principal figures, do not\nat all prove that the merit of Shakespeare\'s dramas consists in the\nexpression of character.\n\nThat a great talent for depicting character is attributed to Shakespeare\narises from his actually possessing a peculiarity which, for superficial\nobservers and in the play of good actors, may appear to be the capacity\nof depicting character. This peculiarity consists in the capacity of\nrepresentative scenes expressing the play of emotion. However unnatural\nthe positions may be in which he places his characters, however improper\nto them the language which he makes them speak, however featureless they\nare, the very play of emotion, its increase, and alteration, and the\ncombination of many contrary feelings, as expressed correctly and\npowerfully in some of Shakespeare\'s scenes, and in the play of good\nactors, evokes even, if only for a time, sympathy with the persons\nrepresented. Shakespeare, himself an actor, and an intelligent man, knew\nhow to express by the means not only of speech, but of exclamation,\ngesture, and the repetition of words, states of mind and developments or\nchanges of feeling taking place in the persons represented. So that, in\nmany instances, Shakespeare\'s characters, instead of speaking, merely\nmake an exclamation, or weep, or in the middle of a monolog, by means of\ngestures, demonstrate the pain of their position (just as Lear asks some\none to unbutton him), or, in moments of great agitation, repeat a\nquestion several times, or several times demand the repetition of a word\nwhich has particularly struck them, as do Othello, Macduff, Cleopatra,\nand others. Such clever methods of expressing the development of\nfeeling, giving good actors the possibility of demonstrating their\npowers, were, and are, often mistaken by many critics for the expression\nof character. But however strongly the play of feeling may be expressed\nin one scene, a single scene can not give the character of a figure when\nthis figure, after a correct exclamation or gesture, begins in a\nlanguage not its own, at the author\'s arbitrary will, to volubly utter\nwords which are neither necessary nor in harmony with its character.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n"Well, but the profound utterances and sayings expressed by\nShakespeare\'s characters," Shakespeare\'s panegyrists will retort. "See\nLear\'s monolog on punishment, Kent\'s speech about vengeance, or Edgar\'s\nabout his former life, Gloucester\'s reflections on the instability of\nfortune, and, in other dramas, the famous monologs of Hamlet, Antony,\nand others."\n\nThoughts and sayings may be appreciated, I will answer, in a prose work,\nin an essay, a collection of aphorisms, but not in an artistic dramatic\nproduction, the object of which is to elicit sympathy with that which is\nrepresented. Therefore the monologs and sayings of Shakespeare, even did\nthey contain very many deep and new thoughts, which they do not, do not\nconstitute the merits of an artistic, poetic production. On the\ncontrary, these speeches, expressed in unnatural conditions, can only\nspoil artistic works.\n\nAn artistic, poetic work, particularly a drama, must first of all excite\nin the reader or spectator the illusion that whatever the person\nrepresented is living through, or experiencing, is lived through or\nexperienced by himself. For this purpose it is as important for the\ndramatist to know precisely what he should make his characters both do\nand say as what he should not make them say and do, so as not to destroy\nthe illusion of the reader or spectator. Speeches, however eloquent and\nprofound they may be, when put into the mouth of dramatic characters, if\nthey be superfluous or unnatural to the position and character, destroy\nthe chief condition of dramatic art--the illusion, owing to which the\nreader or spectator lives in the feelings of the persons represented.\nWithout putting an end to the illusion, one may leave much unsaid--the\nreader or spectator will himself fill this up, and sometimes, owing to\nthis, his illusion is even increased, but to say what is superfluous is\nthe same as to overthrow a statue composed of separate pieces and\nthereby scatter them, or to take away the lamp from a magic lantern: the\nattention of the reader or spectator is distracted, the reader sees the\nauthor, the spectator sees the actor, the illusion disappears, and to\nrestore it is sometimes impossible; therefore without the feeling of\nmeasure there can not be an artist, and especially a dramatist.\n\nShakespeare is devoid of this feeling. His characters continually do and\nsay what is not only unnatural to them, but utterly unnecessary. I do\nnot cite examples of this, because I believe that he who does not\nhimself see this striking deficiency in all Shakespeare\'s dramas will\nnot be persuaded by any examples and proofs. It is sufficient to read\n"King Lear," alone, with its insanity, murders, plucking out of eyes,\nGloucester\'s jump, its poisonings, and wranglings--not to mention\n"Pericles," "Cymbeline," "The Winter\'s Tale," "The Tempest"--to be\nconvinced of this. Only a man devoid of the sense of measure and of\ntaste could produce such types as "Titus Andronicus" or "Troilus and\nCressida," or so mercilessly mutilate the old drama "King Leir."\n\nGervinus endeavors to prove that Shakespeare possessed the feeling of\nbeauty, "Schoenheit\'s sinn," but all Gervinus\'s proofs prove only that he\nhimself, Gervinus, is completely destitute of it. In Shakespeare\neverything is exaggerated: the actions are exaggerated, so are their\nconsequences, the speeches of the characters are exaggerated, and\ntherefore at every step the possibility of artistic impression is\ninterfered with. Whatever people may say, however they may be enraptured\nby Shakespeare\'s works, whatever merits they may attribute to them, it\nis perfectly certain that he was not an artist and that his works are\nnot artistic productions. Without the sense of measure, there never was\nnor can be an artist, as without the feeling of rhythm there can not be\na musician. Shakespeare might have been whatever you like, but he was\nnot an artist.\n\n"But one should not forget the time at which Shakespeare wrote," say his\nadmirers. "It was a time of cruel and coarse habits, a time of the then\nfashionable euphemism, _i.e._, artificial way of expressing oneself--a\ntime of forms of life strange to us, and therefore, to judge about\nShakespeare, one should have in view the time when he wrote. In Homer,\nas in Shakespeare, there is much which is strange to us, but this does\nnot prevent us from appreciating the beauties of Homer," say these\nadmirers. But in comparing Shakespeare with Homer, as does Gervinus,\nthat infinite distance which separates true poetry from its semblance\nmanifests itself with especial force. However distant Homer is from us,\nwe can, without the slightest effort, transport ourselves into the life\nhe describes, and we can thus transport ourselves because, however alien\nto us may be the events Homer describes, he believes in what he says and\nspeaks seriously, and therefore he never exaggerates, and the sense of\nmeasure never abandons him. This is the reason why, not to speak of the\nwonderfully distinct, lifelike, and beautiful characters of Achilles,\nHector, Priam, Odysseus, and the eternally touching scenes of Hector\'s\nleave-taking, of Priam\'s embassy, of Odysseus\'s return, and others--the\nwhole of the "Iliad" and still more the "Odyssey" are so humanly near to\nus that we feel as if we ourselves had lived, and are living, among its\ngods and heroes. Not so with Shakespeare. From his first words,\nexaggeration is seen: the exaggeration of events, the exaggeration of\nemotion, and the exaggeration of effects. One sees at once that he does\nnot believe in what he says, that it is of no necessity to him, that he\ninvents the events he describes, and is indifferent to his\ncharacters--that he has conceived them only for the stage and therefore\nmakes them do and say only what may strike his public; and therefore we\ndo not believe either in the events, or in the actions, or in the\nsufferings of the characters. Nothing demonstrates so clearly the\ncomplete absence of esthetic feeling in Shakespeare as comparison\nbetween him and Homer. The works which we call the works of Homer are\nartistic, poetic, original works, lived through by the author or\nauthors; whereas the works of Shakespeare--borrowed as they are, and,\nexternally, like mosaics, artificially fitted together piecemeal from\nbits invented for the occasion--have nothing whatever in common with art\nand poetry.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nBut, perhaps, the height of Shakespeare\'s conception of life is such\nthat, tho he does not satisfy the esthetic demands, he discloses to us a\nview of life so new and important for men that, in consideration of its\nimportance, all his failures as an artist become imperceptible. So,\nindeed, say Shakespeare\'s admirers. Gervinus says distinctly that\nbesides Shakespeare\'s significance in the sphere of dramatic poetry in\nwhich, according to his opinion, Shakespeare equals "Homer in the sphere\nof Epos, Shakespeare being the very greatest judge of the human soul,\nrepresents a teacher of most indisputable ethical authority and the most\nselect leader in the world and in life."\n\nIn what, then, consists this indisputable authority of the most select\nleader in the world and in life? Gervinus devotes the concluding chapter\nof his second volume, about fifty pages, to an explanation of this.\n\nThe ethical authority of this supreme teacher of life consists in the\nfollowing: The starting point of Shakespeare\'s conception of life, says\nGervinus, is that man is gifted with powers of activity, and therefore,\nfirst of all, according to Gervinus, Shakespeare regarded it as good and\nnecessary for man that he should act (as if it were possible for a man\nnot to act):\n\n"Die thatkraeftigen Maenner, Fortinbras, Bolingbroke, Alcibiades, Octavius\nspielen hier die gegensaetzlichen Rollen gegen die verschiedenen\nthatlosen; nicht ihre Charaktere verdienen ihnen Allen ihr Glueck und\nGedeihen etwa durch eine grosse Ueberlegenheit ihrer Natur, sondern\ntrotz ihrer geringeren Anlage stellt sich ihre Thatkraft an sich ueber\ndie Unthaetigkeit der Anderen hinaus, gleichviel aus wie schoener Quelle\ndiese Passivitaet, aus wie schlechter jene Thaetigkeit fliesse."\n\n_I.e._, active people, like Fortinbras, Bolingbroke, Alcibiades,\nOctavius, says Gervinus, are placed in contrast, by Shakespeare, with\nvarious characters who do not exhibit energetic activity. And happiness\nand success, according to Shakespeare, are attained by individuals\npossessing this active character, not at all owing to the superiority\nof their nature; on the contrary, notwithstanding their inferior gifts,\nthe capacity of activity itself always gives them the advantage over\ninactivity, quite independent of any consideration whether the\ninactivity of some persons flows from excellent impulses and the\nactivity of others from bad ones. "Activity is good, inactivity is evil.\nActivity transforms evil into good," says Shakespeare, according to\nGervinus. Shakespeare prefers the principle of Alexander (of Macedonia)\nto that of Diogenes, says Gervinus. In other words, he prefers death and\nmurder due to ambition, to abstinence and wisdom.\n\nAccording to Gervinus, Shakespeare believes that humanity need not set\nup ideals, but that only healthy activity and the golden mean are\nnecessary in everything. Indeed, Shakespeare is so penetrated by this\nconviction that, according to Gervinus\'s assertion, he allows himself to\ndeny even Christian morality, which makes exaggerated demands on human\nnature. Shakespeare, as we read, did not approve of limits of duty\nexceeding the intentions of nature. He teaches the golden mean between\nheathen hatred to one\'s enemies and Christian love toward them (pp.\n561, 562). How far Shakespeare was penetrated with this fundamental\nprinciple of _reasonable moderation_, says Gervinus, can be seen from\nthe fact that he has the courage to express himself even against the\nChristian rules which prompt human nature to the excessive exertion of\nits powers. He did not admit that the limits of duties should exceed the\nbiddings of Nature. Therefore he preached a reasonable mean natural to\nman, between Christian and heathen precepts, of love toward one\'s\nenemies on the one hand, and hatred toward them on the other.\n\nThat one may do too much good (exceed the reasonable limits of good) is\nconvincingly proved by Shakespeare\'s words and examples. Thus excessive\ngenerosity ruins Timon, while Antonio\'s moderate generosity confers\nhonor; normal ambition makes Henry V. great, whereas it ruins Percy, in\nwhom it has risen too high; excessive virtue leads Angelo to\ndestruction, and if, in those who surround him, excessive severity\nbecomes harmful and can not prevent crime, on the other hand the divine\nelement in man, even charity, if it be excessive, can create crime.\n\nShakespeare taught, says Gervinus, that one _may be too good_.\n\nHe teaches that morality, like politics, is a matter in which, owing to\nthe complexity of circumstances and motives, one can not establish any\nprinciples (p. 563), and in this he agrees with Bacon and\nAristotle--there are no positive religious and moral laws which may\ncreate principles for correct moral conduct suitable for all cases.\n\nGervinus most clearly expresses the whole of Shakespeare\'s moral theory\nby saying that Shakespeare does not write for those classes for whom\ndefinite religious principles and laws are suitable (_i.e._, for nine\nhundred and ninety-nine one-thousandths of men) but for the educated:\n\n"There are classes of men whose morality is best guarded by the positive\nprecepts of religion and state law; to such persons Shakespeare\'s\ncreations are inaccessible. They are comprehensible and accessible only\nto the educated, from whom one can expect that they should acquire the\nhealthy tact of life and self-consciousness by means of which the innate\nguiding powers of conscience and reason, uniting with the will, lead us\nto the definite attainment of worthy aims in life. But even for such\neducated people, Shakespeare\'s teaching is not always without danger.\nThe condition on which his teaching is quite harmless is that it should\nbe accepted in all its completeness, in all its parts, without any\nomission. Then it is not only without danger, but is the most clear and\nfaultless and therefore the most worthy of confidence of all moral\nteaching" (p. 564).\n\nIn order thus to accept all, one should understand that, according to\nhis teaching, it is stupid and harmful for the individual to revolt\nagainst, or endeavor to overthrow, the limits of established religious\nand state forms. "Shakespeare," says Gervinus, "would abhor an\nindependent and free individual who, with a powerful spirit, should\nstruggle against all convention in politics and morality and overstep\nthat union between religion and the State which has for thousands of\nyears supported society. According to his views, the practical wisdom of\nmen could not have a higher object than the introduction into society of\nthe greatest spontaneity and freedom, but precisely because of this one\nshould safeguard as sacred and irrefragable the natural laws of\nsociety--one should respect the existing order of things and,\ncontinually verifying it, inculcate its rational sides, not overlooking\nnature for the sake of culture, or _vice versa_" (p. 566). Property, the\nfamily, the state, are sacred; but aspiration toward the recognition of\nthe equality of men is insanity. Its realization would bring humanity to\nthe greatest calamities. No one struggled more than Shakespeare against\nthe privileges of rank and position, but could this freethinking man\nresign himself to the privileges of the wealthy and educated being\ndestroyed in order to give room to the poor and ignorant? How could a\nman who so eloquently attracts people toward honors, permit that the\nvery aspiration toward that which was great be crushed together with\nrank and distinction for services, and, with the destruction of all\ndegrees, "the motives for all high undertakings be stifled"? Even if the\nattraction of honors and false power treacherously obtained were to\ncease, could the poet admit of the most dreadful of all violence, that\nof the ignorant crowd? He saw that, thanks to this equality now\npreached, everything may pass into violence, and violence into arbitrary\nacts and thence into unchecked passion which will rend the world as the\nwolf does its prey, and in the end the world will swallow itself up.\nEven if this does not happen with mankind when it attains equality--if\nthe love of nations and eternal peace prove not to be that impossible\n"nothing," as Alonso expressed it in "The Tempest"--but if, on the\ncontrary, the actual attainment of aspirations toward equality is\npossible, then the poet would deem that the old age and extinction of\nthe world had approached, and that, therefore, for active individuals,\nit is not worth while to live (pp. 571, 572).\n\nSuch is Shakespeare\'s view of life as demonstrated by his greatest\nexponent and admirer.\n\nAnother of the most modern admirers of Shakespeare, George Brandes,\nfurther sets forth:[2]\n\n"No one, of course, can conserve his life quite pure from evil, from\ndeceit, and from the injury of others, but evil and deceit are not\nalways vices, and even the evil caused to others, is not necessarily a\nvice: it is often merely a necessity, a legitimate weapon, a right. And\nindeed, Shakespeare always held that there are no unconditional\nprohibitions, nor unconditional duties. For instance, he did not doubt\nHamlet\'s right to kill the King, nor even his right to stab Polonius to\ndeath, and yet he could not restrain himself from an overwhelming\nfeeling of indignation and repulsion when, looking around, he saw\neverywhere how incessantly the most elementary moral laws were being\ninfringed. Now, in his mind there was formed, as it were, a closely\nriveted ring of thoughts concerning which he had always vaguely felt:\nsuch unconditional commandments do not exist; the quality and\nsignificance of an act, not to speak of a character, do not depend upon\ntheir enactment or infringement; the whole substance lies in the\ncontents with which the separate individual, at the moment of his\ndecision and on his own responsibility, fills up the form of these\nlaws."\n\nIn other words, Shakespeare at last clearly saw that the moral of the\n_aim_ is the only true and possible one; so that, according to Brandes,\nShakespeare\'s fundamental principle, for which he extols him, is that\n_the end justifies the means_--action at all costs, the absence of all\nideals, moderation in everything, the conservation of the forms of life\nonce established, and the end justifying the means. If you add to this a\nChauvinist English patriotism, expressed in all the historical dramas, a\npatriotism according to which the English throne is something sacred,\nEnglishmen always vanquishing the French, killing thousands and losing\nonly scores, Joan of Arc regarded as a witch, and the belief that Hector\nand all the Trojans, from whom the English came, are heroes, while the\nGreeks are cowards and traitors, and so forth,--such is the view of life\nof the wisest teacher of life according to his greatest admirers. And he\nwho will attentively read Shakespeare\'s works can not fail to recognize\nthat the description of this Shakespearian view of life by his admirers\nis quite correct.\n\nThe merit of every poetic work depends on three things:\n\n(1) The subject of the work: the deeper the subject, _i.e._, the more\nimportant it is to the life of mankind, the higher is the work.\n\n(2) The external beauty achieved by technical methods proper to the\nparticular kind of art. Thus, in dramatic art, the technical method will\nbe a true individuality of language, corresponding to the characters, a\nnatural, and at the same time touching plot, a correct scenic rendering\nof the demonstration and development of emotion, and the feeling of\nmeasure in all that is represented.\n\n(3) Sincerity, _i.e._, that the author should himself keenly feel what\nhe expresses. Without this condition there can be no work of art, as the\nessence of art consists in the contemplation of the work of art being\ninfected with the author\'s feeling. If the author does not actually feel\nwhat he expresses, then the recipient can not become infected with the\nfeeling of the author, does not experience any feeling, and the\nproduction can no longer be classified as a work of art.\n\nThe subject of Shakespeare\'s pieces, as is seen from the demonstrations\nof his greatest admirers, is the lowest, most vulgar view of life, which\nregards the external elevation of the lords of the world as a genuine\ndistinction, despises the crowd, _i.e._, the working\nclasses--repudiates not only all religious, but also all humanitarian,\nstrivings directed to the betterment of the existing order.\n\nThe second condition also, with the exception of the rendering of the\nscenes in which the movement of feelings is expressed, is quite absent\nin Shakespeare. He does not grasp the natural character of the positions\nof his personages, nor the language of the persons represented, nor the\nfeeling of measure without which no work can be artistic.\n\nThe third and most important condition, sincerity, is completely absent\nin all Shakespeare\'s works. In all of them one sees intentional\nartifice; one sees that he is not _in earnest_, but that he is playing\nwith words.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nShakespeare\'s works do not satisfy the demands of all art, and, besides\nthis, their tendency is of the lowest and most immoral. What then\nsignifies the great fame these works have enjoyed for more than a\nhundred years?\n\nMany times during my life I have had occasion to argue about Shakespeare\nwith his admirers, not only with people little sensitive to poetry, but\nwith those who keenly felt poetic beauty, such as Turgenef, Fet,[3] and\nothers, and every time I encountered one and the same attitude toward my\nobjection to the praises of Shakespeare. I was not refuted when I\npointed out Shakespeare\'s defects; they only condoled with me for my\nwant of comprehension, and urged upon me the necessity of recognizing\nthe extraordinary supernatural grandeur of Shakespeare, and they did not\nexplain to me in what the beauties of Shakespeare consisted, but were\nmerely vaguely and exaggeratedly enraptured with the whole of\nShakespeare, extolling some favorite passages: the unbuttoning of Lear\'s\nbutton, Falstaff\'s lying, Lady Macbeth\'s ineffaceable spots, Hamlet\'s\nexhortation to his father\'s ghost, "forty thousand brothers," etc.\n\n"Open Shakespeare," I used to say to these admirers, "wherever you like,\nor wherever it may chance, you will see that you will never find ten\nconsecutive lines which are comprehensible, unartificial, natural to the\ncharacter that says them, and which produce an artistic impression."\n(This experiment may be made by any one. And either at random, or\naccording to their own choice.) Shakespeare\'s admirers opened pages in\nShakespeare\'s dramas, and without paying any attention to my criticisms\nas to why the selected ten lines did not satisfy the most elementary\ndemands of esthetic and common sense, they were enchanted with the very\nthing which to me appeared absurd, incomprehensible, and inartistic. So\nthat, in general, when I endeavored to get from Shakespeare\'s worshipers\nan explanation of his greatness, I met in them exactly the same\nattitude which I have met, and which is usually met, in the defenders of\nany dogmas accepted not through reason, but through faith. It is this\nattitude of Shakespeare\'s admirers toward their object--an attitude\nwhich may be seen also in all the mistily indefinite essays and\nconversations about Shakespeare--which gave me the key to the\nunderstanding of the cause of Shakespeare\'s fame. There is but one\nexplanation of this wonderful fame: it is one of those epidemic\n"suggestions" to which men constantly have been and are subject. Such\n"suggestion" always has existed and does exist in the most varied\nspheres of life. As glaring instances, considerable in scope and in\ndeceitful influence, one may cite the medieval Crusades which afflicted,\nnot only adults, but even children, and the individual "suggestions,"\nstartling in their senselessness, such as faith in witches, in the\nutility of torture for the discovery of the truth, the search for the\nelixir of life, the philosopher\'s stone, or the passion for tulips\nvalued at several thousand guldens a bulb which took hold of Holland.\nSuch irrational "suggestions" always have been existing, and still\nexist, in all spheres of human life--religious, philosophical,\npolitical, economical, scientific, artistic, and, in general,\nliterary--and people clearly see the insanity of these suggestions only\nwhen they free themselves from them. But, as long as they are under\ntheir influence, the suggestions appear to them so certain, so true,\nthat to argue about them is regarded as neither necessary nor possible.\nWith the development of the printing press, these epidemics became\nespecially striking.\n\nWith the development of the press, it has now come to pass that so soon\nas any event, owing to casual circumstances, receives an especially\nprominent significance, immediately the organs of the press announce\nthis significance. As soon as the press has brought forward the\nsignificance of the event, the public devotes more and more attention to\nit. The attention of the public prompts the press to examine the event\nwith greater attention and in greater detail. The interest of the public\nfurther increases, and the organs of the press, competing with one\nanother, satisfy the public demand. The public is still more\ninterested; the press attributes yet more significance to the event. So\nthat the importance of the event, continually growing, like a lump of\nsnow, receives an appreciation utterly inappropriate to its real\nsignificance, and this appreciation, often exaggerated to insanity, is\nretained so long as the conception of life of the leaders of the press\nand of the public remains the same. There are innumerable examples of\nsuch an inappropriate estimation which, in our time, owing to the mutual\ninfluence of press and public on one another, is attached to the most\ninsignificant subjects. A striking example of such mutual influence of\nthe public and the press was the excitement in the case of Dreyfus,\nwhich lately caught hold of the whole world.\n\nThe suspicion arose that some captain of the French staff was guilty of\ntreason. Whether because this particular captain was a Jew, or because\nof some special internal party disagreements in French society, the\npress attached a somewhat prominent interest to this event, whose like\nis continually occurring without attracting any one\'s attention, and\nwithout being able to interest even the French military, still less the\nwhole world. The public turned its attention to this incident, the\norgans of the press, mutually competing, began to describe, examine,\ndiscuss the event; the public was yet more interested; the press\nanswered to the demand of the public, and the lump of snow began to grow\nand grow, till before our eyes it attained such a bulk that there was\nnot a family where controversies did not rage about "l\'affaire." The\ncaricature by Caran d\'Ache representing at first a peaceful family\nresolved to talk no more about Dreyfus, and then, like exasperated\nfuries, members of the same family fighting with each other, quite\ncorrectly expressed the attitude of the whole of the reading world to\nthe question about Dreyfus. People of foreign nationalities, who could\nnot be interested in the question whether a French officer was a traitor\nor not--people, moreover, who could know nothing of the development of\nthe case--all divided themselves for and against Dreyfus, and the moment\nthey met they talked and argued about Dreyfus, some asserting his guilt\nwith assurance, others denying it with equal assurance. Only after the\nlapse of some years did people begin to awake from the "suggestion" and\nto understand that they could not possibly know whether Dreyfus was\nguilty or not, and that each one had thousands of subjects much more\nnear to him and interesting than the case of Dreyfus.\n\nSuch infatuations take place in all spheres, but they are especially\nnoticeable in the sphere of literature, as the press naturally occupies\nitself the more keenly with the affairs of the press, and they are\nparticularly powerful in our time when the press has received such an\nunnatural development. It continually happens that people suddenly begin\nto extol some most insignificant works, in exaggerated language, and\nthen, if these works do not correspond to the prevailing view of life,\nthey suddenly become utterly indifferent to them, and forget both the\nworks themselves and their former attitude toward them.\n\nSo within my recollection, in the forties, there was in the sphere of\nart the laudation and glorification of Eugene Sue, and Georges Sand; and\nin the social sphere Fourier; in the philosophical sphere, Comte and\nHegel; in the scientific sphere, Darwin.\n\nSue is quite forgotten, Georges Sand is being forgotten and replaced by\nthe writings of Zola and the Decadents, Beaudelaire, Verlaine,\nMaeterlinck, and others. Fourier with his phalansteries is quite\nforgotten, his place being taken by Marx. Hegel, who justified the\nexisting order, and Comte, who denied the necessity of religious\nactivity in mankind, and Darwin with his law of struggle, still hold on,\nbut are beginning to be forgotten, being replaced by the teaching of\nNietzsche, which, altho utterly extravagant, unconsidered, misty, and\nvicious in its bearing, yet corresponds better with existing tendencies.\nThus sometimes artistic, philosophic, and, in general, literary crazes\nsuddenly arise and are as quickly forgotten. But it also happens that\nsuch crazes, having arisen in consequence of special reasons\naccidentally favoring to their establishment, correspond in such a\ndegree to the views of life spread in society, and especially in\nliterary circles, that they are maintained for a long time. As far back\nas in the time of Rome, it was remarked that often books have their own\nvery strange fates: consisting in failure notwithstanding their high\nmerits, and in enormous undeserved success notwithstanding their\ntriviality. The saying arose: "pro captu lectoris habent sua fata\nlibelli"--_i.e._, that the fate of books depends on the understanding of\nthose who read them. There was harmony between Shakespeare\'s writings\nand the view of life of those amongst whom his fame arose. And this fame\nhas been, and still is, maintained owing to Shakespeare\'s works\ncontinuing to correspond to the life concept of those who support this\nfame.\n\nUntil the end of the eighteenth century Shakespeare not only failed to\ngain any special fame in England, but was valued less than his\ncontemporary dramatists: Ben Jonson, Fletcher, Beaumont, and others. His\nfame originated in Germany, and thence was transferred to England. This\nhappened for the following reason:\n\nArt, especially dramatic art, demanding for its realization great\npreparations, outlays, and labor, was always religious, _i.e._, its\nobject was to stimulate in men a clearer conception of that relation of\nman to God which had, at that time, been attained by the leading men of\nthe circles interested in art.\n\nSo it was bound to be from its own nature, and so, as a matter of fact,\nhas it always been among all nations--Egyptians, Hindus, Chinese,\nGreeks--commencing in some remote period of human life. And it has\nalways happened that, with the coarsening of religious forms, art has\nmore and more diverged from its original object (according to which it\ncould be regarded as an important function--almost an act of worship),\nand, instead of serving religious objects, it strove for worldly aims,\nseeking to satisfy the demands of the crowd or of the powerful, _i.e._,\nthe aims of recreation and amusement. This deviation of art from its\ntrue and high vocation took place everywhere, and even in connection\nwith Christianity.\n\nThe first manifestations of Christian art were services in churches: in\nthe administration of the sacraments and the ordinary liturgy. When, in\ncourse of time, the forms of art as used in worship became insufficient,\nthere appeared the Mysteries, describing those events which were\nregarded as the most important in the Christian religious view of life.\nWhen, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the center of gravity\nof Christian teaching was more and more transferred, the worship of\nChrist as God, and the interpretation and following of His teaching, the\nform of Mysteries describing external Christian events became\ninsufficient, and new forms were demanded. As the expression of the\naspirations which gave rise to these changes, there appeared the\nMoralities, dramatic representations in which the characters were\npersonifications of Christian virtues and their opposite vices.\n\nBut allegories, owing to the very fact of their being works of art of a\nlower order, could not replace the former religious dramas, and yet no\nnew forms of dramatic art corresponding to the conception now\nentertained of Christianity, according to which it was regarded as a\nteaching of life, had yet been found. Hence, dramatic art, having no\nfoundation, came in all Christian countries to swerve farther and\nfarther from its proper use and object, and, instead of serving God, it\ntook to serving the crowd (by crowd, I mean, not simply the masses of\ncommon people, but the majority of immoral or unmoral men, indifferent\nto the higher problems of human life). This deviation was, moreover,\nencouraged by the circumstance that, at this very time, the Greek\nthinkers, poets, and dramatists, hitherto unknown in the Christian\nworld, were discovered and brought back into favor. From all this it\nfollowed that, not having yet had time to work out their own form of\ndramatic art corresponding to the new conception entertained of\nChristianity as being a teaching of life, and, at the same time,\nrecognizing the previous form of Mysteries and Moralities as\ninsufficient, the writers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in\ntheir search for a new form, began to imitate the newly discovered Greek\nmodels, attracted by their elegance and novelty.\n\nSince those who could principally avail themselves of dramatic\nrepresentations were the powerful of this world: kings, princes,\ncourtiers, the least religious people, not only utterly indifferent to\nthe questions of religion, but in most cases completely\ndepraved--therefore, in satisfying the demands of its audience, the\ndrama of the fifteenth and sixteenth and seventeenth centuries entirely\ngave up all religious aim. It came to pass that the drama, which\nformerly had such a lofty and religious significance, and which can, on\nthis condition alone, occupy an important place in human life, became,\nas in the time of Rome, a spectacle, an amusement, a recreation--_only_\nwith this difference, that in Rome the spectacles existed for the whole\npeople, whereas in the Christian world of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and\nseventeenth centuries they were principally meant for depraved kings and\nthe higher classes. Such was the case with the Spanish, English,\nItalian, and French drama.\n\nThe dramas of that time, principally composed, in all these countries,\naccording to ancient Greek models, or taken from poems, legends, or\nbiographies, naturally reflected the characteristics of their respective\nnationalities: in Italy comedies were chiefly elaborated, with humorous\npositions and persons. In Spain there flourished the worldly drama, with\ncomplicated plots and historical heroes. The peculiarities of the\nEnglish drama were the coarse incidents of murders, executions, and\nbattles taking place on the stage, and popular, humorous interludes.\nNeither the Italian nor the Spanish nor the English drama had European\nfame, but they all enjoyed success in their own countries. General fame,\nowing to the elegance of its language and the talent of its writers,\nwas possessed only by the French drama, distinguished by its strict\nadherence to the Greek models, and especially to the law of the three\nUnities.\n\nSo it continued till the end of the eighteenth century, at which time\nthis happened: In Germany, which had not produced even passable dramatic\nwriters (there was a weak and little known writer, Hans Sachs), all\neducated people, together with Frederick the Great, bowed down before\nthe French pseudo-classical drama. Yet at this very time there appeared\nin Germany a group of educated and talented writers and poets, who,\nfeeling the falsity and coldness of the French drama, endeavored to find\na new and freer dramatic form. The members of this group, like all the\nupper classes of the Christian world at that time, were under the charm\nand influence of the Greek classics, and, being utterly indifferent to\nreligious questions, they thought that if the Greek drama, describing\nthe calamities and sufferings and strife of its heroes, represented the\nhighest dramatic ideal, then such a description of the sufferings and\nthe struggles of heroes would be a sufficient subject in the Christian\nworld, too, if only the narrow demands of pseudo-classicalism were\nrejected. These men, not understanding that, for the Greeks, the strife\nand sufferings of their heroes had a religious significance, imagined\nthat they needed only to reject the inconvenient law of the three\nUnities, without introducing into the drama any religious element\ncorresponding to their time, in order that the drama should have\nsufficient scope in the representation of various moments in the lives\nof historical personages and, in general, of strong human passions.\nExactly this kind of drama existed at that time among the kindred\nEnglish people, and, becoming acquainted with it, the Germans decided\nthat precisely such should be the drama of the new period.\n\nThereupon, because of the clever development of scenes which constituted\nShakespeare\'s peculiarity, they chose Shakespeare\'s dramas in preference\nto all other English dramas, excluding those which were not in the least\ninferior, but were even superior, to Shakespeare. At the head of the\ngroup stood Goethe, who was then the dictator of public opinion in\nesthetic questions. He it was who, partly owing to a desire to destroy\nthe fascination of the false French art, partly owing to his desire to\ngive a greater scope to his own dramatic writing, but chiefly through\nthe agreement of his view of life with Shakespeare\'s, declared\nShakespeare a great poet. When this error was announced by an authority\nlike Goethe, all those esthetic critics who did not understand art threw\nthemselves on it like crows on carrion and began to discover in\nShakespeare beauties which did not exist, and to extol them. These men,\nGerman esthetic critics, for the most part utterly devoid of esthetic\nfeeling, without that simple, direct artistic sensibility which, for\npeople with a feeling for art, clearly distinguishes esthetic\nimpressions from all others, but believing the authority which had\nrecognized Shakespeare as a great poet, began to praise the whole of\nShakespeare indiscriminately, especially distinguishing such passages as\nstruck them by their effects, or which expressed thoughts corresponding\nto their views of life, imagining that these effects and these thoughts\nconstitute the essence of what is called art. These men acted as blind\nmen would act who endeavored to find diamonds by touch among a heap of\nstones they were fingering. As the blind man would for a long time\nstrenuously handle the stones and in the end would come to no other\nconclusion than that all stones are precious and especially so the\nsmoothest, so also these esthetic critics, without artistic feeling,\ncould not but come to similar results in relation to Shakespeare. To\ngive the greater force to their praise of the whole of Shakespeare, they\ninvented esthetic theories according to which it appeared that no\ndefinite religious view of life was necessary for works of art in\ngeneral, and especially for the drama; that for the purpose of the drama\nthe representation of human passions and characters was quite\nsufficient; that not only was an internal religious illumination of what\nwas represented unnecessary, but art should be objective, _i.e._, should\nrepresent events quite independently of any judgment of good and evil.\nAs these theories were founded on Shakespeare\'s own views of life, it\nnaturally turned out that the works of Shakespeare satisfied these\ntheories and therefore were the height of perfection.\n\nIt is these people who are chiefly responsible for Shakespeare\'s fame.\nIt was principally owing to their writings that the interaction took\nplace between writers and public which expressed itself, and is still\nexpressing itself, in an insane worship of Shakespeare which has no\nrational foundation. These esthetic critics have written profound\ntreatises about Shakespeare. Eleven thousand volumes have been written\nabout him, and a whole science of Shakespearology composed; while the\npublic, on the one hand, took more and more interest, and the learned\ncritics, on the other hand, gave further and further explanations,\nadding to the confusion.\n\nSo that the first cause of Shakespeare\'s fame was that the Germans\nwished to oppose to the cold French drama, of which they had grown\nweary, and which, no doubt, was tedious enough, a livelier and freer\none. The second cause was that the young German writers required a model\nfor writing their own dramas. The third and principal cause was the\nactivity of the learned and zealous esthetic German critics without\nesthetic feeling, who invented the theory of objective art,\ndeliberately rejecting the religious essence of the drama.\n\n"But," I shall be asked, "what do you understand by the word\'s religious\nessence of the drama? May not what you are demanding for the drama,\nreligious instruction, or didactics, be called \'tendency,\' a thing\nincompatible with true art?" I reply that by the religious essence of\nart I understand not the direct inculcation of any religious truths in\nan artistic guise, and not an allegorical demonstration of these truths,\nbut the exhibition of a definite view of life corresponding to the\nhighest religious understanding of a given time, which, serving as the\nmotive for the composition of the drama, penetrates, to the knowledge of\nthe author, through all of his work. So it has always been with true\nart, and so it is with every true artist in general and especially the\ndramatist. Hence--as it was when the drama was a serious thing, and as\nit should be according to the essence of the matter--that man alone can\nwrite a drama who has something to say to men, and something which is of\nthe greatest importance for them: about man\'s relation to God, to the\nUniverse, to the All, the Eternal, the Infinite. But when, thanks to\nthe German theories about objective art, the idea was established that,\nfor the drama, this was quite unnecessary, then it is obvious how a\nwriter like Shakespeare--who had not got developed in his mind the\nreligious convictions proper to his time, who, in fact, had no\nconvictions at all, but heaped up in his drama all possible events,\nhorrors, fooleries, discussions, and effects--could appear to be a\ndramatic writer of the greatest genius.\n\nBut these are all external reasons. The fundamental inner cause of\nShakespeare\'s fame was and is this: that his dramas were "pro captu\nlectoris," _i.e._, they corresponded to the irreligious and immoral\nframe of mind of the upper classes of his time.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nAt the beginning of the last century, when Goethe was dictator of\nphilosophic thought and esthetic laws, a series of casual circumstances\nmade him praise Shakespeare. The esthetic critics caught up this praise\nand took to writing their lengthy, misty, learned articles, and the\ngreat European public began to be enchanted with Shakespeare. The\ncritics, answering to the popular interest, and endeavoring to compete\nwith one another, wrote new and ever new essays about Shakespeare; the\nreaders and spectators on their side were increasingly confirmed in\ntheir admiration, and Shakespeare\'s fame, like a lump of snow, kept\ngrowing and growing, until in our time it has attained that insane\nworship which obviously has no other foundation than "suggestion."\n\nShakespeare finds no rival, not even approximately, either among the old\nor the new writers. Here are some of the tributes paid to him.\n\n"Poetic truth is the brightest flower in the crown of Shakespeare\'s\nmerits;" "Shakespeare is the greatest moralist of all times;"\n"Shakespeare exhibits such many-sidedness and such objectivism that they\ncarry him beyond the limits of time and nationality;" "Shakespeare is\nthe greatest genius that has hitherto existed;" "For the creation of\ntragedy, comedy, history, idyll, idyllistic comedy, esthetic idyll, for\nthe profoundest presentation, or for any casually thrown off, passing\npiece of verse, he is the only man. He not only wields an unlimited\npower over our mirth and our tears, over all the workings of passion,\nhumor, thought, and observation, but he possesses also an infinite\nregion full of the phantasy of fiction, of a horrifying and an amusing\ncharacter. He possesses penetration both in the world of fiction and of\nreality, and above this reigns one and the same truthfulness to\ncharacter and to nature, and the same spirit of humanity;" "To\nShakespeare the epithet of Great comes of itself; and if one adds that\nindependently of his greatness he has, further, become the reformer of\nall literature, and, moreover, has in his works not only expressed the\nphenomenon of life as it was in his day, but also, by the genius of\nthought which floated in the air has prophetically forestalled the\ndirection that the social spirit was going to take in the future (of\nwhich we see a striking example in Hamlet),--one may, without\nhesitation, say that Shakespeare was not only a great poet, but the\ngreatest of all poets who ever existed, and that in the sphere of poetic\ncreation his only worthy rival was that same life which in his works he\nexpressed to such perfection."\n\nThe obvious exaggeration of this estimate proves more conclusively than\nanything that it is the consequence, not of common sense, but of\nsuggestion. The more trivial, the lower, the emptier a phenomenon is, if\nonly it has become the subject of suggestion, the more supernatural and\nexaggerated is the significance attributed to it. The Pope is not merely\nsaintly, but most saintly, and so forth. So Shakespeare is not merely a\ngood writer, but the greatest genius, the eternal teacher of man kind.\n\nSuggestion is always a deceit, and every deceit is an evil. In truth,\nthe suggestion that Shakespeare\'s works are great works of genius,\npresenting the height of both esthetic and ethical perfection, has\ncaused, and is causing, great injury to men.\n\nThis injury is twofold: first, the fall of the drama, and the\nreplacement of this important weapon of progress by an empty and immoral\namusement; and secondly, the direct depravation of men by presenting to\nthem false models for imitation.\n\nHuman life is perfected only through the development of the religious\nconsciousness, the only element which permanently unites men. The\ndevelopment of the religious consciousness of men is accomplished\nthrough all the sides of man\'s spiritual activity. One direction of this\nactivity is in art. One section of art, perhaps the most influential, is\nthe drama.\n\nTherefore the drama, in order to deserve the importance attributed to\nit, should serve the development of religious consciousness. Such has\nthe drama always been, and such it was in the Christian world. But upon\nthe appearance of Protestantism in its broader sense, _i.e._, the\nappearance of a new understanding of Christianity as of a teaching of\nlife, the dramatic art did not find a form corresponding to the new\nunderstanding of Christianity, and the men of the Renaissance were\ncarried away by the imitation of classical art. This was most natural,\nbut the tendency was bound to pass, and art had to discover, as indeed\nit is now beginning to do, its new form corresponding to the change in\nthe understanding of Christianity.\n\nBut the discovery of this new form was arrested by the teaching arising\namong German writers at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the\nnineteenth centuries--as to so-called objective art, _i.e._, art\nindifferent to good or evil--and therein the exaggerated praise of\nShakespeare\'s dramas, which partly corresponded to the esthetic teaching\nof the Germans, and partly served as material for it. If there had not\nbeen exaggerated praise of Shakespeare\'s dramas, presenting them as the\nmost perfect models, the men of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\nwould have had to understand that the drama, to have a right to exist\nand to be a serious thing, must serve, as it always has served and can\nnot but do otherwise, the development of the religious consciousness.\nAnd having understood this, they would have searched for a new form of\ndrama corresponding to their religious understanding.\n\nBut when it was decided that the height of perfection was Shakespeare\'s\ndrama, and that we ought to write as he did, not only without any\nreligious, but even without any moral, significance, then all writers of\ndramas in imitation of him began to compose such empty pieces as are\nthose of Goethe, Schiller, Hugo, and, in Russia, of Pushkin, or the\nchronicles of Ostrovski, Alexis Tolstoy, and an innumerable number of\nother more or less celebrated dramatic productions which fill all the\ntheaters, and can be prepared wholesale by any one who happens to have\nthe idea or desire to write a play. It is only thanks to such a low,\ntrivial understanding of the significance of the drama that there\nappears among us that infinite quantity of dramatic works describing\nmen\'s actions, positions, characters, and frames of mind, not only void\nof any spiritual substance, but often of any human sense.\n\nLet not the reader think that I exclude from this estimate of\ncontemporary drama the theatrical pieces I have myself incidentally\nwritten. I recognize them, as well as all the rest, as not having that\nreligious character which must form the foundation of the drama of the\nfuture.\n\nThe drama, then, the most important branch of art, has, in our time,\nbecome the trivial and immoral amusement of a trivial and immoral crowd.\nThe worst of it is, moreover, that to dramatic art, fallen as low as it\nis possible to fall, is still attributed an elevated significance no\nlonger appropriate to it. Dramatists, actors, theatrical managers, and\nthe press--this last publishing in the most serious tone reports of\ntheaters and operas--and the rest, are all perfectly certain that they\nare doing something very worthy and important.\n\nThe drama in our time is a great man fallen, who has reached the last\ndegree of his degradation, and at the same time continues to pride\nhimself on his past of which nothing now remains. The public of our time\nis like those who mercilessly amuse themselves over this man once so\ngreat and now in the lowest stage of his fall.\n\nSuch is one of the mischievous effects of the epidemic suggestion about\nthe greatness of Shakespeare. Another deplorable result of this worship\nis the presentation to men of a false model for imitation. If people\nwrote of Shakespeare that for his time he was a good writer, that he had\na fairly good turn for verse, was an intelligent actor and good stage\nmanager--even were this appreciation incorrect and somewhat\nexaggerated--if only it were moderately true, people of the rising\ngeneration might remain free from Shakespeare\'s influence. But when\nevery young man entering into life in our time has presented to him, as\nthe model of moral perfection, not the religious and moral teachers of\nmankind, but first of all Shakespeare, concerning whom it has been\ndecided and is handed down by learned men from generation to generation,\nas an incontestable truth, that he was the greatest poet, the greatest\nteacher of life, the young man can not remain free from this pernicious\ninfluence. When he is reading or listening to Shakespeare the question\nfor him is no longer whether Shakespeare be good or bad, but only: In\nwhat consists that extraordinary beauty, both esthetic and ethical, of\nwhich he has been assured by learned men whom he respects, and which he\nhimself neither sees nor feels? And constraining himself, and distorting\nhis esthetic and ethical feeling, he tries to conform to the ruling\nopinion. He no longer believes in himself, but in what is said by the\nlearned people whom he respects. I have experienced all this. Then\nreading critical examinations of the dramas and extracts from books with\nexplanatory comments, he begins to imagine that he feels something of\nthe nature of an artistic impression. The longer this continues, the\nmore does his esthetical and ethical feeling become distorted. He ceases\nto distinguish directly and clearly what is artistic from an artificial\nimitation of art. But, above all, having assimilated the immoral view of\nlife which penetrates all Shakespeare\'s writings, he loses the capacity\nof distinguishing good from evil. And the error of extolling an\ninsignificant, inartistic writer--not only not moral, but directly\nimmoral--executes its destructive work.\n\nThis is why I think that the sooner people free themselves from the\nfalse glorification of Shakespeare, the better it will be.\n\nFirst, having freed themselves from this deceit, men will come to\nunderstand that the drama which has no religious element at its\nfoundation is not only not an important and good thing, as it is now\nsupposed to be, but the most trivial and despicable of things. Having\nunderstood this, they will have to search for, and work out, a new form\nof modern drama, a drama which will serve as the development and\nconfirmation of the highest stage of religious consciousness in men.\n\nSecondly, having freed themselves from this hypnotic state, men will\nunderstand that the trivial and immoral works of Shakespeare and his\nimitators, aiming merely at the recreation and amusement of the\nspectators, can not possibly represent the teaching of life, and that,\nwhile there is no true religious drama, the teaching of life should be\nsought for in other sources.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[1] This essay owes its origin to Leo Tolstoy\'s desire to contribute a\npreface to the article he here mentions by Ernest Crosby, which latter\nfollows in this volume.--(_Trans._)\n\n[2] "Shakespeare and His Writings," by George Brandes.\n\n[3] A Russian poet, remarkable for the delicacy of his works.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX CONTENTS\n\n\n I. SHAKESPEARE\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE\n    WORKING CLASSES, BY ERNEST CROSBY,             127\n\nII. LETTER FROM MR. G. BERNARD SHAW,               166\n\n\n\n\nSHAKESPEARE\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE WORKING CLASSES\n\nBY ERNEST CROSBY\n\n\n"Shakespeare was of us," cries Browning, in his "Lost Leader," while\nlamenting the defection of Wordsworth from the ranks of progress and\nliberalism--"Milton was for us, Burns, Shelley were with us--they watch\nfrom their graves!" There can, indeed, be no question of the fidelity to\ndemocracy of Milton, the republican pamphleteer, nor of Burns, the proud\nplowman, who proclaimed the fact that "a man\'s a man for a\' that," nor\nof Shelley, the awakened aristocrat, who sang to such as Burns\n\n    "Men of England, wherefore plow\n     For the lords who lay ye low?"\n\nBut Shakespeare?--Shakespeare?--where is there a line in Shakespeare to\nentitle him to a place in this brotherhood? Is there anything in his\nplays that is in the least inconsistent with all that is reactionary?\n\nA glance at Shakespeare\'s lists of _dramatis personae_ is sufficient to\nshow that he was unable to conceive of any situation rising to the\ndignity of tragedy in other than royal and ducal circles. It may be said\nin explanation of this partiality for high rank that he was only\nfollowing the custom of the dramatists of his time, but this is a poor\nplea for a man of great genius, whose business it is precisely to lead\nand not to follow. Nor is the explanation altogether accurate. In his\nplay, the "Pinner of Wakefield," first printed in 1599, Robert Greene\nmakes a hero, and a very stalwart one, of a mere pound-keeper, who\nproudly refuses knighthood at the hands of the king. There were other\nand earlier plays in vogue in Shakespeare\'s day treating of the triumphs\nof men of the people, one, for instance, which commemorated the rise of\nSir Thomas Gresham, the merchant\'s son, and another, entitled "The\nHistory of Richard Whittington, of his Low Birth, his Great Fortune";\nbut he carefully avoided such material in seeking plots for his dramas.\nCardinal Wolsey, the butcher\'s son, is indeed the hero of "Henry VIII.,"\nbut his humble origin is only mentioned incidentally as something to be\nashamed of. What greater opportunity for idealizing the common people\never presented itself to a dramatist than to Shakespeare when he\nundertook to draw the character of Joan of Arc in the second part of\n"Henry VI."? He knew how to create noble women--that is one of his\nspecial glories--but he not only refuses to see anything noble in the\npeasant girl who led France to victory, but he deliberately insults her\nmemory with the coarsest and most cruel calumnies. Surely the lapse of\nmore than a century and a half might have enabled a man of honor, if not\nof genius, to do justice to an enemy of the weaker sex, and if Joan had\nbeen a member of the French royal family we may be sure that she would\nhave received better treatment.\n\nThe question of the aristocratic tendency of the drama was an active one\nin Shakespeare\'s time. There was a good deal of democratic feeling in\nthe burghers of London-town, and they resented the courtly prejudices of\ntheir playwrights and their habit of holding up plain citizens to\nridicule upon the stage, whenever they deigned to present them at all.\nThe Prolog in Beaumont and Fletcher\'s "Knight of the Burning Pestle"\ngives sufficient evidence of this. The authors adopted the device of\nhaving a Citizen leap upon the stage and interrupt the Speaker of the\nProlog by shouting\n\n    "Hold your peace, goodman boy!"\n\n    Speaker of Prolog: "What do you mean, sir?"\n\n    Citizen: "That you have no good meaning; this seven\n     year there hath been plays at this house. I have observed\n     it, you have still girds at citizens."\n\nThe Citizen goes on to inform the Speaker of the Prolog that he is a\ngrocer, and to demand that he "present something notably in honor of the\ncommons of the city." For a hero he will have "a grocer, and he shall do\nadmirable things." But this proved to be a joke over too serious a\nmatter, for at the first representation of the play in 1611 it was cried\ndown by the citizens and apprentices, who did not appreciate its satire\nupon them, and it was not revived for many years thereafter. It will not\nanswer, therefore, to say that the idea of celebrating the middle and\nlower classes never occurred to Shakespeare, for it was a subject of\ndiscussion among his contemporaries.\n\nIt is hardly possible to construct a play with no characters but\nmonarchs and their suites, and at the same time preserve the\nverisimilitudes of life. Shakespeare was obliged to make some use of\nservants, citizens, and populace. How has he portrayed them? In one play\nalone has he given up the whole stage to them, and it is said that the\n"Merry Wives of Windsor" was only written at the request of Queen\nElizabeth, who wished to see Sir John Falstaff in love. It is from\nbeginning to end one prolonged "gird at citizens," and we can hardly\nwonder that they felt a grievance against the dramatic profession. In\nthe other plays of Shakespeare the humbler classes appear for the main\npart only occasionally and incidentally. His opinion of them is\nindicated more or less picturesquely by the names which he selects for\nthem. There are, for example, Bottom, the weaver; Flute, the\nbellows-maker; Snout and Sly, tinkers; Quince, the carpenter; Snug, the\njoiner; Starveling, the tailor; Smooth, the silkman; Shallow and\nSilence, country justices; Elbow and Hull, constables; Dogberry and\nVerges, Fang and Snare, sheriffs\' officers; Mouldy, Shadow, Wart, and\nBull-calf, recruits; Feebee, at once a recruit and a woman\'s tailor,\nPilch and Patch-Breech, fishermen (though these last two appellations\nmay be mere nicknames); Potpan, Peter Thump, Simple, Gobbo, and Susan\nGrindstone, servants; Speed, "a clownish servant"; Slender, Pistol, Nym,\nSneak, Doll Tear-sheet, Jane Smile, Costard, Oatcake, Seacoal, and\nvarious anonymous "clowns" and "fools." Shakespeare rarely gives names\nof this character to any but the lowly in life, altho perhaps we should\ncite as exceptions Sir Toby Belch and Sir Andrew Ague-Cheek in "Twelfth\nNight"; the vicar, Sir Oliver Mar-Text, in "As You Like It"; Moth, the\npage, in "Love\'s Labor Lost," and Froth, "a foolish gentleman," in\n"Measure for Measure," but none of these personages quite deserves to\nrank as an aristocrat. Such a system of nomenclature as we have exposed\nis enough of itself to fasten the stigma of absurdity upon the\ncharacters subjected to it, and their occupations. Most of the trades\nare held up for ridicule in "Midsummer Night\'s Dream"; Holofernes, the\nschoolmaster, is made ridiculous in "Love\'s Labor Lost," and we are told\nof the middle-class Nym, Pistol, and Bardolph that "three such antics do\nnot amount to a man" (Henry V., Act 3, Sc. 2). But it is not necessary\nto rehearse the various familiar scenes in which these fantastically\nnamed individuals raise a laugh at their own expense.\n\nThe language employed by nobility and royalty in addressing those of\ninferior station in Shakespeare\'s plays may be taken, perhaps, rather as\nan indication of the manners of the times than as an expression of his\nown feeling, but even so it must have been a little galling to the\npoorer of his auditors. "Whoreson dog," "whoreson peasant," "slave,"\n"you cur," "rogue," "rascal," "dunghill," "crack-hemp," and "notorious\nvillain"--these are a few of the epithets with which the plays abound.\nThe Duke of York accosts Thomas Horner, an armorer, as "base dunghill\nvillain and mechanical" (Henry VI., Part 2, Act 2, Sc. 3); Gloster\nspeaks of the warders of the Tower as "dunghill grooms" (Ib., Part 1,\nAct 1, Sc. 3), and Hamlet of the grave-digger as an "ass" and "rude\nknave." Valentine tells his servant, Speed, that he is born to be hanged\n(Two Gentlemen of Verona, Act 1, Sc. 1), and Gonzalo pays a like\ncompliment to the boatswain who is doing his best to save the ship in\nthe "Tempest" (Act 1, Sc. 1). This boatswain is not sufficiently\nimpressed by the grandeur of his noble cargo, and for his pains is\ncalled a "brawling, blasphemous, uncharitable dog," a "cur," a\n"whoreson, insolent noise-maker," and a "wide-chapped rascal." Richard\nIII.\'s Queen says to a gardener, who is guilty of nothing but giving a\ntrue report of her lord\'s deposition and who shows himself a\nkind-hearted fellow, "Thou little better thing than earth," "thou\nwretch"! Henry VIII. talks of a "lousy footboy," and the Duke of\nSuffolk, when he is about to be killed by his pirate captor at Dover,\ncalls him "obscure and lowly swain," "jaded groom," and "base slave,"\ndubs his crew "paltry, servile, abject drudges," and declares that his\nown head would\n\n         "sooner dance upon bloody pole\n    Than stand uncovered to a vulgar groom."\n                (Henry VI., Part 2, Act 4, Sc. 1.)\n\nPetruchio "wrings Grumio by the ear," and Katherine beats the same\nunlucky servant. His master indulges in such terms as "foolish knave,"\n"peasant swain," and "whoreson malthorse drudge" in addressing him;\ncries out to his servants, "off with my boots, you rogues, you\nvillains!" and strikes them. He pays his compliments to a tailor in the\nfollowing lines:\n\n    "O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble,\n     Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,\n     Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter cricket thou;\n     Braved in my own house by a skein of thread!\n     Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant!"\n                (Taming of the Shrew, Act 4, Sc. 3.)\n\nJoan of Arc speaks of her "contemptible estate" as a shepherd\'s\ndaughter, and afterward, denying her father, calls him "Decrepit miser!\nbase, ignoble wretch!" (Henry VI., Part 1, Act 1, Sc. 2, and Act 5, Sc.\n4.) It is hard to believe that Shakespeare would have so frequently\nallowed his characters to express their contempt for members of the\nlower orders of society if he had not had some sympathy with their\nopinions.\n\nShakespeare usually employs the common people whom he brings upon the\nstage merely to raise a laugh (as, for instance, the flea-bitten\ncarriers in the inn-yard at Rochester, in Henry IV., Part 1, Act 2, Sc.\n1), but occasionally they are scamps as well as fools. They amuse us\nwhen they become hopelessly entangled in their sentences (_vide_ Romeo\nand Juliet, Act 1, Sc. 2), or when Juliet\'s nurse blunderingly makes\nher think that Romeo is slain instead of Tybalt; but when this same\nlady, after taking Romeo\'s money, espouses the cause of the County\nParis--or when on the eve of Agincourt we are introduced to a group of\ncowardly English soldiers--or when Coriolanus points out the poltroonery\nof the Roman troops, and says that all would have been lost "but for our\ngentlemen," we must feel detestation for them. Juliet\'s nurse is not the\nonly disloyal servant. Shylock\'s servant, Launcelot Gobbo, helps Jessica\nto deceive her father, and Margaret, the Lady Hero\'s gentlewoman, brings\nabout the disgrace of her mistress by fraud. Olivia\'s waiting-woman in\n"Twelfth Night" is honest enough, but she is none too modest in her\nlanguage, but in this respect Dame Quickly in "Henry IV." can easily\nrival her. Peter Thump, when forced to a judicial combat with his\nmaster, displays his cowardice, altho in the end he is successful (Henry\nVI., Act 2, Part 2, Sc. 3), and Stephano, a drunken butler, adorns the\nstage in the "Tempest." We can not blame Shakespeare for making use of\ncutthroats and villains in developing his plots, but we might have been\nspared the jokes which the jailors of Posthumus perpetrate when they\ncome to lead him to the scaffold, and the ludicrous English of the clown\nwho supplies Cleopatra with an asp. The apothecary who is in such\nwretched plight that he sells poison to Romeo in spite of a Draconian\nlaw, gives us another unflattering picture of a tradesman; and when\nFalstaff declares, "I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or\nanything," we have a premature reflection on the Puritan, middle-class\nconscience and religion. In "As You Like It," Shakespeare came near\ndrawing a pastoral sketch of shepherds and shepherdesses on conventional\nlines. If he failed to do so, it was as much from lack of respect for\nthe keeping of sheep as for the unrealities of pastoral poetry. Rosalind\ndoes not scruple to call the fair Phebe "foul," and, as for her hands,\nshe says:\n\n    "I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,\n     A freestone colored hand; I verily did think\n     That her old gloves were on, but \'twas her hands;\n     She has a housewife\'s hand."\n\nNo one with a high respect for housewifery could have written that line.\nWhen in the same play Jaques sees the pair of rural lovers, Touchstone\nand Audrey, approaching, he cries: "There is, sure, another flood, and\nthese couples are coming to the ark! Here come a pair of very strange\nbeasts, which in all tongues are called fools" (Act 5, Sc. 4). The\nclown, Touchstone, speaks of kissing the cow\'s dugs which his former\nsweetheart had milked, and then marries Audrey in a tempest of\nbuffoonery. Howbeit, Touchstone remains one of the few rustic characters\nof Shakespeare who win our affections, and at the same time he is witty\nenough to deserve the title which Jaques bestows upon him of a "rare\nfellow."\n\nOccasionally Shakespeare makes fun of persons who are somewhat above the\nlower classes in rank. I have mentioned those on whom he bestows\ncomical names. He indulges in humor also at the expense of the two\nScottish captains, Jamy and Macmorris, and the honest Welsh captain,\nFluellen (Henry V., Act 3, Sc. 2 _et passim_), and shall we forget the\ninimitable Falstaff? But, while making every allowance for these\ndiversions into somewhat nobler quarters (the former of which are\nexplained by national prejudices), do they form serious exceptions to\nthe rule, and can Falstaff be taken, for instance, as a representative\nof the real aristocracy? As Queen and courtiers watched his antics on\nthe stage, we may be sure that it never entered their heads that the\n"girds" were directed at them or their kind.\n\nThe appearance on Shakespeare\'s stage of a man of humble birth who is\nvirtuous without being ridiculous is so rare an event that it is worth\nwhile to enumerate the instances. Now and then a servant or other\nobscure character is made use of as a mere lay figure of which nothing\ngood or evil can be predicated, but usually they are made more or less\nabsurd. Only at long intervals do we see persons of this class at once\nserious and upright. As might have been expected, it is more often the\nservant than any other member of the lower classes to whom Shakespeare\nattributes good qualities, for the servant is a sort of attachment to\nthe gentleman and shines with the reflection of his virtues. The noblest\nquality which Shakespeare can conceive of in a servant is loyalty, and\nin "Richard II." (Act 5, Sc. 3) he gives us a good example in the\ncharacter of a groom who remains faithful to the king even when the\nlatter is cast into prison. In "Cymbeline" we are treated to loyalty _ad\nnauseam_. The king orders Pisanio, a trusty servant, to be tortured\nwithout cause, and his reply is,\n\n    "Sir, my life is yours.\n     I humbly set it at your will."\n                (Act 4, Sc. 3.)\n\nIn "King Lear" a good servant protests against the cruelty of Regan and\nCornwall toward Gloucester, and is killed for his courage. "Give me my\nsword," cries Regan. "A peasant stand up thus!" (Act 3, Sc. 7). And\nother servants also show sympathy for the unfortunate earl. We all\nremember the fool who, almost alone, was true to Lear, but, then, of\ncourse, he was a fool. In "Timon of Athens" we have an unusual array of\ngood servants, but it is doubtful if Shakespeare wrote the play, and\nthese characters make his authorship more doubtful. Flaminius, Timon\'s\nservant, rejects a bribe with scorn (Act 3, Sc. 1). Another of his\nservants expresses his contempt for his master\'s false friends (Act 3,\nSc. 3), and when Timon finally loses his fortune and his friends forsake\nhim, his servants stand by him. "Yet do our hearts wear Timon\'s livery"\n(Act 4, Sc. 2). Adam, the good old servant in "As You Like It," who\nfollows his young master Orlando into exile, is, like Lear\'s fool, a\nnoteworthy example of the loyal servitor.\n\n    "Master, go on, and I will follow thee\n     To the last gasp with truth and loyalty."\n                (Act 2, Sc. 3.)\n\nBut Shakespeare takes care to point out that such fidelity in servants\nis most uncommon and a relic of the good old times--\n\n    "O good old man, bow well in thee appears\n     The constant service of the antique world,\n     When service sweat for duty, nor for meed!\n     Thou art not for the fashion of these times,\n     When none will sweat but for promotion."\n\nOutside the ranks of domestic servants we find a few cases of honorable\npoverty in Shakespeare. In the play just quoted, Corin, the old\nshepherd, says:\n\n     "Sir, I am a true laborer; I earn that I eat, get that I\n     wear; owe no man hate, envy no man\'s happiness; glad of\n     other men\'s good, content with my harm; and the greatest of\n     my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck."\n                (As You Like It, Act 3, Sc. 2.)\n\nin short, an ideal proletarian from the point of view of the aristocrat.\n\nThe "Winter\'s Tale" can boast of another good shepherd (Act 3, Sc. 3),\nbut he savors a little of burlesque. "Macbeth" has several humble\nworthies. There is a good old man in the second act (Sc. 2), and a good\nmessenger in the fourth (Sc. 2). King Duncan praises highly the sergeant\nwho brings the news of Macbeth\'s victory, and uses language to him such\nas Shakespeare\'s yeomen are not accustomed to hear (Act 1, Sc. 2). And\nin "Antony and Cleopatra" we make the acquaintance of several exemplary\ncommon soldiers. Shakespeare puts flattering words into the mouth of\nHenry V. when he addresses the troops before Agincourt:\n\n    "For he to-day that sheds his blood with me\n     Shall be my brother; be he ne\'er so vile\n     This day shall gentle his condition."\n                (Act 4, Sc. 4.)\n\nAnd at Harfleur he is even more complaisant:\n\n    "And you, good yeomen,\n     Whose limbs were made in England, shew us here\n     The metal of your pasture; let us swear\n     That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not,\n     For there is none of you so mean and base\n     That hath not noble luster in your eyes." (Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nThe rank and file always fare well before a battle.\n\n    "Oh, it\'s \'Tommy this\' and \'Tommy that\' an\' \'Tommy, go away\';\n     But it\'s \'Thank you, Mr. Atkins,\' when the band begins to play."\n\nI should like to add some instances from Shakespeare\'s works of serious\nand estimable behavior on the part of individuals representing the lower\nclasses, or of considerate treatment of them on the part of their\n"betters," but I have been unable to find any, and the meager list must\nend here.\n\nBut to return to Tommy Atkins. He is no longer Mr. Atkins after the\nbattle. Montjoy, the French herald, comes to the English king under a\nflag of truce and asks that they be permitted to bury their dead and\n\n    "Sort our nobles from our common men;\n     For many of our princes (wo the while!)\n     Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood;\n     So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs\n     In blood of princes." (Henry V., Act 4, Sc. 7.)\n\nWith equal courtesy Richard III., on Bosworth field, speaks of his\nopponents to the gentlemen around him:\n\n    "Remember what you are to cope withal--\n     A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,\n     A scum of Bretagne and base lackey peasants."\n                (Act 5, Sc. 3.)\n\nBut Shakespeare does not limit such epithets to armies. Having, as we\nhave seen, a poor opinion of the lower classes, taken man by man, he\nthinks, if anything, still worse of them taken _en masse_, and at his\nhands a crowd of plain workingmen fares worst of all. "Hempen\nhome-spuns," Puck calls them, and again\n\n    "A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,\n     That work for bread upon Athenian stalls."\n\nBottom, their leader, is, according to Oberon, a "hateful fool," and\naccording to Puck, the "shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort"\n(Midsummer Night\'s Dream, Act 3, Scs. 1 and 2, Act 4, Sc. 1). Bottom\'s\nadvice to his players contains a small galaxy of compliments:\n\n     "In any case let Thisby have clean linen, and let not him\n     that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out\n     for the lion\'s claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onion or\n     garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt\n     to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy."\n                (Ib., Act 4, Sc. 2.)\n\nThe matter of the breath of the poor weighs upon Shakespeare and his\ncharacters. Cleopatra shudders at the thought that\n\n         "mechanic slaves,\n    With greasy aprons, rules and hammers, shall\n    Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths\n    Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,\n    And forced to drink their vapor."\n                (Antony and Cleopatra, Act 5, Sc. 2.)\n\nCoriolanus has his sense of smell especially developed. He talks of the\n"stinking breaths" of the people (Act 2, Sc. 1), and in another place\nsays:\n\n    "You common cry of curs, whose breath I hate\n     As reek of rotten fens, whose love I prize\n     As the dead carcasses of unburied men\n     That do corrupt the air, I banish you,"\n\nand he goes on to taunt them with cowardice (Act 3, Sc. 3). They are the\n"mutable, rank-scented many" (Act 3, Sc. 1). His friend Menenius is\nequally complimentary to his fellow citizens. "You are they," says he,\n\n    "That make the air unwholesome, when you cast\n     Your stinking, greasy caps, in hooting at\n     Coriolanus\'s exile."\n                (Act 4, Sc. 7.)\n\nAnd he laughs at the "apron-men" of Cominius and their "breath of\ngarlic-eaters" (Act 4, Sc. 7). When Coriolanus is asked to address the\npeople, he replies by saying: "Bid them wash their faces, and keep their\nteeth clean" (Act 2, Sc. 3). According to Shakespeare, the Roman\npopulace had made no advance in cleanliness in the centuries between\nCoriolanus and Caesar. Casca gives a vivid picture of the offer of the\ncrown to Julius, and his rejection of it: "And still as he refused it\nthe rabblement shouted, and clapped their chapped hands, and threw up\ntheir sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of stinking breath,\nbecause Caesar refused the crown, that it had almost choked Caesar, for he\nswooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part I durst not laugh,\nfor fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air." And he calls\nthem the "tag-rag people" (Julius Caesar, Act 1, Sc. 2). The play of\n"Coriolanus" is a mine of insults to the people and it becomes tiresome\nto quote them. The hero calls them the "beast with many heads" (Act 4,\nSc. 3), and again he says to the crowd:\n\n    "What\'s the matter, you dissentious rogues,\n     That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion\n     Make yourself scabs?\n\n    First Citizen. We have ever your good word.\n\n    Coriolanus. He that will give good words to ye will flatter\n     Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,\n     That like not peace nor war? The one affrights you,\n     The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,\n     Where he would find you lions, finds you hares;\n     Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,\n     Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,\n     Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is\n     To make him worthy whose offense subdues him,\n     And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness\n     Deserves your hate; and your affections are\n     A sick man\'s appetite, who desires most that\n     Which would increase his evil. He that depends\n     Upon your favors, swims with fins of lead,\n     And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?\n     With every minute you do change a mind,\n     And call him noble that was now your hate,\n     Him vile that was your garland."\n                (Act 1, Sc. 1.)\n\nHis mother, Volumnia, is of like mind. She calls the people "our general\nlouts" (Act 3, Sc. 2). She says to Junius Brutus, the tribune of the\npeople:\n\n    "\'Twas you incensed the rabble,\n     Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth\n     As I can of those mysteries which Heaven\n     Will not leave Earth to know."\n                (Act 4, Sc. 2).\n\nIn the same play Cominius talks of the "dull tribunes" and "fusty\nplebeians" (Act 1, Sc. 9). Menenius calls them "beastly plebeians" (Act\n2, Sc. 1), refers to their "multiplying spawn" (Act 2, Sc. 2), and says\nto the crowd:\n\n     "Rome and her rats are at the point of battle."\n                (Act 1, Sc. 2).\n\nThe dramatist makes the mob cringe before Coriolanus. When he appears,\nthe stage directions show that the "citizens steal away." (Act 1, Sc.\n1.)\n\nAs the Roman crowd of the time of Coriolanus is fickle, so is that of\nCaesar\'s. Brutus and Antony sway them for and against his assassins with\nease:\n\n      "First Citizen. This Caesar was a tyrant.\n\n       Second Citizen. Nay, that\'s certain.\n    We are blessed that Rome is rid of him....\n\n       First Citizen. (After hearing a description of the murder.)\n    O piteous spectacle!\n\n       2 Cit. O noble Caesar!\n\n       3 Cit. O woful day!\n\n       4 Cit. O traitors, villains!\n\n       1 Cit. O most bloody sight!\n\n       2 Cit. We will be revenged; revenge! about--seek--burn,\n    fire--kill--slay--let not a traitor live!" (Act 3, Sc. 2.)\n\nThe Tribune Marullus reproaches them with having forgotten Pompey, and\ncalls them\n\n    "You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things."\n\nHe persuades them not to favor Caesar, and when they leave him he asks\nhis fellow tribune, Flavius,\n\n    "See, whe\'r their basest metal be not moved?"\n                (Act 1, Sc. 1.)\n\nFlavius also treats them with scant courtesy:\n\n    "Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.\n     Is this a holiday? What! you know not,\n     Being mechanical, you ought not walk\n     Upon a laboring day without the sign\n     Of your profession?"\n                (Ib.)\n\nThe populace of England is as changeable as that of Rome, if Shakespeare\nis to be believed. The Archbishop of York, who had espoused the cause of\nRichard II. against Henry IV., thus soliloquizes:\n\n    "The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;\n     Their over greedy love hath surfeited;\n     An habitation giddy and unsure\n     Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.\n     O thou fond many! With what loud applause\n     Didst thou beat Heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,\n     Before he was what thou would\'st have him be!\n     And now being trimmed in thine own desires,\n     Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,\n     That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.\n     So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge\n     Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard,\n     And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,\n     And howlst to find it."\n                (Henry IV., Part 2, Act 1, Sc. 3.)\n\nGloucester in "Henry VI." (Part 2, Act 2, Sc. 4) notes the fickleness of\nthe masses. He says, addressing his absent wife:\n\n    "Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook\n     The abject people, gazing on thy face\n     With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,\n     That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels\n     When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets."\n\nWhen she arrives upon the scene in disgrace, she says to him:\n\n         "Look how they gaze;\n    See how the giddy multitude do point\n    And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee.\n    Ah, Gloster, hide thee from their hateful looks."\n\nAnd she calls the crowd a "rabble" (Ib.), a term also used in "Hamlet"\n(Act 4, Sc. 5). Again, in part III. of "Henry VI.," Clifford, dying on\nthe battlefield while fighting for King Henry, cries:\n\n    "The common people swarm like summer flies,\n     And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?\n     And who shines now but Henry\'s enemies?"\n                (Act 2, Sc. 6.)\n\nAnd Henry himself, conversing with the keepers who have imprisoned him\nin the name of Edward IV., says:\n\n    "Ah, simple men! you know not what you swear.\n     Look, as I blow this feather from my face,\n     And as the air blows it to me again,\n     Obeying with my wind when I do blow,\n     And yielding to another when it blows,\n     Commanded always by the greater gust,\n     Such is the lightness of you common men."\n                (Ib., Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nSuffolk, in the First Part of the same trilogy (Act 5, Sc. 5), talks of\n"worthless peasants," meaning, perhaps, "property-less peasants," and\nwhen Salisbury comes to present the demands of the people, he calls him\n\n         "the Lord Ambassador\n    Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king,"\n                (Part 2, Act 3, Sc. 2.)\n\nand says:\n\n    "\'Tis like the Commons, rude unpolished hinds\n     Could send such message to their sovereign."\n\nCardinal Beaufort mentions the "uncivil kernes of Ireland" (Ib., Part 2,\nAct 3, Sc. 1), and in the same play the crowd makes itself ridiculous by\nshouting, "A miracle," when the fraudulent beggar Simpcox, who had\npretended to be lame and blind, jumps over a stool to escape a whipping\n(Act 2, Sc. 1). Queen Margaret receives petitioners with the words\n"Away, base cullions" (Ib., Act 1, Sc. 3), and among other flattering\nremarks applied here and there to the lower classes we may cite the\nepithets "ye rascals, ye rude slaves," addressed to a crowd by a porter\nin Henry VIII., and that of "lazy knaves" given by the Lord Chamberlain\nto the porters for having let in a "trim rabble" (Act 5, Sc. 3). Hubert,\nin King John, presents us with an unvarnished picture of the common\npeople receiving the news of Prince Arthur\'s death:\n\n    "I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,\n     The whilst his iron did on his anvil cool,\n     With open mouth swallowing a tailor\'s news;\n     Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,\n     Standing on slippers (which his nimble haste\n     Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet),\n     Told of a many thousand warlike French\n     That were embattailed and rank\'d in Kent.\n     Another lean, unwashed artificer,\n     Cuts off his tale, and talks of Arthur\'s death."\n                (Act 4, Sc. 2.)\n\nMacbeth, while sounding the murderers whom he intends to employ, and who\nsay to him, "We are men, my liege," answers:\n\n    "Ay, in the catalogue, ye go for men\n     As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\n     Shoughs, water-sugs, and demi-wolves, are cleped\n     All by the name of dogs."\n                (Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nAs Coriolanus is held up to our view as a pattern of noble bearing\ntoward the people, so Richard II. condemns the courteous behavior of the\nfuture Henry IV. on his way into banishment. He says:\n\n    "Ourselves, and Bushy, Bagot here and Green\n     Observed his courtship to the common people;\n     How he did seem to dive into their hearts\n     With humble and familiar courtesy;\n     What reverence he did throw away on slaves;\n     Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles\n     And patient overbearing of his fortune,\n     As \'twere to banish their effects with him.\n     Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;\n     A brace of draymen did God speed him well\n     And had the tribute of his supple knee,\n     With \'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends.\'"\n                (Richard II., Act 1, Sc. 4.)\n\nThe King of France, in "All\'s Well that Ends Well," commends to Bertram\nthe example of his late father in his relations with his inferiors:\n\n    "Who were below him\n     He used as creatures of another place,\n     And bowed his eminent top to their low ranks,\n     Making them proud of his humility\n     In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man\n     Might be a copy to these younger times."\n                (Act 1, Sc. 2.)\n\nShakespeare had no fondness for these "younger times," with their\nincreasing suggestion of democracy. Despising the masses, he had no\nsympathy with the idea of improving their condition or increasing their\npower. He saw the signs of the times with foreboding, as did his hero,\nHamlet:\n\n"By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it; the\nage has grown so picked, that the toe of the peasant comes so near the\nheel of the courtier, he galls his kibe." There can easily be too much\nliberty, according to Shakespeare--"too much liberty, my Lucio,\nliberty" (Measure for Measure, Act 1, Sc. 3), but the idea of too much\nauthority is foreign to him. Claudio, himself under arrest, sings its\npraises:\n\n         "Thus can the demi-god, Authority,\n    Make us pay down for our offense by weight,--\n    The words of Heaven;--on whom it will, it will;\n    On whom it will not, so; yet still \'tis just."\n                (Ib.)\n\nUlysses, in "Troilus and Cressida" (Act 1, Sc. 3), delivers a long\npanegyric upon authority, rank, and degree, which may be taken as\nShakespeare\'s confession of faith:\n\n         "Degree being vizarded,\n    Th\' unworthiest shews as fairly in the mask.\n    The heavens themselves, the planets, and this center,\n    Observe degree, priority, and place,\n    Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,\n    Office and custom, in all line of order;\n    And therefore is the glorious planet, Sol,\n    In noble eminence enthroned and sphered\n    Amidst the other; whose med\'cinable eye\n    Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,\n    And posts, like the commandments of a king,\n    Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets,\n    In evil mixture, to disorder wander,\n    What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!\n    What raging of the sea, shaking of the earth,\n    Commotion of the winds, frights, changes, horrors,\n    Divert and crack, rend and deracinate\n    The unity and married calm of states\n    Quite from their fixture! Oh, when degree is shaked,\n    Which is the ladder of all high designs,\n    The enterprise is sick. How could communities,\n    Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,\n    Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,\n    The primogenity and due of birth,\n    Prerogative of age, crowns, scepters, laurels,\n    But by degree stand in authentic place?\n    Take but degree away, untune the string,\n    And hark, what discord follows! each thing meets\n    In mere oppugnancy; the bounded waters\n    Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,\n    And make a sop of all this solid globe;\n    Strength should be lord of imbecility,\n    And the rude son should strike his father dead;\n    Force should be right; or, rather, right and wrong,\n    (Between whose endless jar justice resides)\n    Should lose their names, and so should justice too.\n    Then everything includes itself in power.\n    Power into will, will into appetite;\n    And appetite, a universal wolf,\n    So doubly seconded with will and power,\n    Must make perforce an universal prey,\n    And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,\n    This chaos, when degree is suffocate,\n    Follows the choking;\n    And this neglection of degree it is,\n    That by a pace goes backward, in a purpose\n    It hath to climb. The General\'s disdained\n    By him one step below; he by the next;\n    That next by him beneath; so every step,\n    Exampled by the first pace that is sick\n    Of his superiors, grows to an envious fever\n    Of pale and bloodless emulation;\n    And \'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,\n    Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,\n    Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength."\n\nThere is no hint in this eloquent apostrophe of the difficulty of\ndetermining among men who shall be the sun and who the satellite, nor of\nthe fact that the actual arrangements, in Shakespeare\'s time, at any\nrate, depended altogether upon that very force which Ulysses\ndeprecates. In another scene in the same play the wily Ithacan again\ngives way to his passion for authority and eulogizes somewhat\nextravagantly the paternal, prying, omnipresent State:\n\n    "The providence that\'s in a watchful state\n     Knows almost every grain of Plutus\' gold,\n     Finds bottom in th\' incomprehensive deeps,\n     Keeps place with thought, and almost, like the gods,\n     Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.\n     There is a mystery (with which relation\n     Durst never meddle) in the soul of state,\n     Which hath an operation more divine\n     Than breath or pen can give expressure to."\n                (Act 3, Sc. 3.)\n\nThe State to which Ulysses refers is of course a monarchical State, and\nthe idea of democracy is abhorrent to Shakespeare. Coriolanus expresses\nhis opinion of it when he says to the people:\n\n                 "What\'s the matter,\n    That in these several places of the city\n    You cry against the noble Senate, who,\n    Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else\n    Would feed on one another?"\n                (Act 2, Sc. 1.)\n\nThe people should have no voice in the government--\n\n             "This double worship,--\n    Where one part does disdain with cause, the other\n    Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,\n    Can not conclude, but by the yea and no\n    Of general ignorance,--it must omit\n    Real necessities, and give away the while\n    To unstable slightness. Purpose so barred, it follows,\n    Nothing is done to purpose; therefore, beseech you,\n    You that will be less fearful than discreet,\n    That love the fundamental part of state\n    More than you doubt the change on\'t, that prefer\n    A noble life before a long, and wish\n    To jump a body with a dangerous physic\n    That\'s sure of death without it, at once pluck out\n    The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick\n    The sweet which is their poison."\n                (Ib. Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nIt is the nobility who should rule--\n\n    "It is a purposed thing and grows by plot\n     To curb the will of the nobility;\n     Suffer\'t and live with such as can not rule,\n     Nor ever will be ruled."\n                (Ib.)\n\nJunius Brutus tries in vain to argue with him, but Coriolanus has no\npatience with him, a "triton of the minnows"; and the very fact that\nthere should be tribunes appointed for the people disgusts him--\n\n    "Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,\n     Of their own choice; one\'s Junius Brutus,\n     Sicinus Velutus, and I know not--\'Sdeath!\n     The rabble should have first unroofed the city,\n     Ere so prevailed with me; it will in time\n     Win upon power, and throw forth greater themes."\n\nAnd again:\n\n    "The common file, a plague!--Tribunes for them!"\n                (Act 1, Sc. 6.)\n\nShakespeare took his material for the drama of "Coriolanus" from\nPlutarch\'s "Lives," and it is significant that he selected from that\nlist of worthies the most conspicuous adversary of the commonalty that\nRome produced. He presents him to us as a hero, and, so far as he can,\nenlists our sympathy for him from beginning to end. When Menenius says\nof him:\n\n    "His nature is too noble for the world,"\n                (Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nhe is evidently but registering the verdict of the author. Plutarch\'s\ntreatment of Coriolanus is far different. He exhibits his fine\nqualities, but he does not hesitate to speak of his "imperious temper\nand that savage manner which was too haughty for a republic." "Indeed,"\nhe adds, "there is no other advantage to be had from a liberal education\nequal to that of polishing and softening our nature by reason and\ndiscipline." He also tells us that Coriolanus indulged his "irascible\npassions on a supposition that they have something great and exalted in\nthem," and that he wanted "a due mixture of gravity and mildness, which\nare the chief political virtues and the fruits of reason and education."\n"He never dreamed that such obstinacy is rather the effect of the\nweakness and effeminacy of a distempered mind, which breaks out in\nviolent passions like so many tumors." Nor apparently did Shakespeare\never dream of it either, altho he had Plutarch\'s sage observations\nbefore him. It is a pity that the great dramatist did not select from\nPlutarch\'s works some hero who took the side of the people, some Agis or\nCleomenes, or, better yet, one of the Gracchi. What a tragedy he might\nhave based on the life of Tiberius, the friend of the people and the\nmartyr in their cause! But the spirit which guided Schiller in the\nchoice of William Tell for a hero was a stranger to Shakespeare\'s heart,\nand its promptings would have met with no response there.\n\nEven more striking is the treatment which the author of "Coriolanus"\nmetes out to English history. All but two of his English historical\ndramas are devoted to the War of the Roses and the incidental struggle\nover the French crown. The motive of this prolonged strife--so\nattractive to Shakespeare--had much the same dignity which distinguishes\nthe family intrigues of the Sublime Porte, and Shakespeare presents the\nhistory of his country as a mere pageant of warring royalties and their\ntrains. When the people are permitted to appear, as they do in Cade\'s\nrebellion, to which Shakespeare has assigned the character of the rising\nunder Wat Tyler, they are made the subject of burlesque. Two of the\npopular party speak as follows:\n\n       "John Holland. Well, I say, it was never merry world in\n     England since gentlemen came up.\n\n       George Bevis. O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in\n     handicraftsmen.\n\n       John. The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons."\n\nWhen Jack Cade, alias Wat Tyler, comes on the scene, he shows himself to\nbe a braggart and a fool. He says:\n\n     "Be brave then, for your captain is brave and vows\n     reformation. There shall be in England seven half-penny\n     loaves sold for a penny; the three-hooped pot shall have ten\n     hoops, and I will make it a felony to drink small beer. All\n     the realm shall be in common, and in Cheapside shall my\n     palfrey go to grass. And when I am king asking I will be--\n\n       All. God save your majesty!\n\n       Cade. I thank you, good people--there shall be no money; all\n     shall eat and drink on my score, and I will apparel them all\n     in one livery, that they may agree like brothers and worship\n     me their lord."\n                (Henry VI., Part 2, Act 4, Sc. 2.)\n\nThe crowd wishes to kill the clerk of Chatham because he can read,\nwrite, and cast accounts. (Cade. "O monstrous!") Sir Humphrey Stafford\ncalls them\n\n    "Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,\n     Marked for the gallows."\n                (Ib.)\n\nClifford succeeds without much difficulty in turning the enmity of the\nmob against France, and Cade ejaculates disconsolately, "Was ever a\nfeather so lightly blown to and fro as this multitude?" (Ib., Act 4, Sc.\n8.) In the stage directions of this scene, Shakespeare shows his own\nopinion of the mob by writing, "Enter Cade and his rabblement." One\nlooks in vain here as in the Roman plays for a suggestion that poor\npeople sometimes suffer wrongfully from hunger and want, that they\noccasionally have just grievances, and that their efforts to present\nthem, so far from being ludicrous, are the most serious parts of\nhistory, beside which the struttings of kings and courtiers sink into\ninsignificance.\n\nOne of the popular songs in Tyler\'s rebellion was the familiar couplet:\n\n    "When Adam delved and Eve span,\n     Who was then the gentleman?"\n\nShakespeare refers to it in "Hamlet," where the grave-diggers speak as\nfollows:\n\n       "First Clown. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentleman\n     but gardners, ditchers and grave-makers; they hold up Adam\'s\n     profession.\n\n       Second Clown. Was he a gentleman?\n\n       First Clown. He was the first that ever bore arms.\n\n       Second Clown. Why, he had none.\n\n       First Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand\n     the Scripture? The Scripture says, Adam digged; could he dig\n     without arms?"\n                (Act 5, Sc. 1.)\n\nThat Shakespeare\'s caricature of Tyler\'s rebellion is a fair indication\nof his view of all popular risings appears from the remarks addressed by\nWestmoreland to the Archbishop of York in the Second Part of "Henry IV."\n(Act 4, Sc. 1). Says he:\n\n              "If that rebellion\n    Came like itself, in base and abject routs,\n    Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,\n    And countenanced by boys and beggary;\n    I say if damned commotion so appeared,\n    In his true, native, and most proper shape,\n    You, Reverend Father, and these noble lords\n    Had not been here to dress the ugly form\n    Of base and bloody insurrection\n    With your fair honors."\n\nThe first and last of Shakespeare\'s English historical plays, "King\nJohn" and "Henry VIII.," lie beyond the limits of the civil wars, and\neach of them treats of a period momentous in the annals of English\nliberty, a fact which Shakespeare absolutely ignores. John as king had\ntwo great misfortunes--he suffered disgrace at the hands of his barons\nand of the pope. The first event, the wringing of Magna Charta from the\nking, Shakespeare passes over. A sense of national pride might have\nexcused the omission of the latter humiliation, but no, it was a triumph\nof authority, and as such Shakespeare must record it for the edification\nof his hearers, and consequently we have the king presented on the stage\nas meekly receiving the crown from the papal legate (Act 5, Sc. 1).\nEngland was freed from the Roman yoke in the reign of Henry VIII., and\nin the drama of that name Shakespeare might have balanced the indignity\nforced upon King John, but now he is silent. Nothing must be said\nagainst authority, even against that of the pope, and the play\nculminates in the pomp and parade of the christening of the infant\nElizabeth! Such is Shakespeare\'s conception of history! Who could guess\nfrom reading these English historical plays that throughout the period\nwhich they cover English freedom was growing, that justice and the\nrights of man were asserting themselves, while despotism was gradually\ncurbed and limited? This is the one great glory of English history,\nexhibiting itself at Runnymede, reflected in Wyclif and John Ball and\nWat Tyler, and shining dimly in the birth of a national church under the\neighth Henry. As Shakespeare wrote, it was preparing for a new and\nconspicuous outburst. When he died, Oliver Cromwell was already\nseventeen years of age and John Hampden twenty-two. The spirit of\nHampden was preeminently the English spirit--the spirit which has given\ndistinction to the Anglo-Saxon race--and he and Shakespeare were\ncontemporaries, and yet of this spirit not a vestige is to be found in\nthe English historical plays and no opportunities lost to obliterate or\ndistort its manifestations. Only in Brutus and his\nfellow-conspirators--of all Shakespearian characters--do we find the\nleast consideration for liberty, and even then he makes the common, and\nperhaps in his time the unavoidable, mistake of overlooking the\ngenuinely democratic leanings of Julius Caesar and the anti-popular\ncharacter of the successful plot against him.\n\nIt has in all ages been a pastime of noble minds to try to depict a\nperfect state of society. Forty years before Shakespeare\'s birth, Sir\nThomas More published his "Utopia" to the world. Bacon intended to do\nthe same thing in the "New Atlantis," but never completed the work,\nwhile Sir Philip Sidney gives us his dream in his "Arcadia." Montaigne\nmakes a similar essay, and we quote from Florio\'s translation, published\nin 1603, the following passage (Montaigne\'s "Essays," Book I, Chapter\n30):\n\n"It is a nation, would I answer Plato, that hath no kind of traffic, no\nknowledge of letters, no intelligence of numbers, no name of magistrate\nnor of political superiority; no use of service, of riches, or of\npoverty; no contracts, no succession, no dividences; no occupation, but\nidle; no respect of kindred, but common; no apparel, but natural; no\nmanuring of lands; no use of wine, corn, or metal. The very words that\nimport lying, falsehood, treason, dissimulation, covetousness, envy,\ndetraction, and pardon were never heard among them."\n\nWe may readily infer that Shakespeare found little to sympathize with in\nthis somewhat extravagant outline of a happy nation, but he goes out of\nhis way to travesty it. In "The Tempest" he makes Gonzalo, the noblest\ncharacter in the play, hold the following language to the inevitable\nking (Shakespeare can not imagine even a desert island without a king!):\n\n    "Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,\n     I\' th\' commonwealth I would by contraries\n     Execute all things; for no kind of traffic\n     Would I admit; no name of magistrate;\n     Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,\n     And use of service, none; contract, succession,\n     Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\n     No use of metal, corn or wine or oil;\n     No occupation; all men idle,--all,\n     And women too, but innocent and pure;\n     No sovereignty, ...\n\n       Sebastian. Yet he would be king on\'t.\n\n       Antonia. The latter end of his commonwealth forgets\n     the beginning.\n\n       Gonzalo. All things in common. Nature should produce\n     Without sweat or endeavor; treason, felony,\n     Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,\n     Would I not have; but Nature should bring forth\n     Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,\n     To feed my innocent people.\n\n       Seb. No marrying \'mong his subjects?\n\n       Ant. None, man; all idle, whores, and knaves.\n\n       Gon. I would with such perfection govern, sir,\n     To \'xcel the golden age.\n\n       Seb. \'Save his Majesty!\n\n       Ant. Long live Gonzalo!\n\n       Gon. And do you mark me, sir?\n\n       King. Pr\'ythee, no more; thou dost talk nothing to me.\n\n       Gon. I do well believe your Highness; and did it to\n     minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such\n     sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh\n     at nothing.\n\n       Ant. \'Twas you we laughed at.\n\n       Gon. Who, in this kind of merry fooling, am nothing\n     to you; so you may continue and laugh at nothing still."\n                (Tempest, Act 2, Sc. 1.)\n\nThat all things are not for the best in the best of all possible worlds\nwould seem to result from the wise remarks made by the fishermen who\nenliven the scene in "Pericles, Prince of Tyre." They compare landlords\nto whales who swallow up everything, and suggest that the land be purged\nof "these drones that rob the bee of her honey"; and Pericles, so far\nfrom being shocked at such revolutionary and vulgar sentiments, is\nimpressed by their weight, and speaks kindly of the humble philosophers,\nwho in their turn are hospitable to the shipwrecked prince--all of which\nun-Shakespearian matter adds doubt to the authenticity of this drama\n(Act 2, Sc. 1).\n\nHowever keen the insight of Shakespeare may have been into the hearts of\nhis high-born characters, he had no conception of the unity of the human\nrace. For him the prince and the peasant were not of the same blood.\n\n           "For princes are\n    A model, which heaven makes like to itself,"\n\nsays King Simonides in "Pericles," and here at least we seem to see the\nhand of Shakespeare (Act 2, Sc. 2). The two princes, Guiderius and\nArviragus, brought up secretly in a cave, show their royal origin\n(Cymbeline, Act 3, Sc. 3), and the servants who see Coriolanus in\ndisguise are struck by his noble figure (Coriolanus, Act 4, Sc. 5).\nBastards are villains as a matter of course, witness Edmund in "Lear"\nand John in "Much Ado about Nothing," and no degree of contempt is too\nhigh for a\n\n          "hedge-born swain\n    That doth presume to boast of gentle blood."\n                (Henry VI., Part 1, Act 4, Sc. 1.)\n\nCourage is only to be expected in the noble-born. The Duke of York says:\n\n    "Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,\n     And find no harbor in a royal heart."\n                (Henry VI., Part 2, Act 3, Sc. 1.)\n\nIn so far as the lower classes had any relation to the upper classes, it\nwas one, thought Shakespeare, of dependence and obligation. It was not\nthe tiller of the soil who fed the lord of the manor, but rather the\nlord who supported the peasant. Does not the king have to lie awake and\ntake thought for his subjects? Thus Henry V. complains that he can not\nsleep\n\n              "so soundly as the wretched slave,\n    Who with a body filled and vacant mind,\n    Gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread,\n    Never sees horrid night, the child of Hell,\n    But like a lackey, from the rise to set,\n    Sweats in the eye of Phoebus, and all night\n    Sleeps in Elysium....\n    The slave, a member of the country\'s peace,\n    Enjoys it, but in gross brain little wots\n    What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,\n    Whose hours the peasant best advantages."\n                (Henry V., Act 4, Sc. 1.)\n\nAnd these lines occur at the end of a passage in which the king laments\nthe "ceremony" that oppresses him and confesses that but for it he would\nbe "but a man." He makes this admission, however, in a moment of danger\nand depression. Henry IV. also invokes sleep (Part 2, Act 2, Sc. 1):\n\n    "O thou dull god! why liest thou with the vile\n     In loathsome beds?"\n\nBut plain people have to watch at times, and the French sentinel finds\noccasion to speak in the same strain:\n\n         "Thus are poor servitors\n    (When others sleep upon their quiet beds)\n    Constrained to watch in darkness, rain, and cold."\n                (Henry VI., Part 1, Act 2, Sc. 1.)\n\nHenry VI. is also attracted by the peasant\'s lot:\n\n    "O God, methinks it were a happy life,\n     To be no better than a homely swain....\n     ... The shepherd\'s homely curds,\n     His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,\n     His wonted sleep under a fresh tree\'s shade,\n     All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,\n     As far beyond a prince\'s delicates."\n                (Henry VI., Part 3, Act 2, Sc. 5.)\n\nAll of which is natural enough, but savors of cant in the mouths of men\nwho fought long and hard to maintain themselves upon their thrones.\n\nWe have already shown by references to the contemporary drama that the\nplea of custom is not sufficient to explain Shakespeare\'s attitude to\nthe lower classes, but if we widen our survey to the entire field of\nEnglish letters in his day, we shall see that he was running counter to\nall the best traditions of our literature. From the time of Piers\nPlowman down, the peasant had stood high with the great writers of\npoetry and prose alike. Chaucer\'s famous circle of story-tellers at the\nTabard Inn in Southwark was eminently democratic. With the knight and\nthe friar were gathered together\n\n    "An haberdasher and a carpenter,\n     A webbe, a deyer and tapiser,"\n\nand the tales of the cook and the miller take rank with those of the\nsquire and lawyer. The English Bible, too, was in Shakespeare\'s hands,\nand he must have been familiar with shepherd kings and\nfishermen-apostles. In the very year in which "Hamlet" first appeared, a\nwork was published in Spain which was at once translated into English, a\nwork as well known to-day as Shakespeare\'s own writings. If the\npeasantry was anywhere to be neglected and despised, where should it be\nrather than in proud, aristocratic Spain, and yet, to place beside\nShakespeare\'s Bottoms and Slys, Cervantes has given us the admirable\nSancho Panza, and has spread his loving humor in equal measure over\nservant and master. Are we to believe that the yeomen of England, who\nbeat back the Armada, were inferior to the Spanish peasantry whom they\novercame, or is it not rather true that the Spanish author had a deeper\ninsight into his country\'s heart than was allotted to the English\ndramatist? Cervantes, the soldier and adventurer, rose above the\nprejudices of his class, while Shakespeare never lifted his eyes beyond\nthe narrow horizon of the Court to which he catered. It was love that\nopened Cervantes\'s eye, and it is in all-embracing love that Shakespeare\nwas deficient. As far as the common people were concerned, he never held\nthe mirror up to nature.\n\nBut the book of all others which might have suggested to Shakespeare\nthat there was more in the claims of the lower classes than was dreamt\nof in his philosophy was More\'s "Utopia," which in its English form was\nalready a classic. More, the richest and most powerful man in England\nafter the king, not only believed in the workingman, but knew that he\nsuffered from unjust social conditions. He could never have represented\nthe down-trodden followers of Cade-Tyler nor the hungry mob in\n"Coriolanus" with the utter lack of sympathy which Shakespeare\nmanifests. "What justice is there in this," asks the great Lord\nChancellor, whose character stood the test of death--"what justice is\nthere in this, that a nobleman, a goldsmith, a banker, or any other man,\nthat either does nothing at all or at best is employed in things that\nare of no use to the public, should live in great luxury and splendor\nupon what is so ill acquired; and a mean man, a carter, a smith, a\nplowman, that works harder even than the beasts themselves, and is\nemployed on labors so necessary that no commonwealth could hold out a\nyear without them, can only earn so poor a livelihood, and must lead so\nmiserable a life, that the condition of the beasts is much better than\ntheirs?"\n\nHow different from this is Shakespeare\'s conception of the place of the\nworkingman in society! After a full and candid survey of his plays,\nBottom, the weaver with the ass\'s head, remains his type of the artizan\nand the "mutable, rank-scented many," his type of the masses. Is it\nunfair to take the misshapen "servant-monster" Caliban as his last word\non the subject?\n\n      "Prospero. We\'ll visit Caliban my slave who never\n    Yields us kind answer.\n\n      Miranda. \'Tis a villain, sir,\n    I do not love to look on.\n\n      Prospero. But as \'tis,\n    We can not miss him! he does make our fire,\n    Fetch in our wood, and serve in offices\n    That profit us." (Tempest, Act 1, Sc. 2.)\n\nTo which I would fain reply in the words of Edward Carpenter:\n\n    "Who art thou ...\n     With thy faint sneer for him who wins thee bread\n     And him who clothes thee, and for him who toils\n     Day-long and night-long dark in the earth for thee?"\n\n\n\n\nLETTER FROM MR. G. BERNARD SHAW\n\n(Extracts)\n\n\nAs you know, I have striven hard to open English eyes to the emptiness\nof Shakespeare\'s philosophy, to the superficiality and second-handedness\nof his morality, to his weakness and incoherence as a thinker, to his\nsnobbery, his vulgar prejudices, his ignorance, his disqualifications of\nall sorts for the philosophic eminence claimed for him.... The preface\nto my "Three Plays for Puritans" contains a section headed "Better than\nShakespeare?" which is, I think, the only utterance of mine on the\nsubject to be found in a book.... There is at present in the press a new\npreface to an old novel of mine called "The Irrational Knot." In that\npreface I define the first order in Literature as consisting of those\nworks in which the author, instead of accepting the current morality and\nreligion ready-made without any question as to their validity, writes\nfrom an original moral standpoint of his own, thereby making his book an\noriginal contribution to morals, religion, and sociology, as well as to\n_belles letters_. I place Shakespeare with Dickens, Scott, Dumas pere,\netc., in the second order, because, tho they are enormously\nentertaining, their morality is ready-made; and I point out that the one\nplay, "Hamlet," in which Shakespeare made an attempt to give as a hero\none who was dissatisfied with the ready-made morality, is the one which\nhas given the highest impression of his genius, altho Hamlet\'s revolt is\nunskillfully and inconclusively suggested and not worked out with any\nphilosophic competence.[4]\n\nMay I suggest that you should be careful not to imply that Tolstoy\'s\ngreat Shakespearian heresy has no other support than mine. The preface\nof Nicholas Rowe to his edition of Shakespeare, and the various prefaces\nof Dr. Johnson contain, on Rowe\'s part, an apology for him as a writer\nwith obvious and admitted shortcomings (very ridiculously ascribed by\nRowe to his working by "a mere light of nature"), and, on Johnson\'s, a\ngood deal of downright hard-hitting criticism. You should also look up\nthe history of the Ireland forgeries, unless, as is very probable,\nTolstoy has anticipated you in this. Among nineteenth-century poets\nByron and William Morris saw clearly that Shakespeare was enormously\noverrated intellectually. A French book, which has been translated into\nEnglish, has appeared within the last ten years, giving Napoleon\'s\nopinions of the drama. His insistence on the superiority of Corneille to\nShakespeare on the ground of Corneille\'s power of grasping a political\nsituation, and of seeing men in their relation to the state, is\ninteresting.\n\nOf course you know about Voltaire\'s criticisms, which are the more\nnoteworthy because Voltaire began with an extravagant admiration for\nShakespeare, and got more and more bitter against him as he grew older\nand less disposed to accept artistic merit as a cover for philosophic\ndeficiencies.\n\nFinally, I, for one, shall value Tolstoy\'s criticism all the more\nbecause it is criticism of a foreigner who can not possibly be enchanted\nby the mere word-music which makes Shakespeare so irresistible in\nEngland.[5] In Tolstoy\'s estimation, Shakespeare must fall or stand as a\nthinker, in which capacity I do not think he will stand a moment\'s\nexamination from so tremendously keen a critic and religious realist.\nUnfortunately, the English worship their great artists quite\nindiscriminately and abjectly; so that is quite impossible to make them\nunderstand that Shakespeare\'s extraordinary literary power, his fun, his\nmimicry, and the endearing qualities that earned him the title of "the\ngentle Shakespeare"--all of which, whatever Tolstoy may say, are quite\nunquestionable facts--do not stand or fall with his absurd reputation as\na thinker. Tolstoy will certainly treat that side of his reputation with\nthe severity it deserves; and you will find that the English press will\ninstantly announce that Tolstoy considers his own works greater than\nShakespeare\'s (which in some respects they most certainly are, by the\nway), and that he has attempted to stigmatize our greatest poet as a\nliar, a thief, a forger, a murderer, an incendiary, a drunkard, a\nlibertine, a fool, a madman, a coward, a vagabond, and even a man of\nquestionable gentility. You must not be surprised or indignant at this:\nit is what is called "dramatic criticism" in England and America. Only a\nfew of the best of our journalist-critics will say anything worth\nreading on the subject.\n\n        Yours faithfully,\n                G. BERNARD SHAW.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[4] Besides the prefaces here referred to, Mr. G. Bernard Shaw has at\nvarious times written other articles on the subject.--(V.

This book relates the author\'s own\n     experiences, sensations, and reflections during the most\n     noted siege of modern history. The translation has been\n     authorized by Count Tolstoy, who has specially commended it\n     for its accuracy, simplicity, and directness.\n\n          "No other modern book approaches \'Sevastopol\' in\n          the completeness and directness with which it\n          unveils the realities of war.

Of their\n     translation of Sevastopol, Tolstoy also says: "I think I\n     already wrote you how unusually the first volume of your\n     edition pleases me.

There is a quality in the little tales\n          published under the title \'Esarhaddon\' which is\n          quickly suggestive of certain Biblical narratives.\n          There is one called \'Three Questions,\' which\n          contains, in half a dozen pages, an entire\n          philosophy of life, and it is presented in such\n          apt pictures and ideas that its meaning is not to\n          be overlooked. It would be hard to suggest\n          anything that could be read in five minutes that\n          would impart so much to think about. \'Esarhaddon,\'\n          the sketch from which the volume takes its name,\n          is of the same character, and the third tale,\n          \'Work, Death, and Sickness,\' is full of very fine\n          thought. There is, perhaps, no writer working\n          to-day whose mind is centered on broader and\n          better things than the Russian master, and the\n          present offering shows him at his very best."\n\n     "Hour-Glass Stories."

The object of\n     this activity is to transmit to others feelings the artist\n     has experienced. By certain external signs--movements,\n     lines, colors, sounds or arrangements of words--an artist\n     infects other people so that they share his feelings; thus,\n     "art is a means of union among men, joining them together\n     in the same feeling." Without adequate expression there is\n     no art, for there is no infection, no transference to\n     others of the author\'s feeling. The test of art is\n     infection. If an author has moved you so that you feel as\n     he felt, if you are so united to him in feeling that it\n     seems to you that he has expressed just what you have long\n     wished to express, the work that has so infected you is a\n     work of art.\n\n     A POWERFUL WORK FULL OF GENIUS AND ORIGINALITY\n\n          "The powerful personality of the author, the\n          startling originality of his views, grip the\n          reader and carry him, though his deepest\n          convictions be outraged, protesting through the\n          book."--_Pall Mall Gazette._\n\n          "The discussion is bound to shake the whole world\n          to its very center, and to result in a\n          considerable readjustment of\n          theories."--_Pittsburg Times._\n\n          "It is the ablest and most scholarly writing of a\n          great thinker."--_Chicago Inter Ocean._\n\n          "No recent book on the subject is so novel, so\n          readable, or so questionable."--_New York Times\n          Saturday Review._\n\n     Small 12mo, Cloth, 268 pp. 80 cts., post-paid\n\n     FUNK & WAGNALLS COMPANY, Publishers\n     NEW YORK and LONDON\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n  | Transcriber\'s Notes:                                         |\n  |                                                              |\n  | Page 7: Double quotes inside double quotes in Hallam         |\n  | quotation replaced with single quotes.                       |\n  | Page 9: Closing quotes moved from after "says Brandes" to    |\n  | follow "... at the sight."                                   |\n  | Page 20: strangset amended to strangest                      |\n  | Page 56: insteading amended to instead                       |\n  | Page 72: be amended to he ("he begins")                      |\n  | Page 80: "... the then fashionable euphemism": There is a    |\n  | possibility that "euphuism" should have been used, rather    |\n  | than "euphemism."                                            |\n  | Page 96: Closing quotes added after "... an artistic         |\n  | impression."                                                 |\n  | Page 102: Beaudelaire _sic_                                  |\n  | Page 165: Mirander amended to Miranda                        |\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\n'
