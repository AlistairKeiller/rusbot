The sun was shedding its light; the grass,\nrevivified, was blooming forth, where it was left uncut, not only on\nthe greenswards of the boulevard, but between the flag-stones, and the\nbirches, poplars and wild-berry trees were unfolding their viscous\nleaves; the limes were unfolding their buds; the daws, sparrows and\npigeons were joyfully making their customary nests, and the flies were\nbuzzing on the sun-warmed walls. Plants, birds, insects and children\nwere equally joyful. Only men--grown-up men--continued cheating and\ntormenting themselves and each other. People saw nothing holy in this\nspring morning, in this beauty of God\'s world--a gift to all living\ncreatures--inclining to peace, good-will and love, but worshiped their\nown inventions for imposing their will on each other.\n\nThe joy of spring felt by animals and men did not penetrate the office\nof the county jail, but the one thing of supreme importance there was\na document received the previous evening, with title, number and seal,\nwhich ordered the bringing into court for trial, this 28th day of\nApril, at nine o\'clock in the morning, three prisoners--two women and\none man. One of the women, as the more dangerous criminal, was to be\nbrought separately. So, in pursuance of that order, on the 28th day of\nApril, at eight o\'clock in the morning, the jail warden entered the\ndingy corridor of the woman\'s ward. Immediately behind him came a\nwoman with weary countenance and disheveled gray hair, wearing a\ncrown-laced jacket, and girdled with a blue-edged sash. She was the\nmatron.\n\n"You want Maslova?" she asked the warden, as they neared one of the\ncells opening into the corridor.\n\nThe warden, with a loud clanking of iron, unlocked and opened the door\nof the cell, releasing an even fouler odor than permeated the\ncorridor, and shouted:\n\n"Maslova to the court!" and again closing the door he waited for her\nappearance.\n\nThe fresh, vivifying air of the fields, carried to the city by the\nwind, filled even the court-yard of the jail. But in the corridor the\noppressive air, laden with the smell of tar and putrescence, saddened\nand dejected the spirit of every new-comer. The same feeling was\nexperienced by the jail matron, notwithstanding she was accustomed to\nbad air. On entering the corridor she suddenly felt a weariness coming\nover her that inclined her to slumber.\n\nThere was a bustling in the cell; women\'s voices and steps of bare\nfeet were heard.\n\n"Hurry up, Maslova! Come on, I say!" shouted the warden into the\ncell-door.\n\nPresently at the cell-door appeared a middle-sized, full-breasted\nyoung woman, dressed in a long, gray coat over a white waist and\nskirt. She approached with firm step, and, facing about, stood before\nthe warden. Over her linen stockings she wore jail shoes; her head was\ncovered with a white \'kerchief, from under which black curls were\nevidently purposely brushed over the forehead. The face of the woman\nwas of that whiteness peculiar to people who have been a long time in\nconfinement, and which reminds one of potato-sprouts in a cellar. Her\nsmall, wide hands, her white, full neck, showing from under the large\ncollar of the coat, were of a similar hue. On the dull pallor of that\nface the most striking feature was the black, sparkling eyes, somewhat\nswollen, but very bright eyes, one of which slightly squinted. She\nheld herself erect, putting forth her full chest. Emerging into the\ncorridor, throwing her head back a little, she looked into the eyes of\nthe warden and stood ready to do his bidding. The warden was about to\nshut the door, when a pale, severe, wrinkled face of an old woman with\ndisheveled hair was thrust out. The old woman began to say something\nto Maslova. But the warden pressed the door against the head of the\nwoman, and she disappeared. In the cell a woman\'s voice burst into\nlaughter. Maslova also smiled, and turned to the grated little opening\nin the door. The old woman pressed her forehead to the grating, and\nsaid in a hoarse voice:\n\n"Above all, don\'t speak too much; stick to one thing, and that is\nall."\n\n"Of course. It cannot be any worse," said Maslova.\n\n"You certainly cannot stick to two things," said the chief warden,\nwith official assurance of his own wit. "Follow me, now! Forward!\nMarch!"\n\nThe eye looking from behind the grating disappeared, and Maslova took\nto the middle of the corridor, and with short, but rapid strides,\nfollowed the warden. They descended the stone stairway, and as they\npassed the men\'s ward, noisy and more noisome even than the woman\'s\nward, scores of eyes followed them from behind the gratings. They\nentered the office, where an armed escort of two soldiers stood. The\nclerk handed one of the soldiers a document, reeking of tobacco smoke,\nand, pointing to the prisoner, said:\n\n"Take her."\n\nThe soldier, a Nijhni peasant with a red and pock-marked face, placed\nthe paper into the cuff of his coat sleeve, and, smiling, winked to\nhis muscular comrade. The soldiers and prisoner descended the stairs\nand went in the direction of the main entrance.\n\nA small door in the gate opened, and, crossing the threshold, they\npassed through the inclosure and took the middle of the paved street.\n\nDrivers, shop-keepers, kitchen maids, laborers and officials halted\nand gazed with curiosity at the prisoner. Some shook their heads and\nthought: "There is the result of evil conduct--how unlike ours!"\nChildren looked with horror at the cut-throat, but the presence of the\nsoldiers reassured them, for she was now powerless to do harm. A\nvillager, returning from the mart, where he had disposed of his\ncharcoal and visited an inn, offered her a kopeck. The prisoner\nblushed, drooped her head and murmured something.\n\nConscious of the attention that was shown her, without turning her\nhead she looked askance at the onlookers and rather enjoyed it. She\nalso enjoyed the comparatively pure spring air, but the walking on the\ncobblestones was painful to her feet, unused as they were to walking,\nand shod in clumsy prison shoes. She looked at her feet and endeavored\nto step as lightly as possible. Passing by a food store, in front of\nwhich some pigeons were picking grain, she came near striking with her\nfoot a dove-colored bird. It rose with a flutter of its wings, and\nflew past the very ear of the prisoner, fanning her face with its\nwings. She smiled, then sighed deeply, remembering her own condition.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nThe history of the prisoner Maslova was a very common one. Maslova was\nthe daughter of an unmarried menial who lived with her mother, a\ncowherd, on the estate of two spinsters. This unmarried woman gave\nbirth to a child every year, and, as is the custom in the villages,\nbaptized them; then neglected the troublesome newcomers, and they\nfinally starved to death.\n\nThus five children died. Every one of these was baptized, then it\nstarved and finally died. The sixth child, begotten of a passing\ngypsy, was a girl, who would have shared the same fate, but it\nhappened that one of the two old maidens entered the cow-shed to\nreprimand the milkmaids for carelessness in skimming the cream, and\nthere saw the mother with the healthy and beautiful child. The old\nmaiden chided them for the cream and for permitting the woman to lie\nin the cow-shed, and was on the point of departing, but noticing the\nchild, was moved to pity, and afterward consented to stand godmother\nto the child. She baptized the child, and in pity for her\ngod-daughter, furnished her with milk, gave the mother some money,\nand the babe thrived. Wherefore the old maidens called it "the saved\none."\n\nThe child was three years old when the mother fell ill and died. She\nwas a great burden to her grandmother, so the old maidens adopted her.\nThe dark-eyed girl became unusually lively and pretty, and her\npresence cheered them.\n\nOf the two old maidens, the younger one--Sophia Ivanovna--was the\nkindlier, while the older one--Maria Ivanovna--was of austere\ndisposition. Sophia Ivanovna kept the girl in decent clothes, taught\nher to read and intended to give her an education. Maria Ivanovna said\nthat the girl ought to be taught to work that she might become a\nuseful servant, was exacting, punished, and even beat her when in bad\nhumor. Under such conditions the girl grew up half servant, half lady.\nHer position was reflected even in her name, for she was not called by\nthe gentle Katinka, nor yet by the disdainful Katka, but Katiousha,\nwhich stands sentimentally between the two. She sewed, cleaned the\nrooms, cleaned the ikons with chalk, ground, cooked and served coffee,\nwashed, and sometimes she read for the ladies.\n\nShe was wooed, but would marry no one, feeling that life with any one\nof her wooers would be hard, spoiled, as she was, more or less, by the\ncomparative ease she enjoyed in the manor.\n\nShe had just passed her sixteenth year when the ladies were visited by\ntheir nephew, a rich student, and Katiousha, without daring to confess\nit to him, or even to herself, fell in love with him. Two years\nafterward, while on his way to the war, he again visited his aunts,\nand during his four days\' stay, consummated her ruin. Before his\ndeparture he thrust a hundred ruble bill into her hand.\n\nThenceforward life ceased to have any charms for her, and her only\nthought was to escape the shame which awaited her, and not only did\nshe become lax in her duties, but--and she did not know herself how it\nhappened--all of a sudden she gave vent to her ill temper. She said\nsome rude things to the ladies, of which she afterward repented, and\nleft them.\n\nDissatisfied with her behavior, they did not detain her. She then\nobtained employment as servant in the house of the commissary of rural\npolice, but was obliged to give up the position at the end of the\nthird month, for the commissary, a fifty-year old man, pursued her\nwith his attentions, and when, on one occasion, he became too\npersistent, she flared up, called him an old fool, and threw him to\nthe ground. Then she was driven from the house. She was now so far\nadvanced on the road to maternity that to look for a position was out\nof the question. Hence she took lodgings with an old midwife, who was\nalso a wine dealer. The confinement came off painlessly. But the\nmidwife was attending a sick woman in the village, infected Katiousha\nwith puerperal fever, and the child, a boy, was taken to a foundling\nasylum where, she was told, he died immediately after his arrival\nthere.\n\nWhen Katiousha took lodgings with the midwife she had 127 rubles; 27\nrubles of which she had earned, and 100 rubles which had been given\nher by her seducer. When she left her she had but six rubles left. She\nwas not economical, and spent on herself as well as others. She paid\n40 rubles to the midwife for two months\' board; 25 rubles it cost her\nto have the child taken away; 40 rubles the midwife borrowed of her to\nbuy a cow with; the balance was spent on dresses, presents, etc., so\nthat after the confinement she was practically penniless, and was\ncompelled to look for a position. She was soon installed in the house\nof a forester who was married, and who, like the commissary, began to\npay court to her. His wife became aware of it, and when, on one\noccasion, she found them both in the room, she fell on Katiousha and\nbegan to beat her. The latter resented it, and the result was a\nscrimmage, after which she was driven out of the house, without being\npaid the wages due her. Katiousha went to the city, where she stopped\nwith her aunt. Her aunt\'s husband was a bookbinder. Formerly he used\nto earn a competence, but had lost his customers, and was now given to\ndrink, spending everything that came into his hands.\n\nWith the aid of a small laundry she was keeping, her aunt supported\nher children as well as her husband. She offered Maslova work as a\nwasherwoman, but seeing what a hard life the washerwomen at her\naunt\'s establishment were leading, she searched through the\nintelligence offices for a position as servant. She found such a place\nwith a lady who was living with her two student boys. A week after she\nhad entered upon her duties, the oldest son neglected his studies and\nmade life miserable for Maslova. The mother threw all blame upon\nMaslova and discharged her. She was some time without any occupation.\nIn one of these intelligence offices she once met a lady richly\ndressed and adorned with diamonds. This lady, learning of the\ncondition of Maslova, who was looking for a position, gave her her\ncard and invited her to call. The lady received Maslova\naffectionately, treated her to choice cakes and sweet wine, while she\ndispatched her servant somewhere with a note. In the evening a tall\nman with long hair just turning gray, and gray beard, came into the\nroom. The old man immediately seated himself beside Maslova and began\nto jest. The hostess called him into an adjoining room, and Maslova\noverheard her say: "As fresh as a rose; just from the country." Then\nthe hostess called in Maslova and told her that the man was an author,\nvery rich, _and will be very generous if he takes a liking to her_. He\ndid take a liking to her, gave her twenty-five rubles, and promised to\ncall on her often. The money was soon spent in settling for her board\nat her aunt\'s, for a new dress, hat and ribbons. A few days afterward\nthe author sent for her a second time. She called. He gave her another\ntwenty-five ruble bill and offered to rent apartments for her where\nshe could reside separately.\n\nWhile living in the apartments rented by the author, Maslova became\ninfatuated with a jolly clerk living in the same house. She herself\ntold the author of her infatuation, and moved into a smaller\napartment. The clerk, who had promised to marry her, without saying\nanything, left for Nijhni, evidently casting her off, and Maslova\nremained alone. She wished to remain in the apartment, but the\nlandlord would not permit a single woman to occupy it, and she\nreturned to her aunt. Her fashionable dress, cape and hat won her the\nrespect of her aunt, who no longer dared to offer her work as a\nwasherwoman, considering her present position far above it. The\nquestion of working in the laundry did not even occur to Maslova now.\nShe looked with compassion on the life of drudgery led by these pale,\nemaciated washerwomen, some of whom showed symptoms of consumption,\nwashing and ironing in a stifling, steam-laden atmosphere with the\nwindows open summer and winter, and she was horrified at the thought\nthat she, too, might be driven to such drudgery.\n\nMaslova had for a long time been addicted to cigarette smoking, but of\nlate she had been getting more and more accustomed to drink. The wine\nattracted her, not because of its taste, but because it enabled her to\nforget her past life, to comfort herself with ease, and the confidence\nof her own worth that it gave her. Without wine she was despondent and\nabashed. There was the choice of two things before her; either the\nhumiliating occupation of a servant, with the certain unwelcome\nattentions of the men, or a secure, quiet and legitimatized position\nof everybody\'s mistress. She wished to revenge herself on her seducer,\nas well as the clerk, and all those that brought misfortune upon her.\nBesides, she could not withstand the temptation of having all the\ndresses her heart desired--dresses made of velvet, gauze and\nsilk--ball dresses, with open neck and short sleeves. And when Maslova\nimagined herself in a bright yellow silk dress, with velvet trimmings,\ndecolette, she made her choice.\n\nFrom this day on Maslova began to lead a life to which hundreds of\nthousands of women are driven, and which, in nine cases out of ten,\nends in painful disease, premature decrepitude and death.\n\nAfter a night\'s orgies there would come a deep slumber till three or\nfour o\'clock in the afternoon; then the weary rising from a dirty\ncouch; seltzer-water to remove the effect of excessive drinking,\ncoffee. Then came the sauntering through the rooms in dressing-gown,\nlooking through the windows; the languid quarrels; then the perfuming\nof her body and hair, the trying on of dresses, and the quarrels with\nthe mistress which they occasioned; contemplating herself in the\nmirror, rouging her face, darkening her eyebrows. Then came the sweet,\nrich food, the bright silk dress, the entry into the brightly lighted\nparlor, the arrival of the guests, music, dancing, confectionery, wine\nand cigarettes.\n\nThus Maslova lived for seven years. On the eighth, when she had\nreached her twenty-sixth year, there happened that for which she had\nbeen jailed, and for which she was now led to the court, after six\nmonths of confinement among thieves and murderers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nAt the time when Maslova, exhausted by the long walk, was approaching\nwith the armed convoy the building in which court was held, the same\nnephew of the ladies that brought her up, Prince Dmitri Ivanovitch\nNekhludoff, who deceived her, lay on his high, soft, spring\nfeather-bed, in spotless Holland linen, smoking a cigarette. He was\ngazing before him, contemplating the events of the previous day and\nconsidering what he had before him for that day. As he thought of the\nprevious evening, spent at the Korchagins, a wealthy and influential\nfamily, whose daughter, rumor had it, he was to marry, he sighed, and\nthrowing away the butt of his cigarette, he was on the point of taking\nanother from the silver cigarette holder, but changed his mind. Half\nrising, he slipped his smooth, white feet into the slippers, threw a\nsilk morning gown over his broad shoulders, and with quick and heavy\nstride, walked into the adjoining dressing-room, which was permeated\nwith the artificial odors of elixirs, perfumes, cosmetics. There he\nwashed his partly gold-filled teeth with a tooth-powder, rinsed them\nwith a perfumed mouth-wash, then began to sponge himself and dry his\nbody with Turkish towels. After washing his hands with perfumed soap,\ncarefully brushing his trimmed nails and washing his face and stout\nneck in a marble basin, he walked into a third room, where a\nshower-bath was ready. Here he received a cold-water douche, and after\nrubbing his white and muscular body with coarse towels and donning his\nwhite linen, he seated himself before the mirror and began to brush\nhis short, curly beard and the thinning curls of his forehead.\n\nEverything used by him--the linen, clothing, shoes, scarfs,\nscarf-pins, cuff-buttons, were of the very best quality, simple,\ntasteful and expensive.\n\nHe then picked out the first of a dozen scarfs and pins that came into\nhis hand--it was no more novel and amusing, as it used to be--and he\nwas quite indifferent as to which he put on. He dressed himself in his\nbrushed clothes which lay on the chair and went out, though not quite\nrefreshed, yet clean and fragrant. In the oblong dining-room, the\ninlaid floor of which had been polished by three of his men the day\nbefore, and containing a massive oaken sideboard and a similar\nextension table, the legs of which were carved in the shape of lion\'s\npaws, giving it a pompous appearance, breakfast stood ready for him. A\nfine, starched cloth with large monograms was spread on the table, on\nwhich stood a silver coffee-pot, containing fragrant, steaming coffee,\na sugar bowl and cream pitcher to match, fresh rolls and various kinds\nof biscuits. Beside them lay the last number of the "Revue des deux\nMondes," newspapers and his mail. Nekhludoff was about to open the\nletters, when a middle-aged woman, with a lace head-gear over her\nunevenly parted hair, glided into the room. This was Agrippina\nPetrovna, servant of his mother, who died in this very house. She was\nnow stewardess to the son.\n\nAgrippina Petrovna had traveled many years abroad with Nekhludoff\'s\nmother, and had acquired the manners of a lady. She had lived in the\nhouse of the Nekhludoffs since childhood, and knew Dmitri Ivanovitch\nwhen he was called by the diminutive Mitenka.\n\n"Good-morning, Dmitri Ivanovitch."\n\n"How do you do, Agrippina Petrovna? What\'s the news?" asked\nNekhludoff, jesting.\n\n"A letter from the old Princess, or the young one, perhaps. The maid\nbrought it long ago, and is now waiting in my room," said Agrippina\nPetrovna, handing him the letter with a significant smile.\n\n"Very well; I will attend to it immediately," said Nekhludoff, taking\nthe letter and then, noticing the smile on Agrippina\'s face, he\nfrowned.\n\nThe smile on Agrippina\'s face signified that the letter came from\nPrincess Korchagin, whom, according to Agrippina Petrovna, he was to\nmarry. And this supposition, expressed by her smile, displeased\nNekhludoff.\n\n"Then I will bid her wait," and Agrippina Petrovna glided out of the\ndining-room, first replacing the crumb-brush, which lay on the table,\nin its holder.\n\nNekhludoff opened the perfumed letter and began to read:\n\n     "In fulfillment of the duty I assumed of being your memory,"\n     the letter ran, "I call to your mind that you have been\n     summoned to serve as juror to-day, the 28th of April, and\n     that, therefore, you cannot accompany us and Kolosoff to the\n     art exhibition, as you promised yesterday in your customary\n     forgetfulness; a moins que vous ne soyez dispose a payer a\n     la cour d\'assises les 300 rubles d\'amende que vous vous\n     refusez pour votre cheval, for your failure to appear in\n     time. I remembered it yesterday, when you had left. So keep\n     it in mind.\n\n                                         "PRINCESS M. KORCHAGIN."\n\nOn the other side was a postscript:\n\n     "Maman vous fait dire que votre couvert vous attendra jusqu\'\n     a la nuit. Venez absolument a quelle heure que cela soit. M. K."\n\nNekhludoff knit his brows. The note was the continuation of a skillful\nstrategem whereby the Princess sought, for the last two months, to\nfasten him with invisible bonds. But Nekhludoff, besides the usual\nirresoluteness before marriage of people of his age, and who are not\npassionately in love, had an important reason for withholding his\noffer of marriage for the time being. The reason was not that ten\nyears before he had ruined and abandoned Katiousha, which incident he\nhad entirely forgotten, but that at this very time he was sustaining\nrelations with a married woman, and though he now considered them at\nan end, they were not so considered by her.\n\nIn the presence of women, Nekhludoff was very shy, but it was this\nvery shyness that determined the married woman to conquer him. This\nwoman was the wife of the commander of the district in which\nNekhludoff was one of the electors. She led him into relations with\nher which held him fast, and at the same time grew more and more\nrepulsive to him. At first Nekhludoff could not resist her wiles,\nthen, feeling himself at fault, he could not break off the relations\nagainst her will. This was the reason why Nekhludoff considered that\nhe had no right, even if he desired, to ask for the hand of Korchagin.\nA letter from the husband of that woman happened to lay on the table.\nRecognizing the handwriting and the stamp, Nekhludoff flushed and\nimmediately felt an influx of that energy which he always experienced\nin the face of danger. But there was no cause for his agitation; the\nhusband, as commander of the district where Nekhludoff\'s estates were\nsituated, informed the latter of a special meeting of the local\ngoverning body, and asked him to be present without fail, and donner\nun coup d\'epaule in the important measures to be submitted concerning\nthe schools and roads, and that the reactionary party was expected to\noffer strong opposition.\n\nThe commander was a liberal-minded man, entirely absorbed with the\nstruggles, and knew nothing about his wretched family life.\n\nNekhludoff recalled all the tortures this man had occasioned him; how\non one occasion he thought that the husband had discovered all, and he\nwas preparing to fight a duel with him, intending to use a blank\ncartridge, and the ensuing scene where she, in despair, ran to the\npond, intending to drown herself, while he ran to search for her. "I\ncannot go now, and can undertake nothing until I have heard from her,"\nthought Nekhludoff. The preceding week he had written to her a\ndecisive letter, acknowledging his guilt, and expressing his readiness\nto redeem it in any manner she should suggest, but for her own good,\nconsidered their relations ended. It is to this letter that he\nexpected a reply. He considered it a favorable sign that no reply\ncame. If she had not consented to a separation, she would have\nanswered long ago, or would have come personally, as she often did\nbefore. Nekhludoff had heard that an army officer was courting her,\nand while he was tormented by jealousy, he was at the same time\ngladdened by the hope of release from the oppressive lie.\n\nThe other letter was from the steward in charge of his estates.\nNekhludoff was requested to return and establish his right to the\ninheritance and also to decide on the future management of the\nestates; whether the same system of letting out to the peasants, which\nprevailed during the lifetime of his mother, was to be continued, or,\nas the steward had strongly advised the deceased Princess, and now\nadvised the young Prince, to augment the stock and work all the land\nhimself. The steward wrote that the land could thus best be exploited.\nHe also apologized for his failure to send the three thousand rubles\ndue on the first of the month, which he would send by the next mail,\nexplaining it by the difficulty of collecting the rents from the\npeasants whose bad faith had reached a point where it became necessary\nto resort to the courts to collect them. This letter was partly\nagreeable and partly disagreeable to Nekhludoff. It was agreeable to\nfeel the power of authority over so vast an estate, and it was\ndisagreeable, because in his youth he was an enthusiastic adherent of\nHerbert Spencer, and being himself a large land owner, was struck by\nthe proposition in _Social Statics_ that private ownership of land is\ncontrary to the dictates of justice. With the frankness and boldness\nof youth, he not only _then_ spoke of the injustice of private\nownership of land; not only did he compose theses in the university on\nthe subject, but he actually distributed among the peasants the few\nhundred acres of land left him by his father, not desiring to own land\ncontrary to his convictions. Now that he found himself the owner of\nvast estates, he was confronted by two alternatives: either to waive\nhis ownership in favor of the peasants, as he did ten years ago with\nthe two hundred acres, or, by tacit acquiescence, confess that all his\nformer ideas were erroneous and false.\n\nHe could not carry out the first, because he possessed no resources\noutside of the land. He did not wish to go into service, and yet he\nhad luxurious habits of life which he thought he could not abandon.\nIndeed, there was no necessity of abandoning these habits, since he\nhad lost the strength of conviction as well as the resolution, the\nvanity and the desire to astonish people that he had possessed in his\nyouth. The other alternative--to reject all the arguments against\nprivate ownership of land which he gathered from Spencer\'s _Social\nStatics_, and of which he found confirmation in the works of Henry\nGeorge--he could follow even less.\n\nFor this reason the steward\'s letter was disagreeable to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nHaving breakfasted, Nekhludoff went to the cabinet to see for what\nhour he was summoned to appear at court, and to answer the Princess\'\nnote. In the work-room stood an easel with a half-finished painting\nturned face downward, and on the wall hung studies in drawing. On\nseeing that painting, on which he had worked two years, and those\ndrawings, he called to mind the feeling of impotence, which he\nexperienced of late with greatest force, to make further advance in\nthe art. He explained this feeling by the development of a fine\naesthetic taste, and yet this consciousness caused him unpleasant\nsensations.\n\nSeven years before he had retired from active service he decided that\nhis true vocation in life was painting, and from the height of his\nartistic activity he looked down upon all other occupations. And now\nit appeared that he had no right to do so, and every recollection of\nit was disagreeable to him. He looked on all the luxurious\nappointments of the work-room with heavy heart, and walked into the\ncabinet in ill humor. The cabinet was a high room, profusely\nornamented, and containing every imaginable device of comfort and\nnecessity.\n\nHe produced from one of the drawers of a large table the summons, and,\nascertaining that he must appear at eleven o\'clock, he sat down and\nwrote to the Princess, thanking her for the invitation, and saying\nthat he should try to call for dinner. The tone of the note seemed to\nhim too intimate, and he tore it up; he wrote another, but that was\ntoo formal, almost offensive. Again he tore it up, and touched a\nbutton on the wall. A servant, morose, with flowing side-whiskers and\nin a gray apron, entered.\n\n"Please send for a carriage."\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"And tell the Korchagins\' maid that I thank them; I will try to call."\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"It is impolite, but I cannot write. But I will see her to-day,"\nthought Nekhludoff, and started to dress himself.\n\nWhen he emerged from the house a carriage with rubber tires awaited\nhim.\n\n"You had scarcely left Prince Korchagin\'s house yesterday when I\ncalled for you," said the driver, half-turning his stout, sun-burned\nneck in the white collar of his shirt, "and the footman said that you\nhad just gone."\n\n"Even the drivers know of my relations to the Korchagins," thought\nNekhludoff, and the unsolved question which continually occupied his\nmind of late--whether or not he ought to marry Princess\nKorchagin--again occurred to him, and, like most questions that he was\ncalled upon to decide at that time, it remained unsolved.\n\nHe had many reasons for, and as many against, marriage. There was the\npleasure of domestic life, which made it possible to lead a moral\nlife, as he called married life; then, and principally, the family and\nchildren would infuse his present aimless life with a purpose. This\nwas for marriage generally. On the other hand there was, first, the\nloss of freedom which all elderly bachelors fear so much; and, second,\nan unconscious awe of that mysterious creature, woman.\n\nHowever, in favor of marrying Missy in particular (Korchagin\'s name\nwas Maria, but, as usual in families of the higher classes, she\nreceived a nickname) there was, first, the fact that she came of good\nstock, and was in everything, from her dress to her manner of\nspeaking, walking and laughing, distinguished not by any exceptional\nqualities, but by "good breeding"--he knew no other expression for the\nquality which he prized very highly. Second, she valued him above all\nother men, hence, he thought she understood him. And this appreciation\nof him, that is, acknowledging his high qualities, was proof to\nNekhludoff of her intelligence and correct judgment. Finally, against\nmarrying Missy in particular, was, first, the extreme probability of\nhis finding a girl of much better qualities than Missy, and,\nconsequently, more worthy of him; and, second, Missy was twenty-seven\nyears old and had probably loved other men before him. This thought\ntormented him. His pride could not reconcile itself to the thought\nthat she could love some one else, even in the past. Of course, she\ncould not be expected to know that she would meet him, but the very\nthought that she could have loved some one else before offended him.\n\nSo that there were as many reasons for as there were against marriage\nin general and marrying Missy in particular. At all events the\narguments were equally strong on both sides, and Nekhludoff laughed as\nhe compared himself to the ass in the fable who, while deciding which\nof the two bales of hay before him he should have his meal from,\nstarved himself.\n\n"However, until I have heard from Maria Vasilieona, the wife of the\ncommander, and have done with her for good, I can do nothing," he said\nto himself.\n\nAnd the consciousness that he could and must defer his decision\npleased him.\n\n"Ah, but I will consider it all later," he said to himself, as his\ncabriolet silently approached the asphalt pavement of the court-house.\n\n"And now I must do my duty to the community conscientiously, as I\nalways do, and think it one\'s duty to do. Besides, it is often\ninteresting," he said, and went past the door-keeper into the\nvestibule of the court.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nThere was great commotion in the corridors of the court when\nNekhludoff entered.\n\nThe attendants flitted to and fro breathlessly, delivering orders and\ndocuments. Police captains, lawyers and clerks passed now one way, now\nthe other; complainants and defendants under bail leaned sadly against\nthe walls, or were sitting and waiting.\n\n"Where is the Circuit Court?" asked Nekhludoff of one of the\nattendants.\n\n"Which one? There is a civil division and a criminal one."\n\n"I am a juror."\n\n"Criminal division. You should have said so. This way, to the right,\nthen turn to your left. The second door."\n\nNekhludoff went as directed.\n\nAt the door two men stood waiting. One was a tall, stout merchant, a\ngood-natured man, who had evidently partaken of some liquor and was in\nvery high spirits; the other was a clerk of Jewish extraction. They\nwere talking about the price of wool when Nekhludoff approached them\nand asked if that was the jury\'s room.\n\n"Here, sir, here. Are you also one of the jurymen?" mirthfully winking\nhis eyes, the good-natured merchant asked.\n\n"Well, we will drudge together, I suppose," he continued in response\nto Nekhludoff\'s affirmative answer. "My name is Baklashoff, merchant\nof the second guild," he introduced himself, extending his soft, broad\nhand; "we must do our duty. Whom have I the honor of addressing?"\n\nNekhludoff gave his name and passed into the jury-room.\n\nIn the small jury-room there were about ten men of every description.\nThey had just arrived; some were sitting, others walked about, eyeing,\nand making each other\'s acquaintance. One was a retired officer in\nuniform; others were in short coats, and but one in peasant garb.\n\nNotwithstanding that they were all complaining that the jury duty was\nburdensome, and was taking them away from their business, they all\nseemed to be pleased with the consciousness of performing an important\ncivic duty.\n\nThe jurymen talked among themselves of the weather, of the premature\nspring, of the business before them. Those who were not acquainted\nwith Nekhludoff hastened to become so, evidently considering it an\nhonor. And Nekhludoff, as was usual with him among strangers, received\nit as his due. If he were asked why he considered himself above the\nmajority of people he would not be able to answer, as there was\nnothing in his life transcending the commonplace. The fact that he\nspoke English, French and German fluently; that his linen, clothing,\nscarf and cuff-buttons were of superior make would not be sufficient\nreason for assuming his superiority, as he himself well understood.\nAnd yet he doubtless acknowledged in himself this superiority, and\nregarded the respect shown him as his due, and was offended when it\nwas not forthcoming. It just happened that in the jury-room Nekhludoff\nexperienced this disagreeable feeling of being treated with\ndisrespect. Among the jurymen there was an acquaintance of Nekhludoff.\nThis was Peter Gerasimovitch (Nekhludoff never knew, and even boasted\nof the fact that he did not know his surname), who was at one time\ntutor to his sister\'s children. Peter Gerasimovitch was now teacher in\na college. Nekhludoff could never bear his familiarity, his\nself-satisfied laughter--in a word, his "communizing," as Nekhludoff\'s\nsister used to put it.\n\n"Ha, ha! So you are also trapped?" he greeted Nekhludoff with a loud\nburst of laughter. "You did not escape it?"\n\n"I never intended to evade my duty," sternly and gloomily said\nNekhludoff.\n\n"That I call civic virtue. But wait till you are hungry and sleepy,\nyou will sing another tune," Peter Gerasimovitch said, laughing still\nlouder.\n\n"This son of an archdeacon will soon begin to \'thou\' me," thought\nNekhludoff, with an expression of sadness on his face, as though he\nhad just learned of a grievous loss in his family. He turned from the\nex-tutor and approached a group of people that had formed around a\nclean-faced, tall man, of dignified carriage, who were holding a\nspirited conversation. The man was speaking of a case that was being\ntried in the civil division, showing his familiarity with the judges\nand the famous lawyers by referring to them by name. He was telling\nthem of the remarkable turn given to the probable result of the case\nby the dexterity of a famous lawyer, by which an old lady, who was in\nthe right, would be obliged to pay an enormous sum to the adverse\nside.\n\n"He is a most ingenious attorney," he said.\n\nHe was listened to with respect, and some attempted to interrupt him\nwith some remarks, but he cut them short as if he alone knew the true\nfacts.\n\nAlthough Nekhludoff arrived late, there was a long wait before him,\nwhich was caused by the failure of one of the judges to appear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nThe presiding justice arrived early. He was a tall, stout man, with\nlong, grayish side-whiskers. He was married, but, like his wife, led a\nvery dissolute life. They did not interfere with each other. On the\nmorning in question he received a note from a Swiss governess, who had\nlived in his house during the summer, and was now passing on her way\nfrom the South to St. Petersburg. She wrote that she would be in town\nbetween three and six o\'clock p.m., and wait for him at the "Hotel\nItalia." He was, therefore, anxious to end his day\'s sitting before\nsix o\'clock, that he might meet the red-haired Clara Vasilievna.\n\nEntering his private chamber, and locking the door behind him, he\nproduced from the lower shelf of a book-case two dumb-bells, made\ntwenty motions upward, forward, sidewise and downward, and three times\nlowered himself, holding the bells above his head.\n\n"Nothing so refreshes one as a cold-water bath and exercise," he\nthought, feeling with his left hand, on the fourth finger of which was\na gold ring, the biceps of his right arm. He had to go through two\nmore movements (these exercises he went through every day before court\nopened), when the door rattled. Some one was attempting to open it.\nThe judge quickly replaced the dumb-bells and opened the door.\n\n"I beg your pardon," he said.\n\nOne of the members of the court, wearing gold eye-glasses, of medium\nheight, with high shoulders and frowning countenance, entered.\n\n"Matvei Nikitich is late again," said the newcomer, with an air of\ndispleasure.\n\n"Yes," said the presiding judge, donning his robes. "He is always\nlate."\n\n"It is a shame," said the member, and sat down angrily, then lighted a\ncigarette.\n\nThis member of the court, a very punctilious man, had this morning had\nan unpleasant encounter with his wife, which was caused by her\nspending her monthly allowance before the month was up. She asked for\na sum of money in advance, and he refused. The result was a quarrel.\nShe said that unless he gave her the money there would be no dinner\nthat night, and that he would have to dine outside. He departed in\nfear that she would carry out her threat, as anything might be\nexpected from her.\n\n"Is it worth while leading a good, moral life?" he thought, as he\nlooked at the beaming, healthy, joyful and good-natured presiding\njustice, who, spreading his elbows, stroked his long, gray whiskers;\n"he is always contented and cheerful, while I am suffering."\n\nThe secretary entered and handed the presiding justice a document.\n\n"Thank you," he said, and lighted a cigarette. "Which case shall be\ntaken up first?"\n\n"The poison case, I think," the secretary answered, with feigned\nindifference.\n\n"Very well; so let it be the poison case," said the justice,\nconsidering that that case could be disposed of by four o\'clock and\nmake it possible for him to keep the appointment. "Has Matvei Nikitich\narrived?"\n\n"Not yet."\n\n"Is Breae here?"\n\n"Yes," answered the secretary.\n\n"Then tell him that we shall try the poisoning case."\n\nBreae was an assistant prosecuting attorney and was assigned to this\nterm of the court.\n\nThe secretary met Breae in the corridor. With uplifted shoulders, his\nrobe unbuttoned, and portfolio under his arm, he almost ran, his heels\nclattering on the floor, and his disengaged hand outstretched in the\ndirection in which he was going.\n\n"Michael Petrovich desires to know if you are ready," said the\nsecretary.\n\n"Certainly; I am always ready," said the assistant prosecutor; "which\nis the first case?"\n\n"The poisoning case."\n\n"Very well," said the assistant prosecutor, but he did not consider it\nwell at all--he had not slept all night. A send-off had been given to\na departing friend, and he drank and played till two in the morning,\nso that he was entirely unfamiliar with this case, and now hastened to\nglance over the indictment. The secretary had purposely suggested the\ncase, knowing that the prosecutor had not read it. The secretary was a\nman of liberal, even radical, ideas. Breae was conservative, and the\nsecretary disliked him, and envied his position.\n\n"And what about the Skoptzy?"[A]\n\n"I have already said that I cannot prosecute them in the absence of\nwitnesses," said the assistant prosecutor, "and I will so declare to\nthe court."\n\n"But you don\'t need----"\n\n"I cannot," said the assistant prosecutor, and waving his hand, ran to\nhis office.\n\nHe was postponing the case against the Skoptzy, although the absent\nwitness was an entirely unnecessary one. The real reason of the\npostponement was that the prosecutor feared that their trial before an\nintelligent jury might end in their acquittal. By an understanding\nwith the presiding justice their case was to be transferred to the\nsession of the District Court, where the preponderance of peasants on\nthe jury would insure their conviction.\n\nThe commotion in the corridor increased. The greatest crowd was before\nthe Civil Court, where the case of which the portly gentleman was\ntelling the jurymen was being tried. During a recess the same old lady\nfrom whom the ingenious attorney managed to win her property in favor\nof his shrewd client, came out of the court-room. That he was not\nentitled to the property was known to the judges as well as to the\nclaimant and his attorney, but the mode of their procedure was such\nthat it was impossible to dismiss their claim. The old lady was stout,\nin smart attire, and with large flowers on her hat. As she passed\ninto the corridor she stopped, and turning to her lawyer, kept\nrepeating:\n\n"How can it be? Great heavens! I don\'t understand it!"\n\nThe lawyer did not listen to her, but looked at the flowers on her\nhat, making mental calculations.\n\nBehind the old lady, beaming in his wide-open vest, and with a\nself-sufficient smile on his face, came that same famous lawyer who so\nmanaged the case that the lady with the large flowers lost all her\nproperty, while his shrewd client, who paid him ten thousand rubles,\nreceived over a hundred thousand. All eyes were directed toward him.\nHe was conscious of it and seemed to say by his demeanor:\n\n"Never mind your expressions of devotion," and brushed past the crowd.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote A: A sect of eunuchs.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nFinally Matvei Nikitich arrived, and the usher, a long-necked and lean\nman, with a sideling gait and protruding lower lip, entered the\njury-room.\n\nThe usher was an honest man, with a university education, but he could\nnot hold any employment on account of his tippling habit. A countess,\nhis wife\'s patroness, had obtained him his present position three\nmonths ago; he still retained it, and was exceedingly glad.\n\n"Are you all here, gentlemen?" he asked, putting on his pince-nez and\nlooking through it.\n\n"I think so," said the cheerful merchant.\n\n"Let us see," said the usher, and drawing a sheet of paper from his\npocket, began to call the names of the jury, looking at those that\nresponded to their names now through his pince-nez, now over it.\n\n"Counsilor of State E. M. Nikiforoff."\n\n"Here," said the portly gentleman, who was familiar with all the\nlitigations.\n\n"Retired Colonel Ivan Semionovich Ivanoff."\n\n"Present," answered a lank man in the uniform of a retired officer.\n\n"Merchant of the second guild, Peter Baklashoff."\n\n"Here," said the good-natured merchant, smiling from ear to ear. "We\nare ready."\n\n"Lieutenant of the Guards, Prince Dmitri Nekhludoff."\n\n"Here," answered Nekhludoff.\n\nThe usher, looking politely and pleasantly through his pince-nez,\nbowed, thereby distinguishing him from the rest, as it were.\n\n"Captain Uri Dmitrievich Danchenko; merchant Gregory Ephimovich\nKouleshoff," etc., etc., etc.\n\nThere were but two missing from the panel.\n\n"You will now, gentlemen, walk into the court," said the usher,\npointing to the door with a polite sweep of the hand.\n\nThey all rose from their seats, and passing each other through the\ndoor, made their way through the corridor to the court-room.\n\nThe court was held in a large, oblong room. At one end was a platform,\nreached by three steps. In the middle of the platform stood a table,\ncovered with green cloth, which was fringed with a dark-green lace.\nBehind the table stood three arm-chairs with high, carved backs. In an\nimage-case suspended in the right corner was a representation of\nChrist with a crown of thorns, and beneath it a reading-desk, and on\nthe same side stood the prosecutor\'s desk. To the left, opposite this\ndesk, was the secretary\'s table, and dividing these from the seats\nreserved for spectators was a carved railing, along which stood the\nprisoners\' bench, as yet unoccupied.\n\nOn an elevation to the right were two rows of chairs, also with high\nbacks, reserved for the jury; below these were tables for the\nattorneys. All this was in the front part of the court-room, which was\ndivided in two by a railing. In the rear part of the room benches in\nlines extended to the wall. In the front row sat four women, either\nservants or factory employees, and two men, also workmen, who were\nevidently awed by the grandeur of the ornamentations, and were timidly\nwhispering to each other.\n\nSoon after the jurymen came the usher, who, walking sidewise to the\nmiddle of the room, shouted, as if he meant to frighten those present:\n\n"The court is coming!"\n\nEverybody stood up, and the judges ascended the platform. First came\nthe presiding judge with his muscles and beautiful whiskers. Then came\nthe gold-spectacled, gloomy member of the court--now even more gloomy,\nfor before the opening of the session he met his brother-in-law, a\ncandidate for a judicial office, who told him that he had seen his\nsister, and that she declared that there would be no dinner at home\nthis day.\n\n"So that, it seems, we will have to dine at an inn," said the\nbrother-in-law, laughing.\n\n"What is there droll about it?" said the gloomy member of the court,\nand sank into a still deeper gloom.\n\nAnd last of all came the third member of the court, that same Matvei\nNikitich, who was always late. He wore a long beard, and had large,\nkindly eyes, with drooping eyelids. He suffered from catarrh of the\nstomach, and by the advice of his physician had adopted a new regimen,\nand this new regimen detained him this morning longer than usual. When\nhe ascended the platform he seemed to be wrapped in thought, but only\nbecause he had the habit of making riddles of every question that\noccurred to him. At this moment he was occupied with the following\nenigmatical proposition:\n\nIf the number of steps in the distance between the cabinet-door and\nthe arm-chair will divide by three without a remainder, then the new\nregimen will cure him; but if it does not so divide, then it will not.\nThere were twenty-six steps, but he made one short step and reached\nthe chair with the twenty-seventh.\n\nAs the judges ascended the elevation in their uniforms, with\ngold-laced collars, they presented an imposing array. They themselves\nfelt it, and all three, as if confused by their own greatness,\nmodestly lowered their eyes, and hastily seated themselves behind the\ntable on which clean paper and freshly-pointed lead pencils of all\nsizes had been placed. The prosecutor, who entered with the judges,\nalso hastily walked to his place near the window, his portfolio still\nunder his arm, and waving his hand he began to read the papers in the\ncase, utilizing every moment to prepare himself.\n\nThis was his fifth case as prosecuting attorney. He was ambitious, and\nwas determined to make his career, and hence he endeavored to obtain\na conviction in every case he prosecuted. He knew the main points of\nthe poisoning case, and had already planned his speech; but he needed\nto know some particulars of which he was now making extracts from the\npapers.\n\nThe secretary sat on the opposite side of the elevation, and, having\nprepared all the papers that might be necessary to produce on trial,\nwas glancing over a newspaper article, which he had obtained and read\nthe day before. He was anxious to talk to the member of the court with\nthe long beard, who shared his views, and before doing so wished to\nbetter familiarize himself with it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nThe presiding justice looked over the papers, asked some questions of\nthe usher, and receiving affirmative answers, ordered that the\nprisoners be brought into court. Immediately a door beyond the grating\nopened, and two gendarmes with unsheathed swords and caps on their\nheads, stepped into the court-room. Behind them came a freckled,\nred-haired man and two women. The man was dressed in prisoner\'s garb\nwhich was too long and too wide for him. As he entered the court-room\nhe held up with outspread fingers the sleeves which were too long.\nWithout looking at the judges or the spectators, his attention was\nabsorbed by the bench around which he was led. When he had passed\naround he carefully seated himself on the edge, and making room for\nthe others, began to stare at the presiding justice, the muscles of\nhis cheeks moving as if he were whispering something. He was followed\nby a middle-aged woman, also dressed in a prisoner\'s coat. A white\nprison cap covered her head; her face was grayish, and her eyes were\ndevoid of either eye-lashes or eyebrows. She seemed quite composed. As\nshe was passing the railing to take her seat, her coat caught at\nsomething; without haste, she carefully disengaged it, then smoothed\nit and took her seat.\n\nThe third prisoner was Maslova.\n\nNo sooner did she enter than all the male spectators turned their\neyes toward her, attracted by her white face, lustrous black eyes and\nhigh breast. Even the gendarme whom she passed gazed at her until she\nseated herself; then, as if feeling himself guilty, he quickly turned\nhis head from her and straightening himself, he began to gaze into the\nwindow directly in front of him.\n\nThe presiding justice waited until all the prisoners took their\nplaces, and as soon as Maslova was seated, he turned to the secretary.\n\nThen commenced the customary proceeding; calling of the jurymen,\nfining the absent ones, listening to the claims of exemption from jury\nduty and filling the panel from a number of reserves. Then the\npresiding justice folded the slips of paper, placed them in a glass\nvase, and turning up his gold-laced sleeve drew the slips one by one,\nunrolled them and read them aloud. Then he straightened his sleeve and\ncalled on the priest to swear in the jury.\n\nAn old little priest with a swollen, pale yellow face, in a brown\ncassock and gold cross on his breast and some small badges pinned to\nthe cassock, slowly moving his swollen feet under the cassock,\napproached the reading desk under the image.\n\nThe jury rose and, crowding each other, came forward.\n\n"Come nearer, please," said the priest, touching with his swollen hand\nthe cross on his breast, and waiting until all the jury were near him.\n\nWhile the jury were mounting the steps to the elevation where the desk\nstood, the priest wriggled his bald, hoary head through the opening of\nthe stole, then rearranging his scanty hair, he turned to the jury:\n\n"Raise your right hands and keep your fingers thus," he said, in a\nslow, feeble voice, raising his bloated hand and pointing at his\nforehead with the first three of its dimpled fingers. "Now repeat\nafter me: \'I promise and swear by the Almighty God, His Holy Gospel,\nand by the life-giving cross of our Lord, that in the case\'"--he\ncontinued, resting after each phrase. "Don\'t drop your hand; hold it\nthus," he turned to a young man who let his hand fall--"\'that in the\ncase which----\'"\n\nThe portly, whiskered gentleman, the colonel, merchant and others\nheld their hands as directed by the priest, and seemed to do so with\nparticular pleasure, holding their hands quite high, and their fingers\nmost proper; others seemed to do it against their will, and\ncarelessly. Some repeated the words too loudly, in a provoking manner,\nwith an expression on the face which seemed to say: "I will repeat as\nI please;" others whispered, fell behind the priest and then, as if\nfrightened, hastened to catch up with him. Some held their fingers\ntightly closed, as if challenging anyone to part them; others, again,\nloosened them, now closed them again. After the jury was sworn, the\npresiding justice directed them to choose a foreman. They arose and,\ncrowding each other, went into the consultation room, where almost\nevery one produced cigarettes and began to smoke. Some one proposed\nthe portly gentleman, who was immediately chosen, then they threw away\ntheir cigarettes and returned to the court. The gentleman declared to\nthe presiding justice that he was chosen foreman, and stepping over\nthe feet of each other, the jury again seated themselves in the two\nrows of high-backed chairs.\n\nEverything proceeded smoothly, quickly and not without solemnity, and\nthe regularity, order and solemnity evidently pleased the\nparticipants, confirming their sense of rendering important public\nservice. Nekhludoff also experienced this feeling.\n\nAs soon as the jury seated themselves the presiding justice instructed\nthem in their rights, duties and responsibilities. While speaking, he\nwas constantly changing his attitude; now he leaned on his right hand,\nnow on his left; then he reclined in his chair, or rested his hands on\nthe arms of the chair, smoothed the corners of the paper on the table,\npolished the paper-knife or clutched the lead pencil.\n\nTheir rights, according to him, consisted in that they were allowed to\nquestion prisoners, through the presiding justice; they might keep\npencils and paper, and might also view exhibits. Their duties\nconsisted in not giving a false verdict. And their responsibilities\nconsisted in that if they failed to keep secret their deliberations,\nor spoke to outsiders, they would be liable to punishment.\n\nThey all listened with respectful attention. The merchant, from whom\nthe fumes of wine spread through the jury box, and who was suppressing\nthe noisy rising of gases in his stomach, approvingly nodded at every\nsentence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nAfter he had finished the instructions, the presiding justice turned\nto the prisoners.\n\n"Simon Kartinkin, rise!" he said.\n\nSimon sprang up nervously. The muscles of his cheeks began to twitch\nstill quicker.\n\n"What is your name?"\n\n"Simon Petroff Kartinkin," he said quickly, in a sharp voice,\nevidently prepared for the question.\n\n"What estate?"\n\n"Peasant."\n\n"What government, district?"\n\n"Government of Tula, district of Krapivensk, Kupian township, village\nof Borki."\n\n"How old are you?"\n\n"Thirty-four; born in eighteen hundred----"\n\n"What faith?"\n\n"Of the Russian orthodox faith."\n\n"Are you married?"\n\n"O, no!"\n\n"What is your occupation?"\n\n"I was employed in the Hotel Mauritania."\n\n"Were you ever arrested before?"\n\n"I was never arrested before, because where I lived----"\n\n"You were not arrested?"\n\n"God forbid! Never!"\n\n"Have you received a copy of the indictment?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Sit down. Euphemia Ivanovna Bochkova!" The presiding justice turned\nto the next prisoner.\n\nBut Simon remained standing in front of Bochkova.\n\n"Kartinkin, sit down!"\n\nKartinkin still remained standing.\n\n"Kartinkin, sit down!"\n\nBut Kartinkin stood still until the usher, his head leaning to the\nside, and with wide-open eyes, whispered to him in a tragic tone:\n\n"Sit down, sit down!"\n\nKartinkin sat down as quickly as he rose, and wrapping himself in his\ncoat began to move his cheeks.\n\n"Your name?" With a sigh of weariness the presiding justice turned to\nthe next prisoner without looking at her, and consulted a paper before\nhim. He was so accustomed to the business that to expedite matters he\ncould try two cases at once.\n\nBochkova was forty-two years old, a burgess of the town of Koloma; by\noccupation a servant--in the same Hotel Mauritania. Was never arrested\nbefore, and had received a copy of the indictment. She gave the\nanswers very boldly and with an intonation which seemed to add to\nevery answer.\n\n"Yes, Bochkova, Euphemia, have received a copy, and am proud of it,\nand will permit no one to laugh at me."\n\nWithout waiting to be told to sit down, Bochkova sat down immediately\nafter the questioning ceased.\n\n"Your name?" asked the presiding justice of the third prisoner. "You\nmust rise," he added, gently and courteously, seeing Maslova still in\nher seat.\n\nWith quick movement Maslova rose with an air of submissiveness, and\nthrowing back her shoulders, looked into the face of the presiding\njustice with her smiling, somewhat squinting black eyes.\n\n"What are you called?"\n\n"They used to call me Lubka," she answered, rapidly.\n\nMeanwhile Nekhludoff put on his pince-nez and examined the prisoners\nwhile they were questioned.\n\n"It is impossible," he thought, looking intently at the prisoner. "But\nher name is Lubka," he thought, as he heard her answer.\n\nThe presiding justice was about to continue his interrogation when the\nmember with the eye-glasses, angrily whispering something, stopped\nhim. The presiding justice nodded his assent and turned to the\nprisoner.\n\n"You say \'Lubka,\' but a different name is entered here."\n\nThe prisoner was silent.\n\n"I ask you what is your real name?"\n\n"What name did you receive at baptism?" asked the angry member.\n\n"Formerly I was called Katherine."\n\n"It is impossible," Nekhludoff continued to repeat, although there was\nno doubt in his mind now that it was she, that same servant ward with\nwhom he had been in love at one time--yes, in love, real love, and\nwhom in a moment of mental fever he led astray, then abandoned, and to\nwhom he never gave a second thought, because the recollection of it\nwas too painful, revealed too manifestly that he, who prided himself\nof his good breeding, not only did not treat her decently, but basely\ndeceived her.\n\nYes, it was she. He saw plainly the mysterious peculiarity that\ndistinguishes every individual from every other individual.\nNotwithstanding the unnatural whiteness and fullness of her face, this\npleasant peculiarity was in the face, in the lips, in the slightly\nsquinting eyes, and, principally, in the naive, smiling glance, and in\nthe expression of submissiveness not only in the face, but in the\nwhole figure.\n\n"You should have said so," again very gently said the presiding\njustice. "What is your patronymic?"\n\n"I am illegitimate," said Maslova.\n\n"But yet you were named after your godfather?"\n\n"Michailova."\n\n"What crime could she have committed?" Nekhludoff thought meanwhile,\nhis breath almost failing him.\n\n"What is your surname--your family name?" continued the presiding\njustice.\n\n"Maslova--after my mother."\n\n"Your estate?"\n\n"Burgess."\n\n"Of the orthodox faith?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Your occupation? What was your occupation?"\n\nMaslova was silent.\n\n"What was your occupation?" repeated the justiciary.\n\n"You know!" said Maslova. She smiled and quickly glanced around, then\nlooked squarely at the justiciary.\n\nThere was something so unusual in the expression of her\nface--something so terrible and piteous in the meaning of her words,\nin that smile, that quick glance which she cast over the\ncourt-room--that the justiciary hung his head, and for a moment there\nwas perfect silence.\n\nA burst of laughter from some spectator interrupted the silence. Some\none hissed. The justiciary raised his head and continued the\ninterrogation.\n\n"Were you ever arrested?"\n\n"No." Maslova said in an undertone, sighing.\n\n"Have you received a copy of the indictment?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Sit down."\n\nThe prisoner raised her skirt with the customary movement of a\nfashionable lady, arranging her train, and sat down, folding her hands\nin the sleeves of her coat, and still looking at the justiciary.\n\nThen began the recounting of witnesses, their removal to a separate\nroom, the decision on the evidence of the medical expert. Then the\nsecretary arose and began to read the indictment, loud and with\ndistinctness, but so rapidly that his incorrect sounding of the\nletters l and r turned his reading into one continuous, weary drone.\nThe judges leaned now on one side, now on the other side of their\narm-chairs, then on the table, and again on the backs of the chairs,\nor closed their eyes, or opened them and whispered to each other. One\nof the gendarmes several times stifled a yawn.\n\nThe convulsions of Kartinkin\'s cheeks did not cease. Bochkova sat\nquietly and erect, now and then scratching with her finger under her\ncap.\n\nMaslova sat motionless, listening to the reading, and looking at the\nclerk; at times she shuddered and made a movement as if desiring to\nobject, blushed, then sighed deeply, changed the position of her\nhands, glanced around and again looked at the clerk.\n\nNekhludoff sat on the high-backed chair in the front row, second to\nthe aisle, and without removing his pince-nez looked at Maslova, while\nhis soul was being racked by a fierce and complicated struggle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nThe indictment read as follows:\n\n"On the 17th of January, 18--, suddenly died in the Hotel Mauritania,\nmerchant of the second guild, Therapont Emelianovich Smelkoff.\n\n"The local police physician certified that the cause of death of said\nSmelkoff was rupture of the heart, caused by excessive use of liquor.\n\n"The body of Smelkoff was interred.\n\n"On the 21st day of January, a townsman and comrade of Smelkoff, on\nreturning from St. Petersburg, and hearing of the circumstances of his\ndeath, declared his suspicion that Smelkoff was poisoned with a view\nof robbing him of the money he carried about his person.\n\n"This suspicion was confirmed at the preliminary inquest, by which it\nwas established: 1. That Smelkoff had drawn from the bank, some time\nbefore his death, three thousand eight hundred rubles; that, after a\ndue and careful inventory of the money of the deceased, only three\nhundred and twelve rubles and sixteen kopecks were found. 2. That the\nentire day and evening preceding his death deceased passed in the\ncompany of a girl named Lubka (Katherine Maslova) in the Hotel\nMauritania, whither said Maslova came at the request of Smelkoff for\nmoney; that she obtained the money from Smelkoff\'s trunk, first\nunlocking it with a key intrusted to her by Smelkoff; that the money\nwas thus taken in the presence of two servants of the said\nhotel--Euphemia Bochkova and Simon Kartinkin; that at the opening of\nsaid trunk by the said Maslova in the presence of the aforementioned\nBochkova and Kartinkin, there were rolls of hundred ruble bills. 3.\nThat on the return of said Smelkoff and Maslova to the said hotel, the\nsaid Maslova, on the advice of the said servant Kartinkin,\nadministered to the deceased a glass of brandy, in which she put a\nwhite powder given her by said Kartinkin. 4. That on the following\nmorning Lubka (Katherine Maslova) sold to her mistress, Rosanova, a\ndiamond ring belonging to Smelkoff, said ring she alleged to have\nbeen presented to her by said Smelkoff. 5. That the servant of said\nHotel Mauritania, Euphemia Bochkova, deposited in her name in the\nlocal Bank of Commerce the sum of eighteen hundred rubles.\n\n"At the autopsy held on the body of Smelkoff, and after the removal of\nthe intestines, the presence of poison was readily discovered, leaving\nno doubt that death was caused by poisoning.\n\n"The prisoners, Maslova, Bochkova and Kartinkin pleaded not guilty.\nMaslova declared that she did go to the Hotel Mauritania, as stated,\nfor the purpose of fetching some money for the merchant, and that\nopening the trunk with the key given to her by the merchant, she took\nonly forty rubles, as she was directed, but took no more, which fact\ncan be substantiated by Bochkova and Kartinkin, in whose presence she\ntook the money and locked the trunk. She further testified that during\nher second visit to the room of the merchant she gave him, at the\ninstigation of Kartinkin, several powders in a glass of brandy, which\nshe considered to be narcotic, in order that she might get away from\nhim. The ring was presented to her by Smelkoff when she cried and was\nabout to leave him after he had beaten her.\n\n"Euphemia Bochkova testified that she knew nothing about the missing\nmoney, never entered the merchant\'s room, which Lubka herself kept in\norder, and that if anything was stolen from the merchant, it was done\nby Lubka when she came to the room for the money."\n\nAt this point Maslova shuddered, and with open mouth looked at\nBochkova.\n\n"And when Euphemia Bochkova was shown her bank account of eighteen\nhundred rubles," continued the secretary, "and asked how she came by\nthe money, she testified that the money was saved from their earnings\nby herself and Simon Kartinkin, whom she intended to marry.\n\n"Simon Kartinkin, on his part, at the first examination, confessed\nthat, at the instigation of Maslova, who brought the key to the trunk,\nhe and Bochkova stole the money, which was afterwards divided between\nthe three."\n\nAt this Maslova shuddered again, sprang to her feet, turned red in\nthe face, and began to say something, but the usher bade her be quiet.\n\n"Finally," continued the secretary, "Kartinkin also confessed to\ngiving Maslova the powders to put the merchant to sleep. On the second\nexamination, however, he denied having either stolen the money, or\ngiven Maslova the powders, but charged Maslova with both. As to the\nmoney placed by Bochkova in the bank, he declared, in accordance with\nBochkova\'s testimony, that they had saved it during their twelve\nyears\' service in the hotel."\n\nThe indictment wound up as follows:\n\n"In view of the aforesaid the defendants, Simon Kartinkin, peasant of\nthe village of Borkoff, thirty-three years of age; burgess Euphemia\nIvanova Bochkova, forty-two years of age, and burgess Katherine\nMaslova, twenty-seven years of age, conspired on the 17th day of\nJanuary, 188-, to administer poison to merchant Smelkoff with intent\nto kill and rob him, and did on said day administer to said Smelkoff\npoison, from which poison the said Smelkoff died, and did thereafter\nrob him of a diamond ring and twenty-five hundred rubles, contrary to\nthe laws in such cases made and provided. Chapter 1453, sections 4 and\n5, Penal Code.\n\n"Wherefore, in accordance with chapter 201 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, the said peasant, Simon Kartinkin, burgess Euphemia\nBochkova and burgess Katherine Maslova are subject to trial by jury,\nthe case being within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court."\n\nThe clerk having finished the reading of the long indictment, folded\nthe papers, seated himself at his desk and began to arrange his long\nhair. Every one present gave a sigh of relief, and with the\nconsciousness that the trial had already begun, everything would be\ncleared up and justice would finally be done, leaned back on their\nchairs.\n\nNekhludoff alone did not experience this feeling. He was absorbed in\nthe horrible thought that the same Maslova, whom he knew as an\ninnocent and beautiful girl ten years ago, could be guilty of such a\ncrime.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nWhen the reading of the indictment was finished, the justiciary,\nhaving consulted with his associates, turned to Kartinkin with an\nexpression on his face which plainly betokened confidence in his\nability to bring forth all the truth.\n\n"Simon Kartinkin," he called, leaning to the left.\n\nSimon Kartinkin rose, put out his chest, incessantly moving his\ncheeks.\n\n"You are charged, together with Euphemia Bochkova and Katherine\nMaslova, with stealing from the trunk of the merchant Smelkoff money\nbelonging to him, and subsequently brought arsenic and induced Maslova\nto administer it to Smelkoff, by reason of which he came to his death.\nAre you guilty or not guilty?" he said, leaning to the right.\n\n"It is impossible, because our business is to attend the guests----"\n\n"You will speak afterwards. Are you guilty or not?"\n\n"No, indeed. I only----"\n\n"You can speak later. Do you admit that you are guilty?" calmly but\nfirmly repeated the justiciary.\n\n"I cannot do it because----"\n\nAgain the usher sprang toward Simon and with a tragic whisper stopped\nhim.\n\nThe justiciary, with an expression showing that the questioning was at\nan end, moved the hand in which he held a document to another place,\nand turned to Euphemia Bochkova.\n\n"Euphemia Bochkova, you, with Kartinkin and Maslova, are charged with\nstealing, on the 17th day of January, 188-, at the Hotel Mauritania,\nfrom the trunk of the merchant Smelkoff, money and a ring, and\ndividing the same among yourselves, and with a view of hiding your\ncrime, administered poison to him, from the effects of which he died.\nAre you guilty?"\n\n"I am not guilty of anything," boldly and firmly answered the\nprisoner. "I never entered the room--and as that scurvy woman did go\ninto the room, she, then, did the business----"\n\n"You will speak afterwards," again said the justiciary, with the same\ngentleness and firmness. "So you are not guilty?"\n\n"I did not take the money, did not give him the poison, did not go\ninto the room. If I were in the room I should have thrown her out."\n\n"You are not guilty, then?"\n\n"Never."\n\n"Very well."\n\n"Katherine Maslova," began the justiciary, turning to the third\nprisoner. "The charge against you is that, having come to the Hotel\nMauritania with the key to Smelkoff\'s trunk, you stole therefrom money\nand a ring," he said, like one repeating a lesson learned by rote, and\nleaning his ear to the associate sitting on his left, who said that he\nnoticed that the phial mentioned in the list of exhibits was missing.\n"Stole therefrom money and a ring," repeated the justiciary, "and\nafter dividing the money again returned with the merchant Smelkoff to\nthe Hotel Mauritania, and there administered to him poison, from the\neffects of which he died. Are you guilty or not guilty?"\n\n"I am not guilty of anything," she answered, quickly. "As I said\nbefore, so I repeat now: I never, never, never took the money; I did\nnot take anything, and the ring he gave me himself."\n\n"You do not plead guilty of stealing twenty-five hundred rubles?" said\nthe justiciary.\n\n"I say I didn\'t take anything but forty rubles."\n\n"And do you plead guilty to the charge of giving the merchant Smelkoff\npowders in his wine?"\n\n"To that I plead guilty. Only I thought, as I was told, that they\nwould put him to sleep, and that no harm could come from them. I did\nnot wish, nor thought of doing him any harm. Before God, I say that I\ndid not," she said.\n\n"So you deny that you are guilty of stealing the money and ring from\nthe merchant Smelkoff," said the justiciary, "but you admit that you\ngave him the powders?"\n\n"Of course, I admit, only I thought that they were sleeping powders.\nI only gave them to him that he might fall asleep--never wished, nor\nthought----"\n\n"Very well," said the justiciary, evidently satisfied with the results\nof the examinations. "Now tell us how it happened," he said, leaning\nhis elbows on the arms of the chair and putting his hands on the\ntable. "Tell us everything. By confessing frankly you will improve\nyour present condition."\n\nMaslova, still looking straight at the justiciary, was silent.\n\n"Tell us what took place."\n\n"What took place?" suddenly said Maslova. "I came to the hotel; I was\ntaken to the room; he was there, and was already very drunk." (She\npronounced the word "he" with a peculiar expression of horror and with\nwide-open eyes.) "I wished to depart; he would not let me."\n\nShe became silent, as if she had lost the thread of the story, or\nthought of something else.\n\n"What then?"\n\n"What then? Then I remained there awhile and went home."\n\nAt this point the assistant public prosecutor half rose from his seat,\nuncomfortably resting on one elbow.\n\n"Do you wish to question the prisoner?" asked the justiciary, and\nreceiving an affirmative answer, motioned his assent.\n\n"I would like to put this question: Has the prisoner been acquainted\nwith Simon Kartinkin before?" asked the assistant prosecutor without\nlooking at Maslova.\n\nAnd having asked the question he pressed his lips and frowned.\n\nThe justiciary repeated the question. Maslova looked with frightened\neyes at the prosecutor.\n\n"With Simon? I was," she said.\n\n"I would like to know now, what was the character of the acquaintance\nthat existed between them. Have they met often?"\n\n"What acquaintance? He invited me to meet guests; there was no\nacquaintance," answered Maslova, throwing restless glances now at the\nprosecutor, now at the justiciary.\n\n"I would like to know why did Kartinkin invite Maslova only, and not\nother girls?" asked the prosecutor, with a Mephistophelian smile,\nwinking his eyes.\n\n"I don\'t know. How can I tell?" answered Maslova, glancing around her,\nfrightened, and for a moment resting her eyes on Nekhludoff. "He\ninvited whomever he wished."\n\n"Is it possible that she recognized me?" Nekhludoff thought, with\nhorror. He felt his blood rising to his head, but Maslova did not\nrecognize him. She turned away immediately, and with frightened eyes\ngazed at the prosecutor.\n\n"Then the prisoner denies that she had intimate relations with\nKartinkin? Very well. I have no more questions to ask."\n\nHe removed his elbow from the desk, and began to make notes. In\nreality, instead of making notes, he merely drew lines across his\nnotes, having seen prosecutors and attorneys, after an adroit\nquestion, making memoranda of questions which were to crush their\nopponents.\n\nThe justiciary did not turn immediately to the prisoner, because he\nwas at the moment asking his associate in the eye-glasses whether he\nconsented to the questions previously outlined and committed to\nwriting.\n\n"What followed?" the justiciary continued.\n\n"I came home," Maslova continued, looking somewhat bolder, "and went\nto sleep. As soon as I was asleep our girl, Bertha, came and woke me.\n\'Your merchant is here again. Wake up.\' Then he"--again she pronounced\nit with evident horror--"he wished to send for wine, but was short of\nmoney. Then he sent me to the hotel, telling me where the money was\nand how much to take, and I went."\n\nThe justiciary was whispering at the time to his associate on the\nleft, and did not listen to Maslova, but to make it appear that he had\nheard everything he repeated her last words.\n\n"And you went. Well, what else?" he asked.\n\n"I came there and did as he told me. I went to his room. I did not\nenter it alone, but called Simon Michaelovich and her," she said,\npointing to Bochkova.\n\n"She lies; I never entered----" Bochkova began, but she was stopped.\n\n"In their presence I took four ten ruble bills," she continued.\n\n"And while taking this money, did the prisoner see how much money\nthere was?" asked the prosecutor.\n\nMaslova shuddered as soon as the prosecutor began to speak. She could\nnot tell why, but she felt that he was her enemy.\n\n"I did not count it, but I saw that it was all hundred ruble bills."\n\n"The prisoner saw hundred ruble bills. I have no other questions."\n\n"Well, did you bring back the money?" asked the justiciary, looking at\nthe clock.\n\n"I did."\n\n"Well, what then?"\n\n"Then he again took me with him," said Maslova.\n\n"And how did you give him the powder in the wine?" asked the\njusticiary.\n\n"How? Poured it into the wine and gave it to him."\n\n"Why did you give it to him?"\n\nWithout answering, she sighed deeply. After a short silence she said:\n\n"He would not let me go. He exhausted me. I went into the corridor and\nsaid to Simon Michaelovich: \'If he would only let me go; I am so\ntired.\' And Simon Michaelovich said: \'We are also tired of him. We\nintend to give him sleeping powders. When he is asleep you can go.\'\n\'All right,\' I said. I thought that it was a harmless powder. He gave\nme a package. I entered. He lay behind the partition, and ordered me\nto bring him some brandy. I took from the table a bottle of\nfeen-champagne, poured into two glasses--for myself and him--threw the\npowder into his glass and handed it to him. I would not have given it\nto him if I had known it."\n\n"And how did you come by the ring?" asked the justiciary.\n\n"He presented it to me."\n\n"When did he present it to you?"\n\n"When we reached his room. I wished to depart. Then he struck me on\nthe head and broke my comb. I was angered, and wished to go. Then he\ntook the ring from his finger and gave it to me, asking me to stay,"\nshe said.\n\nHere the assistant prosecutor again rose, and with a dissimulating\nnaiveness asked permission to ask a few more questions, which was\ngranted, and leaning his head on his gold-embroidered collar, he\nasked:\n\n"I would like to know how long was the prisoner in the room with\nSmelkoff?"\n\nMaslova was again terror-stricken, and with her frightened eyes\nwandering from the prosecutor to the justiciary, she answered,\nhurriedly:\n\n"I do not remember how long."\n\n"And does the prisoner remember entering another part of the hotel\nafter she had left Smelkoff?"\n\nMaslova was thinking.\n\n"Into the next room--an empty one," she said.\n\n"Why did you enter that room?" said the assistant prosecutor,\nimpulsively.\n\n"To wait for a cabriolet."\n\n"Was not Kartinkin in the room with the prisoner?"\n\n"He also came in."\n\n"Why did he come in?"\n\n"There was the merchant\'s feen-champagne left, and we drank it\ntogether."\n\n"Oh, drank together. Very well."\n\n"And did the prisoner have any conversation with Simon, and what was\nthe subject of the conversation?"\n\nMaslova suddenly frowned, her face turned red, and she quickly\nanswered:\n\n"What I said? I know nothing more. Do what you please with me. I am\ninnocent, and that is all. I did not say anything. I told everything\nthat happened."\n\n"I have no more questions to ask," said the prosecutor to the court,\nand uplifting his shoulders he began to add to the memorandums of his\nspeech that the prisoner herself confessed to entering an empty room\nwith Simon.\n\nThere was a short silence.\n\n"Have you anything else to say?"\n\n"I have told everything," she said, sighing, and took her seat.\n\nThe justiciary then made some notes, and after he had listened to a\nsuggestion whispered by the associate on the left, declared a recess\nof ten minutes, and, hastily rising, walked out of the court-room.\n\nAfter the judges had risen, the jury, lawyers and witness also rose,\nand with the pleasant feeling of having already performed part of an\nimportant work, began to move hither and thither.\n\nNekhludoff walked into the jury-room and took a seat near the window.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nYes, it was Katiousha.\n\nThe relations of Nekhludoff to Katiousha were the following:\n\nNekhludoff first met Katiousha when he went to stay one summer out at\nthe estate of his aunts in order that he might quietly prepare his\nthesis on the private ownership of land. Ordinarily he lived on the\nestate of his mother, near Moskow, with his mother and sister. But\nthat year his sister married, and his mother went abroad. Nekhludoff\nhad to write a composition in the course of his university studies,\nand decided to pass the summer at his aunts\'. There in the woods it\nwas quiet, and there was nothing to distract him from his studies.\nBesides, the aunts loved their nephew and heir, and he loved them,\nloved their old-fashioned way of living.\n\nDuring that summer Nekhludoff experienced that exaltation which youth\ncomes to know not by the teaching of others, but when it naturally\nbegins to recognize the beauty and importance of life, and man\'s\nserious place in it; when it sees the possibility of infinite\nperfection of which the world is capable, and devotes itself to that\nendeavor, not only with the hope, but with a full conviction of\nreaching that perfection which it imagines possible. While in the\nuniversity he had that year read Spencer\'s Social Statics, and\nSpencer\'s reasoning bearing on private ownership of land produced a\nstrong impression on him, especially because he was himself the son of\na landed proprietress. His father was not rich, but his mother\nreceived as her marriage portion ten thousand acres of land. He then\nfor the first time understood all the injustice of private ownership\nof land, and being one of those to whom any sacrifice in the name of\nmoral duty was a lofty spiritual enjoyment, he forthwith divided the\nland he had inherited from his father among the peasants. On this\nsubject he was then composing a disquisition.\n\nHis life on the estate of his aunts was ordered in the following way:\nHe rose very early, some times at three o\'clock, and till sunrise\nbathed in the river under a hill, often in the morning mist, and\nreturned when the dew was yet on the grass and flowers. Some mornings\nhe would, after partaking of coffee, sit down to write his\ncomposition, or read references bearing on the subject. But, above\nall, he loved to ramble in the woods. Before dinner he would lie down\nin the woods and sleep; then, at dinner, he made merry, jesting with\nhis aunts; then went out riding or rowing. In the evening he read\nagain, or joined his aunts, solving riddles for them. On moonlit\nnights he seldom slept, because of the immense joy of life that\npervaded him, and instead of sleeping, he sometimes rambled in the\ngarden till daylight, absorbed in his thoughts and phantasies.\n\nThus he lived happily the first month under the roof of his aunts\'\ndwelling, paying no attention to the half-servant, half-ward, the\nblack-eyed, nimble-footed Katiousha.\n\nNekhludoff, raised under the protecting wing of his mother, was at\nnineteen a perfectly innocent youth. He dreamed of woman, but only as\nwife. All those women who, according to his view, could not be\nconsidered as likely to become his wife, were to him not women, but\npeople. But it happened on Ascension Day that there was visiting his\naunts a lady from the neighborhood with her two young daughters, her\nson and a local artist who was staying with them.\n\nAfter tea had been served the entire company, as usual, repaired to\nthe meadow, where they played blind man\'s buff. Katiousha went with\nthem. After some exchanges came Nekhludoff\'s turn to run with\nKatiousha. Nekhludoff always liked to see Katiousha, but it had never\noccurred to him that their relations could ever be any but the most\nformal.\n\n"It will be difficult to catch them now," said the cheerful artist,\nwhose short and curved legs carried him very swiftly, "unless they\nstumble."\n\n"You could not catch them."\n\n"One, two, three!"\n\nThey clapped their hands three times. Almost bursting into laughter,\nKatiousha quickly changed places with Nekhludoff, and pressing with\nher strong, rough little hand his large hand she ran to the left,\nrustling her starched skirt.\n\nNekhludoff was a swift runner; he wished to out-distance the artist,\nand ran with all his might. As he turned around he saw the artist\ncatching up with Katiousha, but with her supple limbs she gained on\nhim and ran to the left. In front of them was a patch of lilac bushes,\nbehind which no one ran, but Katiousha, turning toward Nekhludoff,\nmotioned him with her head to join her there. He understood her, and\nran behind the bushes. But here was a ditch overgrown with nettles,\nwhose presence was unknown to Nekhludoff. He stumbled and fell,\nstinging and wetting his hands in the evening dew that was now\nfalling, but, laughing, he straightened himself and ran into the open.\n\nKatiousha, her black eyes beaming with joy, ran toward him. They met\nand caught each others\' hands.\n\n"You were stung by the nettles, I suppose," she said, arranging with\nher free hand her loosened braid, breathing heavily, and looking up\ninto his eyes.\n\n"I did not know there was a ditch," he said, also smiling, and still\nkeeping her hand in his.\n\nShe advanced a little, and he, without being able to account for it,\ninclined his face toward hers. She did not draw back. He pressed her\nhand and kissed her on the lips.\n\nShe uttered an exclamation, and with a swift movement, releasing her\nhand, she ran in the direction of the crowd.\n\nPlucking two lilac twigs from the lilac bush, fanning her flushed face\nwith them, and glancing around toward him, she ran to the players,\nbriskly waving her hands.\n\nFrom this day on the relations between Nekhludoff and Katiousha were\nchanged, and there were established between them those peculiar\nrelations which are customary between two innocent young people who\nare attached to each other.\n\nAs soon as Katiousha entered the room, or even when Nekhludoff saw her\nwhite apron from afar, everything became immediately as if lit by the\nsun; everything became more interesting, more cheerful, more\nimportant; life became more joyful. She experienced the same feeling.\nBut not alone the presence and proximity of Katiousha had such effect\nupon Nekhludoff; the very thought of her existence had the same power\nupon him as that of his had upon her. Whether he received an\nunpleasant letter from his mother, or was backward in his composition,\nor felt the ceaseless sadness of youth, it would suffice for him to\nsee her and his spirit resumed its wonted good cheer.\n\nKatiousha had to do all the housework, but she managed to do her duty\nand found spare time for reading. He gave her the works of Dostoievsky\nand Tourgenieff to read. Those descriptive of the beauties of nature\nshe liked best. Their conversations were but momentary, when they met\nin the corridor, on the veranda, in the court-yard, or in the room of\nthe aunts\' old servant, Matriena Pavlovna, with whom Katiousha roomed,\nor in the servants\' chamber, whither Nekhludoff sometimes went to\ndrink tea. And these conversations in the presence of Matriena\nPavlovna were the pleasantest. When they were alone their conversation\nflagged. Then the eyes would speak something different, more\nimportant, than the mouth; the lips were drawn up, they felt\nuncomfortable, and quickly parted.\n\nThese relations continued during the time of his first visit to his\naunts. The aunts noticed them, were dismayed, and immediately wrote to\nthe Princess Elena Ivanovna, Nekhludoff\'s mother. But their anxiety\nwas unfounded; Nekhludoff, without knowing it, loved Katiousha, as\ninnocent people love, and this very love was the principal safeguard\nagainst either his or her fall. Not only did he not desire to possess\nher physically, but the very thought of such relation horrified him.\nThere was more reason in the poetical Sophia Ivanovna\'s fear that\nNekhludoff\'s having fallen in love with a girl, might take a notion to\nmarry her without regard to her birth or station.\n\nIf Nekhludoff were clearly conscious of his love for Katiousha;\nespecially if it were sought to persuade him that he could and must\nnot link his fate to that of the girl, he would very likely have\ndecided in his plumb-line mind that there was no reason why he should\nnot marry her, no matter who she was, provided he loved her. But the\naunts did not speak of their fears, and he departed without knowing\nthat he was enamored of Katiousha.\n\nHe was certain that his feeling toward Katiousha was but a\nmanifestation of that joy which pervaded his entire being, and which\nwas shared by that lovely, cheerful girl. However, when he was taking\nleave, and Katiousha, standing on the veranda with the aunts, followed\nhim with her black, tearful and somewhat squinting eyes, he felt that\nhe was leaving behind him something beautiful, precious, which would\nnever recur. And he became very sad.\n\n"Good-by, Katiousha. I thank you for everything," he said, over the\ncap of Sophia Ivanovna, and seated himself in the cabriolet.\n\n"Good-by, Dmitri Ivanovich," she said, in her pleasant, caressing\nvoice, and holding back the tears which filled her eyes, ran into her\nroom, where she could cry freely.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nFor three years afterward Nekhludoff did not see Katiousha. But when,\nas staff-officer, he was on his way to his army post, he paid a short\nvisit to his aunts, but an entirely different man. Three years ago he\nwas an honest, self-denying youth, ready to devote himself to every\ngood cause; now he was a corrupt and refined egotist, given over to\npersonal enjoyment. Then, the world appeared to him as a mystery which\nhe joyfully and enthusiastically tried to solve; now, everything in\nthis world was plain and simple, and was determined by those\nconditions of life in which he found himself. Then, it was necessary\nand important to hold communion with nature and with those people who\nlived, thought and felt before him (philosophers, poets); now, human\ninstitutions were the only things necessary and important, and\ncommunion he held with his comrades. Woman, then, appeared to him a\nmysterious and charming creature; now, he looked on woman, on every\nwoman, except nearest relations and wives of friends, as a means of\ngratifying now tried pleasures. Then, he needed no money, and wanted\nnot a third part what his mother gave him, disclaimed title to his\nfather\'s land, distributing it among the peasants; now, the fifteen\nhundred rubles\' monthly allowance he received from his mother did not\nsuffice for his needs, and he often made it the cause of unpleasant\nconversation with her. His true self he then considered his spiritual\nbeing; now, his healthy, vigorous, animal self was his true ego.\n\nAnd all this terrible transformation took place in him only because he\nceased to have faith in himself, and began to believe in others. To\nlive according to the faith that was in him was burdensome; every\nquestion would have to be decided almost always against his animal\nego, which was seeking light pleasures; but reposing his faith in\nothers, there remained nothing to decide, everything having been\ndecided, and decided always against the spiritual and in favor of the\nanimal ego. Besides, following his inner faith, he was always subject\nto the censure of people; in the other case he received the approval\nof the people that surrounded him.\n\nThus, when Nekhludoff was thinking, reading, speaking of God, of\ntruth, of wealth, of poverty, everybody considered it out of place and\nsomewhat queer, while his mother and aunt, with good-natured irony,\ncalled him notre cher philosophe. When, however, he was reading\nnovels, relating indecent anecdotes or seeing droll vaudevilles in the\nFrench theatre, and afterward merrily repeated them, everybody praised\nand encouraged him. When he considered it necessary to curtail his\nneeds, wore an old coat and gave up wine-drinking, everybody\nconsidered it eccentric and vain originality; but when he spent large\nsums in organizing a chase, or building an unusual, luxurious cabinet,\neverybody praised his taste and sent him valuable gifts. When he was\nchaste, and wished to preserve his chastity till marriage, his\nrelatives were anxious about his health, and his mother, so far from\nbeing mortified, rather rejoiced when she learned that he had become a\nreal man, and had enticed the French mistress of some friend of his.\nAs to the Katiousha episode--that the thought might occur to him of\nmarrying her, she could not even think of without horror.\n\nSimilarly, when Nekhludoff, on reaching his majority, distributed the\nestate he inherited from his father among the peasants, because he\nconsidered the ownership of land unjust, this act of his horrified his\nmother and relatives, who constantly reproached and ridiculed him for\nit. He was told unceasingly that so far from enriching it only\nimpoverished the peasants, who opened three liquor stores and stopped\nworking entirely. When, however, Nekhludoff joined the Guards, and\nspent and gambled away so much money that Elena Ivanovna had to draw\nfrom her capital, she scarcely grieved, considering it quite natural\nand even beneficial to be thus inoculated when young and in good\nsociety.\n\nNekhludoff at first struggled, but the struggle was very hard, for\nwhatever he did, following the faith that was in him, was considered\nwrong by others, and, contrariwise, whatever he considered wrong was\napproved of by his relatives. The result was that Nekhludoff ceased to\nhave faith in himself and began to follow others. At first this\nrenunciation of self was unpleasant, but it was short lived, and\nNekhludoff, who now began to smoke and drink wine, soon ceased to\nexperience this unpleasant feeling, and was even greatly relieved.\n\nPassionate by nature, Nekhludoff gave himself up entirely to this new\nlife, approved of by all those that surrounded him, and completely\nstifled in himself that voice which demanded something different. It\ncommenced with his removal to St. Petersburg, and ended with his entry\nupon active service.\n\nDuring this period of his life Nekhludoff felt the ecstasy of freedom\nfrom all those moral impediments which he had formerly placed before\nhimself, and continued in a chronic condition of insane egotism.\n\nHe was in this condition when, three years afterward, he visited his\naunts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\nNekhludoff called at his aunts because their manor lay on the road\nthrough which his regiment had preceded him, and also because they\nrequested him to do so, but principally in order that he might see\nKatiousha. It may be that in the depth of his soul there was already a\nmischievous intention toward Katiousha, prompted by his now unbridled\nanimal ego, but he was not aware of it, he merely desired to visit\nthose places in which he lived so happily, and see his somewhat queer,\nbut amiable and good-natured, aunts, who always surrounded the\natmosphere around him with love and admiration, and also to see the\nlovely Katiousha, of whom he had such pleasant recollections.\n\nHe arrived toward the end of March, on Good Friday, in the season of\nbad roads, when the rain was falling in torrents, and was wet all\nthrough, and chilled to the marrow of his bones, but courageous and\nexcited, as he always felt at that time of the year.\n\n"I wonder if she is still there?" he thought, as he drove into the\nfamiliar court-yard of the old manor, which was covered with snow that\nfell from the roofs, and was surrounded by a low brick wall. He\nexpected that the ringing of the bell would bring her running to meet\nhim, but on the perron of the servants\' quarters appeared two\nbare-footed women with tucked-up skirts, carrying buckets, who were\napparently scrubbing floors. She was not on the front perron, either;\nonly Timon, the lackey, came forth in an apron, also apparently\noccupied with cleaning. Sophia Ivanovna came into the ante-chamber,\nattired in a silk dress and cap.\n\n"How glad I am that you came!" said Sophia Ivanovna. "Masheuka[B] is\nsomewhat ill. We were to church, receiving the sacrament. She is very\ntired."\n\n"I congratulate you, Aunt Sonia,"[C] said Nekhludoff, kissing the hand\nof Sophia Ivanovna. "Pardon me, I have soiled you."\n\n"Go to your room. You are wet all through. Oh, what a mustache!\nKatiousha! Katiousha! Bring him some coffee quickly."\n\n"All right!" responded a familiar, pleasant voice. Nekhludoff\'s heart\nfluttered. "She is here!" To him it was like the sun rising from\nbehind the clouds, and he cheerfully went with Timon to his old room\nto change his clothing.\n\nNekhludoff wished to ask Timon about Katiousha. Was she well? How did\nshe fare? Was she not engaged to be married? But Timon was so\nrespectful, and at the same time so rigid; he so strictly insisted on\nhimself pouring the water from the pitcher over Nekhludoff\'s hands,\nthat the latter could not decide to ask him about Katiousha, and only\ninquired about his grand-children, about the old stallion, about the\nwatch-dog Polkan. They were all well, except Polkan, who had gone mad\nthe previous year.\n\nAfter he had thrown off his wet clothes, and as he was about to dress\nhimself, Nekhludoff heard quick steps and a rapping at the door. He\nrecognized both the steps and the rapping. Only _she_ walked and\nrapped thus.\n\nIt was Katiousha--the same Katiousha--only more lovely than before.\nThe naive, smiling, somewhat squinting black eyes still looked up; she\nwore a clean white apron, as before. She brought a perfumed piece of\nsoap, just taken from the wrapper, and two towels--one Russian and the\nother Turkish. The freshly unpacked soap, the towels and she herself,\nwere all equally clean, fresh, pure and pleasant. The lovely, firm,\nred lips became creased from unrestrainable happiness at sight of him.\n\n"How do you do, Dmitri Ivanovich?" she said, with difficulty, her face\nbecoming flushed.\n\n"How art--how are you?" He did not know whether to "thou" her or not,\nand became as red in the face as she was.[D] "Are you well?"\n\n"Very well. Your aunt sent you your favorite soap, rose-scented," she\nsaid, placing the soap on the table, and the towels on the arms of the\nchair.\n\n"The gentleman has his own," Timon stood up for the independence of\nthe guest, proudly pointing to the open traveling bag with silver\nlids, containing a large number of bottles, brushes, perfumes and all\nsorts of toilet articles.\n\n"My thanks to auntie. But how glad I am that I came," said Nekhludoff,\nfeeling the old brightness and emotions recurring to his soul.\n\nIn answer to this she only smiled and left the room.\n\nThe aunts, who always loved Nekhludoff, received him this time with\ngreater joy than usual. Dmitri was going to active service, where he\nmight be wounded or killed. This affected the aunts.\n\nNekhludoff had arranged his trip so that he might spend twenty-four\nhours with his aunts, but, seeing Katiousha, decided to remain over\nEaster Sunday, which was two days later, and wired to his friend and\ncommander Shenbok, whom he was to meet at Odessa, to come to his\naunts.\n\nFrom the very first day Nekhludoff experienced the old feeling toward\nKatiousha. Again he could not see without agitation the white apron of\nKatiousha; he could not listen without joy to her steps, her voice,\nher laugh; he could not, without emotion, look into her black eyes,\nespecially when she smiled; he could not, above all, see, without\nconfusion, how she blushed when they met. He felt that he was in love,\nbut not as formerly, when this love was to him a mystery, and he had\nnot the courage to confess it to himself; when he was convinced that\none can love only once. Now he loved knowingly, rejoiced at it, and\nconfusedly knowing, though he concealed it from himself, what it\nconsisted of, and what might come of it.\n\nIn Nekhludoff, as in all people, there were two beings; one spiritual,\nwho sought only such happiness for himself as also benefited others;\nand the animal being, seeking his own happiness for the sake of which\nhe is willing to sacrifice that of the world. During this period of\nhis insane egotism, called forth by the life in the army and in St.\nPetersburg, the animal man dominated him and completely suppressed the\nspiritual man. But, seeing Katiousha, and being again imbued with the\nfeelings he formerly experienced toward her, the spiritual man raised\nhis head and began to assert his rights. And during the two days\npreceding Easter an incessant struggle was going on within Nekhludoff\nof which he was quite unconscious.\n\nIn the depth of his soul he knew that he had to depart; that his stay\nat his aunts was unnecessary, that nothing good could come of it, but\nit was so joyous and pleasant that he did not heed it, and remained.\n\nOn the eve of Easter Sunday, the priest and deacon who, as they\nafterward related, with difficulty covered the three miles from the\nchurch to the aunts\' manor, arrived on a sleigh to perform the morning\nservices.\n\nNekhludoff, with his aunts and the servants, went through the motions,\nwithout ceasing to look on Katiousha, who brought a censer and was\nstanding at the door; then, in the customary fashion, kissed the\npriest and the aunts, and was about to retire to his room when he\nheard Matriena Pavlovna, the old servant of Maria Ivanovna, making\npreparations with Katiousha to go to church and witness the\nconsecration of the paschal bread. "I will go there, too," he thought.\n\nThere was no wagon or sleigh road to the church, so Nekhludoff gave\ncommand, as he would in his own house, to have a horse saddled, and,\ninstead of going to bed, donned a brilliant uniform and tight\nknee-breeches, threw on his military coat, and, mounting the snorting\nand constantly neighing, heavy stallion, he drove off to the church in\nthe dark, over pools and snow mounds.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote B: Diminutive of Maria.]\n\n[Footnote C: Diminutive of Sophia.]\n\n[Footnote D: The Russian thou cannot be rendered into English with any\ndegree of accuracy. The greeting to which the impulsive Nekhludoff was\nabout to give expression is that used toward a beloved person.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nThat morning service formed the brightest and most impressive\nreminiscence of Nekhludoff\'s after life.\n\nThe darkness of the night was only relieved here and there by white\npatches of snow, and as the stallion, splashing through the mud-pools,\nand his ears pricked up at the sight of the fire-pots surrounding the\nchurch, entered its inclosure, the service had already begun.\n\nThe peasants, recognizing Maria Ivanovna\'s nephew, led his horse to\nthe driest spot, where he dismounted, then they escorted him to the\nchurch filled with a holiday crowd.\n\nTo the right were the male peasants; old men in homespun coats and\nbast shoes, and young men in new cloth caftans, bright-colored belts\nand boots. To the left the women, with red silk \'kerchiefs on their\nheads, shag caftans with bright red sleeves, and blue, green, red,\nstriped and dotted skirts and iron-heeled shoes. Behind them stood the\nmore modest women in white \'kerchiefs and gray caftans and ancient\nskirts, in shoes or bast slippers. Among these and the others were\ndressed-up children with oiled hair. The peasants made the sign of the\ncross and bowed, disheveling their hair; the women, especially the old\nwomen, gazing with their lustreless eyes on one image, before which\ncandles burned, pressed hard with the tips of their fingers on the\n\'kerchief of the forehead, the shoulders and the abdomen, and,\nmumbling something, bent forward standing, or fell on their knees. The\nchildren, imitating their elders, prayed fervently when they were\nlooked at. The gold iconostasis was aflame with innumerable candles,\nwhich surrounded a large one in the centre wound in a narrow strip of\ngilt paper. The church lustre was dotted with candles, joyful melodies\nof volunteer singers with roaring bass and piercing contralto mingled\nwith the chant of the choir.\n\nNekhludoff went forward. In the middle of the church stood the\naristocracy; a country squire with his wife and son in a sailor\nblouse, the commissary of the rural police, a telegraph operator, a\nmerchant in high boots, the local syndic with a medal on his breast,\nand to the right of the tribune, behind the squire\'s wife, Matriena\nPavlovna, in a lilac-colored chatoyant dress and white shawl with\ncolored border, and beside her was Katiousha in a white dress,\ngathered in folds at the waist, a blue belt, and a red bow in her\nblack hair.\n\nEverything was solemn, joyous and beautiful; the priest in his bright,\nsilver chasuble, dotted with gilt crosses, the deacon, the chanters in\nholiday surplice of gold and silver, the spruce volunteer singers with\noiled hair, the joyous melodies of holiday songs, the ceaseless\nblessing of the throng by the priests with flower-bedecked tern\ncandles with the constantly repeated exclamations: "Christ has risen!\nChrist has risen!" Everything was beautiful, but more beautiful than\nall was Katiousha, in her white dress, blue belt and red bow in her\nhair, and her eyes radiant with delight.\n\nNekhludoff felt that she saw him without turning round. He saw it\nwhile passing near her to the altar. He had nothing to tell her, but\ntried to think of something, and said, when passing her:\n\n"Auntie said that she would receive the sacrament after mass."\n\nHer young blood, as it always happened when she looked at him, rose to\nher cheeks, and her black eyes, naively looking up, fixed themselves\non Nekhludoff.\n\n"I know it," she said, smiling.\n\nAt that moment a chanter with a copper coffee-pot in his hand passed\nclose to Katiousha, and, without looking at her, grazed her with the\nskirt of the surplice. The chanter, evidently out of respect for\nNekhludoff, wished to sweep around him, and thus it happened that he\ngrazed Katiousha.\n\nNekhludoff, however, was surprised that that chanter did not\nunderstand that everything in the church, and in the whole world, for\nthat matter, existed only for Katiousha, and that one might spurn the\nentire world, but must not slight her, because she was the centre of\nit. It was for her that the gold iconostasis shone brightly, and these\ncandles in the church-lustre burned; for her were the joyful chants:\n"Be happy, man; it is the Lord\'s Easter." All the good in the world\nwas for her. And it seemed to him that Katiousha understood that all\nthis was for her. It seemed to Nekhludoff, when he looked at her erect\nfigure in the white dress with little folds at the waist, and by the\nexpression of her happy face, that the very thing that filled his soul\nwith song, also filled hers.\n\nIn the interval between early and late mass Nekhludoff left the\nchurch. The people made way for him and bowed. Some recognized him;\nothers asked: "Who is he?" He stopped at the porch. Beggars surrounded\nhim, and, distributing such change as he had in his pocket, he\ndescended the stairs.\n\nThe day began to break, but the sun was yet beyond the horizon. The\npeople seated themselves on the grass around the church-yard, but\nKatiousha remained in the church, and Nekhludoff waited on the porch\nfor her appearance.\n\nThe crowd was still pouring out of the church, their hob-nailed shoes\nclattering against the stone pavement, and spread about the cemetery.\n\nAn old man, confectioner to Maria Ivanovna, stopped Nekhludoff and\nkissed him, and his wife, an old woman with a wrinkled Adam\'s apple\nunder a silk \'kerchief, unrolled a yellow saffron egg from her\nhandkerchief and gave it to him. At the same time a young, smiling and\nmuscular peasant, in a new caftan, approached.\n\n"Christ has risen!" he said, with smiling eyes and, nearing\nNekhludoff, spread around him a peculiar, pleasant, peasant odor, and,\ntickling him with his curly beard, three times kissed him on the lips.\n\nWhile Nekhludoff was thus exchanging the customary kisses with the\npeasant and taking from him a dark-brown egg, he noticed the chatoyant\ndress of Matriena Pavlovna and the lovely head with the red bow.\n\nNo sooner did she catch sight of him over the heads of those in front\nof her, than her face brightened up.\n\nOn reaching the porch they also stopped, distributing alms. One of the\nbeggars, with a red, cicatrized slough instead of a nose, approached\nKatiousha. She produced some coins from her handkerchief, gave them to\nhim, and without the slightest expression of disgust, but, on the\ncontrary, her eyes beaming with delight, kissed him three times. While\nshe was thus kissing with the beggar, her eyes met those of\nNekhludoff, and she seemed to ask him: "Is it not right? Is it not\nproper?"\n\n"Yes, yes, darling; it is right; everything is beautiful. I love you."\n\nAs they descended the stairs he came near her. He did not wish to kiss\nher, but merely wished to be by her side.\n\n"Christ has risen!" said Matriena Pavlovna, leaning her head forward\nand smiling. By the intonation of her voice she seemed to say, "All\nare equal to-day," and wiping her mouth with a bandana handkerchief\nwhich she kept under her arm-pit, she extended her lips.\n\n"He has risen, indeed," answered Nekhludoff, and they kissed each\nother.\n\nHe turned to look at Katiousha. She flushed and at the same moment\napproached him.\n\n"Christ has risen, Dmitri Ivanovich."\n\n"He has risen, indeed," he said. They kissed each other twice, and\nseemed to be reflecting whether or not it was necessary to kiss a\nthird time, and having decided, as it were, that it was necessary,\nthey kissed again.\n\n"Will you go to the priest?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"No, we will stay here, Dmitri Ivanovich," answered Katiousha,\nlaboriously, as though after hard, pleasant exertion, breathing with\nher full breast and looking straight in his eyes, with her submissive,\nchaste, loving and slightly squinting eyes.\n\nThere is a point in the love between man and woman when that love\nreaches its zenith; when it is free from consciousness, reason and\nsensuality. Such a moment arrived for Nekhludoff that Easter morn.\n\nNow, whenever he thought of Katiousha, her appearance at that moment\nobscured every other recollection of her. The dark, smooth,\nresplendent head; the white dress with folds clinging to her graceful\nbust and undulating breast; those vermilion cheeks, those brilliant\nblack eyes, and two main traits in all her being: the virgin purity of\nher love, not only for himself, but for everything and everybody--he\nknew it--not only the good and beautiful, but even that beggar whom\nshe had kissed.\n\nHe knew that she possessed that love, because that night and that\nmorning he felt it within him, and felt that in that love his soul\nmingled into one with hers.\n\nAh, if that feeling had continued unchanged! "Yes, that awful affair\noccurred after that notable commemoration of Christ\'s resurrection!"\nhe thought now, sitting at the window of the jury-room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nReturning from the church, Nekhludoff broke his fast with the aunts,\nand to repair his strength, drank some brandy and wine--a habit he\nacquired in the army--and going to his room immediately fell asleep\nwith his clothes on. He was awakened by a rap at the door. By the rap\nhe knew that it was she, so he rose, rubbing his eyes and stretching\nhimself.\n\n"Is it you, Katiousha? Come in," he said, rising.\n\nShe opened the door.\n\n"You are wanted to breakfast," she said. She was in the same white\ndress, but without the bow in her hair.\n\nAs she looked in his eyes she brightened up, as if she had announced\nsomething unusually pleasant.\n\n"I shall come immediately," he answered, taking a comb to rearrange\nhis hair.\n\nShe lingered for a moment. He noticed it, and putting down the comb,\nhe moved toward her. But at the same moment she quickly turned and\nwalked off with her customary light and agile step along the narrow\nmat of the corridor.\n\n"What a fool I am!" Nekhludoff said to himself. "Why did I not detain\nher?" And he ran after her.\n\nHe did not know himself what he wished of her, but it seemed to him\nthat when she entered his room he ought to have done something that\nany one in his place would have done, but which he failed to do.\n\n"Wait, Katiousha," he said.\n\nShe looked around.\n\n"What is it?" she said, stopping.\n\n"Nothing. I only----"\n\nWith some effort he overcame his shyness, and remembering how people\ngenerally act in such a case, he put his arm about Katiousha\'s waist.\n\nShe stopped and looked in his eyes.\n\n"Don\'t, Ivanovich, don\'t," she said, blushing until her eyes filled\nwith tears. Then with her rough, strong hands she removed his arm.\n\nNekhludoff released her, and for a moment felt not only awkward and\nashamed, but seemed odious to himself. He should have believed in\nhimself, but he failed to understand that this awkwardness and shame\nwere the noblest feelings of his soul begging for recognition, and, on\nthe contrary, it seemed to him that it was his foolishness that was\nspeaking within him, that he ought to have done as everybody does in a\nsimilar case.\n\nHe overtook her again, again embraced her and kissed her on the neck.\nThis kiss was entirely unlike the other two kisses. The first was\ngiven unconsciously, behind the lilac bush; the second, in the morning\nin church. The last one was terrible, and she felt it.\n\n"But what are you doing?" she exclaimed in such a voice, as if he had\nirrecoverably destroyed something infinitely precious, and ran away\nfrom him.\n\nHe went to the dining-room. His aunts in holiday attire, the doctor\nand a neighbor were taking lunch standing. Everything was as usual,\nbut a storm raged in Nekhludoff\'s soul. He did not understand what was\nsaid to him, his answers were inappropriate, and he was thinking only\nof Katiousha, recalling the sensation of the last kiss he gave her\nwhen he overtook her in the corridor. He could think of nothing else.\nWhen she entered the room, without looking at her, he felt her\npresence with all his being, and had to make an effort not to look at\nher.\n\nAfter lunch he went immediately to his room, and in great agitation\nwalked to and fro, listening to the sounds in the house and waiting to\nhear her steps. The animal man that dwelled in him not only raised his\nhead, but crushed under foot the spiritual man that he was when he\nfirst arrived at the manor, and was even this very morning in church,\nand that terrible animal man now held sway in his soul. Although\nNekhludoff was watching an opportunity to meet Katiousha that day, he\ndid not succeed in seeing her face to face even once. She was probably\navoiding him. But in the evening it happened that she had to enter a\nroom adjoining his. The physician was to remain over night, and\nKatiousha had to make the bed for him. Hearing her steps, Nekhludoff,\nstepping on tip-toe and holding his breath, as though preparing to\ncommit a crime, followed her into the room.\n\nThrusting both her hands into a white pillow-case, and taking hold of\ntwo corners of the pillow, she turned her head and looked at him\nsmiling, but it was not the old, cheerful, happy smile, but a\nfrightened, piteous smile. The smile seemed to tell him that what he\nwas doing was wrong. For a moment he stood still. There was still the\npossibility of a struggle. Though weak, the voice of his true love to\nher was still heard; it spoke of her, of her feelings, of her life.\nThe other voice reminded him of his enjoyment, his happiness. And this\nsecond voice stifled the first. He approached her with determination.\nAnd the terrible, irresistible animal feeling mastered him.\n\nWithout releasing her from his embrace, Nekhludoff seated her on the\nbed, and feeling that something else ought to be done, seated himself\nbeside her.\n\n"Dmitri Ivanovich, darling, please let me go," she said in a piteous\nvoice. "Matriena Pavlovna is coming!" she suddenly exclaimed, tearing\nherself away.\n\nMatriena Pavlovna was really approaching the door. She entered the\nroom, holding a quilt on her arm, and, looking reproachfully at\nNekhludoff, angrily rebuked Katiousha for taking the wrong quilt.\n\nNekhludoff went out in silence. He was not even ashamed. By the\nexpression of Matriena Pavlovna\'s face he saw that she condemned him,\nand justly so; he knew that what he was doing was wrong, but the\nanimal feeling, which succeeded his former feeling of pure love to\nher, seized him and held sole sway over him; recognizing no other\nfeeling. He knew now what was necessary to do in order to satisfy that\nfeeling, and was looking for means to that end.\n\nHe was out of sorts all that night. Now he would go to his aunts; now\nhe returned to his room, or went to the perron, thinking but of one\nthing: how to meet her alone. But she avoided him, and Matriena\nPavlovna strove not to lose sight of her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nThus the entire evening passed, and when night came the doctor went to\nbed. The aunts were also preparing to retire. Nekhludoff knew that\nMatriena Pavlovna was in the aunts\' dormitory, and that Katiousha was\nin the servants\' quarters--alone. He again went out on the perron. It\nwas dark, damp and warm, and that white mist which in the spring thaws\nthe last snow, filled the air. Strange noises came from the river,\nwhich was a hundred feet from the house. It was the breaking up of the\nice.\n\nNekhludoff came down from the perron, and stepping over pools and the\nthin ice-covering formed on the snow, walked toward the window of the\nservants\' quarters. His heart beat so violently that he could hear it;\nhis breathing at times stopped, at others it escaped in a heavy sigh.\nA small lamp was burning in the maid-servants\' room.\n\nKatiousha was sitting at the table alone, musing and looking at the\nwall before her. Without moving Nekhludoff for some time stood gazing\nat her, wishing to know what she would do while thinking herself\nunobserved. For about two minutes she sat motionless, then raised her\neyes, smiled, reproachfully shook her head, at herself apparently,\nand, changing her position, with a start placed both hands on the\ntable and fixed her eyes before her.\n\nHe remained looking at her, and involuntarily listened to the beating\nof his heart and the strange sounds coming from the river. There, on\nthe misty river some incessant, slow work was going on. Now something\nsnuffled, then it crackled, and again the thin layer of ice resounded\nlike a mass of crushed glass.\n\nHe stood looking at the thoughtful face of Katiousha, tormented by an\ninternal struggle, and he pitied her. But, strange to say, this pity\nonly increased his longing for her.\n\nHe rapped at the window. She trembled from head to foot, as if an\nelectric current had passed through her, and terror was reflected on\nher face. Then she sprang up, and, going to the window, placed her\nface against the window-pane. The expression of terror did not leave\nher even when, shading her eyes with the palms of her hands, she\nrecognized him. Her face was unusually grave--he had never seen such\nan expression on it. When he smiled she smiled also--she smiled as if\nonly in submission to him, but in her soul, instead of a smile, there\nwas terror. He motioned her with his hand to come out. But she shook\nher head and remained at the window. Again he leaned toward the window\nand was about to speak when she turned toward the door. Some one had\napparently called her. Nekhludoff moved away from the window. The fog\nwas so dense that when five feet away he saw only a darkening mass\nfrom which a red, seemingly large, light of the lamp was reflected.\nFrom the river came the same strange sounds of snuffling, crackling\nand grinding of the ice. In the court-yard a cock crowed, others near\nby responded; then from the village, first singly, interrupting each\nother, then mingling into one chorus, was heard the crowing of all the\ncocks. Except for the noise of the river, it was perfectly quiet all\naround.\n\nAfter walking twice around the corner of the house, and stepping\nseveral times into mud-pools, Nekhludoff returned to the window of the\nmaid-servants\' quarters. The lamp was still burning, and Katiousha sat\nalone at the table as if in indecision. As soon as he came near the\nwindow she looked at him. He rapped. Without stopping to see who had\nrapped, she immediately ran from the room, and he heard the opening\nand closing of the door. He was already waiting for her in the\npassage, and immediately silently embraced her. She pressed against\nhis bosom, lifted her head, and with her lips met his kiss.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Nekhludoff returned to his room it was getting brighter. Below,\nthe noises on the river increased, and a buzzing was added to the\nother sounds. The mist began to settle, and from behind the wall of\nmist the waning moon appeared, gloomily, lighting up something dark\nand terrible.\n\n"Is it good fortune or a great misfortune that has happened to me?" he\nasked himself. "It is always thus; they all act in that way," and he\nreturned to his room.\n\n[Illustration: PRINCE NEKHLUDOFF.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nOn the following day the brilliant and jovial Shenbok called at the\naunts for Nekhludoff, and completely charmed them with his elegance,\namiability, cheerfulness, liberality, and his love for Dmitri. Though\nhis liberality pleased the aunts, they were somewhat perplexed by the\nexcess to which he carried it. He gave a ruble to a blind beggar; the\nservants received as tips fifteen rubles, and when Sophia Ivanovna\'s\nlap-dog, Suzette, hurt her leg so that it bled, he volunteered to\nbandage it, and without a moment\'s consideration tore his fine linen\nhandkerchief (Sophia Ivanovna knew that those handkerchiefs were worth\nfifteen rubles a dozen) and made bandages of it for the dog. The aunts\nhad never seen such men, nor did they know that his debts ran up to\ntwo hundred thousand rubles, which--he knew--would never be paid, and\nthat therefore twenty-five rubles more or less made no appreciable\ndifference in his accounts.\n\nShenbok remained but one day, and the following evening departed with\nNekhludoff. They could remain no longer, for the time for joining\ntheir regiment had arrived.\n\nOn this last day spent at the aunts, when the events of the preceding\nevening were fresh in his memory, two antagonistic feelings struggled\nin Nekhludoff\'s soul; one was the burning, sensual recollection of\nlove, although it failed to fulfill its promises, and some\nsatisfaction of having gained his ends; the other, a consciousness of\nhaving committed a wrong, and that that wrong must be righted--not for\nher sake, but for his own sake.\n\nIn that condition of insane egotism Nekhludoff thought only of\nhimself--whether he would be condemned, and how far, if his act should\nbe discovered, but never gave a thought to the question, "How does she\nfeel about it, and what will become of her?"\n\nHe thought that Shenbok divined his relations to Katiousha, and his\nambition was flattered.\n\n"That\'s why you so suddenly began to like your aunts," Shenbok said\nto him when he saw Katiousha. "In your place I should stay here even\nlonger. She is charming!"\n\nHe also thought that while it was a pity to leave now, without\nenjoying his love in its fullness, the necessity of going was\nadvantageous in that he was able to break the relations which it were\ndifficult to keep up. He further thought it was necessary to give her\nmoney, not because she might need it, but because it was customary to\ndo so. So he gave as much money as he thought was proper, considering\ntheir respective positions.\n\nOn the day of his departure, after dinner he waited in the passage\nuntil she came by. She flushed as she saw him, and wished to pass on,\npointing with her eyes to the door of her room, but he detained her.\n\n"I came to bid you farewell," he said, crumpling an envelope\ncontaining a hundred ruble bill. "How is----"\n\nShe suspected it, frowned, shook her head and thrust aside his hand.\n\n"Yes, take it," he murmured, thrusting the envelope in the bosom of\nher waist, and, as if it had burned his fingers, he ran to his room.\n\nFor a long time he paced his room to and fro, frowning, and even\njumping, and moaning aloud as if from physical pain, as he thought of\nthe scene.\n\nBut what is to be done? It is always thus. Thus it was with Shenbok\nand the governess whom he had told about; it was thus with Uncle\nGregory; with his father, when he lived in the country, and the\nillegitimate son Miteuka, who is still living, was born to him. And if\neverybody acts thus, consequently it ought to be so. Thus he was\nconsoling himself, but he could not be consoled. The recollection of\nit stung his conscience.\n\nIn the depth of his soul he knew that his action was so base,\nabominable and cruel that, with that action upon his conscience, not\nonly would he have no right to condemn others but he should not be\nable to look others in the face, to say nothing of considering himself\nthe good, noble, magnanimous man he esteemed himself. And he had to\nesteem himself as such in order to be able to continue to lead a\nvaliant and joyous life. And there was but one way of doing so, and\nthat was not to think of it. This he endeavored to do.\n\nThe life into which he had just entered--new scenes, comrades, and\nactive service--helped him on. The more he lived, the less he thought\nof it, and in the end really forgot it entirely.\n\nOnly once, on his return from active service, when, in the hope of\nseeing her, he paid a visit to his aunts, he was told that Katiousha,\nsoon after his departure, had left them; that she had given birth to a\nchild, and, as the aunts were informed, had gone to the bad. As he\nheard it his heart was oppressed with grief. From the statement of the\ntime when she gave birth to the child it might be his, and it might\nnot be his. The aunts said that she was vicious and of a depraved\nnature, just like her mother. And this opinion of the aunts pleased\nhim, because it exculpated him, as it were. At first he intended to\nfind her and the child, but as it pained him very much, and he was\nashamed to think of it, he did not make the necessary efforts, and\ngradually ceased to think of his sin.\n\nBut now, this fortuitous meeting brought everything to his mind, and\ncompelled the acknowledgment of his heartlessness, cruelty and\nbaseness which made it possible for him to live undisturbed by the sin\nwhich lay on his conscience. He was yet far from such acknowledgment,\nand at this moment was only thinking how to avoid disclosure which\nmight be made by her, or her attorney, and thus disgrace him before\neverybody.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nNekhludoff was in this state of mind when he left the court-room and\nentered the jury-room. He sat near the window, listening to the\nconversations of his fellow jurymen, and smoked incessantly.\n\nThe cheerful merchant evidently sympathized with Merchant Smelkoff\'s\nmanner of passing his time.\n\n"Well, well! He went on his spree just like a Siberian! Seems to have\nknown a good thing when he saw it. What a beauty!"\n\nThe foreman expressed the opinion that the whole case depended on the\nexpert evidence. Peter Gerasimovich was jesting with the Jewish clerk,\nand both of them burst out laughing. Nekhludoff answered all questions\nin monosyllables, and only wished to be left in peace.\n\nWhen the usher with the sidling gait called the jury into court\nNekhludoff was seized with fear, as if judgment was to be passed on\nhim, and not he to pass judgment on others.\n\nIn the depth of his soul he already felt that he was a rascal, who\nought to be ashamed to look people in the face, and yet, by force of\nhabit, he walked to the elevation with his customary air of\nself-confidence, and took his seat next to the foreman, crossed his\nlegs and began to play with his pince-nez.\n\nThe prisoners, who had also been removed from the court, were brought\nin again.\n\nThe new faces of witnesses were now seen in the court-room, and\nNekhludoff noticed Maslova constantly turning her head in the\ndirection of a smartly attired, stout woman in silk and plush, with an\nelegant reticule hanging on her half-bare arm. This was, as Nekhludoff\nafterward learned, Maslova\'s mistress and a witness against her.\n\nThe examination of the witnesses began as to their names, age,\nreligion, et cetera. After being questioned as to whether they\npreferred to testify under oath, the same old priest, with difficulty\nmoving his legs, came, and again arranging the gold cross on his\nsilk-covered breast, with the same calmness and confidence, began to\nadminister the oath to the witnesses and the expert. When the swearing\nin was over, the witnesses were removed to an adjoining room, leaving\nonly Kitaeva, Maslova\'s mistress. She was asked what she knew of the\naffair. Kitaeva, with a feigned smile, a German accent, and\nstraightening her hat at every sentence, fluently and circumstantially\nrelated the following:\n\nSimon came first to her house for Liubasha.[E] In a little while\nLiubasha returned with the merchant. "The merchant was already in\necstasy," slightly smiling, said Kitaeva, "and he continued to drink\nand treat himself, but as he was short of money he sent to his room\nthis same Liubasha, for whom he acquired a predilection," she said,\nlooking at Maslova.\n\nIt seemed to Nekhludoff that Maslova smiled at this, and the smile\nseemed to him disgusting. A strange feeling of squeamishness mingled\nwith compassion rose in his breast.\n\n"What opinion did you entertain of Maslova?" timidly and blushingly\nasked the attorney assigned by the court to defend Maslova.\n\n"Very excellent," answered Kitaeva. "The girl is very well educated\nand elegant in her manners. She was raised in a very good family, and\ncould read French. She sometimes drank a little too much, but she\nnever forgot herself. She is a very good girl."\n\nKatiousha looked at her mistress, then suddenly turned her eyes on the\njury and rested them on Nekhludoff, her face becoming serious and even\nstern. One of the stern eyes squinted. These strangely gazing eyes\nwere turned on Nekhludoff for a considerable time. Notwithstanding the\nterror that seized him, he could not remove his own gaze from those\nsquinting eyes with their shining whites. He recalled that awful night\nwith the breaking ice, the fog, and especially that waning, upturned\nmoon which rose in the morning and lit up something dark and terrible.\nThese two black eyes which looked at and at the same time by him\nreminded him of something dark and terrible.\n\n"She recognized me!" he thought. And Nekhludoff shrank, as it were,\nwaiting for the blow. But she did not recognize him. She sighed calmly\nand again fixed her eyes on the justiciary. Nekhludoff also sighed.\n"Ah, if they would only hasten it through," he thought. He felt now as\nhe did once when out game shooting, when he was obliged to kill a\nwounded bird--he was filled with disgust, pity and vexation. The\nwounded bird is struggling in the game bag; he feels disgust and pity,\nand wishes to kill it quickly and forget it.\n\nSuch mingled feelings filled Nekhludoff\'s breast as he sat listening\nto the examination of the witnesses.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote E: A contemptuous diminutive of Liuba. Tr.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\nAs if to spite him, the case dragged out to a weary length. After the\nexamination of the witnesses and the expert, and after all the\nunnecessary questions by the prosecutor and the attorneys, usually\nmade with an important air, the justiciary told the jury to look at\nthe exhibits, which consisted of an enormous ring with a diamond\nrosette, evidently made for the forefinger, and a glass tube\ncontaining the poison. These were sealed and labeled.\n\nThe jury were preparing to view these things, when the prosecutor rose\nagain and demanded that before the exhibits were examined the medical\nreport of the condition of the body be read.\n\nThe justiciary was hurrying the case, and though he knew that the\nreading of the report would only bring ennui and delay the dinner, and\nthat the prosecutor demanded it only because he had the right to do\nso, he could not refuse the request and gave his consent. The\nsecretary produced the report, and, lisping the letters l and r, began\nto read in a sad voice.\n\nThe external examination disclosed:\n\n1. The height of Therapout Smelkoff was six feet five inches.\n\n"But what a huge fellow," the merchant whispered in Nekhludoff\'s ear\nwith solicitude.\n\n2. From external appearances he seemed to be about forty years of age.\n\n3. The body had a swollen appearance.\n\n4. The color of the pall was green, streaked with dark spots.\n\n5. The skin on the surface of the body rose in bubbles of various\nsizes, and in places hung in patches.\n\n6. The hair was dark and thick, and fell off at a slight touch.\n\n7. The eyes came out of their orbits, and the pupils were dull.\n\n8. A frothy, serous fluid flowed continuously from the cavity of the\nmouth, the nostrils and ears. The mouth was half open.\n\n9. The neck almost disappeared in the swelling of the face and breast,\net cetera, et cetera.\n\nThus, over four pages and twenty-seven clauses, ran the description of\nthe external appearance of the terrible, large, stout, swollen and\ndecomposing body of the merchant who amused himself in the city. The\nloathing which Nekhludoff felt increased with the reading of the\ndescription. Katiousha\'s life, the sanies running from the nostrils,\nthe eyes that came out of their sockets, and his conduct toward\nher--all seemed to him to belong to the same order, and he was\nsurrounded and swallowed up by these things. When the reading was\nfinally over, the justiciary sighed deeply and raised his head in the\nhope that it was all over, but the secretary immediately began to read\nthe report on the internal condition of the body.\n\nThe justiciary again bent his head, and, leaning on his hand, closed\nhis eyes. The merchant, who sat near Nekhludoff, barely kept awake,\nand from time to time swayed his body. The prisoners as well as the\ngendarmes behind them sat motionless.\n\nThe internal examination disclosed:\n\n1. The skin covering of the skull easily detached, and no hemorrhage\nwas noticeable. 2. The skull bones were of average thickness and\nuninjured. 3. On the hard membrane of the skull there were two small\ndiscolored spots of about the size of four centimetres, the membrane\nitself being of a dull gray color, et cetera, et cetera, to the end of\nthirteen more clauses.\n\nThen came the names of the witnesses, the signature and deduction of\nthe physician, from which it appeared that the changes found in the\nstomach, intestines and kidneys justified the conclusion "to a large\ndegree probable" that the death of Smelkoff was due to poison taken\ninto the stomach with a quantity of wine. That it was impossible to\ntell by the changes in the stomach and intestines the name of the\npoison; and that the poison came into the stomach mixed with wine\ncould be inferred from the fact that Smelkoff\'s stomach contained a\nlarge quantity of wine.\n\n"He must have drank like a fish," again whispered the awakened\nmerchant.\n\nThe reading of this official report, which lasted about two hours, did\nnot satisfy, however, the prosecutor. When it was over the justiciary\nturned to him, saying:\n\n"I suppose it is superfluous to read the record of the examination of\nthe intestines."\n\n"I would ask that it be read," sternly said the prosecutor without\nlooking at the justiciary, sidewise raising himself, and impressing by\nthe tone of his voice that it was his right to demand it, that he\nwould insist on it, and that a refusal would be ground for appeal.\n\nThe associate with the long beard and kind, drooping eyes, who was\nsuffering from catarrh, feeling very weak, turned to the justiciary:\n\n"What is the good of reading it? It will only drag the matter out.\nThese new brooms only take a longer time to sweep, but do not sweep\nany cleaner."\n\nThe associate in the gold eye-glasses said nothing, and gloomily and\ndeterminedly looked in front of him, expecting nothing good either\nfrom his wife or from the world.\n\nThe report commenced thus: "February 15th, 188-. The undersigned, in\npursuance of an order, No. 638, of the Medical Department," began the\nsecretary with resolution, raising the pitch of his voice, as if to\ndispel the drowsiness that seized upon every one present, "and in the\npresence of the assistant medical director, examined the following\nintestines:\n\n"1. The right lung and heart (contained in a five-pound glass vial).\n\n"2. The contents of the stomach (contained in a five-pound glass\nvial).\n\n"3. The stomach itself (contained in a five-pound glass vial).\n\n"4. The kidneys, liver and spleen (contained in a two-and-a-half-pound\nglass vial).\n\n"5. The entrails (contained in a five-pound earthen jar)."\n\nAs the reading of this report began the justiciary leaned over to one\nof his associates and whispered something, then to the other, and,\nreceiving affirmative answers, interrupted the reading at this point.\n\n"The Court finds the reading of the report superfluous," he said.\n\nThe secretary closed reading and gathered up his papers, while the\nprosecutor angrily began to make notes.\n\n"The gentlemen of the jury may now view the exhibits," said the\njusticiary.\n\nThe foreman and some of the jury rose from their seats, and, holding\ntheir hands in awkward positions, approached the table and looked in\nturn on the ring, vials and jars. The merchant even tried the ring on\nhis finger.\n\n"What a finger he had," he said, returning to his seat. "It must have\nbeen the size of a large cucumber," he added, evidently amused by the\ngiant figure of the merchant, as he imagined him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\nWhen the examination of the exhibits was over, the justiciary\nannounced the investigation closed, and, desiring to end the session,\ngave the word to the prosecutor, in the hope that as he, too, was\nmortal, he might also wish to smoke or dine, and would have pity on\nthe others. But the prosecutor pitied neither himself nor them. When\nthe word was given him, he rose slowly, displaying his elegant figure,\nand, placing both hands on the desk, and slightly bending his head, he\ncast a glance around the court-room, his eyes avoiding the prisoners.\n\n"Gentlemen of the jury, the case which is now to be submitted to your\nconsideration," he began his speech, prepared while the indictment and\nreports were being read, "is a characteristic crime, if I may so\nexpress myself."\n\nThe speech of a prosecuting attorney, according to his idea, had to be\ninvested with a social significance, according to the manner of those\nlawyers who became famous. True, among his hearers were three women; a\nseamstress, a cook and Simon\'s sister, also a driver, but that made\nno difference. Those celebrities also began on a small scale. The\nprosecutor made it a rule to view the situation from the eminence of\nhis position, i. e., to penetrate into the profound psychological\nmeaning of crime, and bare the ulcers of society.\n\n"Here is before you, gentlemen of the jury, a crime characteristic, if\nI may so express myself, of the end of our century, bearing, as it\nwere, all the specific features of the first symptoms of\ndecomposition, to which those elements of our society, which are\nexposed, as it were, to the more scorching rays of that process, are\nsubject."\n\nThe prosecutor spoke at great length, endeavoring on the one hand to\nremember all those wise sayings which he had prepared for the\noccasion, and on the other, most important, hand, not to stop for a\nmoment, but to make his speech flow uninterruptedly for an hour and a\nquarter. He stopped only once, for a long time swallowing his saliva,\nbut he immediately mastered himself and made up for the lost time by a\ngreater flow of eloquence. He spoke in a gentle, insinuating voice,\nresting now on one foot, now on the other, and looking at the jury;\nthen changed to a calm, business tone, consulting his note-book, and\nagain he thundered accusations, turning now to the spectators, now to\nthe jury. But he never looked at the prisoners, all three of whom\nstared at him. He incorporated into his speech all the latest ideas\nthen in vogue in the circle of his acquaintances, and what was then\nand is now received as the last word of scientific wisdom. He spoke of\nheredity, of innate criminality, of Lombroso, of Charcot, of\nevolution, of the struggle for existence, of hypnotism, of hypnotic\nsuggestion, and of decadence.\n\nThe merchant Smelkoff, according to the prosecutor, was a type of the\ngreat, pure Russian, with his broad nature, who, in consequence of his\ntrusting nature and generosity, had become a victim of a gang of\ncorrupt people, into whose hands he had fallen.\n\nSimon Kartinkin was the atavistic production of serfdom, stupid,\nwithout education, and even without religion. Euphemia was his\nmistress, and a victim of heredity. All the symptoms of degenerate\nlife were in her. But the ruling spirit in this crime was Maslova, who\nwas the mouthpiece of the lowest phenomenon of decadence. "This\nwoman," said the prosecutor without looking at her, "received an\neducation--you have heard here the evidence of her mistress. Not only\ncan she read and write, but she can speak French. She is an orphan,\nand probably bears the germs of criminality in her. She was raised in\nan intelligent, noble family, and could make her living by honest\ntoil, but she leaves them, yields to her passions, and displays an\nintelligence, and especially, as you have heard here, gentlemen of the\njury, an ability to exert influence on people by that mysterious,\nlately discovered by science, especially by the school of Charcot,\npower known by the name of hypnotic suggestion. By the aid of this\npower she gets control over this hero--a kind, trustful, rich guest,\nand uses his confidence first to rob him, and then to pitilessly\nmurder him."\n\n"But he is wandering away," said the justiciary, smiling and leaning\nover to the stern associate.\n\n"What an awful blockhead!" said the stern associate.\n\n"Gentlemen of the jury!" the prosecutor continued meanwhile,\ngracefully swaying his slim body. "The fate of these people is in your\nhands, as is to some extent the fate of society, which is influenced\nby your verdict. You must fathom the significance of this crime, the\ndanger to society that lurks in such pathological, as it were,\nindividuals as Maslova. You must guard it against infection; it is\nyour duty to guard the innocent, healthy elements of society against\ncontagion, if not destruction."\n\nAnd as if himself impressed with the importance of the verdict, and\nevidently greatly delighted with his speech, the prosecutor took his\nseat.\n\nThe burden of his speech, if we eliminate the flights of eloquence,\nwas to the effect that Maslova, after gaining the merchant\'s\nconfidence, hypnotized him, and that, arriving at the inn with the key\nto the merchant\'s trunk, she intended to steal the money herself, but,\nbeing discovered by Simon and Euphemia, was obliged to divide with\nthem. That afterward, desiring to conceal the traces of her crime,\nshe returned with the merchant to the inn and administered poison to\nhim.\n\nWhen the prosecutor had finished his speech, a middle-aged man, in a\ndress coat and wide semi-circle of starched shirt front, rose from the\nlawyer\'s bench, and boldly began to deliver a speech in defense of\nKartinkin and Bochkova. He was a lawyer hired by them for three\nhundred rubles. He declared them both innocent, and threw all the\nblame on Maslova.\n\nHe belittled the deposition of Maslova relating to the presence of\nBochkova and Kartinkin when she took the money, and insisted that, as\nshe had confessed to poisoning the merchant, her evidence could have\nno weight. The twenty-five hundred rubles could have been earned by\ntwo hard working and honest persons, who were receiving in tips three\nto four rubles a day from guests. The merchant\'s money was stolen by\nMaslova, who either gave it to some one for safe keeping, or lost it,\nwhich was not unlikely, as she was not in a normal condition. The\npoisoning was done by Maslova alone.\n\nFor these reasons he asked the jury to acquit Kartinkin and Bochkova\nof stealing the money; or, if they found them guilty of stealing he\nasked for a verdict of theft, but without participation in the\npoisoning, and without conspiracy.\n\nIn conclusion, this lawyer made a thrust at the prosecuting attorney\nby remarking that, although the splendid reasonings of the prosecutor\non heredity explain the scientific questions of heredity, they hardly\nhold good in the case of Bochkova, since her parentage was unknown.\n\nThe prosecutor, growling, began to make notes, and shrugged his\nshoulders in contemptuous surprise.\n\nNext rose Maslova\'s lawyer, and timidly and falteringly began his\nspeech in her defense. Without denying that Maslova participated in\nthe theft, he insisted that she had no intention of poisoning\nSmelkoff, but gave him the powder in order to make him sleep. When he\ndescribed Maslova\'s unfortunate life, telling how she had been drawn\ninto a life of vice by a man who went unpunished, while she was left\nto bear the whole burden of her fall, he attempted to become eloquent,\nbut his excursion into the domain of psychology failed, so that\neverybody felt awkward. When he began to mutter about man\'s cruelty\nand woman\'s helplessness, the justiciary, desiring to help him, asked\nhim to confine himself to the facts of the case.\n\nAfter this lawyer had finished the prosecutor rose again and defended\nhis position on the question of heredity against the first lawyer,\nstating that the fact that Bochkova\'s parentage was unknown did not\ninvalidate the truth of the theory of heredity; that the law of\nheredity is so well established by science that not only can one\ndeduce the crime from heredity, but heredity from the crime. As to the\nstatement of the defense that Maslova was drawn into a vicious life by\nan imaginary (he pronounced the word imaginary with particular\nvirulence) man, he could say that all facts rather pointed to her\nbeing the seducer of many victims who were unfortunate enough to fall\ninto her hands. Saying which he sat down in triumph.\n\nThe prisoners were then allowed to make any statements they wished in\ntheir behalf.\n\nEuphemia Bochkova repeated her statement that she knew nothing, had\nnot taken part in anything, and persistently pointed at Maslova as the\nonly guilty person. Simon only repeated several times:\n\n"Do what you please with me, only it is all for nothing."\n\nMaslova was silent. When asked what she had to say in her defense, she\nonly lifted her eyes on the justiciary, looked around like a hunted\nanimal, and immediately lowering them began to sob aloud.\n\n"What is the matter?" asked the merchant of Nekhludoff, hearing a\nstrange sound escaping the latter\'s lips. It was a suppressed sob.\n\nNekhludoff did not yet realize the significance of his present\nposition, and the scarcely suppressed sob and the tears that welled up\nin his eyes he ascribed to the weakness of his nerves. He put on his\npince-nez to hide them, and, drawing a handkerchief from his pocket,\nbegan to blow his nose.\n\nHis fear of the disgrace that would fall upon him if everybody in the\ncourt-room were to find out his conduct toward her stifled the\nstruggle that was going on within him. At this time fear outweighed\nin him every other feeling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nAfter the last words of the prisoners had been heard, and the lengthy\narguments over the form in which the questions were to be put to the\njury were over, the questions were finally agreed upon, and the\njusticiary began to deliver his instructions to the jury.\n\nAlthough he was anxious to finish the case, he was so carried away\nthat when he started to speak he could not stop himself. He told the\njury at great length that if they found the prisoners guilty, they had\nthe right to return a verdict of guilty, and if they found them not\nguilty, they had the right to return a verdict of not guilty. If,\nhowever they found them guilty of one charge, and not guilty of the\nother, they might bring in a verdict of guilty of the one and not\nguilty of the other. He further explained to them that they must\nexercise this power intelligently. He also intended to explain to them\nthat if they gave an affirmative answer to a question, they would\nthereby affirm everything involved in the question, and that if they\ndid not desire to affirm everything involved in the question, they\nmust distinguish the part they affirmed from the part they\ndisaffirmed. But, seeing on the clock that it was five minutes of\nthree, he decided to pass over to a statement of the case.\n\n"The facts of this case are the following," he began, repeating\neverything that had been stated over and over again by the defendants\'\nattorneys, the prosecutor and the witnesses. While the justiciary was\ncharging the jury his associates thoughtfully listened, and now and\nthen glanced at the clock. They thought that although his charge was\nsound, i. e., as it should be, it was too long. Of the same opinion was\nthe prosecutor, as well as all those connected with the court,\nincluding the spectators. The justiciary concluded his charge.\n\nIt was thought he had finished. But the justiciary found it necessary\nto add a few words concerning the importance of the power given to\nthe jury; that it should be used with care, and should not be abused;\nthat they had taken an oath; that they were the conscience of society,\nand that the secrecy of the consultation room was sacred, etc., etc.\n\nFrom the moment the justiciary began to speak, Maslova kept her eyes\non him, as if she feared to miss a word, so that Nekhludoff was not\nafraid to meet her gaze, and constantly looked at her. And before his\nimagination arose that common phenomenon of the appearance of a long\nabsent, beloved face, which, after the first shock produced by the\nexternal changes which have taken place during the long absence,\ngradually becomes the same as it was many years ago--all the past\nchanges disappear, and before the spiritual eyes stands forth the main\nexpression of the peculiar spiritual individuality. This happened with\nNekhludoff.\n\nYes, notwithstanding the prison garb, the bloated body and the high\nbreast; notwithstanding the distended lower part of the face, the\nwrinkles on the forehead and the temples, and the swelling under the\neyes, it was undoubtedly that same Katiousha who on Easter Sunday\nlooked up to him, her beloved, with her enamored, smiling, happy,\nlively eyes.\n\n"What a remarkable coincidence! That this case should be tried during\nmy term! That, without seeing her for ten years, I should meet her\nhere in the prisoner\'s dock! And what will be the end? Ah, I wish it\nwere over!"\n\nHe would not yield to the feeling of repentance which spoke within\nhim. He considered it an incident which would soon pass away without\ndisturbing his life. He felt himself in the position of a puppy who\nhad misbehaved in his master\'s rooms, and whom his master, taking him\nby the neck, thrust into the dirt he had made. The puppy squeals,\npulls back in his effort to escape the consequences of his deed, which\nhe wishes to forget, but the inexorable master holds him fast. Thus\nNekhludoff felt the foulness of his act, and he also felt the powerful\nhand of the master, but did not yet understand the significance of his\nact, did not recognize the master. He did not wish to believe that\nwhat he saw before him was the result of his own deed. But the\ninexorable, invisible hand held him fast, and he had a foreboding that\nhe should not escape. He summoned up his courage, crossed his legs, as\nwas his wont, and, negligently playing with his pince-nez, he sat with\nan air of self-confidence on the second chair of the front row.\nMeanwhile he already felt in the depth of his soul all the cruelty,\ndastardliness and baseness not only of that act of his, but of his\nwhole idle, dissolute, cruel and wayward life. And the terrible veil,\nwhich during these twelve years in such marvelous manner had hidden\nfrom him that crime and all his subsequent life, already began to\nstir, and now and then he caught a glimpse behind it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nThe justiciary finally finished his speech and handed the list of\nquestions to the foreman. The jury rose from their seats, glad of an\nopportunity to leave the court-room, and, not knowing what to do with\ntheir hands, as if ashamed of something, they filed into the\nconsultation-room. As soon as the door closed behind them a gendarme,\nwith drawn sword resting on his shoulder, placed himself in front of\nit. The judges rose and went out. The prisoners also were led away.\n\nOn entering the consultation-room the jury immediately produced\ncigarettes and began to smoke. The sense of their unnatural and false\nposition, of which they were to a greater or less degree cognizant,\nwhile sitting in the court-room, passed away as soon as they entered\ntheir room and lighted their cigarettes, and, with a feeling of\nrelief, they seated themselves and immediately started an animated\nconversation.\n\n"The girl is not guilty, she was confused," said the kind-hearted\nmerchant.\n\n"That is what we are going to consider," retorted the foreman. "We\nmust not yield to our personal impressions."\n\n"The judge\'s summing up was good," said the colonel.\n\n"Do you call it good? It nearly sent me to sleep."\n\n"The important point is that the servants could not have known that\nthere was money in the room if Maslova had no understanding with\nthem," said the clerk with the Jewish face.\n\n"So you think that she stole it?" asked one of the jury.\n\n"I will never believe that," shouted the kind-hearted merchant. "It is\nall the work of that red-eyed wench."\n\n"They are all alike," said the colonel.\n\n"But she said that she did not go into the room."\n\n"Do you believe her more than the other? I should never believe that\nworthless woman."\n\n"That does not decide the question," said the clerk.\n\n"She had the key."\n\n"What if she had?" answered the merchant.\n\n"And the ring?"\n\n"She explained it," again shouted the merchant. "It is quite likely\nthat being drunk he struck her. Well, and then he was sorry, of\ncourse. \'There, don\'t cry! Take this ring.\' And what a big man! They\nsaid he weighed about two hundred and fifty pounds, I believe."\n\n"That is not the point," interrupted Peter Gerasimovich. "The question\nis, Was she the instigator, or were the servants?"\n\n"The servants could not have done it without her. She had the key."\n\nThis incoherent conversation lasted for a long time.\n\n"Excuse me, gentlemen," said the foreman. "Let us sit down and\nconsider the matter. Take your seats," he added, seating himself in\nthe foreman\'s chair.\n\n"These girls are rogues," said the clerk, and to sustain his opinion\nthat Maslova was the chief culprit, he related how one of those girls\nonce stole a watch from a friend of his.\n\nAs a case in point the colonel related the bolder theft of a silver\n_samovar_.\n\n"Gentlemen, let us take up the questions," said the foreman, rapping\non the table with a pencil.\n\nThey became silent. The questions submitted were:\n\n1. Is the peasant of the village of Barkoff, district of Krapivensk,\nSimon Petroff Kartinkin, thirty-three years of age, guilty of having,\nwith the design of taking the life of Smelkoff and robbing him,\nadministered to him poison in a glass of brandy, which caused the\ndeath of Smelkoff, and of afterward robbing him of twenty-five hundred\nrubles and a diamond ring?\n\n2. Is the burgess Euphemia Ivanovna Bochkova, forty-seven years of\nage, guilty of the crime mentioned in the first question?\n\n3. Is the burgess Katherine Michaelovna Maslova, twenty-seven years of\nage, guilty of the crime mentioned in the first question?\n\n4. If the prisoner Euphemia Bochkova is not guilty of the crime set\nforth in the first question, is she not guilty of secretly stealing,\nwhile employed in the Hotel Mauritania, on the 17th day of January,\n188-, twenty-five hundred rubles from the trunk of the merchant\nSmelkoff, to which end she opened the trunk in the hotel with a key\nbrought and fitted by her?\n\nThe foreman read the first question.\n\n"Well, gentlemen, what do you think?"\n\nThis question was quickly answered. They all agreed to answer\n"Guilty." The only one that dissented was an old laborer, whose answer\nto all questions was "Not guilty."\n\nThe foreman thought that he did not understand the questions and\nproceeded to explain that from all the facts it was evident that\nKartinkin and Bochkova were guilty, but the laborer answered that he\ndid understand them, and that he thought that they ought to be\ncharitable. "We are not saints ourselves," he said, and did not change\nhis opinion.\n\nThe second question, relating to Bochkova, after many arguments and\nelucidations, was answered "Not guilty," because there was no clear\nproof that she participated in the poisoning--a fact on which her\nlawyer put much stress.\n\nThe merchant, desiring to acquit Maslova, insisted that Bochkova was\nthe author of the conspiracy. Many of the jurymen agreed with him, but\nthe foreman, desiring to conform strictly to the law, said that there\nwas no foundation for the charge of poisoning against her. After a\nlengthy argument the foreman\'s opinion triumphed.\n\nThe fourth question, relating to Bochkova, was answered "Guilty," but\nat the insistence of the laborer, she was recommended to the mercy of\nthe court.\n\nThe third question called forth fierce argument. The foreman insisted\nthat she was guilty of both the poisoning and robbery; the merchant,\ncolonel, clerk and laborer opposed this view, while the others\nhesitated, but the opinion of the foreman began to predominate,\nprincipally because the jury were tired out, and they willingly joined\nthe side which promised to prevail the sooner, and consequently\nrelease them quicker.\n\nFrom all that occurred at the trial and his knowledge of Maslova,\nNekhludoff was convinced that she was innocent, and at first was\nconfident that the other jurors would so find her, but when he saw\nthat because of the merchant\'s bungling defense of Maslova, evidently\nprompted by his undisguised liking for her, and the foreman\'s\nresistance which it caused, but chiefly because of the weariness of\nthe jury, there was likely to be a verdict of guilty, he wished to\nmake objection, but feared to speak in her favor lest his relations\ntoward her should be disclosed. At the same time he felt that he could\nnot let things go on without making his objections. He blushed and\ngrew pale in turn, and was about to speak, when Peter Gerasimovich,\nheretofore silent, evidently exasperated by the authoritative manner\nof the foreman, suddenly began to make the very objections Nekhludoff\nintended to make.\n\n"Permit me to say a few words," he began. "You say that she stole the\nmoney because she had the key; but the servants could have opened the\ntrunk with a false key after she was gone."\n\n"Of course, of course," the merchant came to his support.\n\n"She could not have taken the money because she would have nowhere to\nhide it."\n\n"That is what I said," the merchant encouraged him.\n\n"It is more likely that her coming to the hotel for the money\nsuggested to the servants the idea of stealing it; that they stole it\nand then threw it all upon her."\n\nPeter Gerasimovich spoke provokingly, which communicated itself to the\nforeman. As a result the latter began to defend his position more\npersistently. But Peter Gerasimovich spoke so convincingly that he won\nover the majority, and it was finally decided that she was not guilty\nof the theft. When, however, they began to discuss the part she had\ntaken in the poisoning, her warm supporter, the merchant, argued that\nthis charge must also be dismissed, as she had no motive for poisoning\nhim. The foreman insisted that she could not be declared innocent on\nthat charge, because she herself confessed to giving him the powder.\n\n"But she thought that it was opium," said the merchant.\n\n"She could have killed him even with the opium," retorted the colonel,\nwho liked to make digressions, and he began to relate the case of his\nbrother-in-law\'s wife, who had been poisoned by opium and would have\ndied had not antidotes promptly been administered by a physician who\nhappened to be in the neighborhood. The colonel spoke so impressively\nand with such self-confidence and dignity that no one dared to\ninterrupt him. Only the clerk, infected by the example set by the\ncolonel, thought of telling a story of his own.\n\n"Some people get so accustomed to opium," he began, "that they can\ntake forty drops at a time. A relative of mine----"\n\nBut the colonel would brook no interruption, and went on to tell of\nthe effect of the opium on his brother-in-law\'s wife.\n\n"It is five o\'clock, gentlemen," said one of the jury.\n\n"What do you say, gentlemen," said the foreman. "We find her guilty,\nbut without the intent to rob, and without stealing any property--is\nthat correct?"\n\nPeter Gerasimovich, pleased with the victory he had gained, agreed to\nthe verdict.\n\n"And we recommend her to the mercy of the court," added the merchant.\n\nEvery one agreed except the laborer, who insisted on a verdict of "Not\nguilty."\n\n"But that is the meaning of the verdict," explained the foreman.\n"Without the intent to rob, and without stealing any property--hence\nshe is not guilty."\n\n"Don\'t forget to throw in the recommendation to mercy. If there be\nanything left that will wipe it out," joyfully said the merchant. They\nwere so tired and the arguments had so confused them that it did not\noccur to any one to add "but without the intent to cause the death of\nthe merchant."\n\nNekhludoff was so excited that he did not notice it. The answers were\nin this form taken to the court.\n\nRabelais relates the story of a jurist who was trying a case, and who,\nafter citing innumerable laws and reading twenty pages of\nincomprehensible judicial Latin, made an offer to the litigants to\nthrow dice; if an even number fell then the plaintiff was right; if an\nodd number the defendant was right.\n\nIt was the same here. The verdict was reached not because the majority\nof the jury agreed to it, but first because the justiciary had so\ndrawn out his speech that he failed to properly instruct the jury;\nsecond, because the colonel\'s story about his brother-in-law\'s wife\nwas tedious; third, because Nekhludoff was so excited that he did not\nnotice the omission of the clause limiting the intent in the answer,\nand thought that the words "without intent to rob" negatively answered\nthe question; fourth, because Peter Gerasimovich was not in the room\nwhen the foreman read the questions and answers, and chiefly because\nthe jury were tired out and were anxious to get away, and therefore\nagreed to the verdict which it was easiest to reach.\n\nThey rang the bell. The gendarme sheathed his sword and stood aside.\nThe judges, one by one, took their seats and the jury filed out.\n\nThe foreman held the list with a solemn air. He approached the\njusticiary and handed it to him. The justiciary read it, and, with\nevident surprise, turned to consult with his associates. He was\nsurprised that the jury, in limiting the charge by the words, "without\nintent to rob," should fail to add also "without intent to cause\ndeath." It followed from the decision of the jury, that Maslova had\nnot stolen or robbed, but had poisoned a man without any apparent\nreason.\n\n"Just see what an absurd decision they have reached," he said to the\nassociate on his left. "This means hard labor for her, and she is not\nguilty."\n\n"Why not guilty?" said the stern associate.\n\n"She is simply not guilty. I think that chapter 818 might properly be\napplied to this case." (Chapter 818 gives the court the power to set\naside an unjust verdict.)\n\n"What do you think?" he asked the kind associate.\n\n"I agree with you."\n\n"And you?" he asked the choleric associate.\n\n"By no means," he answered, decidedly. "As it is, the papers say that\ntoo many criminals are discharged by juries. What will they say, then,\nif the court should discharge them? I will not agree under any\ncircumstances."\n\nThe justiciary looked at the clock.\n\n"It is a pity, but what can I do?" and he handed the questions to the\nforeman.\n\nThey all rose, and the foreman, standing now on one foot, now on the\nother, cleared his throat and read the questions and answers. All the\nofficers of the court--the secretary, the lawyers and even the\nprosecutor--expressed surprise.\n\nThe prisoners, who evidently did not understand the significance of\nthe answers, were serene. When the reading was over, the justiciary\nasked the prosecutor what punishment he thought should be imposed on\nthe prisoners.\n\nThe prosecutor, elated by the successful verdict against Maslova,\nwhich he ascribed to his eloquence, consulted some books, then rose\nand said:\n\n"Simon Kartinkin, I think, should be punished according to chapter\n1,452, sec. 4, and chapter 1,453; Euphemia Bochkova according to\nchapter 1,659, and Katherine Maslova according to chapter 1,454."\n\nAll these were the severest punishments that could be imposed for the\ncrimes.\n\n"The court will retire to consider their decision," said the\njusticiary, rising.\n\nEverybody then rose, and, with a relieved and pleasant feeling of\nhaving fulfilled an important duty, walked around the court-room.\n\n"What a shameful mess we have made of it," said Peter Gerasimovitch,\napproaching Nekhludoff, to whom the foreman was telling a story. "Why,\nwe have sentenced her to hard labor."\n\n"Is it possible?" exclaimed Nekhludoff, taking no notice at all this\ntime of the unpleasant familiarity of the tutor.\n\n"Why, of course," he said. "We have not inserted in the answer,\n\'Guilty, but without intent to cause death.\' The secretary has just\ntold me that the law cited by the prosecutor provides fifteen years\'\nhard labor."\n\n"But that was our verdict," said the foreman.\n\nPeter Gerasimovitch began to argue that it was self-evident that as\nshe did not steal the money she could not have intended to take the\nmerchant\'s life.\n\n"But I read the questions before we left the room," the foreman\njustified himself, "and no one objected."\n\n"I was leaving the room at the time," said Peter Gerasimovitch. "But\nhow did you come to miss it?"\n\n"I did not think of it," answered Nekhludoff.\n\n"You did not!"\n\n"We can right it yet," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"No, we cannot--it is all over now."\n\nNekhludoff looked at the prisoners. While their fate was being\ndecided, they sat motionless behind the grating in front of the\nsoldiers. Maslova was smiling.\n\nNekhludoff\'s soul was stirred by evil thoughts. When he thought that\nshe would be freed and remain in the city, he was undecided how he\nshould act toward her, and it was a difficult matter. But Siberia and\npenal servitude at once destroyed the possibility of their meeting\nagain. The wounded bird would stop struggling in the game-bag, and\nwould no longer remind him of its existence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\nThe apprehensions of Peter Gerasimovitch were justified.\n\nOn returning from the consultation-room the justiciary produced a\ndocument and read the following:\n\n"By order of His Imperial Majesty, the Criminal Division of the ----\nCircuit Court, in conformity with the finding of the jury, and in\naccordance with ch. 771, s. 3, and ch. 776, s. 3, and ch. 777 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, this 28th day of April, 188-, decrees\nthat Simon Kartinkin, thirty-three years of age, and Katherine\nMaslova, twenty-seven years of age, be deprived of all civil rights,\nand sent to penal servitude, Kartinkin for eight, Maslova for the term\nof four years, under conditions prescribed by ch. 25 of the Code.\nEuphemia Bochkova is deprived of all civil and special rights and\nprivileges, and is to be confined in jail for the period of three\nyears under conditions prescribed by ch. 49 of the Code, with the\ncosts of the trial to be borne by all three, and in case of their\ninability to pay, to be paid out of the treasury.\n\n"The exhibits are to be sold, the ring returned, and the vials\ndestroyed."\n\nKartinkin stood like a post, and with outstretched fingers held up the\nsleeves of his coat, moving his jaws. Bochkova seemed to be calm. When\nMaslova heard the decision, she turned red in the face.\n\n"I am innocent, I am innocent!" she suddenly cried. "It is a sin. I am\ninnocent. I never wished; never thought. It is the truth." And sinking\nto the bench, she began to cry aloud.\n\nWhen Kartinkin and Bochkova left the court-room she was still standing\nand crying, so that the gendarme had to touch the sleeve of her coat.\n\n"She cannot be left to her fate," said Nekhludoff to himself, entirely\nforgetting his evil thoughts, and, without knowing why, he ran into\nthe corridor to look at her again. He was detained at the door for a\nfew minutes by the jostling, animated crowd of jurors and lawyers, who\nwere glad that the case was over, so that when he reached the corridor\nMaslova was some distance away. Without thinking of the attention he\nwas attracting, with quick step he overtook her, walked a little ahead\nof her and stopped. She had ceased to cry, only a sob escaped her now\nand then while she wiped her tears with a corner of her \'kerchief. She\npassed him without turning to look at him. He then hastily returned to\nsee the justiciary. The latter had left his room, and Nekhludoff found\nhim in the porter\'s lodge.\n\n"Judge," said Nekhludoff, approaching him at the moment when he was\nputting on a light overcoat and taking a silver-handled cane which the\nporter handed him, "may I speak to you about the case that has just\nbeen tried? I am a juror."\n\n"Why, of course, Prince Nekhludoff! I am delighted to see you. We have\nmet before," said the justiciary, pressing his hand, and recalling\nwith pleasure that he was the jolliest fellow and best dancer of all\nthe young men on the evening he had met him. "What can I do for you?"\n\n"There was a mistake in the jury\'s finding against Maslova. She is not\nguilty of poisoning, and yet she is sent to penal servitude," he said,\nwith a gloomy countenance.\n\n"The court gave its decision in accordance with your own finding,"\nanswered the justiciary, moving toward the door, "although the answers\ndid not seem to suit the case."\n\nHe remembered that he intended to explain to the jury that an answer\nof guilty without a denial of intent to kill involved an intent to\nkill, but, as he was hastening to terminate the proceedings, he failed\nto do so.\n\n"But could not the mistake be rectified?"\n\n"Cause for appeal can always be found. You must see a lawyer," said\nthe justiciary, putting on his hat a little on one side and continuing\nto move toward the door.\n\n"But this is terrible."\n\n"You see, one of two things confronted Maslova," the justiciary said,\nevidently desiring to be as pleasant and polite with Nekhludoff as\npossible. Then, arranging his side-whiskers over his coat collar, and\ntaking Nekhludoff\'s arm, he led him toward the door. "You are also\ngoing?" he continued.\n\n"Yes," said Nekhludoff, hastily donning his overcoat and following\nhim.\n\nThey came out into the bright, cheerful sunlight, where the rattling\nof wheels on the pavement made it necessary to raise their voices.\n\n"The situation, you see, is a very curious one," continued the\njusticiary. "Maslova was confronted by one of two things: either a\nshort term in jail, in which case her lengthy confinement would have\nbeen taken into consideration, or penal servitude; no other sentence\nwas possible. Had you added the words, \'without intent to kill,\' she\nwould have been discharged."\n\n"It is unpardonable neglect on my part," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"That is the whole trouble," the justiciary said, smiling and looking\nat his watch.\n\nThere was only three-quarters of an hour left to the latest hour fixed\nin Clara\'s appointment.\n\n"You can apply to a lawyer, if you wish. It is necessary to find\ngrounds for appeal. But that can always be found. To the\nDvorianskaia," he said to the cab-driver. "Thirty kopecks--I never pay\nmore."\n\n"All right, Your Excellency."\n\n"Good-day. If I can be of any service to you, please let me know. You\nwill easily remember my address: Dvornikoff\'s house, on the\nDvorinskaia."\n\nAnd, making a graceful bow, he rode off.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\nThe conversation with the justiciary and the pure air somewhat calmed\nNekhludoff. The feeling he experienced he now ascribed to the fact\nthat he had passed the day amid surroundings to which he was\nunaccustomed.\n\n"It is certainly a remarkable coincidence! I must do what is necessary\nto alleviate her lot, and do it quickly. Yes, I must find out here\nwhere Fanarin or Mikishin lives." Nekhludoff called to mind these two\nwell-known lawyers.\n\nNekhludoff returned to the court-house, took off his overcoat and\nwalked up the stairs. In the very first corridor he met Fanarin. He\nstopped him and told him that he had some business with him. Fanarin\nknew him by sight, and also his name. He told Nekhludoff that he would\nbe glad to do anything to please him.\n\n"I am rather tired, but, if it won\'t take long, I will listen to your\ncase. Let us walk into that room."\n\nAnd Fanarin led Nekhludoff into a room, probably the cabinet of some\njudge. They seated themselves at a table.\n\n"Well, state your case."\n\n"First of all, I will ask you," said Nekhludoff, "not to disclose that\nI am interesting myself in this case."\n\n"That is understood. Well?"\n\n"I was on a jury to-day, and we sent an innocent woman to Siberia. It\ntorments me."\n\nTo his own surprise, Nekhludoff blushed and hesitated. Fanarin glanced\nat him, then lowered his eyes and listened.\n\n"Well?"\n\n"We condemned an innocent woman, and I would like to have the case\nappealed to a higher court."\n\n"To the Senate?" Fanarin corrected him.\n\n"And I wish you to take the case."\n\nNekhludoff wanted to get through the most difficult part, and\ntherefore immediately added:\n\n"I take all expenses on myself, whatever they may be," he said,\nblushing.\n\n"Well, we will arrange all that," said the lawyer, condescendingly\nsmiling at Nekhludoff\'s inexperience.\n\n"What are the facts of the case?"\n\nNekhludoff related them.\n\n"Very well; I will examine the record to-morrow. Call at my office the\nday after--no, better on Thursday, at six o\'clock in the evening, and\nI will give you an answer. And now let us go; I must make some\ninquiries here."\n\nNekhludoff bade him good-by, and departed.\n\nHis conversation with the lawyer, and the fact that he had already\ntaken steps to defend Maslova, still more calmed his spirit. The\nweather was fine, and when Nekhludoff found himself on the street, he\ngladly inhaled the spring air. Cab drivers offered their services, but\nhe preferred to walk, and a swarm of thoughts and recollections of\nKatiousha and his conduct toward her immediately filled his head. He\nbecame sad, and everything appeared to him gloomy. "No, I will\nconsider it later," he said to himself, "and now I must have some\ndiversion from these painful impressions."\n\nThe dinner at the Korchagin\'s came to his mind, and he looked at his\nwatch. It was not too late to reach there for dinner. A tram-car\npassed by. He ran after it, and boarded it at a bound. On the square\nhe jumped off, took one of the best cabs, and ten minutes later he\nalighted in front of Korchagin\'s large dwelling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n\n"Walk in, Your Excellency, you are expected," said the fat porter,\npushing open the swinging, oaken door of the entrance. "They are\ndining, but I was told to admit you."\n\nThe porter walked to the stairway and rang the bell.\n\n"Are there any guests?" Nekhludoff asked, while taking off his coat.\n\n"Mr. Kolosoff, also Michael Sergeievich, besides the family," answered\nthe porter.\n\nA fine-looking lackey in dress coat and white gloves looked down from\nthe top of the stairs.\n\n"Please to walk in, Your Excellency," he said.\n\nNekhludoff mounted the stairs, and through the spacious and\nmagnificent parlor he entered the dining-room. Around the table were\nseated the entire family, except Princess Sophia Vasilievna, who never\nleft her own apartments. At the head of the table sat old Korchagin,\non his left the physician; on his right, a visitor, Ivan Ivanovich\nKolosoff, an ex-district commander, and now a bank manager, who was a\nfriend of the family, and of liberal tendencies; further to the left\nwas Miss Rader, governess to Missy\'s four-year-old sister, with the\nlittle girl herself; then to the right, Missy\'s only brother, Peter, a\nhigh-school pupil, on account of whose forthcoming examinations the\nentire family remained in the city, and his tutor, also a student;\nthen again to the left, Katherine Alexeievna, a forty-year-old girl\nSlavophile; opposite to her was Michael Sergeievich, or Misha Telegin,\nMissy\'s cousin, and at the foot of the table, Missy herself, and\nbeside her, on the table, lay an extra cover.\n\n"Ah, very glad you came! Take a seat! We are still at the fish,"\nchewing carefully with his false teeth old Korchagin said, lifting his\nbloodshot eyes on Nekhludoff. "Stepan!" he turned with a full mouth to\nthe fat, majestic servant, pointing with his eyes to Nekhludoff\'s\nplate. Although Nekhludoff had often dined with and knew Korchagin\nwell, this evening his old face, his sensual, smacking lips, the\nnapkin stuck under his vest, the fat neck, and especially the\nwell-fed, military figure made an unpleasant impression on him.\n\n"It is all ready, Your Excellency," said Stepan, taking a soup ladle\nfrom the sideboard and nodding to the fine-looking servant with the\nside-whiskers, who immediately began to set the table beside Missy.\n\nNekhludoff went around the table shaking hands with every one. All,\nexcept Korchagin and the ladies, rose from their seats when he\napproached them. And this walking around the table and his\nhandshaking, although most of the people were comparative strangers to\nhim, this evening seemed to Nekhludoff particularly unpleasant and\nridiculous. He excused himself for his late coming, and was about to\nseat himself at the end of the table between Missy and Katherine\nAlexeievna, when old Korchagin demanded that, since he would not take\nany brandy, he should first take a bite at the table, on which were\nlobster, caviare, cheese and herring. Nekhludoff did not know he was\nas hungry as he turned out to be, and when he tasted of some cheese\nand bread he could not stop eating, and ate ravenously.\n\n"Well? Have you been undermining the bases of society?" asked\nKolosoff, ironically, using an expression of a retrogressive\nnewspaper, which was attacking the jury system. "You have acquitted\nthe guilty and condemned the innocent? Have you?"\n\n"Undermining the bases--undermining the bases"--smilingly repeated the\nPrince, who had boundless confidence in the intelligence and honesty\nof his liberal comrade and friend.\n\nNekhludoff, at the risk of being impolite, did not answer Kolosoff,\nand, seating himself before the steaming soup, continued to eat.\n\n"Do let him eat," said Missy, smiling. By the pronoun "him," she\nmeant to call attention to her intimacy with Nekhludoff.\n\nMeanwhile Kolosoff was energetically and loudly discussing the article\nagainst trial by jury which had roused his indignation. Michael\nSergeievich supported his contentions and quoted the contents of\nanother similar article.\n\nMissy, as usual, was very _distingue_ and unobtrusively well dressed.\nShe waited until Nekhludoff had swallowed the mouthful he was chewing,\nand then said: "You must be very tired and hungry."\n\n"Not particularly. Are you? Have you been to the exhibition?" he\nasked.\n\n"No, we postponed it. But we went to play lawn tennis at the\nSalamatoff\'s. Mister Crooks is really a remarkable player."\n\nNekhludoff had came here for recreation, and it was always pleasant to\nhim to be in this house, not only because of the elegant luxury, which\nacted pleasantly on his senses, but because of the adulating\nkindnesses with which they invisibly surrounded him. To-day,\nhowever--it is wonderful to relate--everything in this house disgusted\nhim; the porter, the broad stairway, the flowers, the lackeys, the\ntable decorations, and even Missy herself, who, just now, seemed to\nhim unattractive and unnatural. He was disgusted with that\nself-confident, vulgar, liberal tone of Kolosoff, the bull-like,\nsensual, figure of old Korchagin, the French phrases of the Slavophile\nmaiden, the ceremonious faces of the governess and the tutor. But\nabove all, he was disgusted with the pronoun "him" that Missy had\nused. Nekhludoff was always wavering between two different relations\nhe sustained toward Missy. Sometimes he looked at her as through\nblinking eyes or by moonlight, and then she seemed to him beautiful,\nfresh, pretty, clever and natural. At other times he looked at her as\nif under a bright sun, and then he saw only her defects. To-day was\nsuch a day. He saw the wrinkles on her face; saw the artificial\narrangement of her hair; the pointed elbows, and, above all, her large\nthumb nail, resembling that of her father.\n\n"It is the dullest game," Kolosoff said, speaking of tennis,\n"baseball, as we played it when we were boys, is much more amusing."\n\n"You have not tried it. It is awfully interesting," retorted Missy,\nunnaturally accentuating the word "awfully," as it seemed to\nNekhludoff.\n\nA discussion arose in which Michael Sergeievich and Katherine\nAlexeievna took part. Only the governess, the tutor and the children\nwere silent, evidently from ennui.\n\n"They are eternally disputing!" laughing aloud, said old Korchagin. He\npulled the napkin from his vest, and, noisily pushing back his chair,\nwhich was immediately removed by a servant, rose from the table. They\nall rose after him and went to a small table, on which stood figured\nbowls filled with perfumed water; then they washed their finger-tips\nand rinsed their mouths, and continued their conversation, in which no\none took any interest.\n\n"Is it not true?" Missy said to Nekhludoff, desiring to receive\nconfirmation of her opinion that man\'s character can best be learned\nin play. She noticed on his thoughtful face an expression of reproach,\nwhich inspired her with fear, and she wished to know the cause of it.\n\n"I really don\'t know. I never thought of it," answered Nekhludoff.\n\n"Will you go to mamma?" asked Missy.\n\n"Yes, yes," he said, producing a cigarette. The tone of his voice\nplainly betrayed that he did not wish to go.\n\nShe looked at him inquiringly, but was silent. He felt ashamed. "It is\nhardly proper for me to come here to put people out of temper," he\nthought, and, in an effort to be pleasant, he said that he would go\nwith pleasure if the Princess were in a mood to receive him.\n\n"Yes, yes; mamma will be glad. You can smoke there also. And Ivan\nIvanovich is with her."\n\nThe mistress of the house, Sophia Vasilievna, was an invalid. For\neight years she had reclined in laces and ribbons, amid velvet,\ngilding, ivory, bronzes and flowers. She never drove out, and received\nonly her "friends," i. e., whoever, according to her view, in any way\ndistinguished himself from the crowd. Nekhludoff was one of these\nfriends, not only because he was considered a clever young man, but\nalso because his mother was a close friend of the family and he was a\ndesirable match for Missy.\n\nHer room was beyond the small and large drawing-rooms. In the large\ndrawing-room Missy, who preceded Nekhludoff, suddenly stopped, and\nplacing her hands on the back of a gilt chair, looked at him.\n\nMissy was very anxious to be married, and Nekhludoff was a desirable\nparty. Besides, she liked him, and had become accustomed to the\nthought that he would belong to her, and not she to him, and, with the\nunconscious but persistent craftiness of heart-sick persons, she\ngained her end. She addressed him now with the intention of bringing\nforth an explanation.\n\n"I see that something has happened to you," she said. "What is the\nmatter with you?"\n\nThe meeting in the court came to his mind, and he frowned and blushed.\n\n"Yes, something has happened," he said, desiring to be truthful. "It\nwas a strange, extraordinary and important event."\n\n"What was it? Can\'t you tell me?"\n\n"Not now. Don\'t press me for an answer. I have not had the time to\nthink over the matter," he said, blushing still more.\n\n"And you will not tell me?" The muscles on her cheek quivered, and she\npushed away the chair.\n\n"No, I cannot," he answered, feeling that answering her thus he\nanswered himself--admitted to himself that something very important\nhad really happened to him.\n\n"Well, then, come!"\n\nShe shook her head as if desiring to drive away undesirable thoughts,\nand walked forward with a quicker step than usual.\n\nIt seemed to him that she unnaturally compressed her lips in order to\nsuppress her tears. It was painful to him to grieve her, but he knew\nthat the slightest weakness would ruin him, i. e., bind him. And this\nhe feared more than anything else to-day, so he silently followed her\nto the door of the Princess\' apartments.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n\nPrincess Sophia Vasilievna had finished her meal of choice and\nnourishing dishes, which she always took alone, that no one might see\nher performing that unpoetical function. A cup of coffee stood on a\nsmall table near her couch, and she was smoking a cigarette. Princess\nSophia Vasilievna was a lean and tall brunette, with long teeth and\nlarge black eyes, who desired to pass for a young woman.\n\nPeople were making unpleasant remarks about her relations with the\ndoctor. Formerly Nekhludoff had paid no attention to them. But to-day,\nthe sight of the doctor, with his oily, sleek head, which was parted\nin the middle, sitting near her couch, was repulsive to him.\n\nBeside the Princess sat Kolosoff, stirring the coffee. A glass of\nliquor was on the table.\n\nMissy entered, together with Nekhludoff, but she did not remain in the\nroom.\n\n"When mamma gets tired of you and drives you away, come to my room,"\nshe said, turning to Nekhludoff, as if nothing had happened, and,\nsmiling cheerfully, she walked out of the room, her steps deadened by\nthe heavy carpet.\n\n"Well, how do you do, my friend? Sit down and tell us the news," said\nSophia Vasilievna, with an artful, feigned, resembling a perfectly\nnatural, smile, which displayed her beautiful, long, skillfully made,\nalmost natural-looking teeth. "I am told that you returned from the\ncourt in very gloomy spirits. It must be very painful to people with a\nheart," she said in French.\n\n"Yes, that is true," said Nekhludoff. "One often feels his--feels that\nhe has no right to judge others."\n\n"Comme c\'est vrai!" she exclaimed, as if struck by the truth of the\nremark, and, as usual, artfully flattering her friend.\n\n"And what about your picture? It interests me very much," she added.\n"Were it not for my indisposition, I should have visited you long\nago."\n\n"I have given up painting entirely," he answered dryly. Her unjust\nflattery was as apparent to him to-day as was her age, which she\nattempted to conceal. Try as he would, he could not force himself to\nbe pleasant.\n\n"It is too bad! You know, Riepin himself told me that Nekhludoff\npossesses undoubted talent," she said, turning to Kolosoff.\n\n"What a shameless liar!" Nekhludoff thought, frowning.\n\nSeeing that Nekhludoff was in ill humor, and could not be drawn into\npleasant and clear conversation, Sophia Vasilievna turned to Kolosoff\nfor his opinion of the new drama, with an air as if Kolosoff\'s opinion\nwould dispel all doubt and every word of his was destined to become\nimmortalized. Kolosoff condemned the drama and took occasion to state\nhis views on art. The correctness of his views seemed to impress her;\nshe attempted to defend the author of the drama, but immediately\nyielded, or found a middle ground. Nekhludoff looked and listened and\nyet saw and heard but little.\n\nListening now to Sophia Vasilievna, now to Kolosoff, Nekhludoff saw,\nfirst, that neither of them cared either for the drama or for each\nother, and that they were talking merely to satisfy a physiological\ncraving to exercise, after dinner, the muscles of the tongue and\nthroat. Secondly, he saw that Kolosoff, who had drunk brandy, wine and\nliquors, was somewhat tipsy--not as drunk as a drinking peasant, but\nlike a man to whom wine-drinking has become a habit. He did not reel,\nnor did he talk nonsense, but was in an abnormal, excited and\ncontented condition. Thirdly, Nekhludoff saw that Princess Sophia\nVasilievna, during the conversation, now and again anxiously glanced\nat the window, through which a slanting ray of the sun was creeping\ntoward her, threatening to throw too much light on her aged face.\n\n"How true it is," she said of some remark of Kolosoff, and pressed a\nbutton on the wall near the couch.\n\nAt this moment the doctor rose with as little ceremony as one of the\nfamily, and walked out of the room. Sophia Vasilievna followed him\nwith her eyes.\n\n"Please, Phillip, let down that curtain," she said to the\nfine-looking servant who responded to the bell, her eyes pointing to\nthe window.\n\n"Say what you will, but there is something mystical about him, and\nwithout mysticism there is no poetry," she said, with one black eye\nangrily following the movements of the servant who was lowering the\ncurtain.\n\n"Mysticism without poetry is superstition, and poetry without\nmysticism is prose," she continued, smiling sadly, still keeping her\neye on the servant, who was smoothing down the curtain.\n\n"Not that curtain, Phillip--the one at the large window," she said in\na sad voice, evidently pitying herself for the efforts she was\ncompelled to make to say these words, and to calm herself, with her\nring-bedecked hand, she lifted to her lips the fragrant, smoking\ncigarette.\n\nThe broad-chested, muscular Phillip bowed slightly, as if excusing\nhimself, and submissively and silently stepped over to the next\nwindow, and, carefully looking at the Princess, so arranged the\ncurtain that no stray ray should fall on her. It was again\nunsatisfactory, and again the exhausted Princess was obliged to\ninterrupt her conversation about mysticism and correct the\nunintelligent Phillip, who was pitilessly tormenting her. For a moment\nPhillip\'s eyes flashed fire.\n\n"\'The devil knows what you want,\' he is probably saying to himself,"\nNekhludoff thought, as he watched this play. But the handsome, strong\nPhillip concealed his impatience, and calmly carried out the\ninstructions of the enervated, weak, artificial Princess Sophia\nVasilievna.\n\n"Of course there is considerable truth in Darwin\'s theory," said the\nreturning Kolosoff, stretching himself on a low arm-chair and looking\nthrough sleepy eyes at the Princess, "but he goes too far."\n\n"And do you believe in heredity?" she asked Nekhludoff, oppressed by\nhis silence.\n\n"In heredity?" repeated Nekhludoff. "No, I do not," he said, being\nentirely absorbed at the moment by those strange forms which, for some\nreason, appeared to his imagination. Alongside of the strong, handsome\nPhillip, whom he looked upon as a model, he imagined Kolosoff, naked,\nhis abdomen like a water-melon, bald-headed, and his arms hanging\nlike two cords. He also dimly imagined what the silk-covered shoulders\nof Sophia Vasilievna would appear like in reality, but the picture was\ntoo terrible, and he drove it from his mind.\n\nSophia Vasilievna scanned him from head to foot.\n\n"Missy is waiting for you," she said. "Go to her room; she wished to\nplay for you a new composition by Schuman. It is very interesting."\n\n"It isn\'t true. Why should she lie so!" Nekhludoff thought, rising and\npressing her transparent, bony, ring-bedecked hand.\n\nIn the drawing-room he met Katherine Alexeievna, returning to her\nmother\'s apartments. As usual, she greeted him in French.\n\n"I see that the duties of juryman act depressingly upon you," she\nsaid.\n\n"Yes, pardon me. I am in low spirits to-day, and I have no right to\nbore people," answered Nekhludoff.\n\n"Why are you in low spirits?"\n\n"Permit me not to speak of it," he said, looking for his hat as they\nentered the Princess\' cabinet.\n\n"And do you remember telling us that one ought to tell the truth? And\nwhat cruel truths you used to tell us! Why don\'t you tell us now? Do\nyou remember, Missy?" the Princess turned to Missy, who had just\nentered.\n\n"Because that was in play," answered Nekhludoff gravely. "In play it\nis permissible, but in reality we are so bad, that is, I am so bad,\nthat I, at least, cannot tell the truth."\n\n"Don\'t correct yourself, but rather say that we are so bad," said\nKatherine Alexeievna, playing with the words, and pretending not to\nsee Nekhludoff\'s gravity.\n\n"There is nothing worse than to confess being in low spirits," said\nMissy. "I never confess it to myself, and that is why I am always\ncheerful. Well, come to my room. We shall try to drive away your\nmauvais humeur."\n\nNekhludoff experienced the feeling which a horse must feel when\nbrushed down before the bridle is put on and it is led to be harnessed\nto the wagon. But to-day he was not at all disposed to draw. He\nexcused himself and began to take leave. Missy kept his hand longer\nthan usual.\n\n"Remember that what is important to you is important to your friends,"\nshe said. "Will you come to-morrow?"\n\n"I don\'t think I will," said Nekhludoff. And feeling ashamed, without\nknowing himself whether for her or for himself, he blushed and hastily\ndeparted.\n\n"What does it mean? Comme cela m\'intrigue," said Katherine Alexeievna,\nwhen Nekhludoff had left. "I must find it out. Some affaire d\'amour\npropre; il est tres susceptible notre cher Mitia."\n\n"Plutot une affaire d\'amour sale," Missy was going to say. Her face\nwas now wan and pale. But she did not give expression to that passage,\nand only said: "We all have our bright days and gloomy days."\n\n"Is it possible that he, too, should deceive me?" she thought. "After\nall that has happened, it would be very wrong of him."\n\nIf Missy had had to explain what she meant by the words, "After all\nthat has happened," she could have told nothing definite, and yet she\nundoubtedly knew that not only had he given her cause to hope, but he\nhad almost made his promise--not in so many words, but by his glances,\nhis smiles, his innuendos, his silence. She considered him her own,\nand to lose him would be very painful to her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n\n"It is shameful and disgusting," Nekhludoff meditated, while returning\nhome on foot along the familiar streets. The oppressive feeling which\nhe had experienced while speaking to Missy clung to him. He understood\nthat nominally, if one may so express himself, he was in the right; he\nhad never said anything to bind himself to her; had made no offer, but\nin reality he felt that he had bound himself to her, that he had\npromised to be hers. Yet he felt in all his being that he could not\nmarry her.\n\n"It is shameful and disgusting," he repeated, not only of his\nrelations to Missy, but of everything. "Everything is disgusting and\nshameful," he repeated to himself, as he ascended the steps of his\nhouse.\n\n"I shall take no supper," he said to Kornei, who followed him into the\ndining-room, where the table was set for his supper. "You may go."\n\n"All right," said Kornei, but did not go, and began to clear the\ntable. Nekhludoff looked at Kornei and an ill feeling sprung up in his\nheart toward him. He wished to be left in peace, and it seemed as if\neverybody were spitefully worrying him. When Kornei had left,\nNekhludoff went over to the _samovar_, intending to make some tea,\nbut, hearing the footsteps of Agrippina Petrovna, he hastily walked\ninto the drawing-room, closing the door behind him. This was the room\nin which, three months ago, his mother had died. Now, as he entered\nthis room, lighted by two lamps with reflectors--one near a portrait\nof his father, the other near a portrait of his mother--he thought of\nhis relations toward his mother, and these relations seemed to him\nunnatural and repulsive. These, too, were shameful and disgusting. He\nremembered how, during her last sickness, he wished her to die. He\nsaid to himself that he wished it so that she might be spared the\nsuffering, but in reality he wished to spare himself the sight of her\nsuffering.\n\nDesiring to call forth pleasant recollections about her, he looked at\nher portrait, painted by a famous artist for five thousand rubles. She\nwas represented in a black velvet dress with bared breast. The artist\nhad evidently drawn with particular care the breast and the beautiful\nshoulders and neck. That was particularly shameful and disgusting.\nThere was something revolting and sacriligious to him in this\nrepresentation of his mother as a denuded beauty, the more so because\nthree months ago she lay in this very room shrunken like a mummy, and\nfilling the entire house with an oppressive odor. He thought he could\nsmell the odor now. He remembered how, on the day before she died, she\ntook his strong, white hand into her own emaciated, discolored one,\nand, looking into his eyes, said: "Do not judge me, Mitia, if I have\nnot done as I should," and her faded eyes filled with tears.\n\n"How disgusting!" he again repeated to himself, glancing at the\nhalf-nude woman with splendid marble shoulders and arms and a\ntriumphant smile on her lips. The bared bosom of that portrait\nreminded him of another young woman whom he had seen dressed in a\nsimilar way a few days before. It was Missy, who had invited him to\nthe house under some pretext, in order to display before him her\nball-dress. He recalled with disgust her beautiful shoulders and arms;\nand her coarse, brutal father, with his dark past, his cruelties, and\nher mother with her doubtful reputation. All this was disgusting and\nat the same time shameful.\n\n"No, no; I must free myself from all these false relations with the\nKorchagins, with Maria Vasilievna, with the inheritance and all the\nrest," he thought. "Yes, to breathe freely; to go abroad--to Rome--and\ncontinue to work on my picture." He remembered his doubts about his\ntalent. "Well, it is all the same; I will simply breathe freely.\nFirst, I will go to Constantinople, then to Rome--away from this jury\nduty. Yes, and to fix matters with the lawyer----"\n\nAnd suddenly, before his imagination, appeared with uncommon vividness\nthe picture of the prisoner with the black, squinting eyes. And how\nshe wept when the last words of the prisoners were spoken! He hastily\ncrushed the cigarette he was smoking, lit another, and began pacing up\nand down the room. One after another the scenes he had lived through\nwith her rose up in his mind. He recalled their last meeting, the\npassion which seized him at the time, and the disappointment that\nfollowed. He recalled the white dress with the blue ribbon; he\nrecalled the morning mass. "Why, I loved her with a pure love that\nnight; I loved her even before, and how I loved her when I first came\nto my aunts and was writing my composition!" That freshness, youth,\nfullness of life swept over him and he became painfully sad.\n\nThe difference between him as he was then and as he was now was great;\nit was equally great, if not greater, than the difference between\nKatiousha in the church and that girl whom they had tried this\nmorning. Then he was a courageous, free man, before whom opened\nendless possibilities; now he felt himself caught in the tenets of a\nstupid, idle, aimless, miserable life, from which there was no escape;\naye, from which, for the most part, he would not escape. He\nremembered how he once had prided himself upon his rectitude; how he\nalways made it a rule to tell the truth, and was in reality truthful,\nand how he was now steeped in falsehood--falsehood which was\nrecognized as truth by all those around him.\n\nAnd there was no escape from this falsehood; at all events, he did not\nsee any escape. He had sunk in it, became accustomed to it, and\nindulged himself in it.\n\nThe questions that absorbed him now were: How to break loose from\nMaria Vasilievna and her husband, so that he might be able to look\nthem in the face? How, without falsehood, to disentangle his relations\nwith Missy? How to get out of the inconsistency of considering the\nprivate holding of land unjust and keeping his inheritance? How to\nblot out his sin against Katiousha? "I cannot abandon the woman whom I\nhave loved and content myself with paying money to the lawyer to save\nher from penal servitude, which she does not even deserve." To blot\nout the sin, as he did then, when he thought that he was atoning for\nhis wrong by giving her money! Impossible!\n\nHe vividly recalled the moment when he ran after her in the corridor,\nthrust money in her bosom, and ran away from her. "Oh, that money!"\nWith the same horror and disgust he recalled that moment. "Oh, how\ndisgusting!" he said aloud, as he did then. "Only a scoundrel and\nrascal could do it! And I am that scoundrel, that rascal!" he said\naloud. "It is possible that I--" and he stopped in the middle of the\nroom--"Is it possible that I am really a scoundrel? Who but I?" he\nanswered himself. "And is this the only thing?" he continued, still\ncensuring himself. "Are not my relations toward Maria Vasilievna base\nand detestable? And my position with regard to property? Under the\nplea that I inherited it from my mother I am using wealth, the\nownership of which I consider unlawful. And the whole of this idle,\nabominable life? And to crown all, my conduct toward Katiousha?\nScoundrel! Villain! Let people judge me as they please--I can deceive\nthem, but I cannot deceive myself."\n\nAnd he suddenly understood that the disgust which he had lately felt\ntoward everybody, and especially to-day toward the Prince and Maria\nVasilievna, and Missy, and Kornei, was disgust with himself. And in\nthis confession of his own baseness there was something painful, and\nat the same time joyous and calming.\n\nIn the course of his life Nekhludoff often experienced what he called\na "cleansing of the soul." This happened when, after a long period of\nretardation, or, perhaps, entire cessation of his inner life, he\nsuddenly became aware of it, and proceeded to cleanse his soul of all\nthe accumulated filth that caused this standstill.\n\nAfter such awakenings Nekhludoff always laid down some rules for\nhimself which he intended to follow all the rest of his life; kept a\ndiary and began a new life, which he hoped he should never change\nagain--"turning a new leaf," he used to call it. But the temptations\nof life entrapped him anew, after every awakening, and, without\nknowing it, he sank again, often to a lower depth than he was in\nbefore.\n\nThus he cleansed himself and revived several times. His first\ncleansing happened when he visited his aunts. That was the brightest\nand most enthusiastic awakening. And it lasted a long time. The next\nhappened when he left the civil service, and, desiring to sacrifice\nhis life, he entered, during the war, the military service. Here he\nbegan to sink quickly. The next awakening occurred when he retired\nfrom the military service, and, going abroad, gave himself up to\npainting.\n\nFrom that day to this there was a long period of uncleanliness, the\nlongest he had gone through yet, and, therefore, he had never sunk so\ndeep, and never before was there such discord between the demands of\nhis conscience and the life which he was leading. So, when he saw the\nchasm which separated the two, he was horrified.\n\nThe discord was so great, the defilement so thorough, that at first he\ndespaired of the possibility of a complete cleansing. "Why, you have\ntried to improve before, and failed," the tempter in his soul\nwhispered. "What is the good of trying again? You are not the only\none--all are alike. Such is life." But the free, spiritual being which\nalone is true, alone powerful, alone eternal, was already awake in\nNekhludoff. And he could not help believing it. However great the\ndifference between that which he was and that which he wished to be,\nfor the awakened spiritual being everything was possible.\n\n"I shall break this lie that binds me at any cost. I will confess the\ntruth to everybody, and will act the truth," he said aloud,\nresolutely. "I will tell Missy the truth--that I am a profligate and\ncannot marry her; that I have trifled with her. I will tell Maria\nVasilevna (the wife of the marshal of nobility)--but no, what is the\ngood of telling her? I will tell her husband that I am a scoundrel,\nthat I have deceived him. I will dispose of my inheritance in\naccordance with the demands of justice. I will tell her, Katiousha,\nthat I am a knave, that I have wronged her, and will do everything in\nmy power to alleviate her condition. Yes, I shall see her, and beg her\nforgiveness--I will beg like a child."\n\nHe stopped.\n\n"I will marry her, if necessary."\n\nHe crossed his hands on his breast, as he used to do when a child,\nraised his eyes and said:\n\n"Lord, help me, teach me; come and enter within me and purify me of\nall this abomination."\n\nHe prayed, asked God to help him and purify him, while that which he\nwas praying for had already happened. Not only did he feel the\nfreedom, vigor and gladness of life, but he also felt the power of\ngood. He felt himself capable of doing the best that man can do.\n\nThere were tears in his eyes when he said these things--tears of\njoy--on the awakening within him of that spiritual being, and tears of\nemotion over his own virtue.\n\nHe felt warm and opened a window which looked into a garden. It was a\nmoonlit, fresh and quiet night. Past the street rattled some vehicle,\nand then everything was quiet. Directly beneath the window a tall,\ndenuded poplar threw its shadow on the gravel of the landing-place,\ndistinctly showing all the ramifications of its bare branches. To the\nleft the roof of a shed seemed white under the bright light of the\nmoon; in front were the tangled branches of the trees, through which\nwas seen the dark shadow of the garden inclosure.\n\nNekhludoff looked at the moonlit garden and roof, the shadows of the\npoplar, and drank in the fresh, invigorating air.\n\n"How delightful! My God, how delightful!" he said of that which was in\nhis soul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n\nIt was six o\'clock when Maslova returned to her cell, weary and\nfoot-sore from the long tramp over the stone pavement. Besides, she\nwas crushed by the unexpectedly severe sentence, and was also hungry.\n\nWhen, during a recess, her guards had lunched on bread and hard-boiled\neggs her mouth watered and she felt that she was hungry, but\nconsidered it humiliating to ask them for some food. Three hours after\nthat her hunger had passed, and she only felt weak. In this condition\nshe heard the sentence. At first she thought that she misunderstood\nit; she could not believe what she heard, and could not reconcile\nherself to the idea that she was a convict. But, seeing the calm,\nserious faces of the judges and the jury, who received the verdict as\nsomething quite natural, she revolted and cried out that she was\ninnocent. And when she saw also that her outcry, too, was taken as\nsomething natural and anticipated, and which could not alter the case,\nshe began to weep. She felt that she must submit to the cruel\ninjustice which was perpetrated on her. What surprised her most was\nthat she should be so cruelly condemned by men--not old men, but those\nsame young men who looked at her so kindly.\n\nThe prosecuting attorney was the only man whose glances were other\nthan kind. While she was sitting in the prisoners\' room, and during\nrecesses she saw these men passing by her and entering the room under\nvarious pretexts, but with the obvious intention of looking at her.\nAnd now these same men, for some reason, sentenced her to hard labor,\nalthough she was innocent of the crime. For some time she wept, then\nbecame calm, and in a condition of complete exhaustion she waited to\nbe taken away. She desired but one thing now--a cigarette. She was in\nthis frame of mind when Bochkova and Kartinkin were brought into the\nroom. Bochkova immediately began to curse her.\n\n"You are innocent, aren\'t you? Why weren\'t you discharged, you vile\nthing? You got your deserts! You will drop your fineries in Siberia!"\n\nMaslova sat with lowered head, her hands folded in the sleeves of her\ncoat, and gazed on the smoothly trampled ground.\n\n"I am not interfering with you, so leave me in peace," she repeated\nseveral times, then became silent. She became enlivened again when,\nafter Bochkova and Kartinkin had been removed from the room, the guard\nentered, bringing her three rubles.\n\n"Are you Maslova?" he asked.\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Here is some money which a lady sent you," he said.\n\n"What lady?"\n\n"Take it, and ask no questions."\n\nThe money was sent by Kitaeva. When leaving the court she asked the\nusher if she could send some money to Maslova, and, receiving an\naffirmative answer, she removed a chamois glove, and, from the back\nfolds of her silk dress, produced a stylish pocket-book, and counted\nout the money into the hands of the usher who, in her presence, handed\nit to the guard.\n\n"Please be sure to give it to her," said Karolina Albertoona to the\nguard.\n\nThe guard was offended by this distrust shown to him, which was the\ncause of his speaking angrily to Maslova.\n\nMaslova was overjoyed by the receipt of the money, for it could give\nher the one thing she wished for now.\n\nAll her thoughts were now centered on her desire to inhale the smoke\nof a cigarette. So strong was this desire that she greedily inhaled\nthe smoke-laden air which was wafted in from the corridor and through\nthe cabinet door. But there was a long wait before her, for the\nsecretary, who was to deliver to the guard the order for her removal,\nforgetting the prisoners, engaged one of the lawyers in the discussion\nof an editorial that had appeared in a newspaper.\n\nAt five o\'clock she was finally led down through the rear door. While\nin the waiting-room she gave one of the guards twenty kopecks, asking\nhim to buy for her two lunch rolls and some cigarettes. The guard\nlaughed, took the money, honestly made the purchase and returned the\nchange to her. She could not smoke on the road, so Maslova arrived at\nthe jail with the same unsatisfied craving for a cigarette. At that\nmoment about a hundred prisoners were brought from the railroad\nstation. Maslova met them in the passageway.\n\nThe prisoners, bearded, clean-shaven, old, young, Russians and\nforeigners--some with half-shaved heads, and with a clinking of iron\nfetters, filled the passage with dust, tramping of feet, conversation\nand a sharp odor of perspiration. The prisoners, as they passed\nMaslova, scanned her from head to foot; some approached and teased\nher.\n\n"Fine girl, that!" said one. "My compliments, auntie," said another,\nwinking one eye. A dark man with a shaven, blue neck and long\nmustache, tangling in his fetters, sprang toward her and embraced her.\n\n"Don\'t you recognize your friend? Come, don\'t put on such style!" he\nexclaimed, grinning as she pushed him away.\n\n"What are you doing, you rascal?" shouted the officer in charge of the\nprisoners.\n\nThe prisoner hastily hid himself in the crowd. The officer fell upon\nMaslova.\n\n"What are you doing here?"\n\nMaslova was going to say that she had been brought from the court, but\nshe was very tired and too lazy to speak.\n\n"She is just from the court, sir," said one of the guards, elbowing\nhis way through the passing crowd, and raising his hand to his cap.\n\n"Then take her to the warden. What indecencies!"\n\n"Very well, sir!"\n\n"Sokoloff! Take her away!" shouted the officer.\n\nSokoloff came and angrily pushed Maslova by the shoulder, and,\nmotioning to her to follow him, he led her into the woman\'s corridor.\nThere she was thoroughly searched, and as nothing was found upon her\n(the box of cigarettes was hidden in the lunch roll), she was admitted\ninto the same cell from which she had emerged in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n\nThe cell in which Maslova was confined was an oblong room, twenty feet\nby fifteen. The kalsomining of the walls was peeled off, and the dry\nboards of the cots occupied two-thirds of the space. In the middle of\nthe room, opposite the door, was a dark iron, with a wax candle stuck\non it, and a dusty bouquet of immortelles hanging under it. To the\nleft, behind the door, on a darkened spot of the floor, stood an\nill-smelling vat. The women had been locked up for the night.\n\nThere were fifteen inmates of this cell, twelve women and three\nchildren.\n\nIt was not dark yet, and only two women lay in their cots; one a\nfoolish little woman--she was constantly crying--who had been arrested\nbecause she had no written evidence of her identity, had her head\ncovered with her coat; the other, a consumptive, was serving a\nsentence for theft. She was not sleeping, but lay, her coat under her\nhead, with wide-open eyes, and with difficulty retaining in her throat\nthe tickling, gurgling phlegm, so as not to cough. The other women\nwere with bare heads and skirts of coarse linen; some sat on their\ncots sewing; others stood at the window gazing on the passing\nprisoners. Of the three women who were sewing, one, Korableva, was the\none who had given Maslova the instructions when the latter left the\ncell. She was a tall, strong woman, with a frowning, gloomy face, all\nwrinkled, a bag of skin hanging under her chin, a short braid of light\nhair, turning gray at the temples, and a hairy wart on her cheek. This\nold woman was sentenced to penal servitude for killing her husband\nwith an axe. The killing was committed because he annoyed her daughter\nwith improper advances. She was the overseer of the cell, and also\nsold wine to the inmates. She was sewing with eye-glasses, and held\nthe needle, after the fashion of the peasants, with three fingers,\nthe sharp point turned toward her breast. Beside her, also sewing, sat\na little woman, good-natured and talkative, dark, snub-nosed and with\nlittle black eyes. She was the watch-woman at a flag-station, and was\nsentenced to three months\' imprisonment for negligently causing an\naccident on the railroad. The third of the women who were occupied\nwith sewing was Theodosia--called Fenichka by her fellow-prisoners--of\nlight complexion, and with rosy cheeks; young, lovely, with bright,\nchildish blue eyes, and two long, flaxen braids rolled up on her small\nhead. She was imprisoned for attempting to poison her husband. She was\nsixteen years old when she was married, and she made the attempt\nimmediately after her marriage. During the eight months that she was\nout on bail, she not only became reconciled to her husband, but became\nso fond of him that the court officers found them living in perfect\nharmony. In spite of all the efforts of her husband, her\nfather-in-law, and especially her mother-in-law, who had grown very\nfond of her, to obtain her discharge, she was sentenced to hard labor\nin Siberia. The kind, cheerful and smiling Theodosia, whose cot was\nnext to Maslova\'s, not only took a liking to her, but considered it\nher duty to help her in every possible way. Two other women were\nsitting idly on their cots; one of about forty years, who seemed to\nhave been pretty in her youth, but was now pale and slim, was feeding\na child with her long, white breast. Her crime consisted in that, when\nthe people of the village she belonged to attempted to stop a\nrecruiting officer who had drafted, illegally, as they thought, her\nnephew, she was the first to take hold of the bridle of his horse.\nThere was another little white-haired, wrinkled woman, good-natured\nand hunch-backed, who sat near the oven and pretended to be catching a\nfour-year-old, short-haired and stout boy, who, in a short little\nshirt, was running past her, laughing and repeating: "You tan\'t tatch\nme!" This old woman, who, with her son, was charged with incendiarism,\nbore her confinement good-naturedly, grieving only over her son, who\nwas also in jail, but above all, her heart was breaking for her old\nman who, she feared, would be eaten up by lice, as her daughter-in-law\nhad returned to her parents, and there was no one to wash him.\n\nBesides these seven women, there were four others who stood near the\nopen windows, their hands resting on the iron gratings, and conversing\nby signs and shouts with the prisoners whom Maslova had met in the\npassageway. One of these, who was serving a sentence for theft, was a\nflabby, large, heavy, red-haired woman with white-yellow freckles over\nher face, and a stout neck which was exposed by the open waist collar.\nIn a hoarse voice she shouted indecent words through the window.\nBeside her stood a woman of the size of a ten-year-old girl, very\ndark, with a long back and very short legs. Her face was red and\nblotched; her black eyes wide open, and her short, thick lips failed\nto hide her white, protruding teeth. She laughed in shrill tones at\nthe antics of the prisoners. This prisoner, who was nicknamed Miss\nDandy, because of her stylishness, was under indictment for theft and\nincendiarism. Behind them, in a very dirty, gray shirt, stood a\nwretched-looking woman, big with child, who was charged with\nconcealing stolen property. This woman was silent, but she approvingly\nsmiled at the actions of the prisoners without. The fourth of the\nwomen who stood at the window, and was undergoing sentence for illicit\ntrading in spirits, was a squat little country woman with bulging eyes\nand kindly face. She was the mother of the boy who was playing with\nthe old woman, and of another seven-year-old girl, both of whom were\nin jail with her, because they had no one else to take care of them.\nKnitting a stocking, she was looking through the window and\ndisapprovingly frowned and closed her eyes at the language used by the\npassing prisoners. The girl who stood near the red-haired woman, with\nonly a shirt on her back, and clinging with one hand to the woman\'s\nskirt, attentively listened to the abusive words the men were\nexchanging with the women, and repeated them in a whisper, as if\ncommitting them to memory. The twelfth was the daughter of a church\nclerk and chanter who had drowned her child in a well. She was a tall\nand stately girl, with large eyes and tangled hair sticking out of her\nshort, thick, flaxen braid. She paid no attention to what was going on\naround her, but paced, bare-footed, and in a dirty gray shirt, over\nthe floor of the cell, making sharp and quick turns when she reached\nthe wall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n\nWhen with a rattling of chains the cell door was unlocked and Maslova\nadmitted, all eyes were turned toward her. Even the chanter\'s daughter\nstopped for a moment and looked at her with raised eyebrows, but\nimmediately resumed walking with long, resolute strides. Korableva\nstuck her needle into the sack she was sewing and gazed inquiringly\nthrough her glasses at Maslova.\n\n"Ah me! So she has returned," she said in a hoarse basso voice. "And I\nwas sure she would be set right. She must have got it."\n\nShe removed her glasses and placed them with her sewing beside her.\n\n"I have been talking with auntie, dear, and we thought that they might\ndischarge you at once. They say it happens. And they sometimes give\nyou money, if you strike the right time," the watch-woman started in a\nsinging voice. "What ill-luck! It seems we were wrong. God has His own\nway, dear," she went on in her caressing and melodious voice.\n\n"It is possible that they convicted you?" asked Theodosia, with gentle\ncompassion, looking at Maslova with her childish, light-blue eyes, and\nher cheerful, young face changed, and she seemed to be ready to cry.\n\nMaslova made no answer, but silently went to her place, next to\nKorableva\'s, and sat down.\n\n"You have probably not eaten anything," said Theodosia, rising and\ngoing over to Maslova.\n\nAgain Maslova did not answer, but placed the two lunch-rolls at the\nhead of the cot and began to undress. She took off the dusty coat, and\nthe \'kerchief from her curling black hair and sat down.\n\nThe hunch-backed old woman also came and stopped in front of Maslova,\ncompassionately shaking her head.\n\nThe boy came behind the old woman, and, with a protruding corner of\nthe upper lip and wide-open eyes, gazed on the rolls brought by\nMaslova. Seeing all these compassionate faces, after what had\nhappened, Maslova almost cried and her lips began to twitch. She\ntried to and did restrain herself until the old woman and the child\napproached. When, however, she heard the kind, compassionate\nexclamation of pity from the old woman, and, especially, when her eyes\nmet the serious eyes of the boy who looked now at her, now at the\nrolls, she could restrain herself no longer. Her whole face began to\ntwitch and she burst into sobs.\n\n"I told her to take a good lawyer," said Korableva. "Well? To\nSiberia?" she asked.\n\nMaslova wished to answer but could not, and, crying, she produced from\nthe roll the box of cigarettes, on which a picture of a red lady with\na high chignon and triangle-shaped, low cut neck was printed, and gave\nit to Korableva. The latter looked at the picture, disapprovingly\nshook her head, chiefly because Maslova spent money so foolishly, and,\nlighting a cigarette over the lamp, inhaled the smoke several times,\nthen thrust it at Maslova. Maslova, without ceasing to cry, eagerly\nbegan to inhale the smoke.\n\n"Penal servitude," she murmured, sobbing.\n\n"They have no fear of God, these cursed blood-suckers!" said\nKorableva. "They have condemned an innocent girl."\n\nAt this moment there was a loud outburst of laughter among those\nstanding near the window. The delicate laughter of the little girl\nmingled with the hoarse and shrill laughter of the women. This\nmerriment was caused by some act of a prisoner without.\n\n"Oh, the scoundrel! See what he is doing!" said the red-headed woman,\npressing her face against the grating, her whole massive frame\nshaking.\n\n"What is that drum-hide shouting about?" said Korableva, shaking her\nhead at the red-haired woman, and then again turning to Maslova. "How\nmany years?"\n\n"Four," said Maslova, and the flow of her tears was so copious that\none of them fell on the cigarette. She angrily crushed it, threw it\naway and took another.\n\nThe watch-woman, although she was no smoker, immediately picked up the\ncigarette-end and began to straighten it, talking at the same time.\n\n"As I said to Matveievna, dear," she said, "it is ill-luck. They do\nwhat they please. And we thought they would discharge you. Matveievna\nsaid you would be discharged, and I said that you would not, I said.\n\'My heart tells me,\' I said, \'that they will condemn her,\' and so it\nhappened," she went on, evidently listening to the sounds of her own\nvoice with particular pleasure.\n\nThe prisoners had now passed through the court-yard, and the four\nwomen left the window and approached Maslova. The larged-eyed illicit\nseller of spirits was the first to speak.\n\n"Well, is the sentence very severe?" she asked, seating herself near\nMaslova and continuing to knit her stocking.\n\n"It is severe because she has no money. If she had money to hire a\ngood lawyer, I am sure they would not have held her," said Korableva.\n"That lawyer--what\'s his name?--that clumsy, big-nosed one can, my\ndear madam, lead one out of the water dry. That\'s the man you should\ntake."\n\n"To hire him!" grinned Miss Dandy. "Why, he would not look at you for\nless than a thousand rubles."\n\n"It seems to be your fate," said the old woman who was charged with\nincendiarism. "I should say he is severe! He drove my boy\'s wife from\nher; put him in jail, and me, too, in my old age," for the hundredth\ntime she began to repeat her story. "Prison and poverty are our lot.\nIf it is not prison, it is poverty."\n\n"Yes, it is always the same with them," said the woman-moonshiner,\nand, closely inspecting the girl\'s head, she put her stocking aside,\ndrew the girl over between her overhanging legs and with dexterous\nfingers began to search in her head. "Why do you deal in wine? But I\nhave to feed my children," she said, continuing her search.\n\nThese words reminded Maslova of wine.\n\n"Oh, for a drop of wine," she said to Korableva, wiping her tears with\nthe sleeve of her shirt and sobbing from time to time.\n\n"Some booze? Why, of course!" said Korableva.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n\nMaslova produced the money from one of the lunch-rolls and gave it to\nKorableva, who climbed up to the draught-hole of the oven for a flask\nof wine she had hidden there. Seeing which, those women who were not\nher immediate neighbors went to their places. Meantime Maslova shook\nthe dust from her \'kerchief and coat, climbed up on her cot and began\nto eat a roll.\n\n"I saved some tea for you, but I fear it is cold," said Theodosia,\nbringing down from a shelf a pot, wrapped in a rag, and a tin cup.\n\nThe beverage was perfectly cold, and tasted more of tin than of tea,\nbut Maslova poured out a cupful and began to drink.\n\n"Here, Finashka!" she called, and breaking a piece from the roll\nthrust it toward the boy, who gazed at her open-mouthed.\n\nKorableva, meanwhile, brought the flask of wine. Maslova offered some\nto Korableva and Miss Dandy. These three prisoners constituted the\naristocracy of the cell, because they had money and divided among\nthemselves what they had.\n\nIn a few minutes Maslova became brighter and energetically began to\nrelate what had transpired at the court, mockingly imitating the\nprosecutor and rehearsing such parts as had appealed to her most. She\nwas particularly impressed by the fact that the men paid considerable\nattention to her wherever she went. In the court-room every one looked\nat her, she said, and for that purpose constantly came into the\nprisoners\' room.\n\n"Even the guard said: \'It is to look at you that they come here.\' Some\none would come and ask for some document or something, but I saw that\nit was not for the document that he came. He would devour me with his\neyes," she said, smiling and shaking her head as if perplexed. "They\nare good ones!"\n\n"Yes, that is how it is," chimed in the watch-woman in her melodious\nvoice. "They are like flies on sugar. If you needed them for any other\npurpose, be sure they would not come so quickly. They know a good\nthing when they see it."\n\n"It was the same here," interrupted Maslova. "As soon as I was brought\nhere I met with a party coming from the depot. They gave me no rest,\nand I could hardly get rid of them. Luckily the warden drove them off.\nOne of them bothered me particularly."\n\n"How did he look?" asked Miss Dandy.\n\n"He had a dark complexion, and wore a mustache."\n\n"It is he."\n\n"Who?"\n\n"Stchegloff. He passed here just now."\n\n"Who is Stchegloff?"\n\n"She don\'t know Stchegloff! He twice escaped from Siberia. Now he has\nbeen caught, but he will escape again. Even the officers fear him,"\nsaid Miss Dandy, who delivered notes to prisoners, and knew everything\nthat transpired in the jail. "He will surely escape."\n\n"If he does he won\'t take either of us with him," said Korableva.\n"You\'d better tell me this: What did the lawyer say to you about a\npetition--you must send one now."\n\nMaslova said that she did not know anything about a petition.\n\nAt this moment the red-haired woman, burying her two freckled hands\ninto her tangled, thick hair, and scratching her head with her nails,\napproached the wine-drinking aristocrats.\n\n"I will tell you, Katherine, everything," she began. "First of all,\nyou must write on paper: \'I am not satisfied with the trial,\' and then\nhand it to the prosecutor."\n\n"What do you want here?" Korableva turned to her, speaking in an angry\nbasso. "You have smelled the wine! We know you. We don\'t need your\nadvice; we know what we have to do."\n\n"Who is talking to you?"\n\n"You want some wine--that\'s what you want."\n\n"Let her alone. Give her some," said Maslova, who always divided with\nothers what she had.\n\n"Yes, I will give her," and Korableva clenched her fist.\n\n"Try it! Try it!" moving toward Korableva, said the red-haired woman.\n"I am not afraid of you."\n\n"You jail bird!"\n\n"You are another!"\n\n"You gutter rake!"\n\n"I am a rake--am I? You convict, murderess!" shrieked the red-haired\nwoman.\n\n"Go away, I tell you!" said Korableva frowning.\n\nBut the red-haired woman only came nearer, and Korableva gave her a\npush on the open, fat breast. The other seemingly only waited for\nthis, for with an unexpected, quick movement of one hand she seized\nKorableva\'s hair and was about to strike her in the face with the\nother, when Korableva seized this hand. Maslova and Miss Dandy sprang\nup and took hold of the hands of the red-haired woman, endeavoring to\nrelease her hold on Korableva, but the hand that clutched the hair\nwould not open. For a moment she released the hair, but only to wind\nit around her fist. Korableva, her head bent, with one hand kept\nstriking her antagonist over the body and catching the latter\'s hand\nwith her teeth. The women crowded around the fighters, parting them\nand shouting. Even the consumptive came near them, and, coughing,\nlooked on. The children huddled together and cried. The noise\nattracted the warden and the matron. They were finally parted.\nKorableva loosened her gray braid and began to pick out the pieces of\ntorn hair, while the other held the tattered remnant of her shirt to\nher breast--both shouting, explaining and complaining against one\nanother.\n\n"I know it is the wine--I can smell it," said the matron. "I will tell\nthe superintendent to-morrow. Now, remove everything, or there will be\ntrouble. There is no time to listen to you. To your places, and be\nsilent!"\n\nBut for a long time there was no silence. The women continued to curse\neach other; they began to relate how it all commenced, and whose fault\nit was. The warden and matron finally departed; the women quieted down\nand took to their cots. The old woman stood up before the image and\nbegan to pray.\n\n"Two Siberian convicts," suddenly said the red-haired woman in a\nhoarse voice, accompanying every word with a torrent of abuse.\n\n"Look out, or you will get it again," quickly answered Korableva,\nadding similar revilement. Then they became silent.\n\n"If they had not prevented me, I should have knocked out your eyes,"\nthe red-haired one began again, and again came a quick and sharp\nretort.\n\nThen came another interval of silence, followed by more abuse. The\nintervals became longer and longer, and finally silence settled over\nthe cell.\n\nThey were all falling asleep; some began to snore; only the old woman,\nwho always prayed for a long time, was still bowing before the image,\nwhile the chanter\'s daughter, as soon as the matron left the cell,\ncame down from her cot and began to walk up and down the cell.\n\nMaslova was awake and incessantly thinking of herself as a convict,\nthe word which had been twice applied to her--once by Bochkova, and\nagain by the red-haired woman. She could not be reconciled to the\nthought. Korableva, who was lying with her back turned toward Maslova,\nturned around.\n\n"I never dreamed of such a thing," she said, in a low voice. "Others\ncommit heaven knows what crimes, and they go scot free, while I must\nsuffer for nothing."\n\n"Don\'t worry, girl. People live also in Siberia. You will not be lost\neven there," Korableva consoled her.\n\n"I know that I will not be lost, but it is painful to be treated that\nway. I deserved a better fate. I am used to a comfortable life."\n\n"You can do nothing against God\'s will," Korableva said, with a sigh.\n"You can do nothing against His will."\n\n"I know, auntie, but it is hard, nevertheless."\n\nThey became silent.\n\n"Listen to that wanton," said Korableva, calling Maslova\'s attention\nto the strange sounds that came from the other end of the cell.\n\nThese sounds were the suppressed sobbing of the red-haired woman. She\nwept because she had just been abused, beaten, and got no wine, for\nwhich she so yearned. She also wept because her whole life was one\nround of abuse, scorn, insults and blows. She meant to draw some\nconsolation from the recollection of her first love for the factory\nhand, Fedka Molodenkoff, but, recalling this first love, she also\nrecalled the manner of its ending. The end of it was that this\nMolodenkoff, while in his cups, by way of jest, smeared her face with\nvitriol, and afterward laughed with his comrades as he watched her\nwrithing in pain. She remembered this, and she pitied herself; and,\nthinking that no one heard her, she began to weep, and wept like a\nchild--moaning, snuffling and swallowing salty tears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n\nNekhludoff rose the following morning with a consciousness that some\nchange had taken place within him, and before he could recall what it\nwas he already knew that it was good and important.\n\n"Katiousha--the trial. Yes, and I must stop lying, and tell all the\ntruth." And what a remarkable coincidence! That very morning finally\ncame the long-expected letter of Maria Vasilievna, the wife of the\nmarshal of the nobility--that same letter that he wanted so badly now.\nShe gave him his liberty and wished him happiness in his proposed\nmarriage.\n\n"Marriage!" he repeated ironically. "How far I am from it!"\n\nAnd his determination of the day before to tell everything to her\nhusband, to confess his sin before him, and to hold himself ready for\nany satisfaction he might demand, came to his mind. But this morning\nit did not seem to him so easy as it had yesterday. "And then, what is\nthe good of making a man miserable? If he asks me, I will tell him;\nbut to call on him specially for that purpose---- No, it is not\nnecessary."\n\nIt seemed to him equally difficult this morning to tell all the truth\nto Missy. He thought it would be offering an insult. It was\ninevitable, as in all worldly affairs, that there should remain\nsomething unexpressed but understood. One thing, however, he decided\nupon this morning--that he would not go there, and would tell the\ntruth when asked. But in his relations toward Katiousha there was to\nbe nothing unsaid.\n\n"I will go to the jail--will tell her, beg of her to forgive me. And,\nif necessary--yes, if necessary--I will marry her," he thought.\n\nThe idea that for the sake of moral satisfaction he would sacrifice\neverything and marry her this morning particularly affected him.\n\nIt was a long time since he had risen with so much energy in him. When\nAgrippina Petrovna entered his room he declared to her with a\ndetermination which he himself did not expect, that he had no further\nneed of the house, and that he would dispense with her services. There\nwas a tacit understanding that the large house was kept up for his\ncontemplated marriage. The closing up of the house consequently had\nsome particular significance. Agrippina Petrovna looked at him with\nsurprise.\n\n"I thank you very much, Agrippina Petrovna, for your solicitude in my\nbehalf, but I do not now need such a large house, or any of the\nservants. If you wish to help me, then be so kind as to pack away the\nthings as you used to do in mamma\'s lifetime. Natasha will dispose of\nthem when she arrives." Natasha was Nekhludoff\'s sister.\n\nAgrippina Petrovna shook her head.\n\n"Dispose of them? Why, they will be needed," she said.\n\n"No, they will not, Agrippina Petrovna--they will positively not be\nneeded," said Nekhludoff, answering what she meant by shaking his\nhead. "Please tell Kornei that his salary will be paid for two months\nin advance, but that I do not need him."\n\n"You are wrong in doing this, Dmitri Ivanovich," she said. "You will\nneed a house even if you go abroad."\n\n"You misunderstand me, Agrippina Petrovna. I will not go abroad, and\nif I do go, it will be to an entirely different place."\n\nHis face suddenly turned a purple color.\n\n"Yes, it is necessary to tell her," he thought. "I must tell all to\neverybody.\n\n"A very strange and important thing has happened to me. Do you\nremember Katiousha, who lived with Aunt Maria Ivanovna?"\n\n"Of course; I taught her to sew."\n\n"Well, then, she was tried in court yesterday, and I was one of the\njury."\n\n"Ah, good Lord! what a pity!" said Agrippina Petrovna. "What was she\ntried for?"\n\n"Murder, and it was all caused by me."\n\n"How could you have caused it? You are talking very strangely," said\nAgrippina Petrovna, and fire sparkled in her old eyes.\n\nShe knew of the incident with Katiousha.\n\n"Yes, it is my fault. And this causes me to change my plans."\n\n"What change can this cause in your plans?" said Agrippina Petrovna,\nsuppressing a smile.\n\n"This: That since it was through my fault that she is in her present\ncondition, I consider it my duty to help her to the extent of my\nability."\n\n"That is your affair, but I cannot see that you are so much in fault.\nIt happens to everybody, and if one is guided by common sense the\nmatter is usually arranged and forgotten, and one lives on like the\nrest of the world," said Agrippina Petrovna, sternly and seriously.\n"There is no reason why you should take it so much to heart. I heard\nlong ago that she had gone to the bad, so whose fault is it?"\n\n"It is my fault, and that is why I wish to make amends."\n\n"Well, it is hard to set that right."\n\n"That is my affair. If you are thinking of yourself, then that which\nmother wished----"\n\n"I am not thinking of myself. Your deceased mother showed me so many\nfavors that I do not desire anything. My niece, Lizauka, wishes me to\ncome to her, so I will go as soon as you need me no longer. Only you\nare taking it too much to heart; it happens with everybody."\n\n"Well, I do not think so. I still ask you to help me rent the house\nand pack away the things. And do not be angry with me. I am very, very\nthankful to you for everything."\n\nIt is remarkable that since Nekhludoff understood that he was\ndisgusted with himself, others ceased to be repulsive to him. On the\ncontrary, he had a kindly and respectful feeling for Agrippina\nPetrovna and Kornei. He wished to confess also before Kornei, but the\nlatter was so impressively respectful that he could not make up his\nmind to do it.\n\nOn his way to the court, passing along the familiar streets and in the\nsame carriage, Nekhludoff was himself surprised what a different man\nhe felt himself to-day.\n\nHis marriage to Missy, which but yesterday seemed to be so near,\nto-day appeared to him absolutely impossible. Yesterday he understood\nhis position to be such that there could be no doubt that she would be\nhappy to marry him; to-day he felt himself unworthy not only of\nmarrying her, but of being her friend. "If she only knew who I was,\nshe would never receive me, and yet I taunted her with coquetting with\nthat gentleman. But no, even if she married me I should never have\npeace, even though I were happy, while that one is in jail, and may\nany day be sent under escort to Siberia. While the woman whom I have\nruined is tramping the weary road to penal servitude, I will be\nreceiving congratulations, and paying visits with my young wife. Or I\nwill be counting the votes for and against school inspection, etc.,\nwith the marshal, whom I have shamefully deceived, and afterward make\nappointments with his wife (what abomination!). Or I will work on my\npicture, which will, evidently, never be finished, for I had no\nbusiness to occupy myself with such trifles. And I can do neither of\nthese things now," he said to himself, happy at the inward change\nwhich he felt.\n\n"First of all," he thought, "I must see the lawyer, and then--then see\nher in jail--the convict of yesterday--and tell her everything."\n\nAnd when he thought how he would see her, confess his guilt before\nher, how he would declare to her that he would do everything in his\npower, marry her in order to wipe out his guilt, he became\nenraptured, and tears filled his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n\nArriving at the court-house, Nekhludoff met the usher in the corridor\nand asked him where the prisoners already sentenced were kept, and\nfrom whom permission could be obtained to see them. The usher told him\nthat the prisoners were kept in various places, and that before final\njudgment the public prosecutor was the only person from whom\npermission to see them could be obtained. "The prosecutor has not\narrived yet; when he does I will let you know, and will escort you\nmyself to him after the session. And now, please to walk into the\ncourt. The session is commencing."\n\nNekhludoff thanked the usher, who seemed to him particularly pitiful\nto-day, and went into the jury-room.\n\nAs Nekhludoff was approaching the jury-room his fellow jurors were\ncoming out, repairing to the court-room. The merchant was as cheerful,\nhad lunched as well as yesterday, and greeted Nekhludoff like an old\nfriend. The loud laughter and familiarity of Peter Gerasimovitch did\nnot give rise to-day in Nekhludoff of the unpleasant sensation of\nyesterday.\n\nNekhludoff wished to tell all the jurymen of his relations to the\nwoman whom they had convicted yesterday. "It would have been proper,"\nhe thought, "yesterday to rise in court and publicly confess my\nguilt." But when with the other jurymen he entered the court-room and\nwitnessed the same procedure, the same "Hear ye! Hear ye!" the three\njudges in high collars on the elevation, the silence, the seating of\nthe jury on high-backed chairs, the gendarmes, the priest--he felt\nthat, though it was necessary to do it, he would not have been able\neven yesterday to break this solemnity.\n\nThey went through the same preliminaries, except the swearing in of\nthe jury and the justiciary\'s speech to them.\n\nA case of burglary was before the court. The prisoner, who was guarded\nby two gendarmes with unsheathed swords, was a twenty-year-old boy\nwith a bloodless face and in a gray coat. He sat alone on the\nprisoners\' bench and scanned from under his eyebrows all those that\nentered the court-room. This boy and another were charged with\nbreaking the lock of a shed and stealing therefrom mats of the value\nof three rubles and sixty-seven kopecks. It appeared from the\nindictment that a policeman caught the boy when he was walking with\nthe other, who carried the mats on his shoulder. Both of them\nimmediately confessed, and they were put in jail. The comrade of this\nboy, a locksmith, died in jail, and he was tried alone. The old mats\nlay on the table reserved for exhibits.\n\nThe case was conducted in the same order as yesterday, with all the\nproofs, witnesses, experts, oath-taking, examinations and\ncross-examinations. The policeman, when questioned by the justiciary,\ncomplainant and the defense, made listless answers--"Yes, sir," "Can\'t\ntell," and again "Yes, sir"--but notwithstanding this, it was apparent\nthat he pitied the boy and testified involuntarily against him.\n\nAnother witness, a splenetic old man who owned those mats, when asked\nif they belonged to him, unwillingly testified that they were his.\nWhen, however, the prosecutor asked him what use he intended to make\nof them, and whether he needed them much, he became angry and\nanswered: "I wish they had been lost entirely, these mats. I don\'t\nneed them at all. And if I had known that you would make so much fuss\nabout them, I would gladly have given ten rubles, or twenty, rather\nthan be dragged into court. I have spent five rubles on carriages\ncoming here and going back again. And I am sick; I am suffering from\nrupture and rheumatism."\n\nThe prisoner admitted the charge against him, and, like a trapped\nanimal, stupidly looked now to one side, now to the other, and in a\nhalting voice related everything as it happened.\n\nIt was a clear case, but the prosecutor, as he did yesterday, raised\nhis shoulders and propounded subtle questions which were calculated to\nentrap the clever criminal.\n\nIn his speech he argued that the theft was committed in a\ndwelling-house by breaking and entering it, and that therefore the\nseverest punishment should be meted out to him.\n\nCounsel for the defense, appointed by the court, argued that the\ntheft was committed not in a dwelling-house, and that, though the\nprisoner pleaded guilty, he was not as dangerous to society as the\nprosecutor would have them believe.\n\nThe justiciary was the personification of impartiality and justice,\nand endeavored to impress on the jury that which they already knew and\ncould not help knowing. Again they took recesses and smoked\ncigarettes, and again the usher shouted "Hear ye!" and the two\ngendarmes sat trying to keep awake.\n\nIt developed during the trial that this boy had been apprenticed in a\ntobacco factory, in which he worked five years. This year he was\ndischarged by his employer after a misunderstanding with the\nemployees, and, going idly about the city, he spent all he had on\ndrink. At an inn he met a locksmith who had also been discharged and\nwas drinking hard, and the two went at night, while drunk, to that\nshed, broke the lock, and took the first thing they saw. They were\ncaught, and as they confessed they were imprisoned. The locksmith,\nwhile waiting for a trial, died. The boy was now being tried as a\ndangerous creature from whom it was necessary to protect society.\n\n"As dangerous a creature as the prisoner of yesterday," Nekhludoff\nthought while watching the proceedings. "They are dangerous, but are\nwe not dangerous? I am a libertine, an impostor; and all of us, all\nthose that know me as I am, not only do not detest but respect me."\n\nIt is evident that this boy is no villain, but a very ordinary\nperson--every one sees that--and that he became what he is only\nbecause he lived amid conditions that beget such people. It is\ntherefore plain that such boys will exist as long as the conditions\nproducing these unfortunates remain unchanged. If any one had taken\npity on this boy, Nekhludoff thought while looking at the sickly,\nfrightened face of the boy, before want had driven him from the\nvillage to the city, and relieved that want, or, when, after twelve\nhours\' work in the factory, he was visiting inns with grown-up\ncomrades, some one had told him, "Don\'t go, Vania; it is bad," the boy\nwould not have gone, or got drunk, and the burglary would never have\noccurred.\n\nBut no one pitied the boy during the time that he, like an animal,\nspent his school years in the city, and, with close-cropped hair, to\nprevent his getting vermin, ran errands for the workmen. On the\ncontrary, the only thing he had heard from the workmen and his\ncomrades was to the effect that a brave fellow was he who cheated,\ndrank, reviled, fought, or led a depraved life.\n\nAnd when, sickly and depraved from the unhealthy work, from drink and\nlewdness, foolish and capricious, he aimlessly prowled around the\ncity, as in a dream, entered some shed and abstracted a few worthless\nmats, then, instead of destroying the causes that led this boy into\nhis present condition, we intend to mend matters by punishing him!\n\nIt is dreadful!\n\nThus Nekhludoff thought, and no longer listened to what was going on\naround him. He was himself terrified at this revelation. He wondered\nwhy he had not seen it before--how others failed to see it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n\nAs soon as the first recess was taken, Nekhludoff rose and went out of\nthe court, intending to return no more. They might do with him what\nthey pleased, but he could no longer take part in that farce.\n\nHaving inquired where the prosecutor\'s room was, he directed his steps\ntoward that dignitary. The messenger would not admit him, declaring\nthat the prosecutor was busy, but Nekhludoff brushed past him and\nasked an officer who met him to announce him to the prosecutor, saying\nthat he was on important business. His title and dress helped\nNekhludoff. The officer announced him, and he was admitted. The\nprosecutor received him standing, evidently dissatisfied with\nNekhludoff\'s persistence in seeking an audience with him.\n\n"What do you wish?" the prosecutor asked, sternly.\n\n"I am a juryman, my name is Nekhludoff, and I want to see the\nprisoner Maslova," he said, resolutely and quickly. He blushed, and\nfelt that his act would have a decisive influence on his life.\n\nThe prosecutor was a tall, swarthy man with short hair just turning\ngray, bright eyes and a trimmed, bushy beard on the protruding lower\njaw.\n\n"Maslova? Yes, I know her. She was charged with poisoning," he said\ncalmly. "Why do you want to see her?" And then, as if desiring to\nsoften his harsh demeanor, he added: "I cannot give you the permission\nbefore I know what you want to see her for."\n\n"It is very important for me to see her," Nekhludoff burst out.\n\n"I see," said the prosecutor, and, raising his eyes, looked intently\nat Nekhludoff. "Has her case been tried?"\n\n"She was tried yesterday and sentenced to four years\' penal servitude.\nThe conviction was irregular; she is innocent."\n\n"I see. If she has only been sentenced yesterday," said the prosecutor\nwithout paying attention to Nekhludoff\'s declaration about her\ninnocence, "then she will be detained until final judgment in the\nplace where she is now. The jail is open to visitors on certain days\nonly. I advise you to apply there."\n\n"But I must see her as soon as possible," with trembling lower jaw\nNekhludoff said, feeling that a critical moment was approaching.\n\n"Why are you so anxious about seeing her?" the prosecutor asked,\nraising his eyebrows with some alarm.\n\n"Because she is innocent of the crime for which she was sentenced to\npenal servitude. The guilt is mine, not hers," Nekhludoff said in a\ntrembling voice, feeling that he was saying what he should not.\n\n"How so?" asked the prosecutor.\n\n"I deceived her, and brought her to the condition in which she is now.\nIf I had not driven her to the position in which she was, she would\nnot have been charged here with such a crime."\n\n"Still I fail to see what all this has to do with visiting her."\n\n"It has, because I want to follow her and--marry her," said\nNekhludoff. And, as it usually happened when he spoke of this, his\neyes filled with tears.\n\n[Illustration: THE PRISONERS.]\n\n"Ah, is that so?" said the prosecutor. "This is really an exceptional\ncase. Are you not a member of the Krasnopersk town council?" asked the\nprosecutor, as if recalling that he had heard of this Nekhludoff who\nwas now making such a strange statement.\n\n"Excuse me, but I fail to see what this has to do with my request,"\nfuming, Nekhludoff answered with rancor.\n\n"Nothing, of course," the prosecutor said, with a faint smile on his\nface, and not in the least disturbed. "But your request is so unusual\nand beside all customary forms----"\n\n"Well, can I get the permission?"\n\n"Permission? Why, yes. I will give you a pass immediately. Please be\nseated."\n\nHe went to the table, sat down and began to write.\n\n"Please be seated."\n\nNekhludoff stood still.\n\nWhen he had made out the pass the prosecutor handed it to Nekhludoff\nand eyed him with curiosity.\n\n"I must also tell you," said Nekhludoff, "that I cannot continue to\nserve as juror."\n\n"As you know, satisfactory reasons must be given to the court in such\ncases."\n\n"The reasons are that I consider all courts useless and immoral."\n\n"I see," said the prosecutor, with the same faint smile which seemed\nto indicate that such statements were familiar to him, and belonged to\nan amusing class of people well known to him. "I see, but you\nunderstand that, as public prosecutor, I cannot agree with you. I\ntherefore advise you to state so to the court, which will either find\nyour reasons satisfactory or unsatisfactory, and in the latter case\nwill impose a fine on you. Apply to the court."\n\n"I have already stated my reasons, and I will not go there,"\nNekhludoff said angrily.\n\n"I have the honor to salute you," said the prosecutor, bowing,\nevidently desiring to rid himself of the strange visitor.\n\n"Who was the man that just left your room?" asked one of the judges\nwho entered the prosecutor\'s cabinet after Nekhludoff had left.\n\n"Nekhludoff. You know, the one who made such strange suggestions in\nthe Krasnopersk town council. Just imagine, he is on the jury, and\namong the prisoners there was a woman, or girl, who was sentenced to\npenal servitude, and who, he says, was deceived by him. And now he\nwishes to marry her."\n\n"It is impossible!"\n\n"That is what he told me. And how strangely excited he was!"\n\n"There is something wrong with our young men."\n\n"He is not so very young."\n\n"What a bore your famous Ivasheukoff is, my dear! He wins his cases by\ntiring us out--there is no end to his talking."\n\n"They must be curbed, or they become real obstructionists."\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\n\nFrom the public prosecutor Nekhludoff went straight to the\ndetention-house. But no one by the name of Maslova was there. The\ninspector told him that she might be found in the old temporary\nprison. Nekhludoff went there and found that Katherine Moslova was one\nof the inmates.\n\nThe distance between the detention-house and the old prison was great,\nand Nekhludoff did not arrive there until toward evening. He was about\nto open the door of the huge, gloomy building, when the guard stopped\nhim and rang the bell. The warden responded to the bell. Nekhludoff\nshowed the pass, but the warden told him that he could not be admitted\nwithout authority from the inspector. While climbing the stairs to the\ninspector\'s dwelling, Nekhludoff heard the sounds of an intricate\nbravura played on the piano. And when the servant, with a handkerchief\ntied around one eye, opened the door, a flood of music dazed his\nsenses. It was a tiresome rhapsody by Lizst, well played, but only to\na certain place. When that place was reached, the melody repeated\nitself. Nekhludoff asked the servant if the inspector was in.\n\nThe servant said that he was not.\n\n"Will he be in soon?"\n\nThe rhapsody again ceased, and with a noisy flourish again repeated\nitself.\n\n"I will go and inquire." And the servant went away.\n\nThe rhapsody again went on at full speed, when suddenly, reaching a\ncertain point, it came to a stand-still and a voice from within was\nheard.\n\n"Tell him that he is not home, and will not come to-day. He is\nvisiting--why do they bother us?" a woman\'s voice was heard to say,\nand the rhapsody continued, then ceased, and the sound of a chair\nmoved back was heard. The angry pianist herself evidently wished to\nreprimand the importunate visitor who came at such a late hour.\n\n"Papa is not home," angrily said a pale, wretched looking girl with\npuffed-up hair and blue spots under her eyes, who came to the door.\nSeeing a young man in a good overcoat, she became calm. "Walk in,\nplease. What do you wish to see him for?"\n\n"I would like to see a prisoner. I hold a pass from the prosecutor."\n\n"Well, I don\'t know; papa is not in. Why, walk in, please," she again\ncalled from the entrance hall. "Or apply to his assistant, who is now\nin the office. You may talk to him. And what is your name?"\n\n"Thank you," said Nekhludoff, without answering the question, and went\naway.\n\nScarcely had the door closed when the same vigorous, merry sound, so\ninappropriate to the place and so persistently rehearsed by the\nwretched girl, was heard. In the court-yard Nekhludoff met a young\nofficer with a stiff, dyed mustache, of whom he inquired for the\nassistant. He himself was the assistant. He took the pass, looked at\nit, and said that he could not admit any one to the prison on a pass\nfor the detention-house. Besides, it was late.\n\n"At ten o\'clock to-morrow the prison is open to all visitors, and the\ninspector will be here. You could then see her in the common\nreception-room, or, if the inspector permits it, in the office."\n\nSo, without gaining an interview, Nekhludoff returned home. Agitated\nby the expectation of seeing her, he walked along the streets,\nthinking not of the court, but of his conversations with the\nprosecutor and the inspectors. That he was seeking an interview with\nher, and told the prosecutor of his intention, and visited two prisons\npreparing for the ordeal, had so excited him that he could not calm\ndown. On returning home he immediately brought forth his unused diary,\nread some parts and made the following entry: "For two years I have\nkept no diary, and thought that I should never again return to this\nchildishness. But it was no childishness, but a discourse with myself,\nwith that true, divine _I_ which lives in every man. All this time\nthis _I_ was slumbering and I had no one to discourse with. It was\nawakened by the extraordinary event of the 28th of April, in court,\nwhere I sat as jurymen. I saw her, Katiousha, whom I had deceived, on\nthe prisoners\' bench, in a prison coat. Through a strange\nmisunderstanding and my mistake, she was sentenced to penal servitude.\nI have just returned from the prosecutor and the prison. I was not\npermitted to see her, but I am determined to do anything to see her,\nacknowledge my guilt and make reparation even by marrying her. Lord,\nhelp me! My soul is rejoicing."\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\n\nFor a long time that night Maslova lay awake with open eyes, and,\nlooking at the door, mused.\n\nShe was thinking that under no circumstances would she marry a convict\non the island of Saghalin, but would settle down some other way--with\nsome inspector, or clerk, or even the warden, or an assistant. They\nare all eager for such a thing. "Only I must not get thin. Otherwise I\nam done for." And she recalled how she was looked at by her lawyer,\nthe justiciary--in fact, everybody in the court-room. She recalled how\nBertha, who visited her in prison, told her that the student, whom she\nloved while she was an inmate at Kitaeva\'s, inquired about her and\nexpressed his regrets when told of her condition. She recalled the\nfight with the red-haired woman, and pitied her. She called to mind\nthe baker who sent her an extra lunch roll, and many others, but not\nNekhludoff. Of her childhood and youth, and especially of her love for\nNekhludoff, she never thought. That was too painful. These\nrecollections were hidden deeply in her soul. She never saw Nekhludoff\neven in a dream. She failed to recognize him in court, not so much\nbecause when she last saw him he was an army officer, beardless, with\nsmall mustache and thick, short hair, while now he was no longer young\nin appearance, and wore a beard, but more because she never thought of\nhim. She had buried all recollections of her past relations with him\nin that terrible dark night when, on his return from the army, he\nvisited his aunts.\n\nUp to that night, while she hoped for his return, the child which she\nbore under her heart was not irksome to her. But from that night\nforward everything changed, and the coming child was only a hindrance.\n\nThe aunts had asked Nekhludoff to stop off at their station and call\non them, but he wired that he would not be able to do it, as he had to\nreach St. Petersburg in time. When Katiousha learned this, she decided\nto go to the railroad station to see him. The train was to pass at two\no\'clock in the morning. Katiousha helped the ladies to bed, and,\nhaving induced the cook\'s girl, Mashka, to accompany her, she put on\nan old pair of shoes, threw a shawl over her head, gathered up her\nskirts and ran to the station.\n\nIt was a dark, rainy, windy, autumn night. The rain now poured down in\nlarge, warm drops, now ceased. The road could not be distinguished in\nthe field, and it was pitch dark in the woods. Although Katiousha was\nfamiliar with the road she lost her way in the woods, and reached a\nsub-station, where the train only stopped for three minutes. Running\non the platform, she espied Nekhludoff through the window of a\nfirst-class car. The car was brightly illuminated. Two officers sat on\nplush seats playing cards. On the table near the window two thick\ncandles were burning. Nekhludoff sat on the arm of the seat, his elbow\nresting on the back, laughing. As soon as she recognized him she\ntapped on the window with her cold hand. But at that moment the third\nbell rang, and the train began to move, the cars jostling each other\nforward. One of the players rose with the cards in his hands and began\nto look through the window. She tapped again, and pressed her face\nagainst the window-pane. At that moment the car beside which she stood\nwas tugged forward, and it moved along. She ran alongside, looking in\nthe window. The officer tried to lower the window, but could not.\nNekhludoff rose, and, pushing the officer aside, began lowering it.\nThe train went faster, so that Katiousha was obliged to run. The train\nmoved still faster when the window was lowered. At that moment the\nconductor pushed her aside and jumped on the car. She fell back, but\ncontinued to run along the wet boards of the platform, and when she\nreached the end of the platform and began to descend the steps to the\nground, she almost fell exhausted. The first-class car was far ahead\nof her, and while she was running the second-class cars passed her,\nthen came with greater speed those of the third class. When the last\ncar with the lanterns flew by her she was already beyond the\nwater-tank, unsheltered from the wind which lashed her, blowing the\nshawl from her head and tangling her feet in her skirt. But still she\nran on.\n\n"Aunt Michaelovna!" shouted the little girl, "you have lost your\nshawl."\n\nKatiousha stopped, threw back her head, and, covering her face with\nher hands, began to sob.\n\n"He is gone!" she cried.\n\n"While he is in a lighted car, sitting on a plush seat, jesting and\ndrinking, I stand here in the mud, rain and wind, crying," she\nthought. She sat down on the ground and began to sob aloud. The little\ngirl was frightened, and, embracing her wet clothing, she said:\n\n"Auntie, let\'s go home."\n\n"I will wait for the next train, throw myself under the wheels, and\nthat will end it all," Katiousha was meanwhile thinking, not heeding\nthe girl.\n\nShe made up her mind to carry out her intention. But as it always\nhappens in the first moment of calm after a period of agitation, the\nchild, _his_ child, suddenly shuddered. Immediately all that which so\ntortured her that she was willing to die, all her wrath and her\ndesire to revenge herself even by death, passed. She became calm,\narranged her clothing, put the shawl on her head, and went away.\n\nShe returned home exhausted, wet and muddy. From that day began in her\nthat spiritual transformation which ended in her present condition.\nFrom that terrible night on she ceased to believe in God and in\ngoodness. Before that night she herself believed in God, and believed\nthat other people believed in Him; but after that night she became\nconvinced that no one believed, and all that was said of God and His\nlaw was false and wrong. The one whom she loved, and who loved\nher--she knew it--abandoned her and made sport of her feelings. And he\nwas the best of all the men she knew. All the others were even worse.\nThis she saw confirmed in all that had happened. His aunts, pious old\nladies, drove her out when she was no longer as useful as she used to\nbe. All the women with whom she came in contact tried to make money by\nher; the men, beginning with the commissary and down to the prison\nofficers, all looked upon her as a means of pleasure. The whole world\nwas after pleasure. Her belief in this was strengthened by the old\nauthor whom she met during the second year of her independent life. He\nhad told her frankly that this--he called it poetical and esthetic--is\nall of life\'s happiness.\n\nEvery one lived for himself only, for his own pleasure, and all the\nwords about God and goodness were deception. And if the questions\nsometimes occurred to her, Why were the affairs of the world so ill\narranged that people harm each other, and all suffer, she thought it\nbest not to dwell on it. If she became lonesome, she took a drink,\nsmoked a cigarette, and the feeling would pass away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\n\nWhen at five o\'clock the following morning, which was Sunday, the\ncustomary whistle blew, Korableva, who was already awake, roused\nMaslova.\n\n"A convict," Maslova thought with horror, rubbing her eyes and\ninvoluntarily inhaling the foul morning air. She wished to fall\nasleep again, to transfer herself into a state of unconsciousness, but\nfear overcame her drowsiness. She raised herself, crossed her legs\nunder her, and looked around. The women were already up, only the\nchildren were still sleeping. The moonshining woman with bulging eyes\nwas carefully removing her coat from under them. The rioter was drying\nnear the oven some rags which served for swaddling cloths, while the\nchild, in the hands of the blue-eyed Theodosia, was crying at the top\nof its lungs, the woman lulling it in a gentle voice. The consumptive,\nseizing her breast, coughed violently, and, sighing at intervals,\nalmost screamed. The red-headed woman lay prone on her back relating a\ndream she had had. The old incendiary stood before the image,\nwhispering the same words, crossing herself and bowing. The chanter\'s\ndaughter sat motionless on her cot, and with dull, half-open eyes was\nlooking into space. Miss Dandy was curling on her finger her oily,\nrough, black hair.\n\nPresently resounding steps were heard in the corridor, the lock\ncreaked open, and two prisoners in short jackets and gray trousers\nscarcely reaching their ankles entered, and, raising the ill-smelling\nvat on a yoke, carried it away. The women went to the faucets in the\ncorridor to wash themselves. The red-headed woman got into a quarrel\nwith a woman from the adjoining cell. Again there were cursing,\nshouting and complaints.\n\n"You will get into the dark-room yet," shouted the warden, and he\nslapped the red-headed woman on her fat, bare back, so that it\nresounded through the entire corridor. "Don\'t let me hear you again."\n\n"Fooling again, you old man?" she said, treating it as a caress.\n\n"Hurry up! It is time for mass."\n\nScarcely had Maslova arranged her hair when the inspector entered with\nhis attendants.\n\n"Make ready for inspection!" shouted the warden.\n\nThe women of the two cells formed in two rows along the corridor,\nthose of the back row placing their hands on the shoulders of the\nwomen in the front row. Then they were counted.\n\nAfter the count came the woman inspector and led the prisoners to the\nchurch. Maslova and Theodosia were in the middle of the column, which\nconsisted of over a hundred women from all the cells. They all had\nwhite \'kerchiefs on their heads, and some few wore their own colored\ndresses. These were the wives and children of convicts. The procession\ncovered the whole stairway. A soft clatter of prison shoes was heard,\nhere and there some conversation, and sometimes laughter. At a turn\nMaslova noticed the malicious face of her enemy, Bochkova, who was\nwalking in the front row, and pointed her out to Theodosia. At the\nfoot of the stairs the women became silent, and, making the sign of\nthe cross and bowing, they filed into the open door of the empty,\ngold-bedecked chapel. Their place was on the right, where, crowding\neach other, they began to arrange themselves in rows, standing. Behind\nthe women came the male convicts who were serving terms or detained\nfor transportation under sentence by the communities. Loudly clearing\ntheir throats, they formed a dense crowd on the left and the middle of\nthe chapel. Above, on the gallery, were other convicts with heads half\nshaven, whose presence was manifested by a clanking of chains.\n\nThis prison chapel had been rebuilt and remodeled by a rich merchant,\nwho had spent about thirty thousand rubles on it, and it was all\nornamented with gilt and bright colors.\n\nFor a few seconds there was silence, which was broken only by the\nblowing of noses, coughing, and clanking of chains. Suddenly the\nprisoners who stood in the middle began to press back, making a\npassage for the inspector, who walked to the middle of the chapel, and\nthe services commenced.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\n\nNekhludoff left the house early. A peasant was driving along a side\nalley, shouting in a strange voice: "Milk! milk! milk!"\n\nThe first warm, spring rain had fallen the evening before. Wherever\nthere was a patch of unpaved ground the green grass burst forth; the\nlindens were covered with green nap; the fowl-cherry and poplar\nunfolded their long, fragrant leaves. In the market-place, through\nwhich Nekhludoff had to pass, dense crowds in rags swarmed before the\ntents, some carrying boots under their arms, others smoothly pressed\ntrousers and vests on their shoulders.\n\nThe working people were already crowding near the traktirs\n(tea-houses), the men in clean, long coats gathered in folds in the\nback of the waist, and in shining boots; the women in bright-colored\nsilk shawls and cloaks with glass-bead trimmings. Policemen, with\npistols attached to yellow cords fastened around their waists, stood\nat their posts. Children and dogs played on the grass-plots, and gay\nnurses sat chatting on the benches.\n\nOn the streets, the left sides of which were yet cool, moist and\nshady, heavy carts and light cabs rumbled and jostled, the tram-cars\nrang their bells. The air was agitated by the pealing of the\nchurch-bells summoning the people to mass.\n\nThe driver stopped at a turn some distance from the prison. A few men\nand women stood around, most of them with bundles in their hands. To\nthe right stood a few frame houses; to the left a two-story building\nover which hung a large sign. The large prison itself was directly in\nfront. An armed soldier walked to and fro challenging every one\nattempting to pass him.\n\nAt the gate of the frame buildings sat the warden in uniform, with an\nentry booklet in his hand. He made entries of visitors and those whom\nthey wished to see. Nekhludoff approached him, gave his name and that\nof Moslova, and the officer entered them in his book.\n\n"Why don\'t they open the door?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"The morning service is on. As soon as it is over you will be\nadmitted."\n\nNekhludoff returned among the waiting crowd.\n\nA man in threadbare clothing, rumpled hat and slippers on his bare\nfeet, and his face full of red lines, pushed his way through the crowd\nand walked toward the prison door.\n\n"Where are you going?" shouted the soldier.\n\n"What are you bawling about?" answered the man, entirely undisturbed\nby the soldier\'s challenge. "If I can\'t go in, I will wait. No use\nbawling as if you were a general."\n\nThe crowd laughed approvingly. Most of the visitors were poorly\ndressed, even ragged, but, judging by outward appearance, there were\nalso some decent men and women among them. Beside Nekhludoff stood a\nwell-dressed man, clean shaven, stout and with rosy cheeks, who\ncarried a bundle of what looked like linen. Nekhludoff asked him if\nthat was his first visit. The man answered that he came there every\nSunday, and they entered into conversation. He was an employee of a\nbank, whose brother was under indictment for forgery. This\nkind-hearted man told Nekhludoff all his story, and was about to ask\nhim about his own when their attention was attracted by a rubber-tired\ncarriage drawn by a blooded chestnut horse. The carriage was occupied\nby a student and a lady whose face was hidden under a veil. The\nstudent alighted, holding in his hand a large bundle. He approached\nNekhludoff and asked him where and how he should deliver the loaves of\nbread he had brought for the prisoners. "I brought them at the request\nof my bride. That is my bride. Her parents advised us to bring some\nalms for the prisoners."\n\n"I really don\'t know, for I am here for the first time, but I think\nthat that officer will tell you," said Nekhludoff, pointing to the\nwarden in the crown-laced uniform.\n\nWhile Nekhludoff was talking to the student the large iron gate of the\nprison opened and a uniformed officer with another warden came out.\nThe one with the booklet in his hand announced that the prison was\nopen for visitors. The guard stood aside, and all the visitors, as if\nfearing to be late, with quick step, and some even running, pressed\ntoward the prison gate. One of the wardens stationed himself at the\ngate, and in a loud voice counted the passing visitors--16, 17, 18,\netc. The other warden, within the gate, touching each with his hand,\nalso counted the visitors as they entered another door. This was to\nmake sure that at their departure no visitor remained in prison, and\nno prisoner made his way out. The tallying officer, without regard to\nthe person of the visitor, slapped Nekhludoff on the back. This at\nfirst offended the latter, but he immediately remembered his mission,\nand he became ashamed that his feelings should be thus wounded.\n\nThe second door opened into a large, vaulted room with small\niron-grated windows. In this room, which was called the meeting-room,\nNekhludoff saw in a niche a large image of the Crucifixion.\n\nNekhludoff went on slowly, letting the hurrying visitors pass before,\nand experienced a mingled feeling of horror at the malefactors\nimprisoned in this jail, compassion for those innocent people who,\nlike the boy and Katiousha, must be here, and timidity and tenderness\nbefore the meeting that was before him. When he reached the end of the\nroom the warden said something, but Nekhludoff, who was absorbed in\nhis thoughts, paid no attention to it, and followed in the direction\nled by the crowd, that is, to the men\'s ward instead of the women\'s.\n\nLetting the hurrying visitors pass, he walked into the next room\ndesignated for interviews. On opening the door he was struck by the\ndeafening shouts of a hundred throats turned into a continuous humming\nnoise. Only as he neared the people, who, like flies swarming on sugar\npressed their faces against a net which divided the room in two, did\nNekhludoff understand the cause of the noise. This room with windows\nin the rear wall was divided in two not by one, but by two wire nets\nwhich stretched from the ceiling to the floor. Two wardens walked\nbetween the nets. The prisoners were on the other side of the nets,\nbetween which there was a space of about seven feet for visitors, so\nthat not only was it difficult to converse with them but a\nshort-sighted man could not even see the face of the prisoner he was\nvisiting. In order to be heard, it was necessary to shout at the top\nof one\'s voice. On both sides, pressing against the nets, were the\nfaces of wives, husbands, fathers, mothers, children, who endeavored\nto see and speak to each other. But as every one tried to speak so\nthat he could be heard by the person spoken to, and his neighbor did\nthe same, their voices interfered with each other, and each tried to\noutcry the other. The result was the noise which astonished Nekhludoff\nwhen he entered the room. It was absolutely impossible to understand\nthe conversations. Only by the expression of the people\'s faces could\none judge what they were speaking about, and what relation the\nspeakers sustained toward each other. Near Nekhludoff was an old woman\nwith a small \'kerchief on her head, who, with trembling chin, shouted\nto a pale young man with head half shaven. The prisoner, knitting his\nbrow, was listening to her with raised eyebrows. Beside the old woman\nstood a young man in a long coat, who was nodding his head while\nlistening to a prisoner with a weary face and beard turning gray, who\ngreatly resembled him. Further on stood a ragamuffin waving his hand,\nshouting and laughing. On the floor beside this man sat a woman in a\ngood woolen dress, with a child in her arms. She wept bitterly,\nevidently seeing for the first time that gray-haired man on the other\nside of the net, manacled, in a prison jacket, and with head half\nshaven. Over this woman stood the bank employee shouting at the top of\nhis voice to a bald-headed prisoner with shining eyes.\n\nNekhludoff remained in this room about five minutes, experiencing a\nstrange feeling of anguish, a consciousness of his impotence at the\ndiscord in the world, and he was seized with a sensation like a\nrocking on board of a ship.\n\n"But I must fulfill my mission," he said to himself, taking heart.\n"What am I to do?"\n\nAs he looked around for some officer, he saw a middle-sized man with\nmustache, wearing epaulets, who was walking behind the crowd.\n\n"Sir, could you not tell me where the women are kept, and where it is\npermitted to see them?" he asked, making a particular effort to be\npolite.\n\n"You wish to go to the women\'s ward?"\n\n"Yes; I would like to see one of the women prisoners," Nekhludoff\nsaid, with the same strained politeness.\n\n"You should have said so in the meeting-room. Whom do you wish to see,\nthen?"\n\n"I wish to see Katherine Maslova."\n\n"Has she been sentenced?"\n\n"Yes, she was sentenced the other day," he said humbly, as if fearing\nto ruffle the temper of the officer, who seemed to be interested in\nhim.\n\n"Then this way, please," said the inspector, who had evidently\ndecided from Nekhludoff\'s appearance that he deserved attention.\n"Sidoroff!" he turned to a warrant-officer wearing a mustache, and\nmedals on his breast. "Show this gentleman to the women\'s ward."\n\n"All right, sir."\n\nAt that moment heart-rending cries came from the direction of the\ngrating.\n\nAll this seemed strange to Nekhludoff, and strangest of all was that\nhe was obliged to thank and feel himself under obligation to the\ninspector and warden.\n\nThe warden led Nekhludoff from the men\'s ward into the corridor, and\nthrough the open door opposite admitted him to the women\'s\nmeeting-room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\n\nThis room, like the one in the men\'s ward, was also divided in three,\nby two nets, but it was considerably smaller. There were also fewer\nvisitors and fewer prisoners, but the noise was as great as in the\nmen\'s room. Here, also, the authorities stood guard between the nets.\nThe authorities were here represented by a matron in uniform with\ncrown-laced sleeves and fringed with blue braid and a belt of the same\ncolor. Here, too, people pressed against the nets--in the\npassage--city folks in divers dresses; behind the nets, female\nprisoners, some in white, others in their own dresses. The whole net\nwas lined with people. Some stood on tip-toe, speaking over the heads\nof others; others, again, sat on the floor and conversed.\n\nThe most remarkable of the women prisoners, both in her shouting and\nappearance, was a thin, ragged gipsy, with a \'kerchief which had\nslipped from her head, who stood almost in the middle of the room,\nnear a post, behind the net, gesticulating and shouting to a short and\ntightly belted gipsy in a blue coat. A soldier sat beside him on the\nfloor, talking to a prisoner. Beyond stood a young peasant with a\nlight beard and in bast shoes, pressing his flushed face to the net,\nevidently with difficulty suppressing his tears. He was talking to a\npretty, light-haired prisoner who gazed at him with her bright, blue\neyes. This was Theodosia, with her husband. Beside them stood a tramp,\nwho was talking to a disheveled, broad-faced woman. Further on there\nwere two women, a man, and again a woman, and opposite each was a\nprisoner. Maslova was not among them. But behind the prisoners stood\nanother woman. Nekhludoff felt the beating of his heart increasing and\nhis breath failing him. The decisive moment was approaching. He neared\nthe net and recognized Katiousha. She stood behind the blue-eyed\nTheodosia, and, smiling, listened to her conversation. She did not\nwear the prison coat, but a white waist, tightly belted, and rising\nhigh above the breast. As in the court, her black hair hung in curls\nover her \'kerchiefed forehead.\n\n"It will all be over in a moment," he thought. "Shall I address her,\nor shall I wait till she addresses me?"\n\nBut she did not address him. She was waiting for Clara, and never\nthought that that man came to see her.\n\n"Whom do you wish to see?" the matron asked Nekhludoff, approaching\nhim.\n\n"Katherine Maslova," he stammered.\n\n"Maslova, you are wanted," shouted the matron.\n\nMaslova turned round, raised her head, and with the familiar\nexpression of submissiveness, came to the net. She did not recognize\nNekhludoff, and gazed at him in surprise. However, judging by his\ndress that he was a rich man, she smiled.\n\n"What are you?" she asked, pressing her smiling face with squinting\neyes against the net.\n\n"I wish to see--" He did not know whether to use the respectful "you"\nor the endearing "thou," and decided on the former. He spoke no louder\nthan usual. "I wish to see you--I----"\n\n"Don\'t give me any of your song and dance----" the tramp beside him\nshouted. "Did you take it, or did you not?"\n\n"She is dying; she is very weak," some one shouted on the other side.\n\nMaslova could not hear Nekhludoff, but the expression of his face, as\nshe spoke, suddenly reminded her of that which she did not wish to\nthink of. The smile disappeared from her face, and a wrinkle on her\nbrow evidenced her suffering.\n\n"I cannot hear what you are saying," she shouted, blinking and still\nmore knitting her brows.\n\n"I came----"\n\n"Yes, I am doing my duty; I am repenting," thought Nekhludoff, and\nimmediately tears filled his eyes, and he felt a choking sensation in\nhis throat. His fingers clutched at the net and he made efforts to\nkeep from sobbing.\n\n"I should not have gone if you were well," came from one side.\n\n"I swear by God I know nothing about it!" cried a prisoner from the\nother side.\n\nMaslova noticed his agitation, and it communicated itself to her. Her\neyes sparkled, and her puffy, white cheeks became covered with red\nspots, but her face retained its severity, and her squinting eyes\nstared past him.\n\n"You are like him, but I don\'t know you," she shouted.\n\n"I came here to ask your forgiveness," he said in a loud voice,\nwithout intonation, as if repeating a lesson he had learned by heart.\n\nAs he said these words he felt ashamed and looked round. But the\nthought immediately came to his mind that it was well that he was\nashamed, for he ought to bear the shame. And in a loud voice he\ncontinued:\n\n"I acted meanly, infamously--forgive me."\n\nShe stood motionless, her squinting eyes fixed on him.\n\nHe could not continue and left the net, making efforts to stifle the\nsobbing which was convulsing his breast.\n\nThe inspector who directed Nekhludoff to the women\'s ward, evidently\nbecoming interested in him, came into the room, and, seeing him in the\nmiddle of the passage, asked him why he was not speaking with the\nprisoner he had inquired about. Nekhludoff blew his nose, and,\nendeavoring to assume an air of calmness, said:\n\n"I can\'t speak through the net; nothing can be heard."\n\nThe inspector mused awhile.\n\n"Well, then, she can be brought out for awhile."\n\n"Maria Karlovna!" he turned to the matron. "Lead Maslova out."\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\n\nA moment afterward Maslova came out through a side door. With gentle\nstep she came up to Nekhludoff; stopped and glanced at him from under\nher lowered eyebrows. Her black hair stood out on her forehead in\ncurly ringlets; her unhealthy, bloated, white face was pretty and very\ncalm, only her shining-black, squinting eyes sparkled from under their\nswollen lashes.\n\n"You may talk here," said the inspector and went aside.\n\nNekhludoff moved toward a bench standing beside the wall.\n\nMaslova glanced inquiringly at the inspector, and shrugging her\nshoulders, as if in wonder, followed Nekhludoff to the bench, and\nstraightening her skirt, sat down beside him.\n\n"I know that it is hard for you to forgive me," began Nekhludoff, but\nfeeling the tears flooding his eyes, again stopped, "but if the past\ncannot be mended, I will do now everything in my power. Tell me----"\n\n"How did you find me?" she asked without answering his question, her\nsquinting eyes looking and not looking at him.\n\n"Oh, Lord! Help me, teach me what to do!" Nekhludoff said to himself\nas he looked at her face so completely changed.\n\n"I was on the jury when you were tried," he said. "You did not\nrecognize me?"\n\n"No, I did not. I had no time to recognize you. Besides, I did not\nlook," she answered.\n\n"Wasn\'t there a child?" he asked, and he felt his face turning red.\n\n"It died at that time, thank God," she said with bitterness, turning\naway her head.\n\n"How did it happen?"\n\n"I was ill myself--nearly died," she said without raising her eyes.\n\n"How could the aunts let you go?"\n\n"Who would keep a servant with a child? As soon as they noticed it\nthey drove me out. But what is the use of talking! I don\'t remember\nanything. It is all over now."\n\n"No, it is not over. I cannot leave it thus. I now wish to atone for\nmy sin."\n\n"There is nothing to atone for; what\'s gone is gone," she said, and,\nall unexpected to him, she suddenly looked at him and smiled in an\nalluring and piteous manner.\n\nHis appearance was entirely unexpected to Maslova, especially at this\ntime and place, and therefore the astonishment of the first moment\nbrought to her mind that of which she never thought before. At the\nfirst moment she hazily recalled that new, wonderful world of feeling\nand thought which had been opened to her by that charming young man\nwho loved her, and whom she loved, and then his inexplicable cruelty\nand the long chain of humiliation and suffering which followed as the\ndirect result of that enchanting bliss, and it pained her. But being\nunable to account for it all, she did the customary thing for\nher--banished all these recollections from her mind, and endeavored to\nobscure them by a life of dissipation. At first she associated this\nman who sat beside her with that young man whom she had loved once,\nbut as the thought pained her, she drove it from her mind. And now\nthis neatly dressed gentleman, with perfumed beard, was to her not\nthat Nekhludoff whom she had loved, but one of those people who, as\nopportunity afforded, were taking advantage of such creatures as she,\nand of whom such creatures as she ought to take advantage as\nopportunity offers. For this reason she smiled alluringly.\n\nShe was silent, thinking how to profit by him.\n\n"All that is over now," she said. "And here I am, sentenced to penal\nservitude."\n\nHer lips trembled as she spoke the terrible word.\n\n"I knew, I was certain that you were innocent," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Of course I was innocent. I am no thief or robber. They say here that\nit all depends on the lawyer; that it is necessary to appeal. Only\nthey say it comes very high----"\n\n"Yes, certainly," said Nekhludoff. "I have already seen a lawyer."\n\n"One must not be sparing, and get a good one," she said.\n\n"I will do everything in my power."\n\nThey were silent. She again smiled as before.\n\n"I would like to ask you--for some money, if you have it--not much,\nsay ten rubles," she said suddenly.\n\n"Yes, yes," said Nekhludoff, abashed, and thrust his hand in his\npocket.\n\nShe quickly glanced at the inspector, who was walking up and down the\naisle.\n\n"Don\'t let him see it, or he will take it away."\n\nNekhludoff took out his pocketbook as soon as the director turned his\nback on them, but before he could hand her the ten-ruble bill the\ninspector turned round, facing them. He crumpled the bill in his hand.\n\n"Why, she is a dead woman," thought Nekhludoff as he looked at her\nonce lovely, but now defiled, bloated face with the unhealthy sparkle\nin her black, squinting eyes, which looked now at the inspector, now\nat Nekhludoff\'s hand with the crumpled bill. And a moment of\nhesitation came over him.\n\nAgain the tempter of the night before whispered in his soul,\nendeavoring to turn the question, What would be the best thing to do?\ninto, What will be the end of it?\n\n"You can do nothing with that woman," whispered the voice. "She will\nbe like a stone around your neck, which will drag you down, and\nprevent your being useful to others. Give her all the money you have,\nbid her good-by and put an end to it for all time."\n\nAnd immediately he became aware that something important was taking\nplace in his soul; that his inner life was on a wavering scale, which\ncould by the slightest effort be made to overbalance to one side or\nthe other. And he made that effort, calling on that God whom the other\nday he felt in his soul, and God immediately came to his aid. He\nresolved to tell her all.\n\n"Katiousha! I came to ask your forgiveness, but you have not answered\nme whether you have forgiven me, or ever will forgive me," he said\nsuddenly.\n\nShe was not listening to him, but looked now at his hand, now at the\ninspector. When the latter turned away, she quickly stretched forth\nher hand, seized the money from Nekhludoff\'s hand and stuck it behind\nher belt.\n\n"How funny!" she said, smiling contemptuously as it seemed to him.\n\nNekhludoff saw that there was something inimical to him in her, which\nstood guard, as it were, over her as she was now, and prevented him\nfrom penetrating into her heart.\n\nBut--wonderful to relate--so far from repulsing him, this only drew\nhim to her by some new peculiar force. He felt that he ought to awaken\nher spirit; that it was extremely difficult to do so; but the very\ndifficulty of the undertaking attracted him. He experienced a feeling\ntoward her which he had never experienced before, either toward her or\nany one else, and in which there was nothing personal. He desired\nnothing of her for himself, and only wished her to to cease to be what\nshe was now, and become what she had been before.\n\n"Katiousha, why do you speak thus? I know you, I remember you as you\nwere in Panoff----"\n\nBut she did not yield--she would not yield.\n\n"Why recall the past!" she said dryly, frowning even more.\n\n"Because I wish to efface, to expiate my sin. Katiousha----" he began,\nand was about to tell her that he would marry her, but he met her eyes\nin which he read something so terrible, rude and repulsive that he\ncould not finish.\n\nAt that moment the visitors began to take leave. The inspector\napproached Nekhludoff and told him that the time for interviewing was\nended. Maslova rose and submissively waited to be dismissed.\n\n"Good-by. I have a great deal to tell you yet, but, as you see, I\ncannot do it now," said Nekhludoff, and extended his hand. "I will\ncall again."\n\n"I think you have said everything----"\n\nShe extended her hand, but did not press his.\n\n"No. I will try to see you again, where we can speak together, and\nthen I will tell you something very important," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Well, all right," she said, smiling as she used to do when she\nwished to please a man.\n\n"You are more to me than a sister," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Funny," she repeated, and, shaking her head, she went behind the\ngrating.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\n\nNekhludoff expected that at the first meeting Katiousha, learning of\nhis intention to serve her, and of his repentance, would be moved to\nrejoicing, would become again Katiousha, but to his surprise and\nhorror, he saw that Katiousha was no more; that only Maslova remained.\n\nIt surprised him particularly that not only was Maslova not ashamed of\nher condition, but, on the contrary, she seemed to be content with,\nand even took pride in it. And yet it could not be different.\n\nIt is usually thought that a thief or murderer, acknowledging the\nharmfulness of his occupation, ought to be ashamed of it. The truth is\njust the contrary. People, whom fate and their sinful mistakes have\nplaced in a given condition, form such views of life generally that\nthey are enabled to consider their condition useful and morally\ntenable. In order, however, to maintain such views they instinctively\ncling to such circles in which the same views are held. We are\nsurprised when we hear thieves boasting of their cleverness, or\nmurderers boasting of their cruelty, but that is only because their\ncircle is limited, and because we are outside of it.\n\nThis was the case also with Maslova. She was sentenced to penal\nservitude, and yet she formed such views of life and her place in it\nthat she could find reasons for self-approval and even boast before\npeople of her condition.\n\nThe substance of this view was that the greatest welfare of all men,\nwithout exception--young, old, students, generals, educated and\nuneducated--consisted in associating with attractive women, and that\ntherefore all men, while pretending to occupy themselves with other\nbusiness, in reality desire nothing else. Now, she is an attractive\nwoman, and can satisfy that desire of theirs, or not, as she wishes,\nhence she is a necessary and important person. All her life, past and\npresent, attested the justice of this view.\n\nWhomever she met during ten years, beginning with Nekhludoff and the\nold commissary of police, and ending with the jailers, all wanted her.\nShe had not met any one who did not want her. Hence the world appeared\nto her as an aggregation of people who watched her from all sides and\nby all possible means--deceit, violence, gold or craftiness--strewn to\npossess her.\n\nWith such an idea of life, Maslova considered herself a most important\nperson. And she cherished this view above all else in the world,\nbecause to change it would be to lose that standing among people which\nit assured her. And in order not to lose her standing she\ninstinctively clung to that circle which held the same views of life.\nSeeing, however, that Nekhludoff wished to lead her into another\nworld, she resisted it, feeling that in that other world into which he\nwas luring her she would lose her present standing which gave her\nconfidence and self-respect. For the same reason she drove from her\nmind all recollection of her first youth and her first relations to\nNekhludoff. These recollections clashed with her present views of\nlife, and for that reason were entirely effaced from her memory, or,\nrather, were preserved somewhere in her memory, but were covered up,\nas it were, with a thick plastering, to prevent any access to them.\nNekhludoff was, therefore, to her not that man whom she had loved with\na pure love, but merely a rich gentleman by whom one may and ought to\nprofit, and who was to be treated like any other man.\n\n"I did not tell her the most important thing," thought Nekhludoff, as\nwith the other people he walked toward the door. "I did not tell her\nthat I would marry her, but I will do it."\n\nThe inspectors at the doors counted the visitors each with one hand\nslapping every visitor on the back. But Nekhludoff was not offended by\nit now; he even took no notice of it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\n\nIt was Nekhludoff\'s intention to alter his manner of living--discharge\nthe servants, let the house and take rooms in a hotel. But Agrippina\nPetrovna argued that no one would rent the house in the summer, and\nthat as it was necessary to live somewhere and keep the furniture and\nthings, he might as well remain where he was. So that all efforts of\nNekhludoff to lead a simple, student life, came to naught. Not only\nwas the old arrangement of things continued, but, as in former times,\nthe house received a general cleaning. First were brought out and hung\non a rope uniforms and strange fur garments which were never used by\nanybody; then carpets, furniture, and the porter, with his assistant,\nrolling up the sleeves on their muscular arms, began to beat these\nthings, and the odor of camphor rose all over the house. Walking\nthrough the court-yard and looking out of the window, Nekhludoff\nwondered at the great number of unnecessary things kept in the house.\nThe only purpose these things served, he thought, was to afford the\nservants an opportunity of exercise.\n\n"It isn\'t worth while to alter my mode of life while Maslova\'s affair\nis unsettled," he thought. "Besides, it is too hard. When she is\ndischarged or transported and I follow her, things will change of\ntheir own accord."\n\nOn the day appointed by the lawyer Fanirin, Nekhludoff called on him.\nOn entering the magnificently appointed apartments of the house owned\nby the lawyer himself, with its huge plants, remarkable curtains and\nother evidences of luxury, attesting easily earned wealth, Nekhludoff\nfound in the reception-room a number of people sitting dejectedly\naround tables on which lay illustrated journals intended for their\ndiversion. The lawyer\'s clerk, who was sitting in this room at a high\ndesk, recognizing Nekhludoff, greeted him and said that he would\nannounce him. But before the clerk reached the door of the cabinet,\nthe door opened and the animated voices of a thick-set man with a red\nface and stubby mustache, wearing a new suit, and Fanirin himself were\nheard. The expression on their faces was such as is seen on people\nwho had just made a profitable, but not very honest, bargain.\n\n"It is your own fault, my dear sir," Fanirin said, smiling.\n\n"I would gladly go to heaven, but my sins prevent me."\n\n"That is all right."\n\nAnd both laughed unnaturally.\n\n"Ah, Prince Nekhludoff! Pleased to see you," said Fanirin, and bowing\nagain to the departing merchant, he led Nekhludoff into his\nbusiness-like cabinet. "Please take a cigarette," said the lawyer,\nseating himself opposite Nekhludoff and suppressing a smile, called\nforth by the success of the preceding affair.\n\n"Thank you. I came to inquire about Maslova\'s case."\n\n"Yes, yes, immediately. My, what rogues these moneybags are!" he said.\n"You have seen that fellow; he is worth twelve millions, and is the\nmeanest skinflint I ever met."\n\nNekhludoff felt an irresistible loathing toward this ready talker who,\nby his tone of voice, meant to show that he and Nekhludoff belonged to\na different sphere than the other clients.\n\n"He worried me to death. He is an awful rogue. I wanted to ease my\nmind," said the lawyer, as if justifying his not speaking about\nNekhludoff\'s case. "And now as to your case. I have carefully examined\nit, \'and could not approve the contents thereof,\' as Tourgeniff has\nit. That is to say, the lawyer was a wretched one, and he let slip all\nthe grounds of appeal."\n\n"What have you decided to do?"\n\n"One moment. Tell him," he turned to his clerk, who had just entered,\n"that I will not change my terms. He can accept them or not, as he\npleases."\n\n"He does not accept them."\n\n"Well, then, let him go," said the lawyer, and his benign and joyful\ncountenance suddenly assumed a gloomy and angry expression.\n\n"They say that lawyers take money for nothing," he said, again\nassuming a pleasant expression. "I succeeded in obtaining the\ndischarge of an insolent debtor who was incarcerated on flimsy\naccusations of fraud, and now they all run after me. And every such\ncase requires great labor. We, too, you know, leave some of our flesh\nin the ink-pot, as some author said."\n\n"Well, now, your case, or rather the case in which you are\ninterested," he continued; "was badly conducted. There are no good\ngrounds for appeal, but, of course, we can make an attempt. This is\nwhat I have written."\n\nHe took a sheet of paper, and quickly swallowing some uninteresting,\nformal words, and emphasizing others, he began to read:\n\n"To the Department of Cassation, etc., etc., Katherine, etc. Petition.\nBy the decision, etc., of the etc., rendered, etc., a certain Maslova\nwas found guilty of taking the life, by poisoning, of a certain\nmerchant Smelkoff, and in pursuance of Chapter 1,454 of the Code, was\nsentenced to etc., with hard labor, etc."\n\nHe stopped, evidently listening with pleasure to his own composition,\nalthough from constant use he knew the forms by heart.\n\n"\'This sentence is the result of grave errors,\' he continued with\nemphasis, \'and ought to be reversed for the following reasons:\nFirst, the reading in the indictment of the description of the\nentrails of Smelkoff was interrupted by the justiciary at the very\nbeginning.\'--One."\n\n"But the prosecutor demanded its reading," Nekhludoff said with\nsurprise.\n\n"That is immaterial; the defense could have demanded the same thing."\n\n"But that was entirely unnecessary."\n\n"No matter, it is a ground of appeal. Further: \'Second. Maslova\'s\nattorney,\' he continued to read, \'was interrupted while addressing the\njury, by the justiciary, when, desiring to depict the character of\nMaslova, he touched upon the inner causes of her fall. The ground for\nrefusing to permit him to continue his address was stated to be\nirrelevancy to the question at issue. But as has often been pointed\nout by the Senate, the character and moral features generally of an\naccused are to be given the greatest weight in determining the\nquestion of intent.\'--Two."\n\n"But he spoke so badly that we could not understand him," said\nNekhludoff with still greater surprise.\n\n"He is a very foolish fellow and, of course, could say nothing\nsensible," Fanirin said, laughing. "However, it is a ground for\nappeal. \'Third. In his closing words the justiciary, contrary to the\npositive requirements of section 1, chapter 801 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, failed to explain to the jury of what legal\nelements the theory of guilt consisted; nor did he tell them that if\nthey found that Maslova gave the poison to Smelkoff, but without\nintent to kill, they had the power to discharge her.\' This is the\nprincipal point."\n\n"We could have known that. That was our mistake."\n\n"And finally: \'Fourth,\'" continued the lawyer. "\'The answer of the\njury to the question of Maslova\'s guilt was made in a form which was\nobviously contradictory. Maslova was charged with intentional\npoisoning of Smelkoff, and with robbery as a motive, while the jury,\nin their answer, denied her guilt of the robbery, from which it was\nevident that they intended to acquit her of the intent to kill. Their\nfailure to do so was due to the incomplete charge of the justiciary.\nSuch an answer, therefore, demanded the application of chapters 816\nand 808 of the Code. That is to say, it was the duty of the presiding\njustice to explain to the jury their mistake and refer the question of\nthe guilt of the accused to them for further deliberation.\'"\n\n"Why, then, did he not do it?"\n\n"That is just what I would like to know myself," said Fanirin,\nlaughing.\n\n"So the Senate will correct the mistake."\n\n"That will depend on who will be sitting there when the case is\nheard."\n\n"Well, and then we continue: \'Under these circumstances the court\nerred in imposing on Maslova punishment, and the application to her of\nsection 3, chapter 771 of the Code was a serious violation of the\nbasic principles of the criminal law. Wherefore applicant demands,\netc., etc., be revised in accordance with chs. 909, 910, s. 2, 912 and\n928 of the Code, etc., etc., and referring the case back for a new\ntrial to a different part of the same court.\' Well, now, everything\nthat could be done was done. But I will be frank with you; the\nprobabilities of success are slight. However, everything depends on\nwho will be sitting in the Senate. If you know any one among them,\nbestir yourself."\n\n"Yes, I know some."\n\n"Then you must hasten, for they will soon be gone on their vacation,\nand won\'t return for three months. In case of failure, the only\nrecourse will be to petition the Czar. I shall be at your service also\nin that contingency."\n\n"I thank you. And now as to your honorarium?"\n\n"My clerk will hand you the petition and also my bill."\n\n"One more question I would like to ask you. The prosecutor gave me a\npass for the prison, but I was told there that it was necessary to\nobtain the Governor\'s permission to visit the prison on other than\nvisitors\' days. Is it necessary?"\n\n"I think so. But he is away, and the lieutenant is in his place."\n\n"You mean Maslenikoff?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"I know him," said Nekhludoff, rising to leave.\n\nAt that moment the lawyer\'s wife, an extremely ugly, pug-nosed and\nbony woman, rushed into the room. Not only was her attire unusually\noriginal--she was fairly loaded down with plush and silk things,\nbright yellow and green--but her oily hair was done up in curls, and\nshe triumphantly rushed into the reception-room, accompanied by a\ntall, smiling man with an earth-colored face, in a cut-away coat with\nsilk facings and a white tie. This was an author. He knew Nekhludoff\nby sight.\n\n"Anatal," she said, opening the door, "come here. Semion Ivanovitch\npromised to read to us his poem, and you must read something from\nGarshin."\n\nNekhludoff was preparing to go, but the lawyer\'s wife whispered\nsomething to her husband and turned to him:\n\n"I know you, Prince, and consider an introduction unnecessary. Won\'t\nyou please attend our literary breakfast? It will be very interesting.\nAnatal is an excellent reader."\n\n"You see what variety of duties I have," said Anatal, smiling and\npointing at his wife, thereby expressing the impossibility of\nresisting that bewitching person.\n\nWith a sad and grave face and with the greatest politeness, Nekhludoff\nthanked the lawyer\'s wife for the invitation, pleaded other\nengagements and went into the reception-room.\n\n"What faces he makes!" the lawyer\'s wife said of him, when he had left\nthe room.\n\nIn the reception-room the clerk handed him the petition, and in answer\nto Nekhludoff\'s question about the honorarium, said that Anatal\nSemionovitch set his fee at a thousand rubles; that he really does not\ntake such cases, but does it for Nekhludoff.\n\n"And who is to sign the petition?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"The prisoner may sign it herself, and if that be troublesome, she may\nempower Anatal Semionovitch."\n\n"No, I will go to the prison and obtain her signature," said\nNekhludoff, rejoicing at the opportunity of seeing Katiousha before\nthe appointed day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\n\nAt the usual hour the jailers\' whistles were heard in the corridors of\nthe prison; with a rattling of irons the doors of the corridors and\ncells opened, and the patter of bare feet and the clatter of prison\nshoes resounded through the corridors; the men and women prisoners\nwashed and dressed, and after going through the morning inspection,\nproceeded to brew their tea.\n\nDuring the tea-drinking animated conversations were going on among the\nprisoners in the cells and corridors. Two prisoners were to be flogged\nthat day. One of these was a fairly intelligent young clerk who, in a\nfit of jealousy, had killed his mistress. He was loved by his\nfellow-prisoners for his cheerfulness, liberality and firmness in\ndealing with the authorities. He knew the laws and demanded compliance\nwith them. Three weeks ago the warden struck one of the chambermen for\nspilling some soup on his new uniform. The clerk, Vasilieff, took the\nchamberman\'s part, saying that there was no law permitting an official\nto beat prisoners. "I will show you the law," said the warden,\nreviling Vasilieff. The latter answered in kind. The warden was about\nto strike him, but Vasilieff caught hold of his hands and held him\nfast for about three minutes and then pushed him out of the door. The\nwarden complained and the inspector ordered Vasilieff placed in\nsolitary confinement.\n\nThese cells for solitary confinement were dark closets iron-bolted\nfrom the outside. In these cold, damp cells, devoid of bed, table or\nchair, the prisoners were obliged to sit or lie on the dirty floor.\nThe rats, of which there was a large number, crawled all over them,\nand were so bold that they devoured the prisoner\'s bread and often\nattacked the prisoners themselves when they remained motionless.\nVasilieff resisted, and with the aid of two other prisoners, tore\nhimself loose from the jailers, but they were finally overcome and all\nthree were thrust into cells. It was reported to the Governor that\nsomething like a mutiny occurred, and in answer came a document\nordering that the two chief culprits, Vasilieff and the tramp\nDon\'tremember (an application given to some tramps and jail birds who,\nto conceal the identity, with characteristic ingenuity and stupidity\nmake that answer to all questions relating to their names), be given\nthirty lashes each.\n\nThe flogging was to take place in the women\'s reception-room.\n\nThis was known to all the inmates of the prison since the previous\nevening, and every one was talking of the coming flogging.\n\nKorableva, Miss Dandy, Theodosia and Maslova, flushed and animated,\nfor they had already partaken of vodka which Maslova now had in\nabundance, were sitting in their corner, talking of the same thing.\n\n"Why, he has not misbehaved," Korableva said of Vasilieff, biting off\na piece of sugar with her strong teeth. "He only sided with a comrade.\nFighting, you know, is not allowed nowadays."\n\n"They say he is a fine fellow," added Theodosia, who was sitting on a\nlog on which stood a tea-pot.\n\n"If you were to tell him, Michaelovna," the watch-woman said to\nMaslova, meaning Nekhludoff.\n\n"I will. He will do anything for me," Maslova answered, smiling and\nshaking her head.\n\n"It will be too late; they are going to fetch him now," said\nTheodosia. "It is awful," she added, sighing.\n\n"I have seen once a peasant flogged in the town hall. My\nfather-in-law had sent me to the Mayor of the borough, and when I came\nthere I was surprised to see him----" The watch-woman began a long\nstory.\n\nHer story was interrupted by voices and steps on the upper corridor.\n\nThe women became silent, listening.\n\n"They are bringing him, the fiends," said Miss Dandy. "Won\'t he get it\nnow! The jailers are very angry, for he gave them no rest."\n\nIt became quiet in the upper corridor, and the watch-woman finished\nher story, how she was frightened when she saw the peasant flogged,\nand how it turned her stomach. Miss Dandy told how Schezloff was\nflogged with a lash while he never uttered a word. Theodosia then\nremoved the pots and bowls; Korableva and the watch-woman took to\ntheir sewing, while Maslova, hugging her knees, became sad from ennui.\nShe was about to lay down to sleep when the matron called her into the\noffice, where a visitor was waiting for her.\n\n"Don\'t fail to tell him about us," said the old Menshova, while\nMaslova was arranging her headgear before a looking-glass half void of\nmercury. "It was not me who set the fire, but he, the villain, himself\ndid it, and the laborer saw it. He would not kill a man. Tell him to\ncall Dmitry. Dmitry will explain to him everything. They locked us up\nhere for nothing, while the villain is living with another man\'s wife\nand sits around in dram-shops."\n\n"That\'s wrong!" affirmed Korableva.\n\n"I will tell him--yes, I will," answered Maslova. "Suppose we have a\ndrink, for courage?" she added, winking one eye.\n\nKorableva poured out half a cup for her. Maslova drank it and wiped\nher mouth. Her spirits rose, and repeating the words "for courage,"\nshaking her head and smiling, she followed the matron.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\n\nNekhludoff had been waiting for a long time in the vestibule.\n\nArriving at the prison he rang the front-door bell and handed his pass\nto the warden on duty.\n\n"What do you want?"\n\n"I wish to see the prisoner Maslova."\n\n"Can\'t see her now; the inspector is busy."\n\n"In the office?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"No, here in the visitors\' room," the warden answered, somewhat\nembarrassed, as it seemed to Nekhludoff.\n\n"Why, are visitors admitted to-day?"\n\n"No--special business," he answered.\n\n"Where can I see him, then?"\n\n"He will come out presently. Wait."\n\nAt that moment a sergeant-major in bright crown-laced uniform, his\nface radiant, and his mustache impregnated with smoke, appeared from a\nside door.\n\n"Why did you admit him here? What is the office for?" he said sternly,\nturning to the warden.\n\n"I was told that the inspector was here," said Nekhludoff, surprised\nat the embarrassment noticeable on the officer\'s face.\n\nAt that moment the inner door opened and Petroff, flushed and\nperspiring, came out.\n\n"He will remember it," he said, turning to the sergeant-major.\n\nThe latter pointed with his eyes to Nekhludoff, and Petroff became\nsilent, frowned and walked out through the rear door.\n\n"Who will remember? What? Why are they all so embarrassed? Why did the\nsergeant make that sign?" thought Nekhludoff.\n\n"You cannot wait here; please walk into the office," the\nsergeant-major turned to Nekhludoff, who was about to go out when the\ninspector came in through the inner door, more embarrassed even than\nhis assistants. He was sighing incessantly. Seeing Nekhludoff, he\nturned to the warden:\n\n"Fedotoff, call Maslova."\n\n"Follow me, please," he said to Nekhludoff. They passed up a winding\nstairway leading into a small room with one window and containing a\nwriting table and a few chairs. The inspector sat down.\n\n"Mine are disagreeable duties," he said, turning to Nekhludoff and\nlighting a thick cigarette.\n\n"You seem tired," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"I am very tired of all this business; my duties are very onerous. I\nam trying my best to alleviate the condition of the prisoners and\nthings are getting only worse. I am very anxious to get away from\nhere; the duties are very, very unpleasant."\n\nNekhludoff could not understand what it was that made it so unpleasant\nfor the inspector, but to-day he noticed on the inspector\'s face an\nexpression of despondency and hopelessness which was pitiful to\nbehold.\n\n"Yes, I think they are very trying," he said. "But why do you not\nresign?"\n\n"I have a family and am without means."\n\n"But if it is difficult----"\n\n"Well, you see, I manage to improve somewhat their lot after all.\nAnother one in my place would hardly exert himself as I do. It is no\neasy matter to handle two thousand people. They are also human and one\nfeels pity for them, and yet they can\'t be allowed to have all their\nown way."\n\nAnd the inspector related the case of a recent fight among the\nprisoners which ended in murder.\n\nHis story was interrupted by the entrance of Maslova, who was preceded\nby the warden.\n\nNekhludoff got sight of her when she appeared on the threshold and\nbefore she saw the inspector. Her face was red, and she walked briskly\nbehind the warden, smiling and shaking her head. Noticing the\ninspector she gazed at him with frightened face, but immediately\nrecovered herself and boldly and cheerfully turned to Nekhludoff.\n\n"How do you do?" she said, drawlingly, smiling and vigorously shaking\nhis hand, not as on the former occasion.\n\n"Here I have brought you the petition to sign," said Nekhludoff,\nsomewhat surprised at the forward manner in which she accosted him.\n"The lawyer wrote it. It must be signed and sent to St. Petersburg."\n\n"Why, certainly. I will do anything," she said, winking one eye and\nsmiling.\n\n"May she sign it here?" Nekhludoff asked of the inspector.\n\n"Come here and sit down," said the inspector. "Here is a pen for you.\nCan you write?"\n\n"I could write once," she said, smiling, and, arranging her skirt and\nwaist-sleeve, sat down, clumsily took the pen into her small,\nenergetic hand, began to laugh and looked round at Nekhludoff.\n\nHe pointed out to her where to sign.\n\nDiligently dipping and shaking the pen she signed her name.\n\n"Do you wish anything else?" she asked, looking now at Nekhludoff, now\nat the inspector, and depositing the pen now on the ink-stand, now on\nthe paper.\n\n"I wish to tell you something," said Nekhludoff, taking the pen from\nher hand.\n\n"Very well; go on," she uttered, and suddenly, as though meditating or\ngrowing sleepy, her face became grave.\n\nThe inspector rose and walked out, leaving Nekhludoff with her alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\n\nThe warden who brought Maslova to the office seated himself on the\nwindow-sill, away from the table. This was a decisive moment for\nNekhludoff. He had been constantly reproaching himself for not telling\nher at their first meeting of his intention to marry her, and was now\ndetermined to do so. She was sitting on one side of the table, and\nNekhludoff seated himself on the other side, opposite her. The room\nwas well lighted, and for the first time Nekhludoff clearly saw her\nface from a short distance, and noticed wrinkles around the eyes and\nlips and a slight swelling under her eyes, and he pitied her even more\nthan before.\n\nResting his elbows on the table so that he should not be heard by the\nwarden, whose face was of a Jewish type, with grayish side-whiskers,\nhe said:\n\n"If this petition fails we will appeal to His Majesty. Nothing will be\nleft undone."\n\n"If it had been done before--if I had had a good lawyer"--she\ninterrupted him. "That lawyer of mine was such a little fool. He was\nonly making me compliments," she said, and began to laugh. "If they\nhad only known that I was your acquaintance, it would have been\ndifferent. They think that everybody is a thief."\n\n"How strange she is to-day," thought Nekhludoff, and was about to tell\nher what he had on his mind when she again began to speak.\n\n"I wanted to tell you. There is an old woman here--we are even\nsurprised--such a good little woman, but there she is--she and her\nson, both in prison, and everybody knows that they are innocent. They\nare accused of setting fire, so they are in prison. She learned, you\nknow, that I am acquainted with you," said Maslova, turning her head\nand casting glances at him, "and she says to me: \'Tell him,\' she says,\n\'to call my son; he will tell him the whole story.\' Menshoff is his\nname. Well, will you do it? Such a good little woman. You can see for\nyourself that she is not guilty. You will help them, dear, won\'t you?"\nshe said, glancing at him; then she lowered her eyes and smiled.\n\n"Very well; I will do it," said Nekhludoff, his surprise at her easy\nmanner growing, "but I would like to talk to you about my own affair.\nDo you remember what I told you that time?"\n\n"You have spoken so much. What did you say that time?" she said,\ncontinuing to smile and turning her head now to one side, now to the\nother.\n\n"I said that I came to ask your forgiveness," he said.\n\n"Oh! Forgiveness, forgiveness! That is all nonsense. You had better----"\n\n"That I wish to atone for my sin," continued Nekhludoff, "and to\natone not by words but by deed. I have decided to marry you."\n\nHer face suddenly showed fright. Her squinting eyes became fixed, and\nthey looked and did not look at him.\n\n"What is that for?" And she frowned maliciously.\n\n"I feel that before God I must do it."\n\n"What God, now, are you talking about? You are not talking to the\npoint. God? What God? Why didn\'t you think of God then?" she said, and\nopening her mouth, stopped short.\n\nNekhludoff only now smelled a strong odor of liquor and understood the\ncause of her excitement.\n\n"Be calm," he said.\n\n"I have nothing to be calm about. You think I am drunk? Yes, I am\ndrunk, but I know what I am talking about," she said quickly, and her\nface became purple. "I am a convict, while you are a lord, a prince,\nand needn\'t stay here to soil your hands. Go to your princesses----"\n\n"You cannot be too cruel to me; you do not know how I feel," he said\nin a low voice, his whole body trembling. "You cannot imagine how\nstrongly I feel my guilt before you!"\n\n"Feel my guilt," she mocked him maliciously. "You did not feel it\nthen, but thrust a hundred rubles in my hands. \'That\'s your price----\'"\n\n"I know, I know, but what am I to do now? I have decided not to leave\nyou," he repeated; "and what I say I will do."\n\n"And I say that you will not!" she said, and laughed aloud.\n\n"Katinsha!" he began.\n\n"Leave me. I am a convict, and you are a prince; and you have no\nbusiness here," she shrieked, violently releasing her hand from his,\nher wrath knowing no limit.\n\n"You wish to save yourself through me," she continued, hastening to\npour out all that had accumulated in her soul. "You have made me the\nmeans of your enjoyment in life, and now you wish to make me the means\nof saving you after death! You disgust me, as do your eye-glasses and\nthat fat, dirty face of yours. Go, go away!" she shrieked,\nenergetically springing to her feet.\n\nThe warden approached them.\n\n"Don\'t you make so much noise! You know whom----"\n\n"Please desist," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"She must not forget herself," said the warden.\n\n"Please wait a while," said Nekhludoff.\n\nThe warden returned to his seat on the window-sill.\n\nMaslova again seated herself, her eyes downcast and her little hands\nclutching each other.\n\nNekhludoff stood over her, not knowing what to do.\n\n"You do not believe me," he said.\n\n"That you wish to marry me? That will never happen. I will sooner hang\nmyself."\n\n"But I will serve you anyway."\n\n"That is your business. Only I don\'t want anything from you. Now, that\nis certain," she said. "Oh, why did I not die then!" she added, and\nbegan to cry piteously.\n\nNekhludoff could not speak; her tears called forth tears in his own\neyes.\n\nShe raised her eyes, looked at him, as if surprised, and with her\n\'kerchief began to wipe the tears streaming down her cheeks.\n\nThe warden again approached them and reminded them that it was time to\npart. Maslova rose.\n\n"You are excited now. If possible I will call to-morrow. Meantime,\nthink it over," said Nekhludoff.\n\nShe made no answer, and without looking at him left the room, preceded\nby the warden.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n"Well, girl, good times are coming," said Korableva to Maslova when\nthe latter returned to the cell. "He seems to be stuck on you, so make\nthe most of it while he is calling. He will get you released. The rich\ncan do anything."\n\n"That\'s so," drawled the watch-woman. "The poor man will think ten\ntimes before he will marry, while the rich man can satisfy his every\nwhim. Yes, my dear; there was a respectable man in our village, and\nhe----"\n\n"Have you spoken to him of my case?" asked the old woman.\n\nBut Maslova was silent. She lay down on her bunk, gazing with her\nsquinting eyes into the corner, and remained in that position till\nevening. Her soul was in torment. That which Nekhludoff told her\nopened to her that world in which she had suffered and which she had\nleft, hating without understanding it. She had now lost that\nforgetfulness in which she had lived, and to live with a clear\nrecollection of the past was painful. In the evening she again bought\nwine, which she drank with her fellow-prisoners.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\n\n"So, that is how it is!" thought Nekhludoff as he made his way out of\nthe prison, and he only now realized the extent of his guilt. Had he\nnot attempted to efface and atone for his conduct, he should never\nhave felt all the infamy of it, nor she all the wrong perpetrated\nagainst her. Only now it all came out in all its horror. He now for\nthe first time perceived how her soul had been debased, and she\nfinally understood it. At first Nekhludoff had played with his\nfeelings and delighted in his own contrition; now he was simply\nhorrified. He now felt that to abandon her was impossible. And yet he\ncould not see the result of these relations.\n\nAt the prison gate some one handed Nekhludoff a note. He read it when\non the street. The note was written in a bold hand, with pencil, and\ncontained the following:\n\n    "Having learned that you are visiting the prison I thought\n    it would be well to see you. You can see me by asking the\n    authorities for an interview with me. I will tell you\n    something very important to your protege as well as to the\n    politicals. Thankfully, Vera Bogodukhovskaia"\n\n"Bogodukhovskaia! Who is Bogodukhovskaia?" thought Nekhludoff,\nentirely absorbed in the impression of his meeting with Maslova, and\nfailing at the first moment to recall either the name or the\nhandwriting. "Oh, yes!" he suddenly recalled. "The deacon\'s daughter\nat the bear-hunt."\n\nVera Bogodukhovskaia was a teacher in the obscure district of\nNovgorod, whither Nekhludoff, on one occasion, went bear hunting with\nhis friends. This teacher had asked Nekhludoff to give her some money\nto enable her to study. He gave it to her, and the incident dropped\nfrom his memory. And now it seemed that this lady was a political\nprisoner, had probably learned his history in prison, and was now\noffering her services. At that time everything was easy and simple;\nnow everything was difficult and complex. Nekhludoff readily and\njoyfully recalled that time and his acquaintance with Bogodukhovskaia.\nIt was on the eve of Shrovetide, in the wilds about sixty versts from\nthe railroad. The hunt was successful; two bears were bagged, and they\nwere dining before their journey home, when the woodsman, in whose hut\nthey were stopping, came to tell them that the deacon\'s daughter had\ncome and wished to see Prince Nekhludoff.\n\n"Is she good looking?" some one asked.\n\n"Come, come!" said Nekhludoff, rising, and wondering why the deacon\'s\ndaughter should want him, assumed a grave expression and went to the\nwoodsman\'s hut.\n\nIn the hut there was a girl in a felt hat and short fur coat, sinewy,\nand with an ugly and unpleasant face, relieved, however, by her\npleasant eyes and raised eyebrows.\n\n"This is the Prince, Vera Efremovna," said the old hostess. "I will\nleave you."\n\n"What can I do for you?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"I--I--You see, you are rich and throw away your money on trifles, on\na chase. I know," began the girl, becoming confused, "but I wish but\none thing; I wish to be useful to people, and can do nothing because I\nknow nothing."\n\n"What, then, can I do for you?"\n\n"I am a teacher, and would like to enter college, but they don\'t let\nme. It is not exactly that they don\'t let me, but we have no means.\nLet me have some money; when I am through with my studies I shall\nreturn it to you."\n\nHer eyes were truthful and kindly, and the expression of resolution\nand timidity on her face was so touching that Nekhludoff, as it was\nusual with him, suddenly mentally placed himself in her position,\nunderstood and pitied her.\n\n"I think it is wrong for rich people to kill bears and get the\npeasants drunk. Why don\'t they make themselves useful? I only need\neighty rubles. Oh, if you don\'t wish to, it is all the same to me,"\nshe said, angrily, interpreting the grave expression on Nekhludoff\'s\nface to her disadvantage.\n\n"On the contrary, I am very thankful to you for the opportunity----"\n\nWhen she understood that he consented her face turned a purple color\nand she became silent.\n\n"I will fetch it immediately," said Nekhludoff.\n\nHe went into the entrance hall where he found an eavesdropping friend.\nWithout taking notice of his comrade\'s jests, he took the money from\nhis hand-bag and brought it to her.\n\n"Please don\'t be thanking me. It is I who ought to be thankful to\nyou."\n\nIt was pleasant to Nekhludoff to recall all that; it was pleasant to\nrecall how he came near quarreling with the army officer who attempted\nto make a bad joke of it; how another comrade sided with him, which\ndrew them more closely together; how merry and successful was the\nhunt, and how happy he felt that night returning to the railroad\nstation. A long file of sleighs moved noiselessly in pairs at a gentle\ntrot along the narrow fir-lined path of the forests, which were\ncovered with a heavy layer of snowflakes. Some one struck a red light\nin the dark, and the pleasant aroma of a good cigarette was wafted\ntoward him. Osip, the sleigh-tender, ran from sleigh to sleigh,\nknee-deep in snow, telling of the elks that were roaming in the deep\nsnow, nibbling the bark of aspen trees, and of the bears emitting\ntheir warm breath through the airholes of their wild haunts.\n\nNekhludoff remembered all that, and above all the happy consciousness\nof his own health, strength and freedom from care. His lungs,\nstraining his tight-fitting fur coat, inhaled the frosty air; the\ntrees, grazed by the shaft, sent showers of white flakes into his\nface; his body was warm, his face ruddy; his soul was without a care\nor blemish, or fear or desire. How happy he was! But now? My God! How\npainful and unbearable it all was!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\n\nRising the next morning Nekhludoff recalled the events of the previous\nday and was seized with fear.\n\nBut, notwithstanding this fear, he was even more determined than\nbefore to carry out his plan already begun.\n\nWith this consciousness of the duty that lay upon him he drove to\nMaslenikoff for permission to visit in jail, besides Maslova, the old\nwoman Menshova and her son, of whom Maslova had spoken to him.\nBesides, he also wished to see Bogodukhovskaia, who might be useful to\nMaslova.\n\nNekhludoff had known Maslenikoff since they together served in the\narmy. Maslenikoff was the treasurer of the regiment. He was the most\nkind-hearted officer, and possessed executive ability. Nothing in\nsociety was of any interest to him, and he was entirely absorbed in\nthe affairs of the regiment. Nekhludoff now found him an administrator\nin the civil government. He was married to a rich and energetic woman\nto whom was due his change of occupation.\n\nShe laughed at him and patted him as she would a tamed animal.\nNekhludoff had visited them once the previous winter, but the couple\nseemed so uninteresting to him that he never called again.\n\nMaslenikoff\'s face became radiant when he saw Nekhludoff. His face was\nas fat and red, his dress as excellent as when he served in the army.\nAs an army officer he was always neat, dressed in a tight uniform made\naccording to the latest style; now his dress fitted his well-fed body\nas perfectly. He wore a uniform. Notwithstanding the difference in\ntheir age--Maslenikoff was about forty--they familiarly "thoued" each\nother.\n\n"Very glad you remembered me. Come to my wife. I have just ten minutes\nto spare, and then I must to the session. My chief, you know, is away.\nI am directing the affairs of the district," he said, with joy which\nhe could not conceal.\n\n"I came to you on business."\n\n"What\'s that?" Maslenikoff said in a frightened and somewhat stern\nvoice, suddenly pricking his ears.\n\n"There is a person in jail in whom I am very much interested;" at the\nword "jail" Maslenikoff\'s face became even more stern, "and I would\nlike to have the right of interview in the office instead of the\ncommon reception room, and oftener than on the appointed days. I was\ntold that it depended on you."\n\n"Of course, mon cher, I am always ready to do anything for you,"\nMaslenikoff said, touching his knees with both hands, as if desiring\nto soften his own greatness. "I can do it, but you know I am caliph\nonly for an hour."\n\n"So you can give me a pass that will enable me to see her?"\n\n"It is a woman?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"What is the charge against her?"\n\n"Poisoning. But she was irregularly convicted."\n\n"Yes, there is justice for you! Ils n\'en font point d\'autres," he\nsaid, for some reason in French. "I know that you do not agree with\nme, but c\'est mon opinion bien arretee," he added, repeating the\nopinion that had been reiterated during the past year by a retrograde,\nconservative newspaper. "I know you are a liberal."\n\n"I don\'t know whether I am a liberal or something else," smilingly\nsaid Nekhludoff, who always wondered at being joined to some party, or\ncalled a liberal only because he held that a man must not be judged\nwithout being heard; that all are equal before the law; that it is\nwrong to torture and beat people generally, especially those that are\nnot convicted. "I don\'t know whether I am a liberal or not, but I do\nknow that our present courts, bad as they are, are nevertheless better\nthan those that preceded them."\n\n"And what lawyer have you retained?"\n\n"I have retained Fanarin."\n\n"Ah, Fanarin!" Maslenikoff said, frowning as he recalled how Fanarin,\nexamining him as a witness the year before, in the most polite manner\nmade him the butt of ridicule.\n\n"I would not advise you to have anything to do with him. Fanarin est\nun homme tare."\n\n"I have another request to make of you," Nekhludoff said, without\nanswering him. "A long time ago I made the acquaintance of a girl\nteacher, a very wretched creature. She is now in jail and desires to\nsee me. Can you give me a pass to her?"\n\nMaslenikoff leaned his head to one side and began to reflect.\n\n"She is a political."\n\n"Yes, I was told so."\n\n"You know politicals can only be seen by their relatives, but I will\ngive you a general pass. Je sais que vous n\'abuserez pas----"\n\n"What is the name of this your protege? Bogodukhovskaia? Elle est\njolie?"\n\n"Hideuse."\n\nMaslenikoff disapprovingly shook his head, went to the table and on a\nsheet of paper with a printed letter-head wrote in a bold hand: "The\nbearer, Prince Dmitri Ivanovich Nekhludoff, is hereby permitted to\nvisit the prisoners, Maslova and Bogodukhovskaia, now detained in the\nprison," and signed his name to it with a broad flourish.\n\n"You will see now what order there is in prison. And to keep order\nthere is very difficult, because it is overcrowded, especially by\nthose to be transported. But I watch over them, and like the\noccupation. You will see there are very many there, but they are\ncontent, and are faring well. It is necessary to know how to deal with\nthem. Some unpleasantness occurred there a few days ago--disobedience.\nAnother man in my place would have treated it as a riot and made many\npeople miserable, but we arranged it all pleasantly. What is necessary\nis solicitude on the one hand, and prompt and vigorous dealing on the\nother," he said, clenching his soft, white fist projecting from under\na white, starched cuff and adorned with a turquoise ring--"solicitude\nand vigorous dealing."\n\n"Well, I don\'t know about that," said Nekhludoff. "I was there twice,\nand I was very much distressed by the sight."\n\n"You know what I will tell you? You ought to get acquainted with\nPrincess Passek," continued Maslenikoff, who had become talkative;\n"she has entirely devoted herself to this cause. Elle fait beaucoup\nde bien. Thanks to her and, without false modesty, to myself,\neverything has been changed, and changed so that none of the old\nhorrors can be found there, and they are decidedly well off there. You\nwill see it. There is Fanarin. I am not personally acquainted with\nhim; besides, our roads do not meet because of my position in society,\nbut he is decidedly a bad man, and allows himself to state in court\nsuch things, such things!"\n\n"Well, thank you," said Nekhludoff, taking the document, and took\nleave of his old comrade.\n\n"Would you not like to see my wife?"\n\n"No, thank you; I have no time now."\n\n"Well, now, she will never forgive me," said Maslenikoff, conducting\nhis old comrade to the first landing, as he did with people of\nsecondary importance, among whom he reckoned Nekhludoff. "Do come but\nfor a moment."\n\nBut Nekhludoff was firm, and while the footman and porter sprang\ntoward him, handing him his overcoat and cane, and opening the door,\nbefore which a policeman stood, he excused himself, pleading want of\ntime.\n\n"Well, then, Thursday, please. That is her reception day. I will tell\nher!" Maslenikoff shouted from the top of the stairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\n\nFrom Maslenikoff, Nekhludoff went directly to the prison and\napproached the familiar apartments of the inspector. The sounds of a\ntuneless piano again assailed his ears, but this time it was not a\nrhapsody that was played, but a study by Clementi, and, as before,\nwith unusual force, precision and rapidity. The servant with a\nhandkerchief around one eye said that the captain was in, and showed\nNekhludoff into the small reception-room, in which was a lounge, a\ntable and a lamp, one side of the rose-colored shade of which was\nscorched, standing on a knitted woolen napkin. The inspector appeared\nwith an expression of sadness and torment on his face.\n\n"Glad to see you. What can I do for you?" he said, buttoning up the\nmiddle button of his uniform.\n\n"I went to the vice-governor, and here is my pass," said Nekhludoff,\nhanding him the document. "I would like to see Maslova."\n\n"Markova?" asked the inspector, who could not hear him on account of\nthe music.\n\n"Maslova."\n\n"O, yes! O, yes!"\n\nThe inspector rose and approached the door through which Clementi\'s\nroulade was heard.\n\n"Marusia; if you would only stop for a little while," he said in a\nvoice which showed that this music was the cross of his life; "I\ncannot hear anything."\n\nThe music ceased; discontented steps were heard, and some one looked\nthrough the door.\n\nThe inspector, as if relieved by the cessation of the music, lit a\nthick cigarette of light tobacco and offered one to Nekhludoff, which\nhe refused.\n\n"Can Maslova----"\n\n"It is not convenient to see Maslova to-day," said the inspector.\n\n"Why?"\n\n"It is your own fault," slightly smiling, said the inspector. "Prince,\nyou must not give her any money. If you wish to give her money, leave\nit with me; I will keep it for her. You see, you must have given her\nmoney yesterday, for she bought wine--it is hard to eradicate that\nevil--and is intoxicated to-day. In fact, she became unruly."\n\n"Is it possible?"\n\n"Why, I even had to employ strict measures, had her transferred to\nanother cell. She is very tractable, but, please do not give her\nmoney. That is their failing."\n\nNekhludoff quickly recalled the incident of yesterday, and he was\nseized with fear.\n\n"And may I see Bogodukhovskaia, the political?" Nekhludoff asked,\nafter some silence.\n\n"Well, yes," said the inspector. "What are you doing here?" he turned\nto a five-year-old girl who came into the room, walking toward her\nfather, her eyes riveted on Nekhludoff. "Look out, or you will fall,"\nhe said, smiling, as the little girl, walking with her head turned\ntoward Nekhludoff, tripped on the carpet and ran to her father.\n\n"If she may be seen, I would go now."\n\n"Oh yes; she may be seen, of course," said the inspector, embracing\nthe little girl, who was still looking at Nekhludoff. "All right----"\n\nThe inspector rose and gently turning the girl aside, walked into the\nvestibule.\n\nHe had scarcely donned the overcoat handed him by the girl with the\nbandaged eye and crossed the threshold when the distinct sounds of\nClementi\'s roulade broke out.\n\n"She was at the Conservatory, but there is disorder in that\ninstitution. But she is very gifted," said the inspector, walking down\nthe stairs. "She intends to appear at concerts."\n\nThe inspector and Nekhludoff neared the prison. The wicket immediately\nopened at the approach of the inspector. The wardens standing to\nattention followed him with their eyes. Four men with heads half\nshaved, carrying large vessels, met him in the vestibule, and as they\nspied him slunk back. One of them, in a particularly gloomy way, knit\nhis brow, his black eyes flashing fire.\n\n"Of course, her talent must be perfected; it cannot be neglected. But\nin a small apartment it is hard, you know," the inspector continued\nthe conversation without paying any attention to the prisoners, and\ndragging his tired legs passed into the meeting-room, followed by\nNekhludoff.\n\n"Whom do you wish to see?" asked the inspector.\n\n"Bogodukhovskaia."\n\n"That is from the tower. You will have to wait a little," he turned to\nNekhludoff.\n\n"Couldn\'t you let me see, meantime, the prisoners Menshov--mother and\nson--who are charged with incendiarism?"\n\n"That is from cell 21. Why, yes; they may be called out."\n\n"Would you allow me to see the son in his cell?"\n\n"It is quieter in the meeting-room."\n\n"But it is interesting to see him there."\n\n"Interesting!"\n\nAt that moment a dashing officer, the inspector\'s assistant, appeared\nat a side door.\n\n"Conduct the Prince to Menshov\'s cell--No. 21," said the inspector to\nhis assistant. "Then show him to the office. And I will call--what is\nher name?"\n\n"Vera Bogodukhovskaia," said Nekhludoff.\n\nThe inspector\'s assistant was a light-haired young officer with dyed\nmustache, who spread around him the odor of perfume.\n\n"Follow me, please." He turned to Nekhludoff with a pleasant smile.\n"Does our institution interest you?"\n\n"Yes. And I am also interested in that man who, I was told, is\ninnocent." The assistant shrugged his shoulders.\n\n"Yes, that may be," he said calmly, courteously admitting the guest\ninto the ill-smelling corridor. "But they also lie often. Walk in,\nplease."\n\nThe doors of the cells were open, and some prisoners stood in the\ncorridor. Slightly nodding to the wardens and looking askance at the\nprisoners, who either pressed against the walls, entered their cells,\nor, stopping at the doors, stood erect like soldiers, the assistant\nescorted Nekhludoff through one corridor into another, on the left,\nwhich was iron-bolted.\n\nThis corridor was darker and more ill-smelling than the first. There\nwas a row of cells on each side, the doors of which were locked. There\nwas a hole in each door--eyelet, so called--of about an inch in\ndiameter. There was no one in this corridor except an old warden with\na wrinkled, sad face.\n\n"Where is Menshov\'s cell?" asked the assistant.\n\n"The eighth one on the left."\n\n"Are these occupied?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"All but one."\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\n\n"May I look in?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"If you please," the assistant said with a pleasant smile, and began\nto make inquiries of the warden. Nekhludoff looked through one of the\nopenings. A tall young man with a small black beard, clad only in his\nlinen, walked rapidly up and down the floor of his cell. Hearing a\nrustle at the door, he looked up, frowned, and continued to walk.\n\nNekhludoff looked into the second opening. His eye met another large,\nfrightened eye. He hastily moved away. Looking into the third, he saw\na small-sized man sleeping curled up on a cot, his head covered with\nhis prison coat. In the fourth cell a broad-faced, pale-looking man\nsat with lowered head, his elbows resting on his knees. Hearing steps,\nthis man raised his head and looked up. In his face and eyes was an\nexpression of hopeless anguish. He was apparently unconcerned about\nwho it was that looked into his cell. Whoever it might be, he\nevidently hoped for no good from any one. Nekhludoff was seized with\nfear, and he hastened to Number 21--Menshov\'s cell. The warden\nunlocked and opened the door. A young, muscular man with a long neck,\nkindly, round eyes and small beard, stood beside his cot, hastily\ndonning his prison coat and, with frightened face, looking at the two\nmen who had entered. Nekhludoff was particularly struck by the kindly,\nround eyes whose wondering and startled look ran from him to the\nwarden and back.\n\n"This gentleman wishes to ask you about your case."\n\n"Thank you."\n\n"Yes, I was told about your case," said Nekhludoff, going into the\ndepth of the cell and stopping at the barred, dirty window, "and would\nlike to hear it from yourself."\n\nMenshov also drew near the window and immediately began to relate the\nparticulars of his case--at first timidly, from time to time glancing\nat the warden, then growing bolder and bolder. And when the warden\nhad left the cell to give some orders, his timidity left him entirely.\nJudging by his speech and manner, his was a story of a simple, honest\npeasant, and it seemed very strange to Nekhludoff to hear it from the\nlips of a prisoner in the garb of disgrace and in prison. While\nlistening to him, Nekhludoff examined the low cot, with its straw\nmattress, the window, with its thick iron bars, the damp, plastered\nwalls, the pitiful face and the figure of the unfortunate, mutilated\npeasant in bast shoes and prison coat, and he became sad; he would not\nbelieve that what this kind-hearted man told him was true. And it was\nstill harder to think that this truthful story should be false, and\nthat kindly face should deceive him. His story, in short, was that\nsoon after his wedding a tapster enticed away his wife. He had\nrecourse to the law everywhere, and the tapster was everywhere\nacquitted. Once he took her away by force, but she ran away the\nfollowing day. He went to the seducer, demanding his wife. The tapster\ntold him that she was not there, although he saw her when coming in,\nand ordered him to depart. He would not go. Then the tapster and\nanother workman beat him until he bled, and the following day the\ntapster\'s house took fire. He and his mother were charged with\nincendiarism, although at the time the fire broke out he was visiting\na friend.\n\n"And you really did not set the fire?"\n\n"I never even thought of such a thing, master. The villain must have\ndone it himself. They say that he had just insured his house. And he\nsaid that I and my mother came and threatened him. It is true, I\nabused him at that time--couldn\'t help it--but I did not set the fire,\nand was not even in the neighborhood when the fire started. He set the\nfire purposely on the day I was there with my mother. He did it for\nthe insurance money, and threw it on us."\n\n"Is it possible?"\n\n"As true as there is a living God, master. Do help us!" He was about\nto bow to the ground, but Nekhludoff forcibly prevented him. "Release\nme. I am suffering here innocently," he continued. His face suddenly\nbegan to twitch; tears welled up in his eyes, and, rolling up the\nsleeve of his coat, he began to wipe his eyes with the dirty sleeve\nof his shirt.\n\n"Have you finished?" asked the warden.\n\n"Yes. Cheer up; I will do what I can for you," Nekhludoff said, and\nwalked out. Menshov stood in the door, so that when the warden closed\nit he pushed him in. While the warden was locking the door, Menshov\nlooked through the hole.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\n\nIt was dinner time when Nekhludoff retraced his steps through the wide\ncorridor, and the cells were open. The prisoners, in light yellow\ncoats, short, wide trousers and prison shoes, eyed him greedily.\nNekhludoff experienced strange feelings and commiseration for the\nprisoners, and, for some reason, shame that he should so calmly view\nit.\n\nIn one of the corridors a man, clattering with his prison shoes, ran\ninto one of the cells, and immediately a crowd of people came out,\nplaced themselves in his way, and bowed.\n\n"Your Excellency--I don\'t know what to call you--please order that our\ncase be decided."\n\n"I am not the commander. I do not know anything."\n\n"No matter. Tell them, the authorities, or somebody," said an\nindignant voice, "to look into our case. We are guilty of no offense,\nand have been in prison the second month now."\n\n"How so? Why?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"We don\'t know ourselves why, but we have been here the second month."\n\n"That is true," said the assistant inspector. "They were taken because\nthey had no passports, and they were to be transported to their\ndistrict, but the prison had burned down there, and the authorities\nasked us to keep them here. Those belonging to other districts were\ntransported, but these we keep here."\n\n"Is that the only reason?" asked Nekhludoff, stopping in the doorway.\n\nThe crowd, consisting of about forty men, all in prison garb,\nsurrounded Nekhludoff and the assistant. Several voices began talking\nat once. The assistant stopped them.\n\n"Let one of you speak."\n\nA tall old man of good mien came forward. He told Nekhludoff that they\nwere all imprisoned on the ground that they had no passports, but\nthat, as a matter of fact, they had passports which had expired and\nwere not renewed for about two weeks. It happened every year, but they\nwere never even fined. And now they were imprisoned like criminals.\n\n"We are all masons and belong to the same association. They say that\nthe prison has burned down, but that isn\'t our fault. For God\'s sake,\nhelp us!"\n\nNekhludoff listened, but scarcely understood what the old man was\nsaying.\n\n"How is that? Can it be possible that they are kept in prison for that\nsole reason?" said Nekhludoff, turning to the assistant.\n\n"Yes, they ought to be sent to their homes," said the assistant.\n\nAt that moment a small-sized man, also in prison attire, pushed his\nway through the crowd and began to complain excitedly that they were\nbeing tortured without any cause.\n\n"Worse than dogs----" he began.\n\n"Tut, tut! do not talk too much, or else you know----"\n\n"Know what?" said the little man desperately. "Are we guilty of\nanything?"\n\n"Silence!" shouted the assistant, and the little man subsided.\n\n"What a peculiar state of things!" Nekhludoff said to himself as he\nran the gauntlet, as it were, of a hundred eyes that followed him\nthrough the corridor.\n\n"Is it possible that innocent people are held in durance here?"\nNekhludoff said, when they emerged from the corridor.\n\n"What can we do? However, many of them are lying. If you ask them,\nthey all claim to be innocent," said the assistant inspector;\n"although some are there really without any cause whatever."\n\n"But these masons don\'t seem to be guilty of any offense."\n\n"That is true so far as the masons are concerned. But those people\nare spoiled. Some measure of severity is necessary. They are not all\nas innocent as they look. Only yesterday we were obliged to punish two\nof them."\n\n"Punish, how?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"By flogging. It was ordered----"\n\n"But corporal punishment has been abolished."\n\n"Not for those that have been deprived of civil rights."\n\nNekhludoff recalled what he had seen the other day while waiting in\nthe vestibule, and understood that the punishment had then been taking\nplace, and with peculiar force came upon him that mingled feeling of\ncuriosity, sadness, doubt, and moral, almost passing over into\nphysical, nausea which he had felt before, but never with such force.\n\nWithout listening to the assistant or looking around him, he hastily\npassed through the corridor and ascended to the office. The inspector\nwas in the corridor, and, busying himself with some affair, had forgot\nto send for Bogodukhovskaia. He only called it to mind when Nekhludoff\nentered the office.\n\n"I will send for her immediately. Take a seat," he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\n\nThe office consisted of two rooms. In the first room, which had two\ndirty windows and the plastering on the walls peeled off, a black\nmeasuring rod, for determining the height of prisoners, stood in one\ncorner, while in another hung a picture of Christ. A few wardens stood\naround in this room. In the second room, in groups and pairs, about\ntwenty men and women were sitting along the walls, talking in low\nvoices. A writing table stood near one of the windows.\n\nThe inspector seated himself at the writing table and offered\nNekhludoff a chair standing near by. Nekhludoff seated himself and\nbegan to examine the people in the room.\n\nHis attention was first of all attracted by a young man with a\npleasant face, wearing a short jacket, who was standing before a man\nprisoner and a girl, gesticulating and talking to them in a heated\nmanner. Beside them sat an old man in blue eye-glasses, immovably\nholding the hand of a woman in prison garb and listening to her. A boy\nin high-school uniform, with an expression of fright on his face,\nstood gazing on the old man. Not far from them, in the corner, a pair\nof lovers were sitting. She was a very young, pretty, stylishly-dressed\ngirl with short-cropped, flaxen hair and an energetic face; he was a\nfine-featured, handsome youth, with wavy hair, and in a prison coat.\nThey occupied the corner, whispering to each other, apparently wrapped\nin their love. Nearest of all to the table was a gray-haired woman in\nblack, evidently the mother of a consumptive young man in a rubber\njacket, who stood before her. Her eyes were fixed on him, and her\ntears prevented her speaking, which she several times attempted to do,\nbut was forced to desist. The young man held a piece of paper in his\nhand, and, evidently not knowing what to do, with an angry expression\non his face was folding and crumpling it. Sitting beside the weeping\nmother, and patting her on the shoulder, was a stout, pretty girl with\nred cheeks, in a gray dress and cape. Everything in this girl was\nbeautiful--the white hands, the wavy, short hair, the strong nose and\nlips; but the principal charm of her face were her hazel, kindly,\ntruthful, sheep eyes. Her beautiful eyes turned on Nekhludoff at the\nmoment he entered, and met his. But she immediately turned them again\non her mother, and whispered to her something. Not far from the lovers\na dark man with gloomy face sat talking angrily to a clean-shaven\nvisitor resembling a Skopetz (a sect of castrates). At the very door\nstood a young man in a rubber jacket, evidently more concerned about\nthe impression he was making on the visitors than what he was saying.\nNekhludoff sat down beside the inspector and looked around him with\nintense curiosity. He was amused by a short-haired boy coming near him\nand asking him in a shrill voice:\n\n"And whom are you waiting for?"\n\nThe question surprised Nekhludoff, but, seeing the boy\'s serious,\nintelligent face, with bright, attentive eyes, gravely answered that\nhe was awaiting a woman acquaintance.\n\n"Well, is she your sister?" asked the boy.\n\n"No, she is not my sister," Nekhludoff answered with surprise. "And\nwith whom are you?"\n\n"I am with mamma. She is a political," said the boy.\n\n"Maria Pavlovna, take away Kolia!" said the inspector, evidently\nfinding Nekhludoff\'s conversation with the boy contrary to the law.\n\nMaria Pavlovna, the same beautiful woman who had attracted\nNekhludoff\'s attention, rose and with heavy, long strides approached\nhim.\n\n"What is he asking you? Who you are?" she asked, slightly smiling with\nher beautifully curved lips, and confidingly looking at him with her\nprominent, kindly eyes, as though expecting Nekhludoff to know that\nher relations to everybody always have been, are and ought to be\nsimple, affable, and brotherly. "He must know everything," she said,\nand smiled into the face of the boy with such a kindly, charming smile\nthat both the boy and Nekhludoff involuntarily also smiled.\n\n"Yes, he asked me whom I came to see."\n\n"Maria Pavlovna, you know that it is not permitted to speak to\nstrangers," said the inspector.\n\n"All right," she said, and, taking the little hand of the boy into her\nown white hand, she returned to the consumptive\'s mother.\n\n"Whose boy is that?" Nekhludoff asked the inspector.\n\n"He is the son of a political prisoner, and was born in prison."\n\n"Is it possible?"\n\n"Yes, and now he is following his mother to Siberia."\n\n"And that girl?"\n\n"I cannot answer it," said the inspector, shrugging his shoulders.\n"Ah, there is Bogodukhovskaia."\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\n\nThe short-haired, lean, yellow-faced Vera Efremovna, with her large,\nkindly eyes, entered timidly through the rear door.\n\n"Well, I thank you for coming here," she said, pressing Nekhludoff\'s\nhand. "You remember me? Let us sit down."\n\n"I did not expect to find you here."\n\n"Oh, I am doing excellently--so well, indeed, that I desire nothing\nbetter," said Vera Efremovna, looking frightened, as usual, with her\nkindly, round eyes at Nekhludoff, and turning her very thin, sinewy\nneck, which projected from under the crumpled, dirty collar of her\nwaist.\n\nNekhludoff asked her how she came to be in prison. She related her\ncase to him with great animation. Her discourse was interspersed with\nforeign scientific terms about propaganda, disorganization, groups,\nsections and sub-sections, which, she was perfectly certain, everybody\nknew, but of which Nekhludoff had never even heard.\n\nShe was evidently sure that it was both interesting and pleasant to\nhim to know all that she was relating. Nekhludoff, however, looked at\nher pitiful neck, her thin, tangled hair, and wondered why she was\ntelling him all that. He pitied her, but not as he pitied the peasant\nMenshov with his hands and face white as potato sprouts, and\ninnocently languishing in an ill-smelling prison. He pitied her on\naccount of the evident confusion that reigned in her head. She seemed\nto consider herself a heroine, and showed off before him. And this\nmade her particularly pitiful. This trait Nekhludoff noticed in other\npeople then in the room. His arrival attracted their attention, and he\nfelt that they changed their demeanor because of his presence. This\ntrait was also present in the young man in the rubber jacket, in the\nwoman in prison clothes, and even in the actions of the two lovers.\nThe only people who did not possess this trait were the consumptive\nyoung man, the beautiful girl with sheep eyes, and the dark-featured\nman who was talking to the beardless man who resembled a Skopetz.\n\nThe affair of which Vera Efremovna wished to speak to Nekhludoff\nconsisted of the following: A chum of hers, Shustova, who did not even\nbelong to her sub-section, was arrested because in her dwelling were\nfound books and papers which had been left with her for safe keeping.\nVera Efremovna thought that it was partly her fault that Shustova was\nimprisoned, and implored Nekhludoff, who was well connected, to do\neverything in his power to effect her release.\n\nOf herself, she related that, after having graduated as midwife, she\njoined some party. At first everything went on smoothly, but afterward\none of the party was caught, the papers were seized, and then all were\ntaken in a police drag-net.\n\n"They also took me, and now I am going to be transported," she wound\nup her story. "But that is nothing. I feel excellently," and she\nsmiled piteously.\n\nNekhludoff asked her about the girl with the sheep eyes, and Vera\nEfremovna told him that she was the daughter of a general, that she\nhad assumed the guilt of another person, and was now going to serve at\nhard labor in Siberia.\n\n"An altruistic, honest person," said Vera Efremovna.\n\nThe other case of which Vera Efremovna wished to speak concerned\nMaslova. As the history of every prisoner was known to everyone in\nprison, she knew Maslova\'s history, and advised him to procure her\nremoval to the ward for politicals, or, at least, to the hospital,\nwhich was just now crowded, requiring a larger staff of nurses.\n\nNekhludoff said that he could hardly do anything, but promised to make\nan attempt when he reached St. Petersburg.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the inspector, who announced\nthat it was time to depart. Nekhludoff rose, took leave of Vera\nEfremovna, and strode to the door, where he stopped to observe what\nwas taking place before him.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, the time is up," said the inspector as he was\ngoing out. But neither visitors nor prisoners stirred.\n\nThe inspector\'s demand only called forth greater animation, but no one\nthought of departing. Some got up and talked standing; some continued\nto talk sitting; others began to cry and take leave. The young man\ncontinued to crumple the bit of paper, and he made such a good effort\nto remain calm that his face seemed to bear an angry expression. His\nmother, hearing that the visit was over, fell on his shoulder and\nbegan to sob. The girl with the sheep eyes--Nekhludoff involuntarily\nfollowed her movements--stood before the sobbing mother, pouring words\nof consolation into her ear. The old man with the blue eye-glasses\nheld his daughter by the hand and nodded affirmatively to her words.\nThe young lovers rose, holding each other\'s hands and silently looking\ninto each other\'s eyes.\n\n"Those are the only happy people here," said the young man in the\nrubber jacket who stood near Nekhludoff, pointing to the young lovers.\n\nSeeing the glances of Nekhludoff and the young man, the lovers--the\nconvict and the flaxen-haired girl--stretched their clasping hands,\nthrew back their heads, and began to dance in a circle.\n\n"They will be married this evening in the prison, and she will go with\nhim to Siberia," said the young man.\n\n"Who is he, then?"\n\n"He is a penal convict. Although they are making merry, it is very\npainful to listen," added the young man, listening to the sobbing of\nthe old man with the blue eye-glasses.\n\n"Please, please don\'t compel me to take severe measures," said the\ninspector, several times repeating the same thing. "Please, please,"\nhe said, weakly and irresolutely. "Well, now, this cannot go on.\nPlease, now come. For the last time I repeat it," he said, in a sad\nvoice, seating himself and rising again; lighting and then\nextinguishing his cigarette.\n\nFinally the prisoners and visitors began to depart--the former passing\nthrough the inner, the latter through the outer, door. First the man\nin the rubber coat passed out; then the consumptive and the\ndark-featured convict; next Vera Efremovna and Maria Pavlovna, and the\nboy who was born in the prison.\n\nThe visitors also filed out. The old man with the blue eye-glasses\nstarted with a heavy gait, and after him came Nekhludoff.\n\n"What a peculiar state of things!" said the talkative young man to\nNekhludoff on the stairs, as though continuing the interrupted\nconversation. "It is fortunate that the captain is a kind-hearted\nman, and does not enforce the rules. But for him it would be\ntantalizing. As it is, they talk together and relieve their feelings."\n\nWhen Nekhludoff, talking to this man, who gave his name as Medyntzev,\nreached the entrance-hall, the inspector, with weary countenance,\napproached him.\n\n"So, if you wish to see Maslova, then please call to-morrow," he said,\nevidently desiring to be pleasant.\n\n"Very well," said Nekhludoff, and hastened away. As on the former\noccasion, besides pity he was seized with a feeling of doubt and a\nsort of moral nausea.\n\n"What is all that for?" he asked himself, but found no answer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\n\nOn the following day Nekhludoff drove to the lawyer and told him of\nthe Menshovs\' case, asking him to take up their defense. The lawyer\nlistened to him attentively, and said that if the facts were really as\ntold to Nekhludoff, he would undertake their defense without\ncompensation. Nekhludoff also told him of the hundred and thirty men\nkept in prison through some misunderstanding, and asked him whose\nfault he thought it was. The lawyer was silent for a short while,\nevidently desiring to give an accurate answer.\n\n"Whose fault it is? No one\'s," he said decisively. "If you ask the\nprosecutor, he will tell you that it is Maslenikoff\'s fault, and if\nyou ask Maslenikoff, he will tell you that it is the prosecutor\'s\nfault. It is no one\'s fault."\n\n"I will go to Maslenikoff and tell him."\n\n"That is useless," the lawyer retorted, smiling. "He is--he is not\nyour friend or relative, is he? He is such a blockhead, and, saving\nyour presence, at the same time such a sly beast!"\n\nNekhludoff recalled what Maslenikoff had said about the lawyer, made\nno answer, and, taking leave, directed his steps toward Maslenikoff\'s\nresidence.\n\nTwo things Nekhludoff wanted of Maslenikoff. First, to obtain\nMaslova\'s transfer to the hospital, and to help, if possible, the\nhundred and thirty unfortunates. Although it was hard for him to be\ndealing with this man, and especially to ask favors of him, yet it was\nthe only way of gaining his end, and he had to go through it.\n\nAs Nekhludoff approached Maslenikoff\'s house, he saw a number of\ncarriages, cabs and traps standing in front of it, and he recalled\nthat this was the reception day to which he had been invited. While\nNekhludoff was approaching the house a carriage was standing near the\ncurb, opposite the door, and a lackey in a cockaded silk hat and cape,\nwas seating a lady, who, raising the long train of her skirt,\ndisplayed the sharp joints of her toes through the thin slippers.\nAmong the carriages he recognized the covered landau of the\nKorchagins. The gray-haired, rosy-cheeked driver deferentially raised\nhis hat. Nekhludoff had scarcely asked the porter where Michael\nIvanovich (Maslenikoff) was, when the latter appeared on the carpeted\nstairway, escorting a very important guest, such as he usually\nescorted not to the upper landing, but to the vestibule. This very\nimportant military guest, while descending the stairs, was conversing\nin French about a lottery for the benefit of orphan asylums, giving\nhis opinion that it was a good occupation for ladies. "They enjoy\nthemselves while they are raising money."\n\n"Qu\'elles s\'amusent et que le bon Dieu les benisse. Ah, Nekhludoff,\nhow do you do? You haven\'t shown yourself for a long time," he greeted\nNekhludoff. "Allez presenter vos devoirs a madame. The Korchagins are\nhere, too. Toutes les jolies femmes de la ville," he said, holding out\nand somewhat raising his military shoulders for his overcoat, which\nwas being placed on him by his own magnificent lackey in gold-braided\nuniform. "Au revoir, mon cher." Then he shook Maslenikoff\'s hand.\n\n"Well, now let us go upstairs. How glad I am," Maslenikoff began\nexcitedly, seizing Nekhludoff by the arm, and, notwithstanding his\ncorpulence, nimbly leading him up the stairs. Maslenikoff was in a\nparticularly happy mood, which Nekhludoff could not help ascribing to\nthe attention shown him by the important person. Every attention shown\nhim by an important person put him into such an ecstasy as may be\nobserved in a fawning little dog when its master pats it, strokes it,\nand scratches under its ears. It wags its tail, shrinks, wriggles,\nand, straightening its ears, madly runs in a circle. Maslenikoff was\nready to do the same thing. He did not notice the grave expression on\nNekhludoff\'s face, nor hear what he was saying, but irresistibly\ndragged him into the reception-room. Nekhludoff involuntarily\nfollowed.\n\n"Business afterward. I will do anything you wish," said Maslenikoff,\nleading him through the parlor. "Announce Prince Nekhludoff to Her\nExcellency," he said on the way to a lackey. The lackey, in an ambling\ngait, ran ahead of them. "Vous n\'avez qu\'a ordonner. But you must see\nmy wife without fail. She would not forgive my failure to present you\nlast time you were here."\n\nThe lackey had already announced him when they entered, and Anna\nIgnatievna, the vice-governess--Mrs. General, as she called\nherself--sat on a couch surrounded by ladies. As Nekhludoff approached\nshe was already leaning forward with a radiant smile on her face. At\nthe other end of the reception-room women sat around a table, while\nmen in military uniforms and civil attire stood over them. An\nincessant cackle came from that direction.\n\n"Enfin! Why do you estrange yourself? Have we offended you in any\nway?"\n\nWith these words, presupposing an intimacy between her and Nekhludoff,\nwhich never existed, Anna Ignatievna greeted him.\n\n"Are you acquainted? Madam Beliavskaia--Michael Ivanovich Chernoff.\nTake a seat here."\n\n"Missy, venez donc a notre table. On vous opportera votre the. And\nyou," she turned to the officer who was conversing with Missy,\nevidently forgetting his name, "come here, please. Will you have some\ntea, Prince?"\n\n"No, no; I will never agree with you. She simply did not love him,"\nsaid a woman\'s voice.\n\n"But she loved pie."\n\n"Eternally those stupid jests," laughingly interfered another lady in\na high hat and dazzling with gold and diamonds.\n\n"C\'est excellent, these waffles, and so light! Let us have some more."\n\n"Well, how soon are you going to leave us?"\n\n"Yes, this is the last day. That is why we came here."\n\n"Such a beautiful spring! How pleasant it is in the country!"\n\nMissy in her hat and some dark, striped dress which clasped her waist\nwithout a wrinkle, was very pretty. She blushed when she saw\nNekhludoff.\n\n"I thought you had left the city," she said to him.\n\n"Almost. Business keeps me here. I come here also for business."\n\n"Call on mamma. She is very anxious to see you," she said, and,\nfeeling that she was lying, and that he understood it, her face turned\na still deeper purple.\n\n"I shall hardly have the time," gloomily answered Nekhludoff,\npretending not to see that she was blushing.\n\nMissy frowned angrily, shrugged her shoulders, and turned to an\nelegant officer, who took from her hands the empty teacup and\nvaliantly carried it to another table, his sword striking every object\nit encountered.\n\n"You must also contribute toward the asylum."\n\n"I am not refusing, only I wish to keep my contribution for the\nlottery. There I will show all my liberality."\n\n"Don\'t forget, now," a plainly dissimulating laugh was heard.\n\nThe reception day was brilliant, and Anna Ignatievna was delighted.\n\n"Mika told me that you busy yourself in the prisons. I understand it\nvery well," she said to Nekhludoff. "Mika"--she meant her stout\nhusband, Maslenikoff--"may have his faults, but you know that he is\nkind. All these unfortunate prisoners are his children. He does not\nlook on them in any other light. Il est d\'une bonte----"\n\nShe stopped, not finding words to express bonte of a husband, and\nimmediately, smiling, turned to an old, wrinkled woman in\nlilac-colored bows who had just entered.\n\nHaving talked as much and as meaninglessly as it was necessary to\npreserve the decorum, Nekhludoff arose and went over to Maslenikoff.\n\n"Will you please hear me now?"\n\n"Ah! yes. Well, what is it?"\n\n"Come in here."\n\nThey entered a small Japanese cabinet and seated themselves near the\nwindow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\n\n"Well, je suis a vous. Will you smoke a cigarette? But wait; we must\nnot soil the things here," and he brought an ash-holder. "Well?"\n\n"I want two things of you."\n\n"Is that so?"\n\nMaslenikoff\'s face became gloomy and despondent. All traces of that\nanimation of the little dog whom its master had scratched under the\nears entirely disappeared. Voices came from the reception-room. One, a\nwoman\'s voice, said: "Jamais, jamais je ne croirais;" another, a man\'s\nvoice from the other corner, was telling something, constantly\nrepeating: "La Comtesse Vorouzoff" and "Victor Apraksine." From the\nthird side only a humming noise mingled with laughter was heard.\nMaslenikoff listened to the voices; so did Nekhludoff.\n\n"I want to talk to you again about that woman."\n\n"Yes; who was innocently condemned. I know, I know."\n\n"I would like her to be transferred to the hospital. I was told that\nit can be done."\n\nMaslenikoff pursed up his lips and began to meditate.\n\n"It can hardly be done," he said. "However, I will consult about it,\nand will wire you to-morrow."\n\n"I was told that there are many sick people in the hospital, and they\nneed assistants."\n\n"Well, yes. But I will let you know, as I said."\n\n"Please do," said Nekhludoff.\n\nThere was a burst of general and even natural laughter in the\nreception-room.\n\n"That is caused by Victor," said Maslenikoff, smiling. "He is\nremarkably witty when in high spirits."\n\n"Another thing," said Nekhludoff. "There are a hundred and thirty men\nlanguishing in prison for the only reason that their passports were\nnot renewed in time. They have been in prison now for a month."\n\nAnd he related the causes that kept them there.\n\n"How did you come to know it?" asked Nekhludoff, and his face showed\ndisquietude and displeasure.\n\n"I was visiting a prisoner, and these people surrounded me and\nasked----"\n\n"What prisoner were you visiting?"\n\n"The peasant who is innocently accused, and for whom I have obtained\ncounsel. But that is not to the point. Is it possible that these\ninnocent people are kept in prison only because they failed to renew\ntheir passports?"\n\n"That is the prosecutor\'s business," interrupted Maslenikoff, somewhat\nvexed. "Now, you say that trials must be speedy and just. It is the\nduty of the assistant prosecutor to visit the prisons and see that no\none is innocently kept there. But these assistants do nothing but play\ncards."\n\n"So you can do nothing for them?" Nekhludoff asked gloomily, recalling\nthe words of the lawyer, that the governor would shift the\nresponsibility.\n\n"I will see to it. I will make inquiries immediately."\n\n"So much the worse for her. C\'est un souffre-douleur," came from the\nreception-room, the voice of a woman apparently entirely indifferent\nto what she was saying.\n\n"So much the better; I will take this," from the other side was heard\na man\'s playful voice, and the merry laughter of a woman who refused\nhim something.\n\n"No, no, for no consideration," said a woman\'s voice.\n\n"Well, then, I will do everything," repeated Maslenikoff,\nextinguishing the cigarette with his white hand, on which was a\nturquoise ring. "Now, let us go to the ladies."\n\n"And yet another question," said Nekhludoff, without going into the\nreception-room, and stopping at the door. "I was told that some people\nin the prison were subjected to corporal punishment. Is it true?"\n\nMaslenikoff\'s face flushed.\n\n"Ah! you have reference to that affair? No, mon cher, you must\npositively not be admitted there--you want to know everything. Come,\ncome; Annette is calling us," he said, seizing Nekhludoff\'s arm with\nthe same excitement he evinced after the attention shown him by the\nimportant person, but this time alarming, and not joyful.\n\nNekhludoff tore himself loose, and, without bowing or saying\nanything, gloomily passed through the reception-room, the parlor and\nby the lackeys, who sprang to their feet in the ante-chamber, to the\nstreet.\n\n"What is the matter with him? What did you do to him?" Annette asked\nher husband.\n\n"That is a la francaise," said some one.\n\n"Rather a la zoulon."\n\n"Oh, he has always been queer."\n\nSome one arose, some one arrived, and the chirping continued.\n\nThe following morning Nekhludoff received from Maslenikoff a letter on\nheavy, glossy paper, bearing a coat-of-arms and seals, written in a\nfine, firm hand, in which he said that he had written to the prison\nphysician asking that Maslova be transferred, and that he hoped his\nrequest would be acceded to. It was signed, "Your loving senior\ncomrade," followed by a remarkably skillful flourish.\n\n"Fool!" Nekhludoff could not help exclaiming, especially because he\nfelt that by the word "comrade" Maslenikoff was condescending, i. e.,\nalthough he considered himself a very important personage, he\nnevertheless was not too proud of his greatness, and called himself\nhis comrade.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\n\nOne of the most popular superstitions consists in the belief that\nevery man is endowed with definite qualities--that some men are kind,\nsome wicked; some wise, some foolish; some energetic, some apathetic,\netc. This is not true. We may say of a man that he is oftener kind\nthan wicked; oftener wise than foolish; oftener energetic than\napathetic, and vice versa. But it would not be true to say of one man\nthat he is always kind or wise, and of another that he is always\nwicked or foolish. And yet we thus divide people. This is erroneous.\nMen are like rivers--the water in all of them, and at every point, is\nthe same, but every one of them is now narrow, now swift, now wide,\nnow calm, now clear, now cold, now muddy, now warm. So it is with\nmen. Every man bears within him the germs of all human qualities,\nsometimes manifesting one quality, sometimes another; and often does\nnot resemble himself at all, manifesting no change. With some people\nthese changes are particularly sharp. And to this class Nekhludoff\nbelonged. These changes in him had both physical and spiritual causes;\nand one of these changes he was now undergoing.\n\nThat feeling of solemnity and joy of rejuvenation which he had\nexperienced after the trial and after his first meeting with Katiousha\nhad passed away, and, after the last meeting, fear and even disgust\ntoward her had taken its place. He was also conscious that his duty\nwas burdensome to him. He had decided not to leave her, to carry out\nhis intention of marrying her, if she so desired; but this was painful\nand tormenting to him.\n\nOn the day following his visit to Maslenikoff he again went to the\nprison to see her.\n\nThe inspector permitted him to see her; not in the office, however,\nnor in the lawyer\'s room, but in the women\'s visiting-room.\nNotwithstanding his kind-heartedness, the inspector was more reserved\nthan formerly. Evidently Nekhludoff\'s conversations with Maslenikoff\nhad resulted in instructions being given to be more careful with this\nvisitor.\n\n"You may see her," he said, "only please remember what I told you as\nto giving her money. And as to her transfer to the hospital, about\nwhich His Excellency has written, there is no objection to it, and the\nphysician also consented. But she herself does not wish it. \'I don\'t\ncare to be chambermaid to that scurvy lot,\' she said. That is the kind\nof people they are, Prince," he added.\n\nNekhludoff made no answer and asked to be admitted to her. The\ninspector sent the warden, and Nekhludoff followed him into the empty\nvisiting-room.\n\nMaslova was already there, quietly and timidly emerging from behind\nthe grating. She approached close to Nekhludoff, and, looking past\nhim, quietly said:\n\n"Forgive me, Dmitri Ivanovich; I have spoken improperly the other\nday."\n\n"It is not for me to forgive you----" Nekhludoff began.\n\n"But you must leave me," she added, and in the fearfully squinting\neyes with which she glanced at him Nekhludoff again saw a strained and\nspiteful expression.\n\n[Illustration: EASTER SERVICES.]\n\n"But why should I leave you?"\n\n"So."\n\n"Why so?"\n\nShe again looked at him with that spiteful glance, as it seemed to\nhim.\n\n"Well, then, I will tell you," she said. "You leave me--I tell you\nthat truly. I cannot. You must drop that entirely," she said, with\nquivering lips, and became silent. "That is true. I would rather hang\nmyself."\n\nNekhludoff felt that in this answer lurked a hatred for him, an\nunforgiven wrong, but also something else--something good and\nimportant. This reiteration of her refusal in a perfectly calm state\ndestroyed in Nekhludoff\'s soul all his doubts, and brought him back to\nhis former grave, solemn and benign state of mind.\n\n"Katiousha, I repeat what I said," he said, with particular gravity.\n"I ask you to marry me. If, however, you do not wish to, and so long\nas you do not wish to, I will be wherever you will be, and follow you\nwherever you may be sent."\n\n"That is your business. I will speak no more," she said, and again her\nlips quivered.\n\nHe was also silent, feeling that he had no strength to speak.\n\n"I am now going to the country, and from there to St. Petersburg," he\nsaid finally. "I will press your--our case, and with God\'s help the\nsentence will be set aside."\n\n"I don\'t care if they don\'t. I deserved it, if not for that, for\nsomething else," she said, and he saw what great effort she had to\nmake to repress her tears.\n\n"Well, have you seen Menshova?" she asked suddenly, in order to hide\nher agitation. "They are innocent, are they not?"\n\n"Yes, I think so."\n\n"Such a wonderful little woman!" she said.\n\nHe related everything he had learned from Menshova, and asked her if\nshe needed anything. She said she needed nothing.\n\nThey were silent again.\n\n"Well, and as to the hospital," she said suddenly, casting on him her\nsquinting glance, "if you wish me to go, I will go; and I will stop\nwine drinking, too."\n\nNekhludoff silently looked in her eyes. They were smiling.\n\n"That is very good," was all he could say.\n\n"Yes, yes; she is an entirely different person," thought Nekhludoff,\nfor the first time experiencing, after his former doubts, the to him\nentirely new feeling of confidence in the invincibility of love.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReturning to her ill-smelling cell, Maslova removed her coat and sat\ndown on her cot, her hands resting on her knees. In the cell were only\nthe consumptive with her babe, the old woman, Menshova, and the\nwatch-woman with her two children. The deacon\'s daughter had been\nremoved to the hospital; the others were washing. The old woman lay on\nthe cot sleeping; the children were in the corridor, the door to which\nwas open. The consumptive with the child in her arms and the\nwatch-woman, who did not cease knitting a stocking with her nimble\nfingers, approached Maslova.\n\n"Well, have you seen him?" they asked.\n\nMaslova dangled her feet, which did not reach the floor, and made no\nanswer.\n\n"What are you whimpering about?" said the watch-woman. "Above all,\nkeep up your spirits. Oh, Katiousha! Well?" she said, rapidly moving\nher fingers.\n\nMaslova made no answer.\n\n"The women went washing. They say that to-day\'s alms were larger. Many\nthings have been brought, they say," said the consumptive.\n\n"Finashka!" shouted the watch-woman. "Where are you, you little\nrogue?" She drew out one of the knitting needles, stuck it into the\nball of thread and stocking, and went out into the corridor.\n\nAt this moment the inmates of the cell, with bare feet in their prison\nshoes, entered, each bearing a loaf of twisted bread, some even two.\nTheodosia immediately approached Maslova.\n\n"Why, anything wrong?" she asked, lovingly, looking with her bright,\nblue eyes at Maslova. "And here is something for our tea," and she\nplaced the leaves on the shelf.\n\n"Well, has he changed his mind about marrying you?" asked Korableva.\n\n"No, he has not, but I do not wish to," answered Maslova, "and I told\nhim so."\n\n"What a fool!" said Korableva, in her basso voice.\n\n"What is the good of marrying if they cannot live together?" asked\nTheodosia.\n\n"Is not your husband going with you?" answered the watch-woman.\n\n"We are legally married," said Theodosia. "But why should he marry her\nlegally if he cannot live with her?"\n\n"What a fool! Why, if he marries her he will make her rich!"\n\n"He said: \'Wherever you may be, I will be with you,\'" said Maslova.\n\n"He may go if he likes; he needn\'t if he don\'t. I will not ask him. He\nis now going to St. Petersburg to try to get me out. All the ministers\nthere are his relatives," she continued, "but I don\'t care for them."\n\n"Sure enough," Korableva suddenly assented, reaching down into her\nbag, and evidently thinking of something else. "What do you say--shall\nwe have some wine?"\n\n"Not I," answered Maslova. "Drink yourselves."\n\n\n\n\nPART SECOND.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nThe Senate could hear the case in two weeks, and by that time\nNekhludoff intended to be in St. Petersburg, and, in case of an\nadverse decision, to petition the Emperor, as the lawyer had advised.\nIn case the appeal failed, for which, his lawyer had told him, he must\nbe prepared, as the grounds of appeal were very weak, the party of\nconvicts to which Maslova belonged would be transported in May. It was\ntherefore necessary, in order to be prepared to follow Maslova to\nSiberia, upon which Nekhludoff was firmly resolved, to go to the\nvillages and arrange his affairs there.\n\nFirst of all, he went to the Kusminskoie estate, the nearest, largest\nblack-earth estate, which brought the greatest income. He had lived on\nthe estate in his childhood and youth, and had also twice visited it\nin his manhood, once when, upon the request of his mother, he brought\na German manager with whom he went over the affairs of the estate. So\nthat he knew its condition and the relations the peasants sustained\ntoward the office, i. e., the landowner. Their relations toward the\noffice were such that they have always been in absolute dependence\nupon it. Nekhludoff had already known it when as a student he\nprofessed and preached the doctrines of Henry George, and in carrying\nout which he had distributed his father\'s estate among the peasants.\nTrue, after his military career, when he was spending twenty thousand\nrubles a year, those doctrines ceased to be necessary to the life he\nwas leading, were forgotten, and not only did he not ask himself where\nthe money came from, but tried not to think of it. But the death of\nhis mother, the inheritance, and the necessity of taking care of his\nproperty, i. e., his lands, again raised the question in his mind of\nhis relation to private ownership of land. A month before Nekhludoff\nwould have argued that he was powerless to change the existing order\nof things; that he was not managing the estate, and living and\nreceiving his income far away from the estate, would feel more or less\nat ease. But now he resolved that, although there was before him a\ntrip to Siberia and complex and difficult relations to the prison\nworld, for which social standing, and especially money, were\nnecessary, he could not, nevertheless, leave his affairs in their\nformer condition, but must, to his own detriment, change them. For\nthis purpose he had decided not to work the land himself, but, by\nrenting it at a low price to the peasants, to make it possible for\nthem to live independent of the landlord. Often, while comparing the\nposition of the landlord with that of the owner of serfs, Nekhludoff\nfound a parallel in the renting of the land to the peasants, instead\nof working it by hired labor, to what the slave-owners did when they\nsubstituted tenancy for serfdom. That did not solve the question, but\nit was a step toward its solution; it was a transition from a grosser\nto a less gross form of ownership of man. He also intended to act\nthus.\n\nNekhludoff arrived at Kusminskoie about noon. In everything\nsimplifying his life, he did not wire from the station of his arrival,\nbut hired a two-horse country coach. The driver was a young fellow in\na nankeen regulation coat, belted below the waist, sitting sidewise on\nthe box. He was the more willing to carry on a conversation because\nthe broken-down, lame, emaciated, foaming shaft-horse could then walk,\nwhich these horses always preferred.\n\nThe driver spoke about the manager of the Kusminskoie estate, not\nknowing that he was carrying its master, Nekhludoff purposely\nrefrained from enlightening him.\n\n"A dandy German," he said, turning half around, cracking his long whip\nnow over the heads, now under the horses. "There is nothing here to\ncompare with his fine team of three bay horses. You ought to see him\ndriving out with his wife! I took some guests to his house last\nChristmas--he had a fine tree. You couldn\'t find the like of it in the\nwhole district! He robbed everybody, right and left. But what does he\ncare? He is bossing everybody. They say he bought a fine estate."\n\nNekhludoff thought that he was indifferent to the manner of the\nGerman\'s management, and to the way he was profiting by it. But the\nstory of the driver with the long waist was unpleasant to him. He was\nenchanted with the fine weather; the darkening clouds, sometimes\nobscuring the sun; the fields over which the larks soared; the woods,\njust covering up the top and bottom with green; the meadows on which\nthe flocks and horses browsed, and the fields on which plowmen were\nalready seen--but a feeling of dissatisfaction crept over him. And\nwhen he asked himself the reason for it, he recalled the driver\'s\naccount of the German\'s management.\n\nBut by the time he was busying himself with the affairs of Kusminskoie\nhe had forgotten it.\n\nAfter an examination of the books and his conversation with the clerk,\nwho artlessly set forth the advantages of the peasants having small\nholdings and the fact that they were hemmed in by the master\'s land,\nNekhludoff grew only more determined to put an end to his ownership,\nand give the land to the peasants. From the books and his\nconversations with the clerk he learned that, as before, two-thirds of\nthe best arable land was cultivated by his own men, and the rest by\npeasants who were paid five rubles per acre--that is to say, for five\nrubles the peasant undertook to plow, harrow and sow an acre of land\nthree times, then mow it, bind or press it, and carry it to the barn.\nIn other words, he was paid five rubles for what hired, cheap labor\nwould cost at least ten rubles. Again, the prices paid by the peasants\nto the office for necessaries were enormous. They worked for meadow,\nfor wood, for potatoe seed, and they were almost all in debt to the\noffice. Thus, the rent charged the peasants for lands beyond the\nfields was four times as great as it could bring on a five per cent.\nbasis.\n\nNekhludoff knew all that before, but he was now learning it as\nsomething new, and only wondered why he and all those who stood in a\nsimilar position could fail to see the enormity of such relations. The\narguments of the clerk that not one-fourth of the value of the stock\ncould be realized on a sale, that the peasants would permit the land\nto run to waste, only strengthened his determination and confirmed\nhim in his belief that he was doing a good deed by giving the land to\nthe peasants, and depriving himself of the greater part of his income.\nDesiring to dispose of the land forthwith, he asked the manager to\ncall together the peasants of the three villages surrounded by his\nlands the very next day, for the purpose of declaring to them his\nintention and agreeing with them as to the price.\n\nWith a joyful consciousness of his firmness, in spite of the arguments\nof the manager, and his readiness to make sacrifices for the peasants,\nNekhludoff left the office, and, reflecting on the coming arrangement,\nhe strolled around the house, through the flower-garden, which lay\nopposite the manager\'s house, and was neglected this year; over the\nlawn-tennis ground, overgrown with chicory, and through the alleys\nlined with lindens, where it had been his wont to smoke his cigar, and\nwhere, three years before, the pretty visitor, Kirimova, flirted with\nhim. Having made an outline of a speech, which he was to deliver to\nthe peasants the following day, Nekhludoff went to the manager\'s\nhouse, and after further deliberating upon the proper disposition of\nthe stock, he calmly and contentedly retired to a room prepared for\nhim in the large building.\n\nIn this clean room, the walls of which were covered with views of\nVenice, and with a mirror hung between two windows, there was placed a\nclean spring bedstead and a small table with water and matches. On a\nlarge table near the mirror lay his open traveling-bag with toilet\narticles and books which he brought with him; one Russian book on\ncriminology, one in German, and a third in English treating of the\nsame subject. He intended to read them in spare moments while\ntraveling through the villages, but as he looked on them now he felt\nthat his mind was far from these subjects. Something entirely\ndifferent occupied him.\n\nIn one corner of the room there stood an ancient arm-chair with\nincrustations, and the sight of this chair standing in his mother\'s\nbed-room suddenly raised in his soul an unexpected feeling. He\nsuddenly felt sorry for the house that would decay, the gardens which\nwould be neglected, the woods which would be cut down, and all the\ncattle-houses, courts, stables, sheds, machinery, horses, cows which\nhad been accumulated with such effort, although not by him. At first\nit seemed to him easy to abandon all that, but now he was loth to part\nwith it, as well as the land and one-half of the income which would be\nso useful now. And immediately serviceable arguments come to his aid,\nby which it appeared that it was not wise to give the land to the\npeasants and destroy his estate.\n\n"I have no right to own the land. And if I do not own the land, I\ncannot keep the property intact. Besides, I will now go to Siberia,\nand for that reason I need neither the house nor the estate,"\nwhispered one voice. "All that is true," whispered another voice, "but\nyou will not pass all your life in Siberia. If you should marry, you\nmay have children. And you must hand over the estate to them in the\nsame condition in which you found it. There are duties toward the\nland. It is easy to give away the land, to destroy everything; but it\nis very hard to accumulate it. Above all, you must mark out a plan of\nyour life, and dispose of your property accordingly. And, then, are\nyou acting as you do in order to satisfy conscientious scruples, or\nfor the praise you expect of people?" Nekhludoff asked himself, and\ncould not help acknowledging that the talk that it would occasion\ninfluenced his decision. And the more he thought the more questions\nraised themselves, and the more perplexing they appeared. To rid\nhimself of these thoughts he lay down on the fresh-made bed, intending\nto go over them again the next day with a clearer mind. But he could\nnot fall asleep for a long time. Along with the fresh air, through the\nopen window, came the croaking of frogs, interrupted by the whistling\nof nightingales, one of which was in a lilac bush under the window.\nListening to the nightingales and the frogs, Nekhludoff recalled the\nmusic of the inspector\'s daughter; and, thinking of that music, he\nrecalled Maslova--how, like the croaking of a frog, her lips trembled\nwhen she said, "You must drop that." Then the German manager descended\nto the frogs. He should have been held back, but not only did he come\ndown, but he was transformed into Maslova and started to taunt him: "I\nam a convict, and you are a Prince." "No, I shall not yield," thought\nNekhludoff, and came to. "Am I acting properly or improperly?" he\nasked himself. "I don\'t know; I will know to-morrow." And he began to\ndescend to where the manager and Maslova were. And there everything\nended.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nWith a feeling of timidity and shame Nekhludoff the following morning,\nwalked out to meet the peasants who had gathered at a small square in\nfront of the house. As he approached them the peasants removed their\ncaps, and for a long time Nekhludoff could not say anything. Although\nhe was going to do something for the peasants which they never dared\neven to think of, his conscience was troubled. The peasants stood in a\nfine, drizzling rain, waiting to hear what their master had to say,\nand Nekhludoff was so confused that he could not open his mouth. The\ncalm, self-confident German came to his relief. This strong, overfed\nman, like Nekhludoff himself, made a striking contrast to the\nemaciated, wrinkled faces of the peasants, and the bare shoulder-bones\nsticking out from under their caftans.\n\n"The Prince came to befriend you--to give you the land, but you are\nnot worthy of it," said the German.\n\n"Why not worthy, Vasily Karlych? Have we not labored for you? We are\nmuch satisfied with our late mistress--may she enjoy eternal\nlife!--and we are grateful to the young Prince for thinking of us,"\nbegan a red-haired peasant with a gift of gab.\n\n"We are not complaining of our masters," said a broad-faced peasant\nwith a long beard. "Only we are too crowded here."\n\n"That is what I called you here for--to give you the land, if you wish\nit," said Nekhludoff.\n\nThe peasants were silent, as if misunderstanding him, or incredulous.\n\n"In what sense do you mean to give us the land?" asked a middle-aged\npeasant in a caftan.\n\n"To rent it to you, that you might use it at a low price."\n\n"That is the loveliest thing," said an old man.\n\n"If the payment is not above our means," said another.\n\n"Of course we will take the land."\n\n"It is our business--we get our sustenance from the land."\n\n"So much the better for you. All you have to do is to take the money.\nAnd what sins you will spare yourself----"\n\n"The sin is on you," said the German. "If you would only work and keep\nthings in order----"\n\n"We cannot, Vasily Karlych," said a lean old man with a pointed nose.\n"You ask, Who let the horse feed in the field? But who did it? Day in\nand day out--and every day is as long as a year--I worked with the\nscythe, and as I fell asleep the horse went among the oats. And now\nyou are fleecing me."\n\n"You should keep order."\n\n"It is easy for you to say keep order. But we have no strength,"\nretorted a middle-aged peasant, all covered with hair.\n\n"I told you to fence it in."\n\n"You give us the timber," said an unsightly little peasant. "When I\ncut a joist last summer, intending to make a fence, you locked me up\nfor three months in the castle to feed the insects. There was a fence\nfor you!"\n\n"Is that true?" asked Nekhludoff of the manager.\n\n"Der erste dich im dorfe," said the manager in German. "He was caught\nevery year in the woods. You must learn to respect other people\'s\nproperty."\n\n"Do we not respect you?" said an old man. "We cannot help respecting\nyou, because you have us in your hands, and you are twisting us into\nrope."\n\n"If you would only abstain from doing wrong," said the manager. "It is\npretty hard to wrong you."\n\n"And who battered my face last summer? Of course, there is no use\ngoing to law with a rich man."\n\n"You only keep within bounds of the law."\n\nThis was evidently a wordy tourney of which the participants hardly\nknew the purpose. Nekhludoff tried to get back to business.\n\n"Well, what do you say? Do you wish the land, and what price do you\nset on it?"\n\n"It is your goods; you name the price."\n\nNekhludoff set the price, and though much lower than the prevailing\nprice, the peasants began to bargain, finding it high. He expected\nthat his offer would be accepted with pleasure, but there was no sign\nof satisfaction. Only when the question was raised whether the whole\ncommunity would take the land, or have individual arrangements did he\nknow that it was profitable for them. For there resulted fierce\nquarrels between those who wished to exclude the weak ones and bad\npayers from participating in the land, and those whom it was sought to\nexclude. But the German finally arranged the price and time of\npayment, and the peasants, noisily talking, returned to the village.\n\nThe price was about thirty per cent. lower than the one prevailing in\nthe district, and Nekhludoff\'s income was reduced to almost one-half,\nbut, with money realized from the sale of the timber and yet to be\nrealized from the sale of the stock, it was amply sufficient for him.\nEverything seemed to be satisfactory, and yet Nekhludoff felt sad and\nlonesome, but, above all, his conscience troubled him. He saw that\nalthough the peasants spoke words of thanks, they were not satisfied\nand expected something more. The result was that while he deprived\nhimself of much, he failed to do that which the peasants expected.\n\nOn the following day, after the contract was signed, Nekhludoff, with\nan unpleasant feeling of having left something undone, seated himself\nin the "dandy" three-horse team and took leave of the peasants, who\nwere shaking their heads in doubt and dissatisfaction. Nekhludoff was\ndissatisfied with himself--he could not tell why, but he felt sad, and\nwas ashamed of something.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nFrom Kusminskoie Nekhludoff went to Panovo, the estate left him by his\naunts, and where he had first seen Katiousha. He intended to dispose\nof this land in the same manner as he disposed of the other, and also\ndesired to learn all there was known about Katiousha, and to find out\nif it was true that their child had died.\n\nAs he sat at the window observing the familiar scenery of the now\nsomewhat neglected estate, he not only recalled, but felt himself as\nhe was fourteen years ago; fresh, pure and filled with the hope of\nendless possibilities. But as it happens in a dream, he knew that that\nwas gone, and he became very sad.\n\nBefore breakfast he made his way to the hut of Matrena Kharina,\nKatiousha\'s aunt, who was selling liquor surreptitiously, for\ninformation about the child, but all he could learn from her was that\nthe child had died on the way to a Moskow asylum; in proof of which\nthe midwife had brought a certificate.\n\nOn his way back he entered the huts of some peasants, and inquired\nabout their mode of living. The same complaints of the paucity of\nland, hunger and degradation he heard everywhere. He saw the same\npinched faces, threadbare homespuns, bare feet and bent shoulders.\n\nIn front of a particularly dilapidated hut stood a number of women\nwith children in their arms, and among them he noticed a lean,\npale-faced woman, easily holding a bloodless child in a short garment\nmade of pieces of stuff. This child was incessantly smiling.\nNekhludoff knew that it was the smile of suffering. He asked who that\nwoman was.\n\nIt transpired that the woman\'s husband had been in prison for the past\nsix months--"feeding the insects"--as they termed it, for cutting down\ntwo lindens.\n\nNekhludoff turned to the woman, Anisia.\n\n"How do you fare?" he asked. "What do you live on?"\n\n"How do I live? I sometimes get some food," and she began to sob.\n\nThe grave face of the child, however, spread into a broad smile, and\nits thin legs began to wriggle.\n\nNekhludoff produced his pocketbook and gave the woman ten rubles. He\nhad scarcely made ten steps when he was overtaken by another woman\nwith a child; then an old woman, and again another woman. They all\nspoke of their poverty and implored his help. Nekhludoff distributed\nthe sixty rubles that were in his pocketbook and returned home, i. e.,\nto the wing inhabited by the clerk. The clerk, smiling, met Nekhludoff\nwith the information that the peasants would gather in the evening,\nas he had ordered. Nekhludoff thanked him and strolled about the\ngarden, meditating on what he had seen. "The people are dying in large\nnumbers, and are used to it; they have acquired modes of living\nnatural to a people who are becoming extinct--the death of children,\nexhausting toil for women, insufficiency of food for all, especially\nfor the aged--all comes and is received naturally. They were reduced\nto this condition gradually, so that they cannot see the horror of it,\nand bear it uncomplainingly. Afterward, we, too, come to consider this\ncondition natural; that it ought to be so."\n\nAll this was so clear to him now that he could not cease wondering how\nit was that people could not see it; that he himself could not see\nthat which is so patent. It was perfectly clear that children and old\npeople were dying for want of milk, and they had no milk because they\nhad not land enough to feed the cattle and also raise bread and hay.\nAnd he devised a scheme by which he was to give the land to the\npeople, and they were to pay an annual rent which was to go to the\ncommunity, to be used for common utilities and taxes. This was not the\nsingle-tax, but it was the nearest approach to it under present\nconditions. The important part consisted in that he renounced his\nright to own land.\n\nWhen he returned to the house, the clerk, with a particularly happy\nsmile on his face, offered him dinner, expressing his fear that it\nmight spoil.\n\nThe table was covered with a gloomy cloth, an embroidered towel\nserving as a napkin, and on the table, in vieux-saxe, stood a\nsoup-bowl with a broken handle, filled with potato soup and containing\nthe same rooster that he had seen carried into the house on his\narrival. After the soup came the same rooster, fried with feathers,\nand cakes made of cheese-curds, bountifully covered with butter and\nsugar. Although the taste of it all was poor, Nekhludoff kept on\neating, being absorbed in the thoughts which relieved him of the\nsadness that oppressed him on his return from the village.\n\nAfter dinner Nekhludoff with difficulty seated the superserviceable\nclerk, and in order to make sure of himself and at the same time to\nconfide to some one the thoughts uppermost in his mind, told him of\nhis project and asked his opinion. The clerk smiled, as though he had\nbeen thinking of the same thing, and was very glad to hear it, but in\nreality did not understand it, not because Nekhludoff did not express\nhimself plainly enough, but because, according to this project,\nNekhludoff deprived himself of advantages for the benefit of others,\nwhereas the truth that every man strives to obtain advantages at the\nexpense of others, was so firmly rooted in the clerk\'s mind, that he\nthought that he misunderstood Nekhludoff when the latter said that the\nentire income of the land was to go into the community\'s treasury.\n\n"I understand. So you will draw the interest on the capital?" he said,\nbecoming radiant.\n\n"No, no. I transfer the land to them entirely."\n\n"In that case you will get no income?" asked the clerk and he ceased\nto smile.\n\n"I relinquish that."\n\nThe clerk sighed deeply, then began to smile again. Now he understood.\nHe understood that Nekhludoff\'s mind was not entirely sound, and he\nimmediately tried to find a way of profiting by Nekhludoff\'s project,\nand endeavored to so construe it that he might turn it to his own\nadvantage.\n\nWhen, however, he understood that there was no such opportunity, he\nceased to take interest in the projects, and continued to smile only\nto please his master. Seeing that the clerk could not understand him,\nNekhludoff dismissed him from his presence, seated himself at the\nink-stained table and proceeded to commit his project to paper.\n\nThe sun was already descending behind the unfolding lindens, and the\nmosquitos filled the room, stinging him. While he was finishing his\nnotes, Nekhludoff heard the lowing of cattle in the village, the\ncreaking of the opening gates and the voices of the peasants who were\ncoming to meet their master. Nekhludoff told the clerk not to call\nthem before the office, that he would go and meet them at any place in\nthe village, and gulping down a glass of tea offered him by the clerk,\nhe went to the village.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nThe crowd stood talking in front of the house of the bailiff, and as\nNekhludoff approached, the conversation ceased and the peasants, like\nthose of Kusminskoie, removed their caps. It was a coarser crowd than\nthe peasants of Kusminskoie, and almost all the peasants wore bast\nshoes and homespun shirts and caftans. Some of them were bare-footed\nand only in their shirts.\n\nWith some effort Nekhludoff began his speech by declaring that he\nintended to surrender the land to them. The peasants were silent, and\nthere was no change in the expression of their faces.\n\n"Because I consider," said Nekhludoff, blushing, "that every man ought\nto have the right to use the land."\n\n"Why, certainly." "That is quite right," voices of peasants were\nheard.\n\nNekhludoff continued, saying that the income from the land should be\ndistributed among all, and he therefore proposed that they take the\nland and pay into the common treasury such rent as they may decide\nupon, such money to be used for their own benefit. Exclamations of\nconsent and approbation continued to be heard, but the faces of the\npeasants became more and more grave, and the eyes that at first were\nfixed on the master were lowered, as if desiring not to shame him with\nthe fact that his cunning was understood by all, and that he could not\nfool anybody.\n\nNekhludoff spoke very clearly, and the peasants were sensible folks;\nbut he was not understood, and could not be understood by them for the\nsame reason which prevented the clerk from understanding him for a\nlong time. They were convinced that it was natural for every man to\nlook out for his own interest. And as to the land owners, the\nexperience of several generations had taught them long ago that these\nwere always serving their own interests.\n\n"Well, what rate do you intend to assess," asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"Why assess? We cannot do that? The land is yours; it is for you to\nsay," some in the crowd said.\n\n"But understand that you are to use the money for the common wants."\n\n"We cannot do it. The community is one thing, and this is another\nthing."\n\n"You must understand," said the smiling clerk, wishing to explain the\noffer, "that the Prince is giving you the land for money which is to\ngo into the community\'s treasury."\n\n"We understand it very well," said a toothless old man without raising\nhis eyes. "Something like a bank, only we must pay in time. We cannot\ndo it; it is hard enough as it is. That will ruin us entirely."\n\n"That is to no purpose. We would rather continue as before," said\nseveral dissatisfied and even rough voices.\n\nThe resistance was particularly hot when Nekhludoff mentioned that he\nwould draw a contract which he himself and they would have to sign.\n\n"What is the good of a contract? We will keep on working as we did\nbefore. We don\'t care for it. We are ignorant people."\n\n"We cannot consent, because that is an uncustomary thing. Let it be as\nit was before. If you would only do away with the seed," several\nvoices were heard.\n\n"Doing away with the seed" meant that under the present regime the\nsowing-seed was chargeable to the peasants, and they asked that it be\nfurnished by the master.\n\n"So you refuse to take the land?" asked Nekhludoff, turning to a\nmiddle-aged, bare-footed peasant in tattered caftan and with a radiant\nface who held his cap straight in front of him, like a soldier hearing\n"Hats off!"\n\n"Yes, sir," said this peasant.\n\n"Then you have enough land?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"No, sir," said the ex-soldier, with artificial cheerfulness, holding\nhis torn cap before him, as though offering it to anyone deserving to\ntake it.\n\n"Think it over at your leisure," said the surprised Nekhludoff, again\nrepeating his offer.\n\n"There is nothing to think over; as we said, so it will be," the\ntoothless, gloomy old man said angrily.\n\n"I will stay here all day to-morrow. If you alter your decision, let\nme know."\n\nThe peasants made no answer.\n\nOn their return to the office the clerk explained to Nekhludoff that\nit was not a want of good sense that prevented their acceptance of the\noffer; that when gathered in assembly they always acted in that\nstubborn manner.\n\nNekhludoff then asked him to summon for the following day several of\nthe most intelligent peasants to whom he would explain his project at\ngreater length.\n\nImmediately after the departure of the smiling clerk, Nekhludoff heard\nangry women\'s voices interrupted by the voice of the clerk. He\nlistened.\n\n"I have no more strength. You want the cross on my breast," said an\nexasperated voice.\n\n"She only ran in," said another voice. "Give her up, I say. Why do you\ntorture the beast, and keep the milk from the children?"\n\nNekhludoff walked around the house where he saw two disheveled women,\none of whom was evidently pregnant, standing near the staircase. On\nthe stairs, with his hands in the pockets of his crash overcoat, stood\nthe clerk. Seeing their master, the women became silent and began to\narrange their \'kerchiefs, which had fallen from their heads, while the\nclerk took his hands out of his pockets and began to smile.\n\nThe clerk explained that the peasants purposely permitted their\ncalves, and even cows, to roam over the master\'s meadows. That two\ncows belonging to these women had been caught on the meadow and driven\ninto an inclosure. The clerk demanded from the women thirty copecks\nper cow, or two days\' work.\n\n"Time and again I told them," said the smiling clerk, looking around\nat Nekhludoff, as if calling him to witness, "to look out for cows\nwhen driving them to feed."\n\n"I just went to see to the child, and they walked away."\n\n"Don\'t leave them when you undertake to look after them."\n\n"And who would feed my child?"\n\n"If they had only grazed, at least, they would have no pains in their\nstomachs. But they only walked in."\n\n"All the meadows are spoiled," the clerk turned to Nekhludoff. "If\nthey are not made to pay there will be no hay left."\n\n"Don\'t be sinning," cried the pregnant woman. "My cow was never\ncaught."\n\n"But now that she was caught, pay for her, or work."\n\n"Well, then, I will work. But return me the cow; don\'t torture her,"\nshe cried angrily. "It is bad enough as it is; I get no rest, either\nday or night. Mother-in-law is sick; my husband is drunk.\nSingle-handed I have to do all the work, and I have no strength. May\nyou choke yourself!" she shouted and began to weep.\n\nNekhludoff asked the clerk to release the cows and returned to the\nhouse, wondering why people do not see what is so plain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nWhether it was because there were fewer peasants present, or because\nhe was not occupied with himself, but with the matter in hand,\nNekhludoff felt no agitation when the seven peasants chosen from the\nvillagers responded to the summons.\n\nHe first of all expressed his views on private ownership of land.\n\n"As I look upon it," he said, "land ought not to be the subject of\npurchase and sale, for if land can be sold, then those who have money\nwill buy it all in and charge the landless what they please for the\nuse of it. People will then be compelled to pay for the right to stand\non the earth," he added, quoting Spencer\'s argument.\n\n"There remains to put on wings and fly," said an old man with smiling\neyes and gray beard.\n\n"That\'s so," said a long-nosed peasant in a deep basso.\n\n"Yes, sir," said the ex-soldier.\n\n"The old woman took some grass for the cow. They caught her, and to\njail she went," said a good-natured, lame peasant.\n\n"There is land for five miles around, but the rent is higher than the\nland can produce," said the toothless, angry old man.\n\n"I am of the same opinion as you," said Nekhludoff, "and that is the\nreason I want to give you the land."\n\n"Well, that would be a kind deed," said a broad-shouldered old peasant\nwith a curly, grayish beard like that of Michael Angelo\'s Moses,\nevidently thinking that Nekhludoff intended to rent out the land.\n\n"That is why I came here. I do not wish to own the land any longer,\nbut it is necessary to consider how to dispose of it."\n\n"You give it to the peasants--that\'s all," said the toothless, angry\npeasant.\n\nFor a moment Nekhludoff was confused, seeing in these words doubt of\nthe sincerity of his purpose. But he shook it off, and took advantage\nof the remark to say what he intended.\n\n"I would be only too glad to give it," he said, "but to whom and how\nshall I give it? Why should I give it to your community rather than to\nthe Deminsky community?" Deminsky was a neighboring village with very\nlittle land.\n\nThey were all silent. Only the ex-soldier said, "Yes, sir."\n\n"And now tell me how would you distribute the land?"\n\n"How? We would give each an equal share," said an oven-builder,\nrapidly raising and lowering his eyebrows.\n\n"How else? Of course divide it equally," said a good-natured, lame\npeasant, whose feet, instead of socks, were wound in a white strip of\nlinen.\n\nThis decision was acquiesced in by all as being satisfactory.\n\n"But how?" asked Nekhludoff, "are the domestics also to receive equal\nshares?"\n\n"No, sir," said the ex-soldier, assuming a cheerful mood. But the\nsober-minded tall peasant disagreed with him.\n\n"If it is to be divided, everybody is to get an equal share," after\nconsidering awhile, he said in a deep basso.\n\n"That is impossible," said Nekhludoff, who was already prepared with\nhis objection. "If everyone was to get an equal share, then those who\ndo not themselves work would sell their shares to the rich. Thus the\nland would again get into the hands of the rich. Again, the people\nthat worked their own shares would multiply, and the landlords would\nagain get the landless into their power."\n\n"Yes, sir," the ex-soldier hastily assented.\n\n"The selling of land should be prohibited; only those that cultivate\nit themselves should be allowed to own it," said the oven-builder,\nangrily interrupting the soldier.\n\nTo this Nekhludoff answered that it would be difficult to determine\nwhether one cultivated the land for himself or for others.\n\nThen the sober-minded old man suggested that the land should be given\nto them as an association, and that only those that took part in\ncultivating it should get their share.\n\nNekhludoff was ready with arguments against this communistic scheme,\nand he retorted that in such case it would be necessary that all\nshould have plows, that each should have the same number of horses,\nand that none should lag behind, or that everything should belong to\nsociety, for which the consent of every one was necessary.\n\n"Our people will never agree," said the angry old man.\n\n"There will be incessant fighting among them," said the white-bearded\npeasant with the shining eyes. "The women will scratch each other\'s\neyes out."\n\n"The next important question is," said Nekhludoff, "how to divide the\nland according to quality. You cannot give black soil to some and clay\nand sand to others."\n\n"Let each have a part of both," said the oven-builder.\n\nTo this Nekhludoff answered that it was not a question of dividing the\nland in one community, but of the division of land generally among all\nthe communities. If the land is to be given gratis to the peasants,\nthen why should some get good land, and others poor land? There would\nbe a rush for the good land.\n\n"Yes, sir," said the ex-soldier.\n\nThe others were silent.\n\n"You see, it is not as simple as it appears at first sight," said\nNekhludoff. "We are not the only ones, there are other people thinking\nof the same thing. And now, there is an American, named George, who\ndevised the following scheme, and I agree with him."\n\n"What is that to you? You are the master; you distribute the land,\nand there is an end to it," said the angry peasant.\n\nThis interruption somewhat confused Nekhludoff, but he was glad to see\nthat others were also dissatisfied with this interruption.\n\n"Hold on, Uncle Semen; let him finish," said the old man in an\nimpressive basso.\n\nThis encouraged Nekhludoff, and he proceeded to explain the single-tax\ntheory of Henry George.\n\n"The land belongs to no one--it belongs to the Creator."\n\n"That\'s so!"\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"The land belongs to all in common. Every one has an equal right to\nit. But there is good land, and there is poor land. And the question\nis, how to divide the land equally. The answer to this is, that those\nwho own the better land should pay to those who own the poorer the\nvalue of the better land. But as it is difficult to determine how much\nanyone should pay, and to whom, and as society needs money for common\nutilities, let every land owner pay to society the full value of his\nland--less, if it is poorer; more, if it is better. And those who do\nnot wish to own land will have their taxes paid by the land owners."\n\n"That\'s correct," said the oven-builder. "Let the owner of the better\nland pay more."\n\n"What a head that Jhorga had on him!" said the portly old peasant with\nthe curls.\n\n"If only the payments were reasonable," said the tall peasant,\nevidently understanding what it was leading to.\n\n"The payments should be such that it would be neither too cheap nor\ntoo dear. If too dear, it would be unprofitable; if too cheap, people\nwould begin to deal in land. This is the arrangement I would like you\nto make."\n\nVoices of approval showed that the peasants understood him perfectly.\n\n"What a head!" repeated the broad-shouldered peasant with the curls,\nmeaning "Jhorga."\n\n"And what if I should choose to take land?" said the clerk, smiling.\n\n"If there is an unoccupied section, take and cultivate it," said\nNekhludoff.\n\n"What do you want land for? You are not hungering without land," said\nthe old man with the smiling eyes.\n\nHere the conference ended.\n\nNekhludoff repeated his offer, telling the peasants to consult the\nwish of the community, before giving their answer.\n\nThe peasants said that they would do so, took leave of Nekhludoff and\ndeparted in a state of excitement. For a long time their loud voices\nwere heard, and finally died away about midnight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe peasants did not work the following day, but discussed their\nmaster\'s proposition. The community was divided into two factions. One\ndeclared the proposition profitable and safe; the other saw in the\nproposition a plot which it feared the more because it could not\nunderstand it. On the third day, however, the proposition was\naccepted, the fears of the peasants having been allayed by an old\nwoman who explained the master\'s action by the suggestion that he\nbegan to think of saving his soul. This explanation was confirmed by\nthe large amount of money Nekhludoff had distributed while he remained\nin Panov. These money gifts were called forth by the fact that here,\nfor the first time, he learned to what poverty the peasants had been\nreduced and though he knew that it was unwise, he could not help\ndistributing such money as he had, which was considerable.\n\nAs soon as it became known that the master was distributing money,\nlarge crowds of people from the entire surrounding country came to him\nasking to be helped. He had no means of determining the respective\nneeds of the individuals, and yet he could not help giving these\nevidently poor people money. Again, to distribute money\nindiscriminately was absurd. His only way out of the difficulty was to\ndepart, which he hastened to do.\n\nOn the third day of his visit to Panov, Nekhludoff, while looking over\nthe things in the house, in one of the drawers of his aunt\'s\nchiffonnier, found a picture representing a group of Sophia Ivanovna,\nCatherine Ivanovna, himself, as student, and Katiousha--neat, fresh,\nbeautiful and full of life. Of all the things in the house Nekhludoff\nremoved this picture and the letters. The rest he sold to the miller\nfor a tenth part of its value.\n\nRecalling now the feeling of pity over the loss of his property which\nhe had experienced in Kusminskoie, Nekhludoff wondered how he could\nhave done so. Now he experienced the gladness of release and the\nfeeling of novelty akin to that experienced by an explorer who\ndiscovers new lands.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nIt was evening when Nekhludoff arrived in the city, and as he drove\nthrough the gas-lit streets to his house, it looked to him like a new\ncity. The odor of camphor still hung in the air through all the rooms,\nand Agrippina, Petrovna and Kornei seemed tired out and dissatisfied,\nand even quarreled about the packing of the things, the use of which\nseemed to consist chiefly in being hung out, dried and packed away\nagain. His room was not occupied, but was not arranged for his coming,\nand the trunks blocked all the passages, so that his coming interfered\nwith those affairs which, by some strange inertia, were taking place\nin this house. This evident foolishness, to which he had once been a\nparty, seemed so unpleasant to Nekhludoff, after the impressions he\nhad gained of the want in the villages, that he decided to move to a\nhotel the very next day, leaving the packing to Agrippina until the\narrival of his sister.\n\nHe left the house in the morning, hired two modest and not over-clean\nfurnished rooms near the prison, and went to his lawyer.\n\nAfter the storms and rains came those cold, piercing winds that\nusually occur in the fall. Protected only by a light overcoat,\nNekhludoff was chilled to the bone. He walked quickly in order to warm\nhimself.\n\nThe village scenes came to his mind--the women, children and old men,\nwhose poverty and exhaustion he had noticed as if for the first time,\nespecially that oldish child which twisted its little calfless\nlegs--and he involuntarily compared them with the city folks. Passing\nby the butcher, fish and clothing shops, he was struck, as if it was\nthe first time he looked upon them--by the physical evidences of the\nwell-being of such a large number of clean, well-fed shopkeepers which\nwas not to be seen anywhere in the villages. Equally well fed were the\ndrivers in quilted coats and buttons on their backs, porters, servant\ngirls, etc. In all these people he now involuntarily saw those same\nvillage folks whom privation had driven to the city. Some of them were\nable to take advantage of the conditions in the city and became happy\nproprietors themselves; others were reduced to even greater straits\nand became even more wretched. Such wretchedness Nekhludoff saw in a\nnumber of shoemakers that he saw working near the window of a\nbasement; in the lean, pale, disheveled washerwomen ironing with bare\nhands before open windows from which soap-laden steam poured out; in\ntwo painters, aproned and bare-footed, who were covered with paint\nfrom temple to heel. In their sunburnt, sinewy, weak hands, bared\nabove the elbows, they carried a bucket of paint and incessantly\ncursed each other. Their faces were wearied and angry. The same\nexpression of weariness and anger he saw in the dusty faces of the\ntruck drivers; on the swollen and tattered men, women and children who\nstood begging on the street corners. Similar faces were seen in the\nwindows of the tea-houses which Nekhludoff passed. Around the dirty\ntables, loaded with bottles and tea services, perspiring men with red,\nstupefied faces sat shouting and singing, and white-aproned servants\nflitted to and fro.\n\n"Why have they all gathered here?" thought Nekhludoff, involuntarily\ninhaling, together with the dust, the odor of rancid oil spread by the\nfresh paint.\n\nOn one of the streets he suddenly heard his name called above the\nrattling of the trucks. It was Shenbok, with curled and stiffened\nmustache and radiant face. Nekhludoff had lost sight of him long ago,\nbut heard that on leaving his regiment and joining the cavalry,\nnotwithstanding his debts he managed to hold his own in rich society.\n\n"I am glad I met you. There is not a soul in the city. How old you\nhave grown, my boy! I only recognized you by your walk. Well, shall\nwe have dinner together? Where can we get a good meal here?"\n\n"I hardly think I will have the time," answered Nekhludoff, who wished\nto get rid of his friend without offending him. "What brings you\nhere?" he asked.\n\n"Business, my boy. Guardianship affairs. I am a guardian, you know. I\nhave charge of Samanoff\'s business--the rich Samanoff, you know. He is\na spendthrift, and there are fifty-four thousand acres of land!" he\nsaid with particular pride, as if he had himself made all these acres.\n"The affairs were fearfully neglected. The land was rented to the\npeasants, who did not pay anything and were eighty thousand rubles in\narrears. In one year I changed everything, and realized seventy per\ncent. more for the estate. Eh?" he asked, with pride.\n\nNekhludoff recalled a rumor that for the very reason that Shenbok\nsquandered his own wealth and was inextricably in debt, he was\nappointed guardian over a rich old spendthrift, and was now evidently\nobtaining an income from the guardianship.\n\nNekhludoff refused to take dinner with Shenbok, or accompany him to\nthe horse races, to which the latter invited him, and after an\nexchange of commonplaces the two parted.\n\n"Is it possible that I was like him?" thought Nekhludoff. "Not\nexactly, but I sought to be like him, and thought that I would thus\npass my life."\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lawyer received him immediately on his arrival, although it was\nnot his turn. The lawyer expressed himself strongly on the detention\nof the Menshovs, declaring that there was not a particle of evidence\nagainst them on record.\n\n"If the case is tried here, and not in the district, I will stake\nanything on their discharge. And the petition in behalf of Theodosia\nBrinkova is ready. You had better take it with you to St. Petersburg\nand present it there. Otherwise there will begin an inquiry which will\nhave no end. Try to reach some people who have influence with the\ncommission on petitions. Well, that\'s all, isn\'t it?"\n\n"No. Here they write me----"\n\n"You seem to be the funnel into which all the prison complaints are\npoured. I fear you will not hold them all."\n\n"But this case is simply shocking," said Nekhludoff, and related the\nsubstance of it.\n\n"What is it that surprises you?"\n\n"Everything. I can understand the orderly who acted under orders, but\nthe assistant prosecutor who drew the indictment is an educated man----"\n\n"That is the mistake. We are used to think that the prosecuting\nofficers--the court officers generally--are a kind of new, liberal\nmen. And so they were at one time, but not now. The only thing that\nconcerns these officers is to draw their salaries on the 20th of every\nmonth. Their principles begin and end with their desire to get more.\nThey will arrest, try and convict anybody----. I am always telling these\ncourt officers that I never look upon them without gratitude,"\ncontinued the lawyer, "because it is due to their kindness that I, you\nand all of us are not in jail. To deprive any one of us of all civil\nrights and send him to Siberia is the easiest thing imaginable."\n\n"But if everything depends on the pleasure of the prosecutor, who can\nenforce the law or not, then what is the use of the courts?"\n\nThe lawyer laughed merrily.\n\n"That is the question you are raising. Well, my dear sir, that is\nphilosophy. However, we can discuss that. Come to my house next\nSaturday. You will find there scholars, litterateurs, artists. We will\nhave a talk on social questions," said the lawyer, pronouncing the\nwords "social questions" with ironical pathos. "Are you acquainted\nwith my wife? Call on Saturday."\n\n"I will try," answered Nekhludoff, feeling that he was saying an\nuntruth; that if there was anything he would try hard to do it was not\nto be present at the lawyer\'s amid the scholars, litterateurs and\nartists.\n\nThe laughter with which the lawyer met Nekhludoff\'s remark concerning\nthe uselessness of courts if the prosecutors can do what they please,\nand the intonation with which he pronounced the words "philosophy" and\n"social questions," showed how utterly unlike himself were the lawyer\nand the people of his circle, both in character and in views of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\nIt was late and the distance to the prison was long, so Nekhludoff\nhired a trap. On one of the streets the driver, who was a middle-aged\nman with an intelligent and good-natured face, turned to Nekhludoff\nand pointed to an immense building going up.\n\n"What a huge building there is going up!" he said with pride, as if he\nhad a part in the building of it.\n\nIt was really a huge structure, built in a complex, unusual style. A\nscaffolding of heavy pine logs surrounded the structure, which was\nfenced in by deal boards. It was as busy a scene as an ant hill.\n\nNekhludoff wondered that these people, while their wives were killing\nthemselves with work at home, and their children starving, should\nthink it necessary to build that foolish and unnecessary house for\nsome foolish and unnecessary man.\n\n"Yes, a foolish building," he spoke his thought aloud.\n\n"How foolish?" retorted the offended driver. "Thanks to them, the\npeople get work. It is not foolish."\n\n"But the work is unnecessary."\n\n"It must be necessary if they are building it," said the driver. "It\ngives the people food."\n\nNekhludoff became silent, the more so because it was too noisy to be\nheard. When they had reached the macadamized road near the prison the\ndriver again turned to Nekhludoff.\n\n"And what a lot of people are coming to the city--awful," he said,\nturning around on the box and pointing to a party of laborers with\nsaws, axes, coats and sacks thrown over their shoulders, and coming\nfrom the opposite direction.\n\n"More than in former years?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"No comparison. The masters are kicking them about like shavings. The\nmarket places are glutted with them."\n\n"What is the reason?"\n\n"They have multiplied. They have no homes."\n\n"And what if they have multiplied! Why do they not remain in the\nvillages?"\n\n"There is nothing to do there. There is no land."\n\nNekhludoff experienced that which happens with a sore place--it is\nstruck oftener than any other part of the body. But it only seems so\nbecause it is more noticeable.\n\n"Can it be possible that it is everywhere the same?" he thought, and\nasked the driver how much land there was in his village; how much he\nhimself owned, and why he lived in the city.\n\n"There is but an acre to every person. We are renting three acres.\nThere is my father and brother. Another brother is in the army. They\nare managing it. But there is really nothing to manage, and my brother\nintended to go to Moskow."\n\n"Is there no land for rent?"\n\n"Where could one get land nowadays? The masters\' children have\nsquandered theirs. The merchants have it all in their hands. One\ncannot rent it from them; they cultivate it themselves. Our lands are\nheld by a Frenchman who bought them of the former landlord. He won\'t\nrent any of it, and that is all."\n\n"What Frenchman?"\n\n"Dufar, the Frenchman--you may have heard. He is making wigs for the\nactors. He is now our master, and does what he pleases with us. He is\na good man himself, but his wife is Russian--and what a cur! She is\nrobbing the people--simply awful! But here is the prison. Shall I\ndrive up to the front? I think they don\'t admit through the front."\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nWith a faint heart and with horror at the thought that he might find\nMaslova in an inebriate condition and persistently antagonistic, and\nat the mystery which she was to him, Nekhludoff rang the bell and\ninquired of the inspector about Maslova. She was in the hospital.\n\nA young physician, impregnated with carbolic acid, came out into the\ncorridor and sternly asked Nekhludoff what he wanted. The physician\nindulged the prisoners\' shortcomings and often relaxed the rules in\ntheir favor, for which he often ran afoul of the prison officials and\neven the head physician. Fearing that Nekhludoff might ask something\nnot permitted by the rules, and, moreover, desiring to show that he\nmade no exceptions in favor of anybody, he feigned anger.\n\n"There are no women here; this is the children\'s ward," he said.\n\n"I know it, but there is a nurse here who had been transferred from\nthe prison."\n\n"Yes, there are two. What do you wish, then?"\n\n"I am closely related to one of them, Maslova," said Nekhludoff, "and\nwould like to see her. I am going to St. Petersburg to enter an appeal\nin her case. I would like to hand her this; it is only a photograph,"\nand he produced an envelope from his pocket.\n\n"Yes, you may do that," said the softened physician, and turning to an\nold nurse in a white apron, told her to call Maslova. "Won\'t you take\na seat, or come into the reception-room?"\n\n"Thank you," said Nekhludoff, and taking advantage of the favorable\nchange in the physician\'s demeanor, asked him what they thought of\nMaslova in the hospital.\n\n"Her work is fair, considering the conditions amid which she had\nlived," answered the physician. "But there she comes."\n\nThe old nurse appeared at one of the doors, and behind her came\nMaslova. She wore a white apron over a striped skirt; a white cap on\nher head hid her hair. Seeing Nekhludoff she flushed, stopped\nwaveringly, then frowned, and with downcast eyes approached him with\nquick step. Coming near him she stood for a moment without offering\nher hand, then she did offer her hand and became even more flushed.\nNekhludoff had not seen her since the conversation in which she\nexcused herself for her impetuosity, and he expected to find her in a\nsimilar mood. But she was entirely different to-day; there was\nsomething new in the expression of her face; something timid and\nreserved, and, as it seemed to him, malevolent toward him. He repeated\nthe words he had said to the physician and handed her the envelope\nwith the photograph which he had brought from Panov.\n\n"It is an old picture which I came across in Panov. It may please you\nto have it. Take it."\n\nRaising her black eyebrows she looked at him with her squinting eyes,\nas though asking, "What is that for?" Then she silently took the\nenvelope and tucked it under her apron.\n\n"I saw your aunt there," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Did you?" she said, with indifference.\n\n"How do you fare here?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"Fairly well," she said.\n\n"It is not very hard?"\n\n"Not very. I am not used to it yet."\n\n"I am very glad. At any rate, it is better than there."\n\n"Than where?" she said, and her face became purple.\n\n"There, in the prison," Nekhludoff hastened to say.\n\n"Why better?" she asked.\n\n"I think the people here are better. There are no such people here as\nthere."\n\n"There are many good people there."\n\n"I did what I could for the Menshovs and hope they will be freed,"\nsaid Nekhludoff.\n\n"May God grant it. Such a wonderful little woman," she said, repeating\nher description of the old woman, and slightly smiled.\n\n"I am going to-day to St. Petersburg. Your case will be heard soon,\nand, I hope, will be reversed."\n\n"It is all the same now, whether they reverse it or not," she said.\n\n"Why now?"\n\n"So," she answered, and stealthily glanced at him inquiringly.\n\nNekhludoff understood this answer and this glance as a desire on her\npart to know if he were still holding to his decision, or had changed\nit since her refusal.\n\n"I don\'t know why it is all the same to you," he said, "but to me it\nreally is all the same whether you are acquitted or not. In either\ncase, I am ready to do what I said," he said, with determination.\n\nShe raised her head, and her black, squinting eyes fixed themselves on\nhis face and past it, and her whole face became radiant with joy. But\nher words were in an entirely different strain.\n\n"Oh, you needn\'t talk that way," she said.\n\n"I say it that you may know."\n\n"Everything has been already said, and there is no use talking any\nmore," she said, with difficulty repressing a smile.\n\nThere was some noise in the ward. A child was heard crying.\n\n"I think I am called," she said, looking around with anxiety.\n\n"Well, then, good-by," he said.\n\nShe pretended not to see his extended hand, turned round, and\nendeavoring to hide her elation, she walked away with quick step.\n\n"What is taking place in her? What is she thinking? What are her\nfeelings? Is she putting me to a test, or is she really unable to\nforgive me? Can she not say what she thinks and feels, or simply will\nnot? Is she pacified or angered?" Nekhludoff asked himself, but could\ngive no answer. One thing he knew, however, and that was that she had\nchanged; that a spiritual transformation was taking place in her, and\nthis transformation united him not only to her, but to Him in whose\nname it was taking place. And this union caused him joyful agitation.\n\nReturning to the ward where eight children lay in their beds, Maslova\nbegan to remake one of the beds, by order of the Sister, and, leaning\nover too far with the sheet, slipped and nearly fell. The convalescing\nboy, wound in bandages to his neck, began to laugh. Maslova could\nrestrain herself no longer, and seating herself on the bedstead she\nburst into loud laughter, infecting several children, who also began\nto laugh. The Sister angrily shouted:\n\n"What are you roaring about? Think you this is like the place you came\nfrom? Go fetch the rations."\n\nMaslova stopped laughing, and taking a dish went on her errand, but\nexchanging looks with the bandaged boy, who giggled again.\n\nSeveral times during the day, when Maslova remained alone, she drew\nout a corner of the picture and looked at it with admiration, but in\nthe evening, when she and another nurse retired for the night, she\nremoved the picture from the envelope and immovably looked with\nadmiration at the faces; her own, his and the aunt\'s, their dresses,\nthe stairs of the balcony, the bushes in the background, her eyes\nfeasting especially on herself, her young, beautiful face with the\nhair hanging over her forehead. She was so absorbed that she failed to\nnotice that the other nurse had entered.\n\n"What is that? Did he give it you?" asked the stout, good-natured\nnurse, leaning over the photograph.\n\n"Is it possible that that is you?"\n\n"Who else?" Maslova said, smiling and looking into her companion\'s\nface.\n\n"And who is that? He himself? And that is his mother?"\n\n"His aunt. Couldn\'t you recognize me?" asked Maslova.\n\n"Why, no. I could never recognize you. The face is entirely different.\nThat must have been taken about ten years ago."\n\n"Not years, but a lifetime," said Maslova, and suddenly her face\nbecame sullen and a wrinkle formed between her eyebrows.\n\n"Yours was an easy life, wasn\'t it?"\n\n"Yes, easy," Maslova repeated, closing her eyes and shaking her head.\n"Worse than penal servitude."\n\n"Why so?"\n\n"Because. From eight in the evening to four in the morning--every day\nthe same."\n\n"Then why don\'t they get out?"\n\n"They like to, but cannot. But what is the use of talking!" cried\nMaslova, and she sprang to her feet, threw the photograph into the\ndrawer of the table, and suppressing her angry tears, ran into the\ncorridor, slamming the door. Looking on the photograph she imagined\nherself as she had been at the time the photograph was made, and\ndreamed how happy she had been and might still be with him. The words\nof her companion reminded her what she was now--reminded her of all\nthe horror of that life which she then felt but confusedly, and would\nnot allow herself to admit. Only now she vividly recalled all those\nterrible nights, particularly one Shrovetide night. She recalled how\nshe, in a low-cut, wine-bespattered, red silk dress, with a red bow in\nher dishevelled hair, weak, jaded and tipsy, after dancing attendance\nupon the guest, had seated herself, at two in the morning, near the\nthin, bony, pimpled girl-pianist and complained of her hard life. The\ngirl said that her life was also disagreeable to her, and that she\nwished to change her occupation. Afterward their friend Clara joined\nthem, and all three suddenly decided to change their life. They were\nabout to leave the place when the drunken guests became noisy, the\nfiddler struck up a lively song of the first figure of a Russian\nquadrille, the pianist began to thump in unison, a little drunken man\nin a white necktie and dress coat caught her up. Another man, stout\nand bearded, and also in a dress coat, seized Clara, and for a long\ntime they whirled, danced, shouted and drank. Thus a year passed, a\nsecond and a third. How could she help changing! And the cause of it\nall was he. And suddenly her former wrath against him rose in her; and\nshe felt like chiding and reproving him. She was sorry that she had\nmissed the opportunity of telling him again that she knew him, and\nwould not yield to him; that she would not allow him to take advantage\nof her spiritually as he had done corporeally; that she would not\nallow him to make her the subject of his magnanimity. And in order to\ndeaden the painful feeling of pity for herself and the useless\nreprobation of him, she yearned for wine. And she would have broken\nher word and drunk some wine had she been in the prison. But here wine\ncould only be obtained from the assistant surgeon, and she was afraid\nof him, because he pursued her with his attentions, and all relations\nwith men were disgusting to her. For some time she sat on a bench in\nthe corridor, and returning to her closet, without heeding her\ncompanion\'s questions, she wept for a long time over her ruined life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nNekhludoff had four cases in hand: Maslova\'s appeal, the petition of\nTheodosia Birukova, the case of Shustova\'s release, by request of Vera\nBogodukhovskaia, and the obtaining of permission for a mother to visit\nher son kept in a fortress, also by Bogodukhovskaia\'s request.\n\nSince his visit to Maslenikoff, especially since his trip to the\ncountry, Nekhludoff felt an aversion for that sphere in which he had\nbeen living heretofore, and in which the sufferings borne by millions\nof people in order to secure the comforts and pleasures of a few, were\nso carefully concealed that the people of that sphere did not and\ncould not see these sufferings, and consequently the cruelty and\ncriminality of their own lives.\n\nNekhludoff could no longer keep up relations with these people without\nreproving himself. And yet the habits of his past life, the ties of\nfriendship and kinship, and especially his one great aim of helping\nMaslova and the other unfortunates, drew him into that sphere against\nhis will; and he was compelled to ask the aid and services of people\nwhom he had not only ceased to respect but who called forth his\nindignation and contempt.\n\nArriving at St. Petersburg, and stopping at his aunt\'s, the wife of an\nex-Minister of State, he found himself in the very heart of the\naristocratic circle. It was unpleasant to him, but he could do no\ndifferent. Not to stop at his aunt\'s was to offend her. Besides,\nthrough her connections she could be of great service to him in those\naffairs for the sake of which he came to St. Petersburg.\n\n"What wonders I hear about you!" said Countess Catherine Ivanovna\nCharskaia, while Nekhludoff was drinking the coffee brought him\nimmediately after his arrival. "Vous posez pour un Howard. You are\nhelping the convicts; making the rounds of the prisons; reforming\nthem."\n\n"You are mistaken; I never had such intentions."\n\n"Why, that is not bad. Only, I understand, there is some love\naffair--come, tell me."\n\nNekhludoff related the story of Maslova, exactly as it happened.\n\n"Yes, yes, I remember. Poor Hellen told me at the time you lived at\nthe old maids\' house that, I believe, they wished you to marry their\nward." Countess Catherine Ivanovna always hated Nekhludoff\'s aunts on\nhis father\'s side. "So, that is she? Elle est encore jolie?"\n\nAunt Catherine Ivanovna was a sixty-year-old, healthy, jolly,\nenergetic, talkative woman. She was tall, very stout, with a black,\ndowny mustache on her upper lip. Nekhludoff loved her, and since\nchildhood had been accustomed to get infected with her energy and\ncheerfulness.\n\n"No, ma tante, all that belongs to the past. I only wish to help her,\nbecause she is innocent, and it is my fault that she was condemned,\nher whole wrecked life is upon my conscience. I feel it to be my duty\nto do for her what I can."\n\n"But how is it? I was told that you wish to marry her."\n\n"I do wish it, it is true; but she doesn\'t."\n\nCatherine Ivanovna raised her eyebrows and silently looked at\nNekhludoff in surprise. Suddenly her face changed and assumed a\npleased expression.\n\n"Well, she is wiser than you are. Ah! what a fool you are! And you\nwould marry her?"\n\n"Certainly."\n\n"After what she has been?"\n\n"The more so--is it not all my fault?"\n\n"Well, you are simply a crank," said the aunt, suppressing a smile.\n"You are an awful crank, but I love you for the very reason that you\nare such an awful crank," she repeated, the word evidently well\ndescribing, according to her view, the mental and moral condition of\nher nephew. "And how opportune. You know, Aline has organized a\nwonderful asylum for Magdalens. I visited it once. How disgusting they\nare! I afterward washed myself from head to foot. But Aline is corps\net ame in this affair. So we will send her, your Magdalen, to her. If\nany one will reform her, it is Aline."\n\n"But she was sentenced to penal servitude. I came here for the\nexpress purpose of obtaining a reversal of her sentence. That is my\nfirst business to you."\n\n"Is that so? Where is the case now?"\n\n"In the Senate."\n\n"In the Senate? Why, my dear cousin Levoushka is in the Senate.\nHowever, he is in the Heraldry Department. Let me see. No, of the real\nones I do not know any. Heaven knows what a mixture they are: either\nGermans, such as Ge, Fe, De--tout l\'alphabet--or all sorts of Ivanvas,\nSemenovs, Nikitins, or Ivaneukos, Semeneukos, Nikitenkas pour varier.\nDes gens de l\'autre monde. However, I will tell my husband. He knows\nall sorts of people. I will tell him. You explain it to him, for he\nnever understands me. No matter what I may say, he always says that he\ncannot understand me. C\'est un parti pris. Everybody understands, only\nhe does not understand."\n\nAt that moment a servant in knee-breeches entered with a letter on a\nsilver tray.\n\n"Ah, that is from Aline. Now you will have an opportunity to hear\nKisiweather."\n\n"Who is that Kisiweather?"\n\n"Kisiweather? Come around to-day and you will find out who he is. He\nspeaks so that the most hardened criminals fall on their knees and\nweep, and repent."\n\nCountess Catherine Ivanovna, however strange it might be, and how so\nlittle it agreed with her character, was a follower of that teaching\nwhich held that essence of Christianity consisted in a belief in\nredemption. She visited the meetings where sermons were delivered on\nthis teaching then in vogue, and invited the adherents to her own\nhouse. Although this teaching rejected all rites, images and even the\nsacraments, the Princess had images hanging in all her rooms, even\nover her bedstead, and she complied with all the ritual requirements\nof the church, seeing nothing contradictory in that.\n\n"Your Magdalen ought to hear him; she would become converted," said\nthe Countess. "Don\'t fail to come to-night. You will hear him then. He\nis a remarkable man."\n\n"It is not interesting to me, ma tante."\n\n"I tell you it is interesting. You must come to-night. Now, what else\ndo you want me to do? Videz votre sac."\n\n"There is the man in the fortress."\n\n"In the fortress? Well, I can give you a note to Baron Kriegmuth.\nC\'est un tres-brave homme. But you know him yourself. He was your\nfather\'s comrade. Il donne dans le spiritisme. But that is nothing. He\nis a kind man. What do you want there?"\n\n"It is necessary to obtain permission for a mother to visit her son\nwho is incarcerated there. But I was told that Cherviansky and not\nKriegmuth is the person to be applied to."\n\n"I do not like Cherviansky, but he is Mariette\'s husband. I will ask\nher; she will do it for me. Elle est tres gentille."\n\n"There is another woman I wish you would speak to her about. She has\nbeen in prison for several months, and no one knows for what."\n\n"Oh, no; she herself surely knows for what. They know very well. And\nit serves them right, those short-haired ones."\n\n"I do not know whether it serves them right or not. But they are\nsuffering. You are a Christian, and believe in the Gospel, and yet are\nso pitiless."\n\n"That has nothing to do with it. The Gospel is one thing; what I\ndislike is another thing. It would be worse if I pretended to like the\nNihilists, especially the female Nihilists, when as a matter of fact I\nhate them."\n\n"Why do you hate them?"\n\n"Why do they meddle in other people\'s affairs? It is not a woman\'s\nbusiness."\n\n"But you have nothing against Mariette occupying herself with\nbusiness," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Mariette? Mariette is Mariette, but who is she? A conceited ignoramus\nwho wants to teach everybody."\n\n"They do not wish to teach; they only wish to help the people."\n\n"We know without them who should and who should not be helped."\n\n"But the people are impoverished. I have just been in the country. Is\nit proper that peasants should overwork themselves without getting\nenough to eat, while we are living in such wasteful luxury?"\n\n"What do you wish me to do? You would like to see me work and not eat\nanything?"\n\n"No, I do not wish you not to eat," smiling involuntarily, answered\nNekhludoff. "I only wish that we should all work, and all have enough\nto eat."\n\nThe aunt again raised her eyebrows and gazed at him with curiosity.\n\n"Mon cher, vous finirez mal," she said.\n\nAt that moment a tall, broad-shouldered general entered the room. It\nwas Countess Charskaia\'s husband, a retired Minister of State.\n\n"Ah, Dmitri, how do you do?" he said, putting out his clean-shaven\ncheek. "When did you get here?"\n\nHe silently kissed his wife on the forehead.\n\n"Non, il est impayable." Countess Catherine Ivanovna turned to her\nhusband. "He wants me to do washing on the river and feast on\npotatoes. He is an awful fool, but, nevertheless, do for him what he\nasks. An awful crank," she corrected herself. "By the way, they say\nthat Kamenskaia is in a desperate condition; her life is despaired\nof," she turned to her husband. "You ought to visit her."\n\n"Yes, it is awful," said the husband.\n\n"Go, now, and have a talk together; I must write some letters."\n\nNekhludoff had just reached the room next to the reception-room when\nshe shouted after him:\n\n"Shall I write then to Mariette?"\n\n"If you please, ma tante."\n\n"I will learn that which you want to say about the short-haired en\nblanc, and she will have her husband attend to it. Don\'t think that I\nam angry. They are hateful, your protegees, but--je ne leur veux pas\nde mal. But God forgive them. Now, go, and don\'t forget to come in the\nevening; you will hear Kisiweather. We will also pray. And if you do\nnot resist, ca vous fera beaucoup de bien. I know that Hellen and all\nof you are very backward in that respect. Now, au revoir."\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nThe man in whose power it was to lighten the condition of the\nprisoners in St. Petersburg had earned a great number of medals,\nwhich, except for a white cross in his button-hole, he did not wear,\nhowever. The old general was of the German barons, and, as it was said\nof him, had become childish. He had served in the Caucasus, where he\nhad received this cross; then in Poland and in some other place, and\nnow he held the office which gave him good quarters, maintenance and\nhonor. He always strictly carried out the orders of his superiors, and\nconsidered their execution of great importance and significance, so\nmuch so that while everything in the world could be changed, these\norders, according to him, were above the possibility of any\nalteration.\n\nAs Nekhludoff was approaching the old general\'s house the tower clock\nstruck two. The general was at the time sitting with a young artist in\nthe darkened reception-room, at a table, the top of which was of\ninlaid work, both of them turning a saucer on a sheet of paper.\nHolding each others fingers over the saucer, placed face downward,\nthey pulled in different directions over the paper on which were\nprinted all the letters of the alphabet. The saucer was answering the\ngeneral\'s question. How would souls recognize each other after death?\n\nAt the moment one of the servants entered with Nekhludoff\'s card, the\nsoul of Jeanne D\'Arc was speaking through the saucer. The soul had\nalready said, "They will recognize each other," which was duly entered\non a sheet of paper. When the servant entered, the saucer, stopping\nfirst on the letter p, then on the letter o, reached the letter s and\nbegan to jerk one way and another. That was because, as the general\nthought, the next letter was to be l, that is to say, Jeanne D\'Arc,\naccording to his idea, intended to say that souls would recognize each\nother only after they had been purged of everything mundane, or\nsomething to that effect, and that therefore the next letter ought to\nbe l (_posl, i. e._, after); the artist, on the other hand, thought\nthat the next letter would be v; that the soul intended to say that\nsouls would recognize each other by the light--_posv_ (_ietu_) that\nwould issue from the ethereal body of the souls. The general, gloomily\nknitting his brow, gazed fixedly on the hands, and imagining that the\nsaucer moved itself, pulled it toward the letter l. The young, anaemic\nartist, with his oily hair brushed behind his ears, looked into the\ndark corner of the room, with his blue, dull eyes, and nervously\ntwitching his lips, pulled toward the letter v. The general frowned at\nthe interruption, and, after a moment\'s silence, took the card, put on\nhis pince-nez and, groaning from pain in his loins, rose to his full\nheight, rubbing his benumbed fingers.\n\n"Show him into the cabinet."\n\n"Permit me, Your Excellency, to finish it myself," said the artist,\nrising. "I feel a presence."\n\n"Very well; finish it," said the general with austerity, and went,\nwith firm, long strides, into the cabinet.\n\n"Glad to see you," said the general in a rough voice to Nekhludoff,\npointing to an arm-chair near the desk. "How long have you been in St.\nPetersburg?"\n\nNekhludoff said that he had but lately arrived.\n\n"Is your mother, the Princess, well?"\n\n"My mother is dead."\n\n"Beg pardon; I was very sorry. My son told me that he had met you."\n\nThe general\'s son was making the same career as his father, and was\nvery proud of the business with which he was entrusted.\n\n"Why, I served with your father. We were friends, comrades. Are you in\nservice?"\n\n"No, I am not."\n\nThe general disapprovingly shook his head.\n\n"I have a request to make of you, general," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Very glad. What can I do for you?"\n\n"If my request be out of season, please forgive me. But I must state\nit."\n\n"What is it?"\n\n"There is a man, Gurkevitch, kept in prison under your jurisdiction.\nHis mother asks to be permitted to visit him, or, at least to send him\nbooks."\n\nThe general expressed neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction at\nNekhludoff\'s request, but, inclining his head to one side, seemed to\nreflect. As a matter of fact he was not reflecting; Nekhludoff\'s\nquestion did not even interest him, knowing very well that his answer\nwould be as the law requires. He was simply resting mentally without\nthinking of anything.\n\n"That is not in my discretion, you know," he said, having rested\nawhile. "There is a law relating to visits, and whatever that law\npermits, that is permitted. And as to books, there is a library, and\nthey are given such books as are allowed."\n\n"Yes, but he wants scientific books; he wishes to study."\n\n"Don\'t believe that." The general paused. "It is not for study that\nthey want them, but so, it is simply unrest."\n\n"But their time must be occupied somehow?"\n\n"They are always complaining," retorted the general. "We know them."\n\nHe spoke of them in general as of some peculiar race of people.\n\n"They have such conveniences here as is seldom seen in a prison," he\ncontinued.\n\nAnd as though justifying himself, he began to recount all the\nconveniences enjoyed by the prisoners in a manner to make one believe\nthat the chief aim of the institution consisted in making it a\npleasant place of abode.\n\n"Formerly, it is true, the regulations were very harsh, but now their\ncondition is excellent. They get three dishes, one of which is always\nof meat--chopped meat or cutlet. Sundays they get a fourth\ndish--dessert. May God grant that every Russian could feed so well."\n\nThe general, like all old men, evidently having committed to memory\nthe oft-repeated words, proceeded to prove how exacting and ungrateful\nthe prisoners were by repeating what he had told many times before.\n\n"They are furnished books on spiritual topics, also old journals. We\nhave a library of suitable books, but they seldom read them. At first\nthey appear to be interested, and then it is found that the pages of\nall the new books are barely half cut, and of the old ones there is no\nevidence of any thumb-marks at all. We even tried," with a remote\nsemblance of a smile the general continued, "to put a piece of paper\nbetween the pages, and it remained untouched. Writing, too, is\nallowed. A slate is given them, also a slate-pencil, so that they may\nwrite for diversion. They can wipe it out and write again. And yet\nthey don\'t write. No, they become quiet very soon. At first they are\nuneasy, but afterward they even grow stout and become very quiet."\n\nNekhludoff listened to the hoarse, feeble voice; looked on that\nfleshless body, those faded eyes under the gray eyebrows, those\nsunken, shaved cheeks, supported by a military collar, that white\ncross, and understood that to argue and explain to him the meaning of\nthose words were futile. But, making another effort, he asked him\nabout the prisoner, Shustova, whose release, he had received\ninformation, had been ordered, through the efforts of Mariette.\n\n"Shustova? Shustova--I don\'t remember them all by name. There are so\nmany of them," he said, evidently reproving them for being so\nnumerous. He rang the bell and called for the secretary.\n\nWhile a servant was going after the secretary he admonished Nekhludoff\nto go into service, saying that the country was in need of honest,\nnoble men.\n\n"I am old, and yet I am serving to the extent of my ability."\n\nThe secretary came and reported that there were no papers received\nrelating to Shustova, who was still in prison.\n\n"As soon as we receive an order we release them the very same day. We\ndo not keep them; we do not particularly value their presence," said\nthe general, again with a waggish smile, which had the effect only of\nmaking his face wry.\n\n"Good-by, my dear," he continued. "Don\'t be offended for advising you,\nfor I do so only because I love you. Have nothing to do with the\nprisoners. You will never find innocent people among them. They are\nthe most immoral set. We know them," he said, in a tone of voice which\ndid not permit the possibility of doubt. "You had better take an\noffice. The Emperor and the country need honest people. What if I and\nsuch as you refused to serve? Who would be left? We are complaining\nof conditions, but refuse to aid the government."\n\nNekhludoff sighed deeply, made a low bow, pressed the bony hand\ncondescendingly extended, and departed.\n\nThe general disapprovingly shook his head, and, rubbing his loins,\nwent to the reception-room, where the artist awaited him with the\nanswer of Jeanne D\'Arc. The general put on his pince-nez and read:\n"They will recognize each other by the light issuing from the ethereal\nbodies."\n\n"Ah!" said the general, approvingly, closing his eyes. "But how will\none recognize another when all have the same light?" he asked, and\nagain crossing his fingers with those of the artist, seated himself at\nthe table.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNekhludoff\'s driver drove up to the gate.\n\n"It is very dull here, sir," he said, turning to Nekhludoff. "It was\nvery tiresome, and I was about to drive away."\n\n"Yes, tiresome," assented Nekhludoff with a deep sigh, resting his\neyes on the clouds and the Neva, dotted with variegated boats and\nsteamers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n\nWith a note from Prince Ivan Michaelovitch, Nekhludoff went to Senator\nWolf--un homme tres comme il faut, as the Prince had described him.\n\nWolf had just breakfasted and, as usual, was smoking a cigar, to aid\nhis digestion, when Nekhludoff arrived. Vladimir Vasilievitch Wolf was\nreally un homme tres comme il faut, and this quality he placed above\nall else; from the height of it he looked upon all other people, and\ncould not help valuing this quality, because, thanks to it, he had\ngained a brilliant career--the same career he strove for; that is to\nsay, through marriage he obtained a fortune, which brought him a\nyearly income of eighteen thousand rubles, and by his own efforts he\nobtained a senatorship. He considered himself not only un homme tres\ncomme il faut, but a man of chivalric honesty. By honesty he\nunderstood the refusal to take bribes from private people. But to do\neverything in his power to obtain all sorts of traveling expenses,\nrents and disbursements he did not consider dishonest. Nor did he\nconsider it dishonest to rob his wife and sister-in-law of their\nfortunes. On the contrary, he considered that a wise arrangement of\nhis family affairs.\n\nThe home circle of Vladimir Vasilievitch consisted of his\ncharacterless wife, her sister, whose fortune he managed to get into\nhis own hands by selling her property and depositing the money in his\nown name, and his gentle, scared, homely daughter, who was leading a\nsolitary, hard life, and whose only diversion consisted in visiting\nthe religious meetings at Aline\'s and Countess Catherine Ivanovna\'s.\n\nThe son of Vladimir Vasilievitch, a good-natured, bearded boy of\nfifteen, who at that age had already commenced to drink and lead a\ndepraved life which lasted till he was twenty years old, was driven\nfrom the house for the reason that he did not pass examinations in any\nschool, and keeping bad company, and, running into debt, he had\ncompromised his father. The father paid once for his son two hundred\nand thirty rubles, and paid six hundred rubles a second time, but\ndeclared that that was the last time, and if the son did not reform he\nwould drive him from the house and have nothing to do with him. Not\nonly did the son not reform, but contracted another debt of a thousand\nrubles, and told his father that he did not care if he was driven from\nthe house, since life at home was torture to him. Then Vladimir\nVasilievitch told his son that he could go where he pleased; that he\nwas no longer his son. Since then no one in the house dared to speak\nof his son to him. And Vladimir Vasilievitch was quite certain that he\nhad arranged his family affairs in the best possible manner.\n\nWolf, with a flattering and somewhat derisive smile--it was an\ninvoluntary expression of his consciousness of his comme il faut\nsuperiority--halted in his exercise long enough to greet Nekhludoff\nand read the note.\n\n"Please take a seat, but you must excuse me. If you have no objection\nI will walk," he said, putting his hands in the pockets of his\njacket, and treading lightly up and down the diagonal of the large\ncabinet, furnished in an austere style. "Very glad to make your\nacquaintance, and, of course, to please the Count Ivan Michaelovitch,"\nemitting the fragrant, blue smoke, and carefully removing the cigar\nfrom his mouth so as not to lose the ashes.\n\n"I would like to ask you to hasten the hearing of the appeal, because\nif the prisoner is to go to Siberia, it would be desirable that she go\nas soon as possible," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Yes, yes, with the first steamer from Nijhni; I know," said Wolf,\nwith his condescending smile, who always knew everything in advance,\nwhatever the subject mentioned to him. "What is the name of the\nprisoner?"\n\n"Maslova."\n\nWolf walked to the table and looked into the papers.\n\n"That\'s right--Maslova. Very well; I will ask my associates. We will\nhear the case Wednesday."\n\n"May I wire my lawyer?"\n\n"So you have a lawyer? What for? But if you wish it, all right."\n\n"The grounds of appeal may be insufficient," said Nekhludoff, "but I\nthink it may be seen from the case that the sentence was the result of\na misunderstanding."\n\n"Yes, yes; that may be so, but the Senate cannot enter into the merits\nof the case," said Vladimir Vasilievitch, sternly, glancing at the\nashes of his cigar. "The Senate only looks after the proper\ninterpretation and application of the law."\n\n"This, I think, is an exceptional case."\n\n"I know; I know. All cases are exceptional. We will do what the law\nrequires. That is all." The ashes were still intact, but had already\ncracked and were in danger of collapse. "And do you often visit St.\nPetersburg?" asked Wolf, holding the cigar so that the ashes would not\nfall. The ashes were unstable, however, and Wolf carefully carried\nthem to the ash-holder, into which they were finally precipitated.\n\n"What an awful catastrophe Kamensky met with," said Wolf. "A fine\nyoung man, and an only son. Especially the condition of the\nmother"--he went on repeating almost word for word the story of a duel\nof which all St. Petersburg was talking at the time. After a few more\nwords about Countess Catherine Ivanovna and her passion for the new\nreligious tendency which Vladimir Vasilievitch neither praised nor\ncondemned, but which, for un homme tres comme il faut, was evidently\nsuperfluous, he rang the bell.\n\nNekhludoff bowed himself out.\n\n"If it is convenient for you, come to dinner," said Wolf, extending\nhis hand, "say on Wednesday. I will then give you a definite answer."\n\nIt was already late, and Nekhludoff drove home, that is, to his\naunt\'s.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n\nMaslova\'s case was to be heard the following day, and Nekhludoff went\nto the Senate. He met Fanirin at the entrance to the magnificent\nSenate building, where several carriages were already waiting. Walking\nup the grand, solemn staircase to the second floor, the lawyer, who\nwas familiar with all the passages, turned into a room to the left, on\nthe door of which was carved the year of the institution of the Code.\nThe lawyer removed his overcoat, remaining in his dress-coat and black\ntie on a white bosom, and with cheerful self-confidence walked into\nthe next room. There were about fifteen spectators present, among whom\nwere a young woman in a pince-nez, and a gray-haired lady. A\ngray-haired old man of patriarchal mien, wearing a box-coat and gray\ntrousers, and attended by two men, attracted particular attention. He\ncrossed the room and entered a wardrobe.\n\nAn usher, a handsome man with red cheeks and in a pompous uniform,\napproached Fanirin with a piece of paper in his hand and asked him in\nwhat case he appeared. Being told that in Maslova\'s case, the usher\nmade a note of something and went away. At that time the door of the\nwardrobe opened and the patriarchal looking old man came forth, no\nlonger in the coat, but in a brilliant uniform which made him resemble\na bird. His uniform evidently embarrassed the old man, and he walked\ninto the room opposite the entrance with quicker than his ordinary\nstep.\n\nFanirin pointed him out to Nekhludoff as Be, "a most honorable\ngentleman." The spectators, including Fanirin, went into the next room\nand seated themselves behind the grating on benches reserved for\nspectators. Only the St. Petersburg lawyer took a seat behind a desk\non the other side of the grating.\n\nThe session room of the Senate was smaller than the room of the\nCircuit Court, was furnished in simpler style, only the table behind\nwhich the Senators sat was of crimson plush instead of green cloth,\nbordered with gold lace.\n\nThere were four Senators. The President, Nikitin, with a closely\nshaved, narrow face and steel-gray eyes; Wolf, with thin lips and\nsmall white hands, with which he was turning over the papers before\nhim; then Skovorodnikoff, stout, massive and pock-marked, and a very\nlearned jurist, and finally, Be, the same partriarchal old man, who\nwas the last to arrive. Immediately behind the Senators came the Chief\nSecretary and Associate Attorney General. He was a young man of medium\nheight, shaved, lean, with a very dark face and black, sad eyes.\nNekhludoff recognized him, notwithstanding his strange uniform and the\nfact that he had not seen him for about six years, as one of his best\nfriends during his student life.\n\n"Is the associate\'s name Selenin?" he asked the lawyer.\n\n"Yes, why?"\n\n"I know him very well; he is an excellent man----"\n\n"And a good associate of the Attorney General--very sensible. It would\nhave been well to see him," said Fanirin.\n\n"At all events, he will follow the dictates of his conscience," said\nNekhludoff, remembering his close relations with and friendship for\nSelenin, and the latter\'s charming qualities of purity, honesty and\ngood breeding, in the best sense of the word.\n\nThe first case before the Senate was an appeal from the decision of\nthe Circuit Court of Appeals affirming a judgment in favor of the\npublisher of a newspaper in a libel suit brought against him.\n\nNekhludoff listened and tried to understand the arguments in the\ncase, but as in the Circuit Court, the chief difficulty in\nunderstanding what was going on was found in the fact that the\ndiscussion centered not on what appeared naturally to be the main\npoint, but on side issues.\n\nThe libel consisted in an article accusing the president of a stock\ncompany of swindling. It seemed, then, that the main point to consider\nwas, whether or not the president was guilty of swindling the\nstockholders, and what was to be done to stop his swindling. But this\nwas never mentioned. The questions discussed were: Had the publisher\nthe legal right to print the article of its reporter? What crime has\nhe committed by printing it--defamation or libel? And does defamation\ninclude libel, or libel defamation? And a number of other things\nunintelligible to ordinary people, including various laws and\ndecisions of some "General Department."\n\nThe only thing Nekhludoff did understand was that, though Wolf had\nsternly suggested but yesterday that the Senate could not consider the\nsubstance of a case, in the case at bar he argued with evident\npartiality in favor of reversing the judgment, and that Selenin, in\nspite of his characteristic reserve, argued in favor of affirming the\njudgment with unexpected fervor. The cause of Selenin\'s ardor lay in\nthe fact that he knew the president of the stock company to be\ndishonest in money affairs, while he accidentally learned that Wolf,\nalmost on the eve of the hearing of the case, had attended a sumptuous\ndinner at the president\'s house. And now, when Wolf, though with great\ncaution, showed undoubted partiality, Selenin became excited and\nexpressed his opinion with more nervousness than an ordinary case\nwould justify. Wolf was evidently offended by the speech; he twitched\nnervously, changed color, made silent gestures of wonder, and with an\nhaughty air of being offended he departed with the other Senators into\nthe deliberation-room.\n\n"What case are you interested in?" the usher again asked Fanirin, as\nsoon as the Senators had left the room.\n\n"I have already told you that I am here in behalf of Maslova."\n\n"That is so. The case will be heard to-day. But----"\n\n"What is that?" asked the lawyer.\n\n"You see, the case was to be argued without counsel, so that the\nSenators would hardly consider it in open session. But--I will\nannounce----" and he made a note on the piece of paper.\n\nThe Senators really intended, after announcing their decision in the\nlibel case, to consider the other cases, including Maslova\'s, while\ndrinking their tea and smoking cigarettes in the consultation-room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\nAs soon as the Senators seated themselves at the table in the\nconsultation-room, Wolf began to set forth in an animated manner the\ngrounds upon which he thought the case ought to be reversed.\n\nThe President, always an ill-natured man, was in a particularly bad\nhumor to-day. While listening to the case during the session he formed\nhis opinion, and sat, absorbed in his thoughts, without listening to\nWolf. These thoughts consisted in a recollection of what note he had\nmade the other day in his memoirs anent the appointment of Velianoff\nto an important post which he desired for himself. The President,\nNikitin, quite sincerely thought that the officials with whom his\nduties brought him in contact were worthy of a place in history.\nHaving written an article the other day in which some of these\nofficials were vehemently denounced for interfering with his plan to\nsave Russia from ruin, as he put it, but in reality for interfering\nwith his getting a larger salary than he was now getting, he was now\nthinking that posterity would give an entirely new interpretation to\nthat incident.\n\n"Why, certainly," he said to Wolf, who was addressing him, although he\ndid not hear what Wolf said.\n\nBe listened to Wolf with a sad face, drawing garlands on a piece of\npaper which lay before him. Be was a liberal of the deepest dye. He\nscarcely held to the traditions of the sixties, and if he ever\ndeviated from strict impartiality, it was invariably in favor of\nliberality. Thus, in this case, besides the consideration that the\ncomplaining president of the stock company was an unclean man, Be was\nin favor of affirming the judgment, also because this charge of libel\nagainst a journalist was a restriction on the freedom of the press.\nWhen Wolf had finished his argument, Be, leaving the garland\nunfinished, in a sad--it was sad for him to be obliged to prove such\ntruisms--soft, pleasant voice, convincingly proved in a few simple\nwords that the charge had no foundation, and, again drooping his hoary\nhead, continued to complete the garland.\n\nSkovorodnikoff, who was sitting opposite Wolf, continually gathering\nwith his thick fingers his beard and mustache into his mouth, as soon\nas Be was through with his argument, stopped chewing his beard, and,\nin a loud, rasping voice, said that although the president of the\nstock company was a villain, he should favor a reversal if there were\nlegal grounds to sustain it, but as there were none, he joined in the\nopinion of Ivan Semenovitch (Be), and he invariably rejoiced at this\nshot aimed at Wolf. The President supported Skovorodnikoff\'s opinion,\nand the judgment was confirmed.\n\nWolf was dissatisfied, especially because by this judgment he seemed\nto stand convicted of arguing in bad faith; but, feigning\nindifference, he opened his papers in the next case, Maslova\'s, and\nbegan to peruse it attentively. The other Senators in the meantime\ncalled for tea, and began a talk about Kamensky\'s duel and his death,\nwhich was then the subject of conversation throughout the city.\n\nThe usher entered and announced the desire of the lawyer and\nNekhludoff to be present at the hearing of the case.\n\n"This case here," said Wolf, "is a whole romantic story," and he\nrelated what he knew of Nekhludoff\'s relations to Maslova.\n\nAfter talking awhile of the story, smoking cigarettes and finishing\ntheir tea, the Senators returned to the session-room, announced their\ndecision in the preceding case, and began to consider Maslova\'s case.\n\nWolf very circumstantially set forth Maslova\'s appeal from the\nsentence, and again not without partiality, but with the evident\ndesire to reverse the judgment.\n\n"Have you anything to add?" the President asked Fanirin.\n\nFanirin rose, and, projecting his broad, starched front, with\nremarkable precision of expression began to discuss the errors of the\ncourt below in the application of the law on the six points raised,\nand permitted himself, though briefly, to touch upon the merits of the\ncase and the crying injustice of the decision. By the tone of his\nshort but strong speech, he seemed to excuse himself, to insist that\nthe honorable Senators with their power of penetration and judicial\nwisdom saw and understood better than he, but that he was speaking\nonly because his duties demanded it. After Fanirin\'s speech there\nseemed to be no doubt left that the Senate had to reverse the\njudgment. When he was through, Fanirin smiled triumphantly. Looking at\nhis lawyer and seeing that smile, Nekhludoff was convinced that the\ncase was won. But as he looked at the Senators Nekhludoff saw that\nFanirin alone was smiling and triumphant. The Senators and Associate\nAttorney General were neither smiling nor triumphant, but wore the air\nof people suffering from ennui and saying: "Oh, we know these cases!\nYou are wasting your time." They were all evidently relieved only when\nthe lawyer had finished, and they were no longer unnecessarily\ndetained. After the speech the President turned to Selenin, who\nplainly, briefly and accurately expressed himself against a reversal.\nThen the Senators arose and went to consult.\n\nThe Senators were divided. Wolf favored a reversal. Be, who thoroughly\nunderstood the case, warmly argued also in favor of a reversal, and in\nglowing terms pictured the court scene and the misunderstanding of the\njury. Nikitin, who, as usual, stood for severity and for strict\nformality, was against it. The whole case, then, depended on\nSkovorodnikoff\'s vote. And his vote was thrown against a reversal,\nprincipally for the reason that Nekhludoff\'s determination to marry\nthe girl on moral grounds was extremely repugnant to him.\n\nSkovorodnikoff was a materialist, a Darwinist, and considered every\nmanifestation of abstract morality, or, worse still, piety, not only\nas contemptible and absurd but as an affront to his person. All this\nbustle about a fallen girl, and the presence there in the Senate of\nher famous counsel and Nekhludoff himself, was to him simply\ndisgusting. And, stuffing his mouth with his beard, and making\ngrimaces, he in a very natural manner pretended to know nothing of the\nentire affair, except that the grounds of appeal were insufficient,\nand therefore agreed with the President to affirm the judgment.\n\nThe appeal was denied.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n\n"It is awful!" said Nekhludoff to the lawyer, as they entered the\nwaiting-room. "In the plainest possible case they cavil at idle forms.\nIt is awful!"\n\n"The case was spoiled at the trial," said Fanirin.\n\n"Selenin, too, was against reversal. It is awful, awful!" Nekhludoff\ncontinued to repeat. "What is to be done now?"\n\n"We will petition the Emperor. Head it yourself while you are here. I\nwill prepare the petition."\n\nAt that moment Wolf in his uniform and stars hung on his breast\nentered the waiting-room and approached Nekhludoff.\n\n"I am sorry, my dear Prince, but the grounds were insufficient," he\nsaid, shrugging his narrow shoulders; and, closing his eyes, he\nproceeded on his way.\n\nAfter Wolf came Selenin, who had learned from the Senators that\nNekhludoff, his former friend, was present.\n\n"I did not expect to meet you here," he said, approaching Nekhludoff\nand smiling with his lips, while his eyes remained sad.\n\n"And I did not know that you were the Attorney General."\n\n"Associate," Selenin corrected him. "But what brought you to the\nSenate?"\n\n"I came here hoping to find justice, and to save an innocent woman."\n\n"What woman?"\n\n"The case that has just been decided."\n\n"Oh, the Maslova case!" said Selenin. "An entirely groundless\nappeal."\n\n"The question is not of the appeal, but of the woman, who is innocent\nand undergoing punishment."\n\nSelenin sighed.\n\n"Quite possible, but----"\n\n"It is not merely possible, but certain."\n\n"How do you know?"\n\n"I know because I was on the jury. I know wherein we made the\nmistake."\n\nSelenin became thoughtful.\n\n"It should have been declared on the trial," he said.\n\n"I did so."\n\n"It should have been made part of the record. If that had appeared in\nthe appeal----"\n\nSelenin, who was always busy, and did not mingle in society, had\nevidently not heard of Nekhludoff\'s romance. Nekhludoff, however,\ndecided not to speak to him of his relations to Maslova.\n\n"But it is evident even now that the verdict was preposterous," he\nsaid.\n\n"The Senate has no right to say so. If the Senate attempted to\ninterfere with the verdicts of the courts upon its own view of the\njustness of the verdicts themselves, there would be greater risks of\njustice being miscarried than established," he said, recalling the\npreceding case. "Besides, the verdicts of juries would lose their\nsignificance."\n\n"I only know one thing, and that is that the woman is entirely\ninnocent, and the last hope of saving her from an undeserved\npunishment is gone. The highest judicial institution has affirmed what\nwas absolutely unjust."\n\n"It has not affirmed because it has not and could not consider the\nmerits of the case," said Selenin, blinking his eyes. "You have\nprobably stopped at your aunts," he added, evidently wishing to change\nthe subject of conversation. "I learned yesterday that you were in St.\nPetersburg. Countess Catherine Ivanovna had invited me and you to be\npresent at the meeting of the English preacher," said Selenin, smiling\nonly with his lips.\n\n"Yes, I was present, but left with disgust," Nekhludoff said angrily,\nvexed at Selenin\'s leading away from the conversation.\n\n"Why should you be disgusted? At all events it is a manifestation of\nreligious feeling, although one-sided and sectarian," said Selenin.\n\n"It is such strange nonsense," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Well, no. The only strange thing here is that we know so little of\nthe teachings of our church that we receive an exposition of its\nfundamental dogmas as a new revelation," said Selenin, as though\nhastening to tell his former friends his new views.\n\nNekhludoff gazed at Selenin with wonder. Selenin did not lower his\neyes, in which there was an expression not only of sadness, but of\nill-will.\n\n"But we will discuss it later," said Selenin. "I am coming," he turned\nto the usher who approached him deferentially. "We must meet again,"\nhe added, sighing; "but you can never be found. You will always find\nme at home at seven. I live on Nadeghinskaia," and he mentioned the\nnumber. "It is a long time since we met," he added, again smiling with\nhis lips.\n\n"I will come if I have the time," said Nekhludoff, feeling that the\nman whom he had once loved was made strange and incomprehensible to\nhim, if not hostile, by this short conversation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs student Nekhludoff knew Selenin as a dutiful son, a true friend,\nand, for his years, an educated, worldly man, with great tact, always\nelegant and handsome, and uncommonly truthful and honest withal. He\nstudied diligently, without any difficulty and without the slightest\nostentation, receiving gold medals for his compositions.\n\nHe had made it the aim of his young life, not merely by word, but in\nreality, to serve others, and thought he saw his chance of doing so in\ngovernment service. Systematically looking over the various activities\nto which he might devote his energies, he decided that he could be\nmost useful in the legislative department, and entered it. But\nnotwithstanding his most accurate and conscientious attention to his\nduties, he found nothing in them to satisfy his desire to be useful.\nHis discontent, due to the pettiness and vanity of his immediate\nsuperiors, grew until an opportunity offered to enter the Senate. He\nwas better off in the Senate, but the same feeling of dissatisfaction\npursued him. He constantly felt that things were not what he expected\nthem to be, and what they should be. During his service in the Senate,\nhis relations obtained for him the post of gentleman of the Emperor\'s\nbed-chamber, and he was obliged to drive around in gorgeous uniform to\nthank various people. In this post he felt even more than before out\nof place. At the same time, on the one hand, he could not refuse the\nappointment, because he would not disappoint those who thought they\nwere pleasing him by it, and, on the other hand, the appointment\nflattered his vanity. It pleased him to see himself in a looking-glass\nin a gold embroidered uniform, and to receive the tokens of respect\nshown him by some people on his appointment.\n\nThe same thing happened with respect to his marriage. A brilliant\nmatch was arranged for him, as it is regarded from the world\'s\nstandpoint. And he married principally because to refuse would have\nbeen to offend and cause pain to the bride and those who had arranged\nthe match. Hence the marriage to a young, pretty, distinguished girl\nflattered his vanity and gave him pleasure. But the marriage soon\nturned out to be "not the thing, you know," more so even than Court\nservice. After her first child, his wife did not wish to have any\nmore, and plunged into luxurious social life, in which he was obliged\nto participate nolens volens. Although this poisoned the life of her\nhusband, and brought her only exertion and fatigue, she nevertheless\ndiligently pursued it. All his efforts to change her mode of life\ncould not alter her confidence, supported by all her relatives and\nacquaintances, that it was quite proper.\n\nThe child, a girl with long, golden curls, was an entire stranger to\nher father, mainly because she was brought up not in accord with his\ndesires. The result was the customary misunderstanding between the\nhusband and wife, and even in a want of desire to understand each\nother, and a quiet, silent struggle, hidden from strangers and\ntempered by propriety, which made Selenin\'s life at home very\nburdensome. So that his family life turned out to be "not the thing,\nyou know," in still greater degree than his service or the Court\nappointment.\n\nThese were the reasons why his eyes were always sad. And this was why,\nseeing Nekhludoff, whom he had known before all these lies had\nfastened themselves upon him, he thought of himself as he had been\nthen, and more than ever felt the discord between his character and\nhis surroundings, and he became painfully sad. The same feeling came\nover Nekhludoff, after the first impression of joy at meeting an old\nfriend.\n\nThat was why, having promised that they would meet each other, neither\nsought that meeting, nor had they seen each other on this visit of\nNekhludoff to St. Petersburg.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n\nOn leaving the Senate, Nekhludoff and his lawyer walked along the\nsidewalk. Fanirin told his driver to follow him, and he began to\nrelate to Nekhludoff how the mistress of so-and-so had made millions\non \'Change, how so-and-so had sold, and another had bought, his wife.\nHe also related some stories of swindling and all sorts of crimes\ncommitted by well-known people who were not occupying cells in prison,\nbut presidents\' chairs in various institutions. These stories, of\nwhich he seemed to possess an inexhaustible source, afforded the\nlawyer great pleasure, as showing most conclusively that the means\nemployed by him as a lawyer to make money were perfectly innocent in\ncomparison with those used by the more noted public men of St.\nPetersburg. And the lawyer was greatly surprised when Nekhludoff, in\nthe middle of one of these stories, hailed a trap, took leave and\ndrove home. Nekhludoff was very sad. He was sad because the Senate\'s\njudgment continued the unreasonable suffering of the innocent Maslova,\nand also because it made it more difficult for him to carry out his\nunalterable intention of joining his fate to hers. His sadness\nincreased as the lawyer related with so much pleasure the frightful\nstories of the prevailing wickedness. Besides, the unkind, cold,\nrepelling gaze of the once charming, open-hearted and noble Selenin\nconstantly recurred to his mind. Nekhludoff, after the impressions of\nhis stay in St. Petersburg, was almost in despair of ever reaching any\nresults. All the plans he had laid out in Moskow seemed to him like\nthose youthful dreams which usually end in disappointment. However, he\nconsidered it his duty, while in St. Petersburg, to exhaust his\nresources in endeavoring to fulfill his mission.\n\nSoon after he reached his room, a servant called him upstairs for tea.\nMariette, in a multi-colored dress, was sitting beside the Countess,\nsipping tea. On Nekhludoff\'s entering the room, Mariette had just\ndropped some funny, indecent joke. Nekhludoff noticed it by the\ncharacter of their laughter. The good-natured, mustached Countess\nCatherine Ivanovna was shaking in all her stout body with laughter,\nwhile Mariette, with a particularly mischievous expression, and her\nenergetic and cheerful face somewhat bent to one side, was silently\nlooking at her companion.\n\n"You will be the death of me," said the Countess, in a fit of\ncoughing.\n\nNo sooner had Nekhludoff seated himself than Mariette, noticing the\nserious and slightly displeased expression on his face, immediately\nchanged not only her expression, but her frame of mind. This was with\nthe intention she had in mind since she first saw him--to get him to\nlike her. She suddenly became grave, dissatisfied with her life,\nseeking something, striving after something. She not merely feigned,\nbut actually induced in herself a state of mind similar to that in\nwhich Nekhludoff was, although she would not be able to say what it\nconsisted of. In a sympathetic conversation about the injustice of the\nstrong, the poverty of the people, the awful condition of the\nprisoners, she succeeded in rousing in him the least expected feeling\nof physical attraction, and under the din of conversation their eyes\nplainly queried, "Can you love me?" and they answered, "Yes, I can."\n\nOn leaving, she told him that she was always ready to be of service to\nhim, and asked him to visit her at the theatre the next day, if only\nfor a minute, saying that she wished to have a talk with him on a\nmatter of importance.\n\n"When will I see you again?" she added, sighing, and carefully\nputting the gloves on her ring-bedecked hand. "Tell me that you will\ncome."\n\nNekhludoff promised to come.\n\nFor a long time that night Nekhludoff could not fall asleep. When he\nrecalled Maslova, the decision of the Senate, and his determination to\nfollow her; when he recalled his relinquishment of his right to the\nland, there suddenly appeared before him, as if in answer to these\nquestions, the face of Mariette; her sigh and glance when she said,\n"When will I see you again?" and her smile--all so distinct that she\nseemed to stand before him, and he smiled himself. "Would it be proper\nfor me to follow her to Siberia? And would it be proper to deprive\nmyself of my property?" he asked himself.\n\nAnd the answers to these questions on that bright St. Petersburg night\nwere indefinite. His mind was all in confusion. He called forth his\nformer trend of thought, but those thoughts had lost their former\npower of conviction.\n\n"And what if all my ideas are due to an over-wrought imagination, and\nI should be unable to live up to them? If I should repent of what I\nhave done?" he asked himself, and, being unable to find answers to\nthese questions, he was stricken with such sadness and despair as he\nhad rarely experienced before, and he fell into that deep slumber\nwhich had been habitual with him after heavy losses at cards.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n\nNekhludoff\'s first feeling on rising the following morning was that he\nhad committed something abominable the preceding evening.\n\nHe began to recall what had happened. There was nothing abominable; he\nhad done nothing wrong. He had only thought that all his present\nintentions--that of marrying Katiousha, giving the land to the\npeasants--artificial, unnatural, and that he must continued to live as\nhe had lived before.\n\nHe could recall no wrong act, but he remembered what was worse than a\nwrong act--there were the bad thoughts in which all bad acts have\ntheir origin. Bad acts may not be repeated; one may repent of them,\nwhile bad thoughts give birth to bad acts.\n\nA bad act only smooths the way to other bad acts, while bad thoughts\nirresistibly lead toward them.\n\nRecalling his thoughts of the day before, Nekhludoff wondered how he\ncould have believed them. How so novel and difficult might be that\nwhich he intended to do, he knew that it was the only life possible to\nhim now, and that, however easy it might be for him to return to his\nold mode of life, he knew that that was death, not life. This\ntemptation of the day before was similar to that of a man who, after a\nnight\'s sound sleep, feels like taking his ease on the soft mattress\nfor a while, although he knows that it is time to be up and away on an\nimportant affair.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNekhludoff would have left the same evening but for his promise to\nMariette to visit her at the theatre. Though he knew that it was wrong\nto do it, he went there, contrary to the dictates of his own\nconscience, considering himself bound to keep his word. Besides his\nwish to see Mariette again, he also wished, as he thought, to measure\nhimself against that world lately so near, but now so strange to him.\n\n"Could I withstand these temptations?" he thought, but not with entire\nsincerity. "I will try it for the last time."\n\nAttired in a dress-coat, he arrived in the theatre where the eternal\n"Dame aux Camelias" was being played. A French actress was showing in\na novel way how consumptive women die.\n\nNekhludoff was shown to the box occupied by Mariette. In the corridor\na liveried servant bowed and opened the door for him.\n\nAll the spectators in the circle of boxes--sitting and standing,\ngray-haired, bald and pomaded heads--were intently following the\nmovements of a slim actress making wry faces and in an unnatural voice\nreading a monologue. Some one hissed when the door was opened, and\ntwo streams of cold and warm air were wafted on Nekhludoff\'s face.\n\nIn the box he found Mariette and a strange lady with a red mantle over\nher shoulders and high head-dress, and two men--a general, Mariette\'s\nhusband, a handsome, tall man with a high, artificial, military\nbreast, and a flaxen haired, bald-headed man with shaved chin and\nsolemn side-whiskers. Mariette, graceful, slim, elegant, decolette,\nwith her strong, muscular shoulders sloping down from the neck, at the\njointure of which was a darkening little mole, immediately turned\naround, and, pointing with her fan to a chair behind her, greeted him\nwith a welcome, grateful, and, as it seemed to Nekhludoff, significant\nsmile. Her husband calmly, as was his wont, looked at Nekhludoff and\nbowed his head. In the glance which he exchanged with his wife, as in\neverything else, he looked the master, the owner, of a beautiful\nwoman.\n\nThere was a thunder of applause when the monologue ended. Mariette\nrose, and, holding in one hand her rustling silk skirt, walked to the\nrear of the box and introduced Nekhludoff to her husband. The general\nincessantly smiled with his eyes, said he was glad, and remained calm\nand mute.\n\n"I had to leave to-day, but I promised you," said Nekhludoff, turning\nto Mariette.\n\n"If you don\'t wish to see me, you will see a remarkable actress,"\nMariette said, answering the meaning of his words. "Wasn\'t she great\nin the last scene?" she turned to her husband.\n\nThe general bowed his head.\n\n"That does not affect me," said Nekhludoff. "I have seen so much real\nmisfortune to-day that----"\n\n"Sit down and tell us what you have seen."\n\nThe husband listened, and ironically smiled with his eyes.\n\n"I went to see that woman who has been released. She is entirely\nbroken down."\n\n"That is the woman of whom I have spoken to you," Mariette said to her\nhusband.\n\n"Yes; I was very glad that she could be released," he calmly said,\nnodding his head and smiling ironically, as it seemed to Nekhludoff,\nunder his mustache. "I will go to the smoking-room."\n\nNekhludoff waited, expecting that Mariette would tell him that\nsomething which she said she had to tell him, but instead she only\njested and talked of the performance, which, she thought, ought to\naffect him particularly.\n\nNekhludoff understood that the only purpose for which she had brought\nhim to the theatre was to display her evening toilet with her\nshoulders and mole, and he was both pleased and disgusted. Now he saw\nwhat was under the veil of the charm that at first attracted him.\nLooking on Mariette, he admired her, but he knew that she was a\nprevaricator who was living with her career-making husband; that what\nshe had said the other day was untrue, and that she only wished--and\nneither knew why--to make him love her. And, as has been said, he was\nboth pleased and disgusted. Several times he attempted to leave, took\nhis hat but still remained. But finally, when the general, his thick\nmustache reeking with tobacco, returned to the box and glanced at\nNekhludoff patronizingly disdainful, as if he did not recognize him,\nNekhludoff walked out before the door closed behind the general, and,\nfinding his overcoat, left the theatre.\n\nOn his way home he suddenly noticed before him a tall, well-built,\nloudly-dressed woman. Every passer-by turned to look at her.\nNekhludoff walked quicker than the woman, and also involuntarily\nlooked her in the face. Her face, probably rouged, was pretty; her\neyes flashed at him, and she smiled. Nekhludoff involuntarily thought\nof Mariette, for he experienced the same feeling of attraction and\ndisgust which took hold of him in the theatre. Passing her hastily,\nNekhludoff turned the corner of the street, and, to the surprise of\nthe policeman, began to walk up and down the water-front.\n\n"That one in the theatre also smiled that way when I entered," he\nthought, "and the smile of the former conveyed the same meaning as\nthat of the latter. The only difference between them is that this one\nspeaks openly and plainly, while the other pretends to be exercising\nhigher and refined feelings. But in reality they are alike. This one\nis at least truthful, while the other is lying." Nekhludoff recalled\nhis relations with the wife of the district commander, and a flood of\nshameful recollections came upon him. "There is a disgusting\nbestiality in man," he thought; "but when it is in a primitive state,\none looks down upon and despises it, whether he is carried away with\nor withstands it. But when this same bestiality hides itself under a\nso-called aesthetic, poetic cover, and demands to be worshiped, then,\ndeifying the beast, one gives himself up to it, without distinguishing\nbetween the good and the bad. Then it is horrible."\n\nAs there was no soothing, rest-giving darkness that night, but instead\nthere was a hazy, cheerless, unnatural light, so even was there no\nrest-giving darkness--ignorance--for Nekhludoff\'s soul. Everything was\nclear. It was plain that all that is considered important and useful\nis really insignificant and wicked, and that all that splendor and\nluxury were hiding old crimes, familiar to every one, and not only\nstalking unpunished, but triumphing and adorned with all the\nallurements man is capable of conceiving.\n\nNekhludoff wished to forget it, not to see it, but he could no longer\nhelp seeing it. Although he did not see the source of the light which\nrevealed these things to him, as he did not see the source of the\nlight which spread over St. Petersburg, and though this light seemed\nto him hazy, cheerless and unnatural, he could not help seeing that\nwhich the light revealed to him, and he felt at the same time both joy\nand alarm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n\nImmediately upon his arrival in Moskow, Nekhludoff made his way to the\nprison hospital, intending to make known to Maslova the Senate\'s\ndecision and to tell her to prepare for the journey to Siberia.\n\nOf the petition which he brought for Maslova\'s signature, he had\nlittle hope. And, strange to say, he no longer wished to succeed. He\nhad accustomed himself to the thought of going to Siberia, and living\namong the exiles and convicts, and it was difficult for him to imagine\nhow he should order his life and that of Maslova if she were freed.\n\nThe door-keeper at the hospital, recognizing Nekhludoff, immediately\ninformed him that Maslova was no longer there.\n\n"Where is she, then?"\n\n"Why, again in the prison."\n\n"Why was she transferred?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"Your Excellency knows their kind," said the door-keeper, with a\ncontemptuous smile. "She was making love to the assistant, so the\nchief physician sent her back."\n\nNekhludoff did not suspect that Maslova and her spiritual condition\nwere so close to him. This news stunned him. The feeling he\nexperienced was akin to that which people experience when hearing\nsuddenly of some great misfortune. He was deeply grieved. The first\nfeeling he experienced was that of shame. His joyful portraying of her\nspiritual awakening now seemed to him ridiculous. Her reluctance to\naccept his sacrifice, the reproaches and the tears, were the mere\ncunning, he thought, of a dissolute woman who wished to make the most\nuse of him. It seemed to him now that at his last visit he had seen in\nher the symptoms of incorrigibility which were now evident. All this\nflashed through his mind at the time he instinctively donned his hat\nand left the hospital.\n\n"But what\'s to be done now?" he asked himself. "Am I bound to her? Am\nI not released now by this, her act?"\n\nBut no sooner did he form the question than he understood that in\nconsidering himself released and leaving her to her fate he would be\npunishing not her, which he desired, but himself, and he was\nterrified.\n\n"No! That will not alter my decision--it will only strengthen it. Let\nher do whatever her soul prompts her to do; if she would make love to\nthe assistant, let her do so. It is her business. It is my business to\ndo what my conscience demands," he said to himself. "And my conscience\ndemands that I sacrifice my liberty in expiation of my sin, and my\ndecision to marry her, although but fictitiously, and follow her\nwherever she may be sent, remains unaltered," he said to himself, with\nspiteful obstinacy, and, leaving the hospital, he made his way with\nresolute step to the prison gate.\n\nComing to the gate, he asked the officer on duty to tell the\ninspector that he wished to see Maslova. The officer knew Nekhludoff,\nand told him an important piece of prison news. The captain had\nresigned, and another man, who was very strict, had taken his place.\n\nThe inspector, who was in the prison at the time, soon made his\nappearance. He was tall, bony, very slow in his movements, and gloomy.\n\n"Visitors are allowed only on certain days," he said, without looking\nat Nekhludoff.\n\n"But I have a petition here which she must sign."\n\n"You may give it to me."\n\n"I must see the prisoner myself. I was always permitted to see her\nbefore."\n\n"That was before," said the inspector, glancing at Nekhludoff.\n\n"I have a pass from the Governor," Nekhludoff insisted, producing his\npocket-book.\n\n"Let me see it," said the inspector, without looking in Nekhludoff\'s\neyes, and taking the document with his skinny, long, white hand, on\nthe index finger of which there was a gold ring, he slowly read it.\n"Walk into the office, please," he said.\n\nOn this occasion there was no one in the office. The inspector seated\nhimself at the table, looking through the papers that lay on it,\nevidently intending to stay through the meeting. When Nekhludoff asked\nhim if Bogodukhovskaia could be seen, he answered: "Visiting the\npoliticals is not allowed," and again buried his head in the papers.\n\nWhen Maslova entered the room, the inspector raised his eyes, and,\nwithout looking either at Maslova or Nekhludoff, said: "You may go\nahead," and continued to busy himself with his papers.\n\nMaslova was again dressed in a white skirt, waist and \'kerchief.\nComing near Nekhludoff and seeing his cold, angry face, her own turned\na purple color, and, with downcast eyes, she began to pick a corner of\nher waist. Her confusion Nekhludoff considered as confirmation of the\nhospital porter\'s words.\n\nSo abhorent was she to him now that he _could not_ extend his hand to\nher, as he desired.\n\n[Illustration: WARDEN AND MATRON.]\n\n"I bring you bad news," he said in an even voice, without looking at\nher. "The Senate affirmed the verdict."\n\n"I knew it would be so," she said in a strange voice, as if choking.\n\nIf it had happened before, Nekhludoff would have asked her why she\nknew it; now he only looked at her. Her eyes were filled with tears,\nbut this not only did not soften him, but made him even more inflamed\nagainst her.\n\nThe inspector rose and began to walk up and down the room.\n\nNotwithstanding the abhorence Nekhludoff felt for Maslova, he thought\nit proper to express his regret at the Senate\'s action.\n\n"Do not despair," he said. "This petition may be more successful, and\nI hope that----"\n\n"Oh, it is not that," she said, looking at him with the tearful and\nsquinting eyes.\n\n"What, then?"\n\n"You have been in the hospital, and they must have told you there\nabout me."\n\n"What of it? That is your business," frowning, Nekhludoff said with\nindifference. The cruel feeling of offended pride rose in him with\ngreater force at her mention of the hospital. "I, a man of the world,\nwhom any girl of the upper class would be only too happy to marry,\noffered to become the husband of that woman, and she could not wait,\nbut made love to the assistant surgeon," he thought, looking at her\nwith hatred.\n\n"Sign this petition," he said, and, taking from his pocket a large\nenvelope, placed it on the table. She wiped her tears with a corner of\nher \'kerchief, seated herself at the table, and asked him where to\nsign.\n\nHe showed her where, and she, seating herself, smoothed with her left\nhand the sleeve of the right. He stood over her, silently looking at\nher back bent over the table, and now and then shaking from the sobs\nshe tried to suppress, and his soul was convulsed by a struggle\nbetween good and evil, between offended pride and pity for her\nsufferings. The feeling of pity conquered.\n\nWhether it was the feeling of pity that first asserted itself, or the\nrecollection of his own deeds of the same character for which he\nreproached her, he scarcely knew, but suddenly he felt himself guilty\nand pitied her.\n\nHaving signed the petition and wiped her soiled fingers on her skirt,\nshe rose and glanced at him.\n\n"Whatever the result, and no matter what happens, I shall keep my\nword," said Nekhludoff.\n\nThe thought that he was forgiving her strengthened in him the feeling\nof pity and tenderness for her, and he wished to console her.\n\n"I will do what I said. I will be with you wherever you may be."\n\n"That\'s no use," she hastened to say, and her face became radiant.\n\n"Make note of what you need for the road."\n\n"Nothing particular, I think. Thank you."\n\nThe inspector approached them, and Nekhludoff, without waiting to be\ntold that the time was up, took leave of her, experiencing a new\nfeeling of quiet happiness, calmness and love for all mankind. It was\nthe consciousness that no act of Maslova could alter his love for her\nthat raised his spirit and made him feel happy. Let her make love to\nthe assistant--that was her business. He loved her not for himself,\nbut for her and for God.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe love-making for which Maslova was expelled from the hospital, and\nto which Nekhludoff gave credence, consisted only in that, when\nMaslova, coming to the drug department for some pectoral herbs,\nprescribed by her superior, she found there an assistant, named\nUstinoff. This Ustinoff had been pursuing her with his attentions for\na long time, and as he tried to embrace her she pushed him away with\nsuch force that he struck the shelving, and two bottles came crashing\nto the floor.\n\nThe chief physician was passing at the time, and, hearing the sound of\nthe breaking glass, and seeing Maslova running out, all flushed, he\nangrily shouted to her:\n\n"Well, girl, if you begin to flirt here, I will send you back. What is\nthe matter?" he turned to the assistant, sternly looking over his\nspectacles.\n\nThe assistant, smiling, began to apologize. The doctor, without\nhearing him to the last, raised his head so that he began to look\nthrough the glasses, and walked into the ward. On the same day he\nasked the inspector to send a more sedate nurse in place of Maslova.\nMaslova\'s expulsion from the hospital on the ground of flirting was\nparticularly painful to her by reason of the fact that, after her\nmeeting with Nekhludoff, all association with men, which had _been_ so\nrepugnant to her, became even more disgusting.\n\nThe fact that, judging her by her past and present condition,\neverybody, including the pimpled assistant, thought that they had the\nright to insult her, and were surprised when she refused their\nattentions, was very painful to her and called forth her tears and\npity for herself. Now, coming out to see Nekhludoff, she wished to\nexplain the injustice of the charge which he had probably heard. But\nas she attempted to do so, she felt that he would not believe her;\nthat her explanation would only tend to corroborate the suspicion, and\nher tears welled up in her throat, and she became silent.\n\nMaslova was still thinking, and continued to assure herself that, as\nshe had told him on his second visit, she had not forgiven him; that\nshe hated him, but, in reality, she had long since begun to love him\nagain, and loved him so that she involuntarily carried out his wishes.\nShe ceased to drink and smoke, she gave up flirting, and willingly\nwent as servant to the hospital. All this she did because she knew he\nwished it. Her repeated refusal to accept his sacrifice was partly due\nto the fact that she wished to repeat those proud words which she had\nonce told him, and mainly because she knew that their marriage would\nmake him unhappy. She was firmly resolved not to accept his sacrifice,\nand yet it was painful for her to think that he despised her; that he\nthought her to be the same as she had been, and did not see the change\nshe was undergoing. The fact that he was at that moment thinking that\nshe did something wrong in the hospital pained her more than the news\nthat she was finally sentenced to hard labor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n\nMaslova might be sent away with the first party of exiles; hence\nNekhludoff was preparing for departure. But he had so many things to\nattend to that he felt that he could never get through with them, no\nmatter how much time there might be left for preparations. It was\ndifferent in former times. Then it was necessary to devise something\nto do, and the interest in all his affairs centered in Dmitri\nIvanovich Nekhludoff. But though all interest in life centered in\nDmitri Ivanovich, he always suffered from ennui. Now, however, all his\naffairs related to people other than Dmitri Ivanovich, and were all\ninteresting and attractive, as well as inexhaustible.\n\nBesides, formerly the occupation with the affairs of Dmitri Ivanovich\nalways caused vexation and irritation; while these affairs of others\nfor the most part put him in a happy mood.\n\nNekhludoff\'s affairs were now divided into three parts. He himself, in\nhis habitual pedantism, thus divided them, and according placed them\nin three different portfolios.\n\nThe first was that of Maslova. This consisted in efforts to obtain a\nsuccessful result in the pending petition, and preparations for\ndeparture to Siberia.\n\nThe second part related to the settlement of his estates. The Panov\nland was granted to the peasants on condition of their paying a rent\nto be used for common necessities. But, in order to complete that\narrangement, it was necessary to sign an agreement and also make his\nwill. The arrangement made for the Kusminskoie estate was to remain in\nforce, only there remained to be determined what part of the rent he\nwas to appropriate to himself, and what was to be left for the benefit\nof the peasants. Without knowing what his necessary disbursements\nwould be on his trip to Siberia, he could not make up his mind to\ndeprive himself of his income, although he reduced it by one-half.\n\nThe third part related to aid to prisoners, who were now applying to\nhim more and more frequently.\n\nAt first, when written to for aid, he proceeded immediately to\nintercede for the applicants, endeavoring to relieve their condition,\nbut in the end their number became so great that he found it\nimpossible to help every one, and was involuntarily brought to a\nfourth matter, which had of late occupied him more than either of the\nothers.\n\nHis fourth concern consisted in solving the question, Why, how and\nwhence came that remarkable institution called the Criminal Court, to\nwhich was due the existence of that prison, with the inmates of which\nhe had become somewhat familiar, and all those places of confinement,\nbeginning with the fortress dedicated to two saints, Peter and Paul,\nand ending with the island of Saghalin, where hundreds and thousands\nof victims of that wonderful criminal law were languishing?\n\nFrom personal contact with prisoners, and from information received\nfrom the lawyer, the prison chaplain, the inspector, and from the\nprison register, Nekhludoff came to the conclusion that the prisoners,\nso-called criminals, could be divided into five classes. The first\nclass consisted of people entirely innocent, victims of judicial\nmistakes, such as that would-be incendiary, Menshov, or Maslova, and\nothers. There were comparatively few people of this class, according\nto the observations of the chaplain--about seven per cent.--but their\ncondition attracted particular attention. The second class consisted\nof people convicted for offenses committed under exceptional\ncircumstances, such as anger, jealousy, drunkenness, etc.--offenses\nwhich, under similar circumstances, would almost invariably have been\ncommitted by all those who judged and punished them. This class made\nup, according to Nekhludoff\'s observations, more than one-half of all\nthe prisoners. To the third class belonged those who committed,\naccording to their own ideas, the most indifferent or even good acts,\nbut which were considered criminal by people--entire strangers to\nthem--who were making the laws. To this class belonged all those who\ncarried on a secret trade in wine, or were bringing in contraband\ngoods, or were picking herbs, or gathering wood, in private or\ngovernment forests. To this class also belonged the predatory\nmountaineers.\n\nThe fourth class consisted of people who, according to Nekhludoff,\nwere reckoned among the criminals only because they were morally above\nthe average level of society. Among these the percentage of those who\nresisted interference with their affairs, or were sentenced for\nresisting the authorities, was very large.\n\nThe fifth class, finally, was composed of people who were more sinned\nagainst by society than they sinned themselves. These were the\nhelpless people, blunted by constant oppression and temptation, like\nthat boy with the mats, and hundreds of others whom Nekhludoff saw\nboth in and out of prison, and the conditions of those whose lives\nsystematically drove them to the necessity of committing those acts\nwhich are called crimes. To these people belonged, according to\nNekhludoff\'s observations, many thieves and murderers, with some of\nwhom Nekhludoff had come in contact. Among these Nekhludoff found, on\nclose acquaintance, those spoiled and depraved people whom the new\nschool calls the criminal type, and the existence of which in society\nis given as the reason for the necessity of criminal law and\npunishment. These so-called depraved types, deviating from the normal,\nwere, according to Nekhludoff, none other than those very people who\nhave sinned less against society than society has sinned against them,\nand against whom society has sinned, not directly, but through their\nancestors.\n\nNekhludoff\'s attention was attracted by a habitual thief, Okhotin, who\ncame under this head. He was the son of a fallen woman; had grown up\nin lodging-houses, and till the age of thirty had never met a moral\nman. In childhood he had fallen in with a gang of thieves, but he\npossessed a humorous vein which attracted people to him. While asking\nNekhludoff for aid he jested at himself, the judges, the prison and\nall the laws, not only criminal, but even divine. There was also a\nfine-looking man, Fedorff, who, in company with a gang of which he was\nthe leader, had killed and robbed an old official. This one was a\npeasant whose father\'s house had been illegally taken from him, and\nwho, while in the army, suffered for falling in love with an officer\'s\nmistress. He was attractive and passionate. His sole desire in life\nwas to enjoy himself, and he had never met any people who, out of any\nconsideration, tempered their passions, nor had he ever heard that\nthere was any other aim in life than personal enjoyment. It was plain\nto Nekhludoff that these two were richly endowed by nature, and were\nonly neglected and mutilated as plants are sometimes neglected and\nmutilated. He also came across a vagabond, and a woman, whose\nstupidity and apparent cruelty were repulsive, but he failed to find\nin them that criminal type spoken of by the Italian school. He only\nsaw in them people who were disagreeable to him personally, like some\nhe had met in dress-coats, uniforms, and laces.\n\nThus the investigation of the question: Why are people of such great\nvariety of character confined in prisons, while others, no different\nthan those, enjoy freedom and even judge those people? was the fourth\nconcern of Nekhludoff.\n\nAt first he hoped to find an answer to this question in books, and\nbought every book bearing on the subject. He bought the works of\nLombroso, Garofalo, Ferri, Mandsley and Tard, and read them carefully.\nBut the more he read them, the greater was his disappointment. The\nsame thing happened with him that happens with people who appeal to\nscience with direct, simple, vital questions, and not with a view of\nplaying the part of an expounder, writer or teacher in it. Science\nsolved a thousand and one various abstruse, complicated questions\nbearing on criminal law, but failed to give an answer to the question\nhe had formed. His question was very simple: Why and by what right do\nsome people confine, torture, exile, flog and kill other people no\ndifferent than they are themselves? And in answer they argued the\nquestions: Whether or not man is a free agent? Can a criminal be\ndistinguished by the measurements of his cranium? To what extent is\ncrime due to heredity? What is morality? What is insanity? What is\ndegeneracy? What is temperament? How does climate, food, ignorance,\nemulation, hypnotism, passion affect crime? What is society? What are\nits duties? etc., etc.\n\nThese arguments reminded Nekhludoff of an answer he had once received\nfrom a schoolboy. He asked the boy whether he had learned the\ndeclension of nouns. "Yes," answered the boy. "Well, then decline\n\'Paw.\'" "What paw? A dog\'s paw?" the boy answered, with a sly\nexpression on his face. Similar answers in the form of questions\nNekhludoff found in scientific books to his one basic question.\n\nHe found there many wise, learned and interesting things, but there\nwas no answer to his principal question: By what right do some people\npunish others? Not only was there no answer, but all reasoning tended\nto explain and justify punishment, the necessity of which was\nconsidered an axiom. Nekhludoff read much, but only by fits and\nstarts, and the want of an answer he ascribed to such superficial\nreading. He, therefore, refused to believe in the justice of the\nanswer which constantly occurred to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n\nThe deportation of the party of convicts to which Maslova belonged was\nset for the fifth of July, and Nekhludoff was prepared to follow her\non that day. The day before his departure his sister, with her\nhusband, arrived in town to see him.\n\nNekhludoff\'s sister, Natalie Ivanovna Ragojhinsky, was ten years his\nsenior. He had grown up partly under her influence. She loved him when\nhe was a boy, and before her marriage they treated each other as\nequals; she was twenty-five and he was fifteen. She had been in love\nthen with his deceased friend, Nikolenka Irtenieff. They both loved\nNikolenka, and loved in him and in themselves the good that was in\nthem, and which unifies all people.\n\nSince that time they had both became corrupted--he by the bad life he\nwas leading; she by her marriage to a man whom she loved sensually,\nbut who not only did not love all that which she and Dimitri at one\ntime considered most holy and precious, but did not even understand\nit, and all those aspirations to moral perfection and to serving\nothers, to which she had once devoted herself, he ascribed to\nselfishness and a desire to show off before people.\n\nRagojhinsky was a man without reputation or fortune, but a clever\nfortune hunter, who, by skillful manoeuvering between liberalism and\nconservatism, availing himself of that dominating tendency which\npromised bitter results in life, but principally by something peculiar\nwhich attracted women to him, he succeeded in making a relatively\nbrilliant judicial career. He was already past his youth when he met\nNekhludoff abroad, made Natalie, who was also not very young, to fall\nin love with him, and married her almost against the wish of her\nmother, who said that it would be a mesalliance. Nekhludoff, although\nhe concealed it from himself and struggled against the feeling, hated\nhis brother-in-law. He disliked his vulgar feelings, his\nself-confident narrowness of mind, but, principally, because of his\nsister, who should so passionately, egotistically and sensually love\nsuch a poor nature, and to please whom she should stifle all her noble\nsentiments. It was always painful to Nekhludoff to think of Natalie as\nthe wife of that hairy, self-confident man, with shining bald head. He\ncould not even suppress his aversion to his children. And whenever he\nheard that she was about to become a mother, he experienced a feeling\nof compassion for her being again infected with something bad by the\nman who was so unlike all of them.\n\nThe Ragojhinskys arrived without their children, and engaged the best\nsuite in the best hotel. Natalie Ivanovna immediately went to the old\nhome of her mother, and learning there that her brother had moved to\nfurnished rooms, she went to his new home. The dirty servant, meeting\nher in the dark, ill-smelling corridor, which was lit up by a lamp\nduring the day, announced that the Prince was away.\n\nDesiring to leave a note, Natalie Ivanovna was shown into his\napartments. She closely examined the two small rooms. She noticed in\nevery corner the familiar cleanliness and order, and she was struck by\nthe modesty of the appointments. On the writing table she saw a\nfamiliar paper-press, with the bronze figure of a dog, neatly arranged\nportfolios, papers, volumes of the Criminal Code and an English book\nof Henry George, and a French one by Tard, between the leaves of which\nwas an ivory paper knife.\n\nShe left a note asking him to call on her the same evening, and,\nshaking her head in wonder at what she had seen, returned to her\nhotel.\n\nThere were two questions relating to her brother that interested\nNatalie Ivanovna--his marriage to Katiousha, of which she had heard in\nher city, where it was a matter of common gossip, and the distribution\nby him of his land to the peasants, upon which some people looked as\nsomething political and dangerous. From one point of view, she rather\nliked the idea of his marrying Katiousha. She admired his resolution,\nseeing in it herself and him as they had been before her marriage. At\nthe same time, she was horror-stricken at the thought that her brother\nwas to marry such an awful woman. The latter feeling was the stronger,\nand she decided to dissuade him from marrying her, although she knew\nhow hard that would be.\n\nThe other affair, that of his parting with his land, she did not take\nso close to heart, but her husband was indignant at such folly, and\ndemanded that she influence her brother to abandon the attempt.\nIgnatius Nikiforovitch said that it was the height of inconsistency,\nfoolhardiness and pride; that such an act could only be explained, if\nat all, by a desire to be odd, to have something to brag about, and to\nmake people talk about one\'s self.\n\n"What sense is there in giving the land to the peasants and making\nthem pay rent to themselves?" he said. "If his mind was set on doing\nit, he could sell them the land through the bank. There would be some\nsense in that. Taking all in all, his act is very eccentric," said\nIgnatius Nikiforovitch, already considering the necessity of a\nguardianship, and he demanded that his wife should seriously speak to\nher brother of this, his strange intention.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n\nIn the evening Nekhludoff went to his sister. Ignatius Nikiforovitch\nwas resting in another room, and Natalie Ivanovna alone met him. She\nwore a tight-fitting black silk dress, with a knot of red ribbon, and\nher hair was done up according to the latest fashion. She was\nevidently making herself look young for her husband. Seeing her\nbrother, she quickly rose from the divan, and, rustling with her silk\nskirt, she went out to meet him. They kissed and, smiling, looked at\neach other. There was an exchange of those mysterious, significant\nglances in which everything was truth; then followed an exchange of\nwords in which that truth was lacking. They had not met since the\ndeath of their mother.\n\n"You have grown stout and young," he said.\n\nHer lips contracted with pleasure.\n\n"And you have grown thin."\n\n"Well, how is Ignatius Nikiforovitch?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"He is resting. He has not slept all night."\n\nA great deal should have been said here, but their words said nothing,\nand their glances said that that which interested them most was left\nunsaid.\n\n"I have been at your lodging."\n\n"Yes, I know it. I have moved from the house. I am so lonely and\nweary. I do not need any of those things, so you take them--the\nfurniture--everything."\n\n"Yes, Agrippina Petrovna told me. I have been there. I thank you very\nmuch. But----"\n\nAt that moment the servant brought in a silver tea service. Natalie\nIvanovna busied herself with making the tea. Nekhludoff was silent.\n\n"Well, Dimitri, I know everything," Natalie said, resolutely, glancing\nat him.\n\n"I am very glad that you know."\n\n"Do you think it possible to reform her after such a life?"\n\nHe was sitting erect on a small chair, attentively listening to her,\nprepared to answer satisfactorily her every question. He was still in\nthat frame of mind which, after his last meeting with Maslova, filled\nhis soul with tranquil happiness and love for all mankind.\n\n"It is not her that I intend to reform, but myself," he answered.\n\nNatalie Ivanovna sighed.\n\n"There are other means besides marriage."\n\n"And I think that that is the best. Besides, that will bring me into\nthat world in which I can be useful."\n\n"I do not think," said Natalie Ivanovna, "that you could be happy."\n\n"It is not a question of my happiness."\n\n"Of course; but if she possesses a heart, she cannot be happy--she\ncannot even desire it."\n\n"She does not."\n\n"I understand, but life--demands something different."\n\n"Life only demands that we do what is right," said Nekhludoff, looking\nat her face, still beautiful, although covered with fine wrinkles\naround the eyes and mouth.\n\n"Poor dear! How she has changed!" thought Nekhludoff, recalling\nNatalie as she had been before her marriage, and a tender feeling,\nwoven of countless recollections of their childhood, rose in his\nbreast toward her.\n\nAt that moment Ignatius Nikiforovitch, as usual holding his head high\nand projecting his broad chest, entered the room, with shining\neye-glasses, bald head and black beard.\n\n"How do you do? How do you do?" he greeted Nekhludoff, unnaturally\naccentuating his words.\n\nThey pressed each other\'s hand, and Ignatius Nikiforovitch lowered\nhimself into an arm-chair.\n\n"Am I disturbing you?"\n\n"No, I do not conceal anything I say or do from anybody."\n\nAs soon as Nekhludoff saw that face, those hairy hands and heard that\npatronizing tone, his gentle disposition immediately disappeared.\n\n"Yes, we have been speaking about his intention," said Natalie\nIvanovna. "Shall I pour out some tea for you?" she added, taking the\ntea-pot.\n\n"Yes, if you please. What intention do you refer to?"\n\n"My intention of going to Siberia with that party of convicts, among\nwhom there is a woman I have wronged," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"I heard that you intended more than that."\n\n"Yes, and marry her, if she only desires it."\n\n"I see! And may I ask you to explain your motives, if it is not\nunpleasant to you? I do not understand them."\n\n"My motives are that that woman--that the first step on her downward\ncareer----" Nekhludoff became angry because he could not find the proper\nexpression. "My motives are that I am guilty, while she is punished."\n\n"If she is punished, then she is also, probably, guilty."\n\n"She is perfectly innocent."\n\nAnd, with unnecessary agitation, Nekhludoff related the whole case.\n\n"Yes, that was an omission by the presiding justice. But in such cases\nthere is the Senate."\n\n"The Senate sustained the verdict."\n\n"Ah, then there were no grounds of appeal," said Ignatius\nNikiforovitch, evidently sharing the well-known opinion that truth is\nthe product of court proceedings. "The Senate cannot go into the\nmerits of a case. But if there is really a judicial error, a petition\nshould be made to the Emperor."\n\n"That was done, but there is no chance of success. Inquiries will be\nmade at the Ministry, which will refer them to the Senate, and the\nSenate will repeat its decision, and, as usual, the innocent will be\npunished."\n\n"In the first place, the Ministry will not refer to the Senate," and\nIgnatius Nikiforovitch smiled condescendingly, "but will call for all\nthe documents in the case, and, if it finds an error, will so decide.\nIn the second place, an innocent person is never, or, at least, very\nseldom punished. Only the guilty is punished."\n\n"And I am convinced that the contrary is true," said Nekhludoff, with\nan unkind feeling toward his brother-in-law. "I am convinced that the\nmajority of the people convicted by courts are innocent."\n\n"How so?"\n\n"They are innocent in the ordinary sense of the word, as that woman\nwas innocent of poisoning; as that peasant is innocent of the murder\nwhich he has not committed; as that mother and son are innocent of the\narson which was committed by the owner himself, and for which they\ncame near being convicted."\n\n"Of course, there always have been and always will be judicial errors.\nHuman institutions cannot be perfect."\n\n"And, then, a large part of the innocent, because they have been\nbrought up amid certain conditions, do not consider the acts committed\nby them criminal."\n\n"Pardon me; that is unfair. Every thief knows that stealing is wrong;\nthat theft is immoral," Ignatius Nikiforovitch said, with the calm,\nself-confident, and, at the same time, somewhat contemptuous, smile\nwhich particularly provoked Nekhludoff.\n\n"No, he does not know. He is told not to steal, but he sees and knows\nthat the employers steal his labor, keep back his pay, and that the\nofficials are constantly robbing him."\n\n"That is anarchism," Ignatius calmly defined the meaning of his\nbrother-in-law\'s words.\n\n"I do not know what it is, but I am speaking of facts," Nekhludoff\ncontinued. "He knows that the officials are robbing him. He knows that\nwe, the landlords, own the land which ought to be common property, and\nwhen he gathers some twigs for his oven we send him to jail and try to\nconvince him that he is a thief."\n\n"I do not understand, and if I do, I cannot agree with you. The land\ncannot be nobody\'s property. If you divide it," Ignatius Nikiforovitch\nbegan, being fully convinced that Nekhludoff was a socialist, and that\nthe theory of socialism demands that all the land should be divided\nequally; that such division is foolish, and that he can easily refute\nit. "If you should divide the land to-day, giving each inhabitant an\nequal share, to-morrow it will again find its way into the hands of\nthe more industrious and able among them----"\n\n"Nobody even thinks of dividing the land into equal shares. There\nought to be no property in land, and it ought not to be the subject of\npurchase and sale or renting."\n\n"The right of property is a natural right. Without property right\nthere would be no interest in cultivating the land. Destroy property\nright and we will return to the condition of the savage,"\nauthoritatively said Ignatius Nikiforovitch.\n\n"On the contrary, only then will land not lie idle, as it is now."\n\n"But, Dimitri Ivanovich, it is perfect madness! Is it possible in our\ntime to destroy property in land? I know it is your old hobby. But\npermit me to tell you plainly----" Ignatius Nikiforovitch turned pale\nand his voice trembled. The question was evidently of particular\nconcern to him. "I would advise you to consider that question well\nbefore attempting its practical solution."\n\n"You are speaking of my personal affairs?"\n\n"Yes. I assume that we are all placed in a certain position, and must\nassume the duties that result from that position, must support those\nconditions of existence into which we were born, which we have\ninherited from our forefathers, and which we must hand over to our\nposterity."\n\n"I consider it my duty----"\n\n"Excuse me," continued Ignatius Nikiforovitch, who would not be\ninterrupted. "I am not speaking of myself and my children. The fortune\nof my children is secure, and I earn enough to live in easy\ncircumstances, and, therefore, my protest against your, permit me to\nsay, ill-considered actions is not based on personal interest, but on\nprinciple. And I would advise you to give it a little more thought, to\nread----"\n\n"You had better let me decide my own affairs. I think I know what to\nread and what not to read," said Nekhludoff, turning pale, and,\nfeeling that he could not control himself, became silent and began to\ndrink his tea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n\n"Well, how are the children?" Nekhludoff asked his sister, having\ncalmed down.\n\nThus the unpleasant conversation was changed. Natalie became calm and\ntalked about her children. She would not speak, however, about those\nthings which only her brother understood in the presence of her\nhusband, and in order to continue the conversation she began to talk\nof the latest news, the killing of Kanesky in the duel.\n\nIgnatius Nikiforovitch expressed his disapproval of the condition of\nthings which excluded the killing in a duel from the category of\ncrimes.\n\nHis remark called forth Nekhludoff\'s reply, and a hot discussion\nfollowed on the same subject, neither expressing fully his opinion,\nand in the end they were again at loggerheads.\n\nIgnatius Nikiforovitch felt that Nekhludoff condemned him, hating all\nhis activity, and he wished to prove the injustice of his reasoning.\nNekhludoff, on the other hand, to say nothing of the vexation caused\nhim by his brother-in-law\'s interference in his affairs (in the depth\nof his soul he felt that his brother-in-law, his sister and their\nchildren, as heirs, had the right to do so), was indignant at the calm\nand confident manner of that narrow-minded man who continued to\nconsider legal and just that which to Nekhludoff was undoubtedly\nfoolish. This self-confidence irritated him.\n\n"What should the court do?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"Sentence one of the duelists, as it would a common murderer, to hard\nlabor."\n\nNekhludoff\'s hands again turned cold, and he continued with warmth:\n\n"Well, what would be then?"\n\n"Justice would be done."\n\n"As if the aim of courts was to do justice!" said Nekhludoff.\n\n"What else?"\n\n"Their aim is to support class interests. Courts, according to my\nidea, are only instruments for the perpetuation of conditions\nprofitable to our class."\n\n"That is an entirely new view," said Ignatius Nikiforovitch, smiling\ncalmly. "Usually somewhat different aims are ascribed to courts."\n\n"In theory, but not in practice, as I have learned. The only aim of\nthe courts is to preserve the existing state of things, and for this\nreason they persecute and kill all those who are above the common\nlevel and who wish to raise it as well as those who are below it."\n\n"I cannot agree with the view that criminals are executed because they\nare above the level of the average. For the most part they are the\nexcrescence of society, just as perverted, though in a different\nmanner, as are those criminal types whom you consider below the level\nof the average."\n\n"And I know people who are far above their judges."\n\nBut Ignatius Nikiforovitch, not accustomed to being interrupted when\nspeaking, did not listen to Nekhludoff, which was particularly\nirritating to the latter, and continued to talk while Nekhludoff was\ntalking.\n\n"I cannot agree with you that the aim of courts is to support the\nexisting order of things. The courts have their aims: either the\ncorrection----"\n\n"Prisons are great places for correction," Nekhludoff put in.\n\n"Or the removal," persistently continued Ignatius Nikiforovitch, "of\nthose depraved and savage people who threaten the existence of\nsociety."\n\n"That is just where the trouble is. Courts can do neither the one nor\nthe other. Society has no means of doing it."\n\n"How is that? I don\'t understand----" asked Ignatius Nikiforovitch, with\na forced smile.\n\n"I mean to say that there are only two sensible modes of\npunishment--those that have been used in olden times: corporal\npunishment and capital punishment. But with the advance of\ncivilization they have gone out of existence."\n\n"That is both new and surprising to hear from you."\n\n"Yes, there is sense in inflicting pain on a man that he might not\nrepeat that for which the pain was inflicted; and it is perfectly\nsensible to cut the head off a harmful and dangerous member of\nsociety. But what sense is there in imprisoning a man, who is depraved\nby idleness and bad example, and keeping him in secure and compulsory\nidleness in the society of the most depraved people? Or to transport\nhim, for some reason, at an expense to the government of five hundred\nroubles, from the District of Tula to the District of Irkutsk, or from\nKursk----"\n\n"But people seem to fear these journeys at government expense. And\nwere it not for these journeys, we would not be sitting here as we are\nsitting now."\n\n"Prisons cannot secure our safety, because people are not imprisoned\nfor life, but are released. On the contrary, these institutions are\nthe greatest breeders of vice and corruption--_i. e._, they increase\nthe danger."\n\n"You mean to say that the penitentiary system ought to be perfected?"\n\n"It cannot be perfected. Perfected prisons would cost more than is\nspent on popular education and would be a new burden on the populace."\n\n"But the deficiencies of the penitentiary system do not invalidate the\njudicial system," Ignatius Nikiforovitch again continued, without\nlistening to his brother-in-law.\n\n"These deficiencies cannot be corrected," said Nekhludoff, raising\nhis voice.\n\n"What then? Would you kill? Or, as a certain statesman suggested,\npluck out their eyes?" said Ignatius Nikiforovitch, smiling\ntriumphantly.\n\n"Yes; that would be cruel, but expedient. What we are doing now is\nboth cruel and inexpedient."\n\n"And I am taking part in it," said Ignatius Nikiforovitch, paling.\n\n"That is your business. But I do not understand it."\n\n"I think there are many things you do not understand," said Ignatius\nNikiforovitch, with a quiver in his voice.\n\n"I saw a public prosecutor in court trying his utmost to convict an\nunfortunate boy, who could only arouse compassion in any unperverted\nman----"\n\n"If I thought so, I should give up my position," said Ignatius\nNikiforovitch, rising.\n\nNekhludoff noticed a peculiar glitter under his brother-in-law\'s\neye-glasses. "Can it be tears?" thought Nekhludoff. They really were\ntears. Ignatius Nikiforovitch was offended. Going toward the window,\nhe drew a handkerchief from his pocket, coughed, and began to wipe his\neye-glasses, and, removing them, he also wiped his eyes. Returning to\nthe couch, Ignatius Nikiforovitch lit a cigar and spoke no more.\nNekhludoff was pained and ashamed at the grief that he had caused his\nbrother-in-law and sister, especially as he was leaving the next day\nand would not see them again. In great agitation he took leave of them\nand departed.\n\n"It is quite possible that what I said was true. At any rate, he did\nnot refute me. But it was wrong to speak that way. Little have I\nchanged if I could insult him and grieve poor Natalie," he thought.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n\nThe party of convicts, which included Maslova, was to leave on the\nthree o\'clock train, and in order to see them coming out of the prison\nand follow them to the railroad station Nekhludoff decided to get to\nthe prison before twelve.\n\nWhile packing his clothes and papers, Nekhludoff came across his\ndiary and began to read the entry he had made before leaving for St.\nPetersburg. "Katiusha does not desire my sacrifice, but is willing to\nsacrifice herself," it ran. "She has conquered, and I have conquered.\nI am rejoicing at that inner change which she seems to me to be\nundergoing. I fear to believe it, but it appears to me that she is\nawakening." Immediately after this was the following entry: "I have\nlived through a very painful and very joyous experience. I was told\nthat she had misbehaved in the hospital. It was very painful to hear\nit. Did not think it would so affect me. Have spoken to her with\ncontempt and hatred, but suddenly remembered how often I myself have\nbeen guilty--am even now, although only in thought, of that for which\nI hated her, and suddenly I was seized with disgust for myself and\npity for her, and I became very joyful. If we would only see in time\nthe beam in our own eye, how much kinder we would be." Then he made\nthe following entry for the day: "Have seen Katiusha, and, because of\nmy self-content, was unkind and angry, and departed with a feeling of\noppression. But what can I do? A new life begins to-morrow. Farewell\nto the old life! My mind is filled with numberless impressions, but I\ncannot yet reduce them to order."\n\nOn awakening the following morning, Nekhludoff\'s first feeling was one\nof sorrow for the unpleasant incident with his brother-in-law.\n\n"I must go to see them," he thought, "and smooth it over."\n\nBut, looking at the clock, he saw that there was no time left, and\nthat he must hasten to the prison to see the departure of the\nconvicts. Hastily packing up his things and sending them to the depot,\nNekhludoff hired a trap and drove to the prison.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hot July days had set in. The stones of the street, the houses,\nand the tins of the roofs, failing to cool off during the suffocating\nnight, exhaled their warmth into the hot, still air. There was no\nbreeze, and such as rose every now and then was laden with dust and\nthe stench of oil paint. The few people that were on the streets\nsought shelter in the shade of the houses. Only sun-burnt\nstreet-pavers in bast shoes were sitting in the middle of the street,\nsetting boulders into the hot sand; gloomy policemen in unstarched\nblouses and carrying revolvers attached to yellow cords, were lazily\nshuffling about, and tram-cars with drawn blinds on the sides exposed\nto the sun, and drawn by white-hooded horses, were running up and down\nthe street.\n\nWhen Nekhludoff arrived at the prison, the formal delivery and\nacceptance of the departing convicts, which began at four in the\nmorning, were still going on. The party consisted of six hundred and\ntwenty-three men and sixty-four women; all had to be counted, the weak\nand sick had to be separated, and they were to be delivered to the\nconvoy. The new inspector, two assistants, a physician, his assistant,\nthe officer of the convoy and a clerk were sitting in the shade around\na table with papers and documents, calling and examining each convict\nand making entries in their books.\n\nOne-half of the table was already exposed to the sun. It was getting\nwarm and close from want of air, and from the breathing of the\nconvicts standing near by.\n\n"Will there ever be an end?" said a tall, stout, red-faced captain of\nthe convoy, incessantly smoking a cigarette and blowing the smoke\nthrough the moustache which covered his mouth. "I am exhausted. Where\nhave you taken so many? How many more are there?"\n\nThe clerk consulted the books.\n\n"Twenty-four men and the women."\n\n"Why are you standing there? Come forward!" shouted the captain to the\ncrowding convicts.\n\nThe convicts had already been standing three hours in a broiling sun,\nwaiting their turn.\n\nAll this was taking place in the court-yard of the prison, while\nwithout the prison stood the usual armed soldier, about two dozen\ntrucks for the baggage, and the infirm convicts, and on the corner a\ncrowd of relatives and friends of the convicts, waiting for a chance\nto see the exiles as they emerged from the prison, and, if possible,\nto have a last few words with them, or deliver some things they had\nbrought for them. Nekhludoff joined this crowd.\n\nHe stood there about an hour. At the end of the hour, from behind the\ngates came the clatter of chains, the tramping of feet, voices of\ncommand, coughing and the low conversation of a large crowd. This\nlasted about five minutes, during which time prison officers flitted\nin and out through the wicket. Finally there was heard a sharp\ncommand.\n\nThe gates were noisily flung open, the clatter of the chains became\nmore distinct, and a detachment of guardsmen in white blouses and\nshouldering guns marched forth and arranged themselves, evidently as a\ncustomary manoeuvre, in a large semi-circle before the gates. Again\na command was heard, and the hard-labor convicts, in pairs, began to\npour out. With pancake-shaped caps on their shaved heads, and sacks on\ntheir shoulders, they dragged their fettered legs, holding up the\nsacks with one hand and waving the other. First came the men convicts,\nall in gray trousers and long coats with diamond aces on their backs.\nAll of them--young, old, slim, stout, pale, and red-faced,\ndark-haired, moustached, bearded and beardless, Russians, Tartars,\nJews--came, clanging their chains and briskly waving their hands as\nthough going on a long journey; but after making about ten steps they\nstopped and humbly arranged themselves in rows of four. Immediately\nbehind these came another contingent, also with shaved heads and\nsimilarly dressed, without leg-fetters, but handcuffed to each other.\nThese were exiles. They walked as briskly as the others, stopped, and\nformed in rows of four. Then came the women in the same order, in gray\ncoats and \'kerchiefs, those sentenced to hard labor coming first; then\nthe exiles, and finally those voluntarily following their husbands, in\ntheir native costumes. Some of the women carried infants under the\nskirts of their coats.\n\nChildren--boys and girls--followed them on foot, hanging on to the\nskirts of their mothers. The men stood silently, coughing now and\nthen, or exchanging remarks, while the women carried on incessant\nconversation. Nekhludoff thought that he saw Maslova as she was coming\nout, but she was soon lost in the large crowd, and he only saw a lot\nof gray creatures almost deprived of all womanly features, with their\nchildren and sacks, grouping themselves behind the men.\n\nAlthough the convicts had been counted within the walls of the prison,\nthe guard began to count them over again. This counting took a long\ntime, because the convicts, moving from one place to another, confused\nthe count of the officers. The officers cursed and pushed the humbly\nbut angrily compliant convicts and counted them again. When the\ncounting was finally over, the officer of the guard gave some command,\nand suddenly all became confusion in the crowd. Infirm men, women and\nchildren hastened to the trucks, on which they first placed their\nsacks, then climbed in themselves, the infants crying in their\nmothers\' arms, the children quarreling about the places, the men\nlooking gloomy and despondent.\n\nSome of the convicts, removing their caps, approached the officer and\nmade some request. As Nekhludoff afterward learned, they were asking\nto be taken on the wagons. The guard officer, without looking at the\napplicants, silently inhaled the smoke of his cigarette, then suddenly\nswung his short hand at one of the convicts that approached him, who\ndodged and sprang back.\n\n"I will elevate you to the nobility with a rope! You can walk!"\nshouted the officer.\n\nOnly a tall, staggering old man in irons was permitted to ride on a\nwagon. The old man removed his cap, and making the sign of the cross,\ndragged himself to the wagon; but his fettered legs prevented his\nclimbing up until an old woman, sitting on the wagon, took his hand\nand helped him in.\n\nWhen all the wagons were loaded with sacks and those that were\npermitted to ride, the guard officer uncovered his bald head, wiped\nwith a handkerchief his pate, forehead and red, stout neck, made the\nsign of the cross, and gave command to proceed.\n\nThere was a clatter of weapons; the convicts, removing their caps,\nbegan to make the sign of the cross, some with their left hands; the\nescorting crowd shouted something, the convicts shouted in answer; a\ngreat wailing arose among the women, and the party, surrounded by\nsoldiers in white blouses moved forward, raising a cloud of dust with\ntheir fettered feet. They marched in the order in which they formed at\nthe prison gates, in rows of four, preceded by a detachment of\nsoldiers. The rear was brought up by the wagons loaded with the sacks\nand the infirm. On top of one of the wagons, above all the others, sat\na woman, wrapped up in her coat and sobbing incessantly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\nWhen Nekhludoff reached the railroad station the prisoners were\nalready seated in the cars, behind grated windows. There were a few\npeople on the platform, come to see their departing relatives, but\nthey were not allowed to come near the cars. The guards were greatly\ntroubled this day. On the way from the prison to the station five men\nhad died from sunstroke. Three of them had been taken to the nearest\npolice station from the street, while two were stricken at the\nrailroad station.[F] They were troubled not because five men had died\nwhile under their guard. That did not bother them; but they were\nchiefly concerned with doing all that the law required them to do\nunder the circumstances--to make proper transfer of the dead, their\npapers and belongings, and to exclude them from the list of those that\nwere to be transferred to Nijhni, which was very troublesome,\nespecially on such a warm day.\n\nThis it was that occupied the convoy, and this was the reason why\nNekhludoff and others were not permitted to approach the cars while\nthe formalities were unfinished. However, upon bribing one of the\nsergeants, Nekhludoff was permitted to come near the cars, the\nsergeant asking him to do his errand so that the captain would not see\nhim. There were eighteen cars, and all, except the one reserved for\nthe authorities, were literally packed with prisoners. Passing by the\nwindows, Nekhludoff listened to the sounds within. Everywhere he heard\nthe rattling of chains, bustle, and the hum of conversation,\ninterspersed with stupid profanity; but nowhere did he hear, as he\nexpected, any reference to the dead comrades. Their conversation\nrelated more to sacks, drinking-water, and the choice of seats.\nLooking into the window of one of the cars, Nekhludoff saw some\nguardsmen removing the handcuffs from the wrists of the prisoners. The\nprisoners stretched out their hands, while one of the guards with a\nkey opened the locks of the handcuffs, which were collected by\nanother. When Nekhludoff reached the second car occupied by the women\nhe heard a woman\'s moan, "Oh, heavens! Oh, heavens!"\n\nNekhludoff passed by and approached one of the windows of the third\ncar, pointed out to him by one of the guards. Overheated air,\nimpregnated with a thick odor of perspiration, assailed his nostrils,\nand shrill women\'s voices were distinctly heard. All the benches were\noccupied by flushed, perspiring women in waists and coats, loudly\nconversing. His approach attracted their attention. Those sitting\nnearest to the grated window became silent. Maslova, in a waist and\nwithout headgear, was sitting near the opposite window. The smiling\nTheodosia, who was sitting near Maslova, seeing Nekhludoff, pushed her\nwith her elbow and pointed to Nekhludoff. Maslova hurriedly rose,\nthrew a \'kerchief over her black hair, and, with an animated, red,\nperspiring and smiling face, came near the window and placed her hands\non the grating.\n\n"But how warm it is!" she said, smiling joyously.\n\n"Did you get the things?"\n\n"I did, thank you."\n\n"Do you need anything?" asked Nekhludoff, feeling the heat issuing\nfrom the window as from a steam bath.\n\n"I do not need anything. Thank you."\n\n"If we could only get some water," said Theodosia.\n\n"Yes, some water," repeated Maslova.\n\n"I will ask one of the guards," said Nekhludoff. "We will not meet now\nuntil we reach Nijhni."\n\n"Why, are you going there?" she said, as if she did not know it, but\njoyously glancing at Nekhludoff.\n\n"I am going on the next train."\n\nMaslova was silent for a few moments; then sighed deeply.\n\n"Is it true, master, that twelve people have died from the heat?" said\na churlish old woman in a hoarse voice.\n\nIt was Korableva.\n\n"I don\'t know that twelve have died. I have seen two," said\nNekhludoff.\n\n"They say twelve. They ought to be punished for it, the devils!"\n\n"How is it with the women?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"Women are stronger," said another prisoner, smiling. "Only there is\none who has taken it into her head to give birth to a child. Listen to\nher wailing," she said, pointing to the adjacent car, from which the\nmoaning proceeded.\n\n"You asked if anything was needed," said Maslova, endeavoring to\nrestrain a happy smile. "Could not that woman be taken off the train?\nShe suffers so. Won\'t you tell the authorities?"\n\n"Yes, I will."\n\n"Another thing--could you not get her to see her husband, Tarass?" she\nadded, pointing to the smiling Theodosia. "He is going with you, isn\'t\nhe?"\n\nAt this point the voice of a sergeant was heard reminding Nekhludoff\nthat talking with the prisoners was prohibited. It was not the\nsergeant who passed Nekhludoff.\n\nNekhludoff walked off to find the captain, intending to see him about\nthe sick woman and Tarass, but for a long time could not find him, the\nguards being too busy to answer his inquiries. Some were leading away\none of the convicts; others were hurrying away to buy their\nprovisions; still others were attending a lady who was traveling with\nthe captain of the convoy.\n\nNekhludoff found the captain after the second bell. The captain,\nwiping his thick moustache with his short hand and raising his\nshoulders, was reprimanding one of the sergeants.\n\n"What is it you want?" he asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"There is a woman giving birth to a child, so I thought it would be\nwell----"\n\n"Well, let her. When the child is born we will see to it," said the\ncaptain, passing to his car.\n\nThe conductor came with a whistle in his hand. The third bell\nsounded, and a loud wailing rose among the female prisoners and their\nfriends and relatives on the platform. Nekhludoff was standing beside\nTarass, and watched the cars passing before him, with the grated\nwindows and the shaved heads seen through them. As the one in which\nMaslova was passed, he saw her standing with others at the window,\nlooking at him and smiling piteously.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote F: Early in the eighties five prisoners died from sunstroke\nwhile being transferred from the Boutyr prison to the Nijhni railroad\nstation.--L. T.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\nThe passenger train which was to carry away Nekhludoff was to start in\ntwo hours. Nekhludoff at first thought of utilizing these two hours in\nvisiting his sister, but after the impressions of the morning he felt\nso excited and exhausted that he seated himself on a sofa in the\nsaloon for first-class passengers. But he unexpectedly felt so drowsy\nthat he turned on his side, placed his palm under his cheek, and\nimmediately fell asleep.\n\nHe was awakened by a servant in dress-coat holding a napkin in his\nhand.\n\n"Mister, mister, are you not Prince Nekhludoff? A lady is looking for\nyou."\n\nNekhludoff quickly raised himself, rubbing his eyes, and the incidents\nof the morning passed before his mind\'s eye--the procession of the\nconvicts, the men who had died from the heat, the grated windows of\nthe cars, and the women huddled behind them, one of whom was laboring\nin child-birth without aid, and another piteously smiling to him from\nbehind the iron grating. But in reality he saw a table covered with\nbottles, vases, chandeliers, and fruit stands; nimble servants\nbustling around the table, and in the depth of the saloon, before the\nlunch-counter, loaded with viands and fruits, the backs of passengers\nleisurely eating their luncheon.\n\nWhile Nekhludoff was raising himself and shaking off the slumber, he\nnoticed that everybody in the saloon was curiously watching the\nentrance. He turned his eyes in the same direction, and saw a\nprocession of people who bore an arm-chair in which was seated a lady,\nher head covered with tulle. The first bearer was a lackey who seemed\nfamiliar to Nekhludoff. The one behind was also a familiar porter,\nwith white crown lace around his cap. Behind the arm-chair came an\nelegantly dressed maid-servant with curly hair, carrying a round\nleather box and a sunshade. Further behind came the short-necked\nPrince Korchagin, his shoulders thrown back; then Missy, Misha, their\ncousin, and a diplomat Osten, unfamiliar to Nekhludoff, with his long\nneck and prominent Adam\'s apple and an ever cheerful appearance. He\nwalked impressively, but evidently jestingly talking to the smiling\nMissy. Behind them came the doctor, angrily smoking a cigarette.\n\nThe Korchagins were moving from their estate to the Prince\'s sister,\nwhose estate was situated on the Nijhni road.\n\nThe procession passed into the ladies\' room. The old Prince, however,\nseating himself at the table, immediately called over a waiter and\nbegan to order something. Missy with Osten also stopped in the\ndining-room, and were about to sit down when they saw an acquaintance\nin the doorway and went to meet her. It was Natalia Ivanovna. She was\nescorted by Agrippina Petrovna, and as she entered the dining-room she\nlooked around. At almost the same moment she noticed Missy and her\nbrother. She first approached Missy, only nodding her head to\nNekhludoff. But after kissing Missy she immediately turned to him.\n\n"At last I have found you," she said.\n\nAfter greeting his sister, Nekhludoff entered into conversation with\nMissy, who told him that their house had burned down, necessitating\ntheir removal to her aunt\'s. Osten began to relate a droll anecdote\nanent the fire. Nekhludoff, without listening to Osten, turned to his\nsister:\n\n"How glad I am that you came!"\n\nIn the course of their conversation he told her how sorry he felt for\nhaving fallen out with her husband; that he had intended to return and\nconfess that he was at fault, but that he knew not how her husband\nwould take it.\n\n"I spoke improperly to him, and it tortured me," he said.\n\n"I knew it. I was sure you didn\'t intend it," said his sister. "Don\'t\nyou know----"\n\nThe tears welled up in her eyes, and she touched her brother\'s hand.\nIt was spoken tenderly; he understood her, and was affected. The\nmeaning of her words was that, besides her love for her husband, her\nlove for her brother was dear and important to her, and that any\ndisagreement with him caused her suffering.\n\n"Thank you, thank you. Oh, what I have seen to-day!" he said, suddenly\nrecalling the two dead convicts. "Two convicts have been killed."\n\n"How killed?"\n\n"So, simply killed. They have been brought here in this heat, and two\nof them died from sunstroke."\n\n"Impossible! How? To-day? Just now?"\n\n"Yes, just now. I have seen their corpses."\n\n"Why were they killed? Who killed them?" asked Natalia Ivanovna.\n\n"Those who forcibly brought them here," said Nekhludoff excitedly,\nfeeling that she took the same view of this as her husband.\n\n"Oh, my God!" said Agrippina Petrovna, coming nearer to them.\n\n"Yes, we have no conception of the life these unfortunates are\nleading, and it is necessary to know it," Nekhludoff added, looking at\nthe old Prince, who, sitting at the table with a napkin tucked under\nhis chin and a large glass before him, at that moment glanced at\nNekhludoff.\n\n"Nekhludoff," he shouted. "Won\'t you take sauce to cool off? It is\nexcellent stuff."\n\nNekhludoff refused and turned away.\n\n"But what will you do?" continued Natalia Ivanovna.\n\n"I will do what I can. I do not know what, but I feel that I must do\nsomething. And I will do what I can."\n\n"Yes, yes, I understand that. And what about him?" she said, smiling\nand nodding in the direction of Korchagin. "Is it really all over?"\n\n"Yes, it is and I think without regret on either side."\n\n"I am very sorry. I like her. But I suppose it must be so. But why\nshould you bind yourself? Why are you following her?"\n\n"Because it is proper that I should," Nekhludoff said dryly, as\nthough desiring to change the subject.\n\nBut he immediately felt ashamed of his coldness to his sister. "Why\nshould I not tell her what I think?" he thought; "and let Agrippina\nPetrovna also know it," he said to himself, looking at the old\nservant.\n\nThe presence of Agrippina Petrovna only encouraged him to repeat his\ndecision to his sister.\n\n"You are speaking of my intention to marry Katiusha. You see, I have\ndecided to do it, but she firmly and decidedly refused me," he said,\nand his voice trembled, as it always did when he spoke of it. "She\ndoes not desire my sacrifice, and in her position she sacrifices very\nmuch, and I could not accept her sacrifice, even if it were only\nmomentary. That is why I am following her, and I will be near her, and\nwill endeavor to relieve her condition as far as I am able."\n\nNatalia Ivanovna was silent. Agrippina Petrovna looked inquiringly at\nNatalia Ivanovna, shaking her head. At that moment the procession\nstarted again from the ladies\' room. The same handsome Phillip and the\nporter were bearing the Princess. She stopped the bearers, beckoned\nNekhludoff to her side, and in a piteously languid manner extended her\nwhite, ring-bedecked hand, with horror anticipating the hard pressure\nof his.\n\n"_Epouvantable!_" she said of the heat. "It is unbearable. _Ce climat\nme tue._" And having said a few words of the horrors of the Russian\nclimate, and invited Nekhludoff to visit them, she gave a sign to the\nbearers. "Don\'t fail to come, now," she added, turning her long face\nto Nekhludoff.\n\nNekhludoff went out on the platform. The procession turned to the\nright, toward the first-class coaches. Nekhludoff, with a porter who\ncarried his baggage, and Tarass, with his bags, turned to the left.\n\n"That is my comrade," Nekhludoff said to his sister, pointing to\nTarass, whose story he had told her before.\n\n"What, are you taking the third class?" asked Natalia Ivanovna, when\nNekhludoff stopped before a third-class car and the porter, with\nTarass, entered it.\n\n"Yes, I will have it more convenient then. Tarass is with me. Another\nthing," he added. "I have not yet given the Kusminskoie land to the\npeasants. So that, in case of my death, your children will inherit\nit."\n\n"Dmitri, don\'t talk that way," said Natalia Ivanovna.\n\n"And if I do give it away, then all I have to tell you is that the\nremainder will be theirs, for I shall hardly marry. And if I do, there\nwill be no children--so that----"\n\n"Dmitri, please stop it," said Natalia Ivanovna; but Nekhludoff saw\nthat she was glad to hear what he was saying.\n\nThe time for parting had come. The conductors were closing the doors,\ninviting the passengers to take seats, others to leave the cars.\n\nNekhludoff entered the heated and ill-smelling car and immediately\nappeared on its platform. Natalia Ivanovna was standing opposite, and\nevidently wished to say something, but could not find words. She could\nnot say "_ecrivez_," because they had long been ridiculing the\ncustomary phrase of parting friends. The conversation about financial\naffairs and the inheritance at once destroyed the tender relations\nthey had resumed. They now felt themselves estranged from each other.\nSo that Natalia Ivanovna was glad when the train began to move and she\ncould say, with a smile: "Well, Dmitri, good-by!" As soon as the train\nleft she began to think how to tell her husband of her conversation\nwith her brother, and her face became grave and worried.\n\nAnd though Nekhludoff entertained the best sentiments toward his\nsister, and he concealed nothing from her, he now felt estranged from\nher, and was glad to be rid of her. He felt that the Natasha of old\nwas no more; that there was only a slave of an unpleasant, dark, hairy\nman with whom he had nothing in common. He plainly saw this, because\nher face became illumined with peculiar animation only when he spoke\nof that which interested her husband--of the distribution of the land\namong the peasants, and of the inheritance. This made him sad.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\nThe heat in the large car of the third class, due to its exposure to\nthe scorching sun rays and the large crowd within, was so suffocating\nthat Nekhludoff remained on the platform. But there was no relief even\nthere, and he drew in long breaths when the train rolled out beyond\nthe houses and the movement of the train created a draught. "Yes,\nkilled," he repeated to himself. And to his imagination appeared with\nunusual vividness the beautiful face of the second dead convict, with\na smile on his lips, the forbidding expression of his forehead, and\nthe small, strong ear under the shaved, bluish scalp. "And the worst\npart of it is that he was killed, and no one knows who killed him. Yet\nhe was killed. He was forwarded, like the others, at the order of\nMaslenikoff. Maslenikoff probably signed the usual order with his\nfoolish flourish, on a printed letter-head, and, of course, does not\nconsider himself guilty. The prison physician, who inspected the\nconvicts, has still less reason for considering himself guilty. He\ncarefully fulfilled his duties, separated the weak ones, and could not\npossibly foresee either the terrible heat, or that they would be taken\naway so late and in such a crowd. The inspector? But the inspector\nonly carried out the order that on such a day so many men and women\nprisoners should be sent away. No more guilty was the officer of the\nconvoy, whose duty consisted in receiving so many people at such a\nplace and delivering them at another place. He led the party in the\nusual way, according to instructions, and could not possibly foresee\nthat such strong men, like the two whom Nekhludoff had seen, would\nsuccumb and die. No one was guilty, and yet the men were killed by\nthese very people who were innocent of their death.\n\n"All this happened," thought Nekhludoff, "because all those\npeople--the governor, inspector and the other officers--saw before\nthem, not human beings and their duties toward them, but the service\nand its requirements. Therein lies the difficulty."\n\nIn his meditation Nekhludoff did not notice how the weather had\nchanged. The sun had hidden behind a low strip of cloud, and from the\nsouthern sky a light-gray mass, from which a slanting rain was already\npouring in the distance over the fields and forests, was coming on.\nNow and then a flash of lightning rent the clouds, and the rattle of\nthe train mingled with the rattle of thunder. The clouds came nearer\nand nearer, the slanting drops of rain, driven by the wind, pattered\non the platform of the car and stained Nekhludoff\'s overcoat. He moved\nto the other side, and drawing in the fresh, humid air and the odor of\nthe wheat coming from the parched ground, he looked on the passing\ngardens, forests; the rye fields just turning yellow, the emerald\nstreaks of oats, and the furrows of the dark-green, flowering potato.\nEverything looked as if covered with varnish: the green and yellow\ncolors became brighter; the black became blacker.\n\n"More, more," said Nekhludoff, rejoicing at the reviving fields and\ngardens under the abundant rain.\n\nThe heavy rain did not last long. The clouds partly dissipated, and\nthe last fine shower fell straight on the wet ground. The sun came\nforth again, the earth brightened, and a low but brilliant violet\ntinged rainbow, broken at one end, appeared in the eastern horizon.\n\n"What was I thinking of?" Nekhludoff asked himself, when all these\nchanges of nature came to an end and the train descended into a vale.\n"Yes, I was thinking that all those people--the inspector, the guard\nand all those servants, for the most part gentle, kind people--have\nbecome wicked."\n\nHe recalled the indifference of Maslenikoff when he told the latter of\nwhat was going on in the prison, of the severity of the inspector, the\ncruelty of the sergeant who refused the use of the wagons to the weak\nconvicts and paid no attention to the suffering of the woman in\nchild-birth. All those people were evidently proof against the feeling\nof sympathy, "as is this paved ground against rain," he thought,\nlooking at the incline paved with multi-colored stone, from which the\nwater streamed off. "May be it is necessary to lay the stones on the\nincline, but it is sad to see the soil deprived of vegetation when it\ncould be made to grow grain, grass, shrubs and trees like those seen\non those heights. It is the same with people," thought Nekhludoff.\n"The whole trouble lies in that people think that there are conditions\nexcluding the necessity of love in their intercourse with man, but\nsuch conditions do not exist. Things may be treated without love; one\nmay chop wood, make bricks, forge iron without love, but one can no\nmore deal with people without love than one can handle bees without\ncare. The nature of bees is such that if you handle them carelessly\nyou will harm them as well as yourself. It is the same with people.\nAnd it cannot be different, because mutual love is the basic law of\nhuman life. True, man cannot compel himself to love, as he can compel\nhimself to work, but it does not follow from this that in his dealings\nwith men he can leave love out of consideration, especially if he\nwants something from them. If you feel no love for people, then keep\naway from them," Nekhludoff said to himself. "Occupy yourself with\nthings, yourself--anything; only keep away from people. As it is\nharmful to eat except when one is hungry, so is it harmful to have\nintercourse with people when one does not love them. If one permits\nhimself to deal with people without having any love for them, as I did\nyesterday with my brother-in-law, there is no limit to the cruelty and\nbrutality one is liable to display toward others, as I have seen\nto-day, and there is no limit to one\'s own suffering, as I have\nlearned from all the experiences of my own life. Yes, yes, that is\nso," thought Nekhludoff, experiencing the double pleasure of a cool\nbreeze after the intolerable heat, and the consciousness of having\nreached the highest degree of lucidity in the question which had so\nlong occupied him.\n\n\n\n\nPART THIRD.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nThe party of convicts to which Maslova belonged had gone about\nthirty-five hundred miles. It was not until Perm was reached that\nNekhludoff succeeded in obtaining Maslova\'s transfer to the contingent\nof politicals, as he was advised to do by Bogodukhovskaia, who was\namong them.\n\nThe journey to Perm was very burdensome to Maslova, both physically\nand morally--physically because of the crowded condition of their\nquarters, the uncleanliness and disgusting insects, which gave her no\nrest; morally because of the equally loathsome men who, though they\nchanged at every stopping place, were like the insects, always\ninsolent, intrusive and gave her little rest. The cynicism prevailing\namong the convicts and their overseers was such that every woman,\nespecially the young women, had to be on the alert. Maslova was\nparticularly subject to these attacks because of her attractive looks\nand her well-known past. This condition of constant dread and struggle\nwas very burdensome to her. The firm repulse with which she met the\nimpertinent advances of the men was taken by them as an insult and\nexasperated them. Her condition in this respect was somewhat relieved\nby the presence of Theodosia and Tarass, who, learning that his wife\nwas subjected to these insults, had himself included among the\nprisoners, and riding as such from Nijhni, was able to protect her to\nsome extent.\n\nMaslova\'s transfer to the division of the politicals bettered her\nsituation in every respect. Besides the improvement in the quarters,\nfood and treatment, her condition was also made easier by the fact\nthat the persecution of the men ceased and she was no longer reminded\nof her past, which she was so anxious to forget now. The principal\nadvantage of the transfer, however, lay in the acquaintance she made\nof some people who exerted a decisive influence over her.\n\nAt stopping places she was permitted to mingle with the politicals,\nbut, being a strong woman, she was compelled to walk with the other\nprisoners. She thus walked from Tomsk. There were two politicals who\ntraveled on foot with her--Maria Pablovna Stchetinina, the same pretty\ngirl with the sheepish eyes who had attracted Nekhludoff\'s attention\nwhen visiting Bogodukhovskaia, and one Simonson, banished to\nYakoutsk--that same shaggy man with deep-set eyes whom Nekhludoff had\nnoticed on the same occasion. Maria Pablovna walked, because she\nyielded her place on the wagon to a pregnant woman; Simonson, because\nhe would not profit by class advantages. These three started on foot\nwith the other convicts in the early morning, the politicals following\nthem later in wagons. It was at the last stopping place, near a large\ncity, where the party was handed over to another convoy officer.\n\nIt was a chill September morning. Snow and rain fell alternately\nbetween cold blasts of wind. All the prisoners--400 men and 50\nwomen--were already in the court-yard, some crowding around the chief\nofficer of the convoy, who was paying out money to the overseers for\nthe day\'s rations; others were buying food of the hucksters who had\nbeen admitted into the court-yard. There were a din of prisoners\'\nvoices counting money and the shrill conversation of the hucksters.\n\nKatiousha and Maria Pablovna, both in boots and short fur coats and\ngirdled with \'kerchiefs, came into the court-yard from the house and\nwalked toward the hucksters, who were sitting under the northern wall\nand calling out their wares--fresh meat-pies, fish, boiled shred\npaste, buckwheat mush, meat, eggs, milk; one woman even offered\nroasted pig.\n\nSimonson, in rubber jacket and similar galoshes, bound with whip-cord\nover woolen socks (he was a vegetarian and did not use the skin of\nanimals), was also awaiting the departure of the party. He stood near\nthe entrance of the house, writing down in a note-book a thought that\noccurred to him. "If," he wrote, "a bacterium were to observe and\nanalyze the nail of a man, it would declare him an inorganic being.\nSimilarly, from an observation of the earth\'s surface, we declare it\nto be inorganic. That is wrong."\n\nHaving bought eggs, buns, fish and fresh wheat bread, Maslova packed\nthem away in a bag while Maria Pablovna settled for the food, when\namong the prisoners there arose a commotion. Every one became silent,\nand the prisoners began to form into ranks. An officer came forth and\ngave final orders.\n\nEverything proceeded as usual--the prisoners were counted over, the\nchains were examined and men were handcuffed in pairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n\nAfter six years of luxurious and pampered life in the city and two\nmonths in prison among the politicals, her present life,\nnotwithstanding the hard conditions, seemed to Katiousha very\nsatisfactory. The journeys of fifteen or twenty miles on foot between\nstopping places, the food and day\'s rest after two days\' tramp,\nstrengthened her physically, while her association with her new\ncomrades opened up to her new phases of life of which she had formerly\nno conception.\n\nShe was charmed with all her new comrades. But above all, with Maria\nPablovna--nay, she even came to love her with a respectful and\nexulting love. She was struck by the fact that a beautiful girl of a\nrich and noble family, and speaking three languages, should conduct\nherself like a common workingwoman, distribute everything sent her by\nher rich brother, dress herself not only simply, but poorly, and pay\nno attention to her appearance. This entire absence of coquetry\nsurprised and completely captivated Maslova. She saw that Maria\nPablovna knew, and that it even pleased her to know, that she was\npretty, but that so far from rejoicing at the impression she was\nmaking on the men, she only feared it, and rather looked at love with\ndisgust and dread. If her male comrades, who knew her, felt any\nattraction toward her they never showed it. But strangers often\nattempted familiarities with her, and in such cases her great physical\nstrength stood her in good stead. "Once," she laughingly related, "I\nwas approached by a stranger on the street, whom I could not get rid\nof. I then gave him such a shaking up that he ran away in fright."\n\nShe also said that from childhood she had felt an aversion for the\nlife of the gentry, but loved the common folks, and was often chidden\nfor staying in the servants\' quarters, the kitchen and the stable,\ninstead of the parlor.\n\n"But among the cooks and drivers I was always cheerful, while our\nladies and gentlemen used to worry me. Afterward, when I began to\nunderstand, I saw that we were leading a wicked life. I had no mother,\nand I did not like my father. At nineteen I left the house with a girl\nfriend and went to work in a factory," she said.\n\nFrom the factory she went to the country, then returned to the city,\nwhere she was arrested and sentenced to hard labor. Maria Pablovna\nnever related it herself, but Katiousha learned from others that she\nwas sentenced to hard labor because she assumed the guilt of another.\n\nSince Katiousha came to know her she saw that Maria Pablovna,\neverywhere and under all circumstances, never thought of herself, but\nwas always occupied in helping some one else. One of her present\ncomrades, jesting, said of her that she had given herself up to the\nsport of charity. And that was true. Like a sportsman looking for\ngame, her entire activity consisted in finding occasion for serving\nothers. And this sport became a habit with her, her life\'s aim. And\nshe did it so naturally that all those that knew her ceased to\nappreciate it, and demanded it as by right.\n\nWhen Maslova entered their ranks, Maria Pablovna felt a disgust and\nloathing for her. Katiousha noticed it. But she also noticed afterward\nthat Maria Pablovna, making some effort, became particularly kind and\ngentle toward her. The kindness and gentleness of such an uncommon\nperson so affected Maslova that she gave herself up to her with her\nwhole soul, unconsciously acquired her glance and involuntarily\nimitated her in everything.\n\nThey were also drawn together by that disgust which both felt toward\nphysical love. The one hated it, because she had experienced all the\nhorror of it; the other, because not having experienced it, she looked\nupon it as something strange and at the same time disgusting and\noffensive to human dignity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\nThe influence exerted by Maria Pablovna over Katiousha was due to the\nfact that Katiousha loved Maria Pablovna. There was another\ninfluence--that of Simonson, and that was due to the fact that\nSimonson loved Katiousha.\n\nSimonson decided everything by the light of his reason, and having\nonce decided upon a thing, he never swerved. While yet a student he\nmade up his mind that the wealth of his father, who was an officer of\nthe Commissary Department, was dishonestly accumulated. He then\ndeclared to him that his wealth ought to be returned to the people.\nAnd when he was reprimanded he left the house and refused to avail\nhimself of his father\'s means. Having come to the conclusion that all\nevil can be traced to the people\'s ignorance, he joined the Democrats,\non leaving the university, and obtaining the position of village\nteacher, he boldly preached before his pupils and the peasants that\nwhich he considered to be just, and denounced that which he considered\nunjust and false.\n\nHe was arrested and prosecuted.\n\nDuring the trial he decided that the court had no right to judge him,\nand said so. The judges disagreeing with him and proceeding with the\ntrial, he concluded not to answer their questions and remained silent.\nHe was sentenced to exile in the Government of Archangel. There he\nformulated a religious creed defining all his actions. According to\nthis religious teaching nothing in the world is dead, there is life in\neverything; all those things which we consider dead, inorganic, are\nbut parts of a huge organic body which we cannot embrace, and that, as\na part of a huge organism, man\'s aim should be to conserve the life of\nthat organism and the lives of all its parts. He therefore considered\nit a crime to destroy life; was against war, executions, the killing\nin any manner not only of human beings, but of animals. He also had\nhis theory of marriage, according to which the breeding of people was\nman\'s lower function, his higher function consisting in conserving\nlife already existing. He found confirmation of this idea in the\nexistence of phagocites in the blood. Bachelors, according to him,\nwere the same phagocites whose function was to help the weak, sickly\nparts of the organism. And true to his convictions, he had been\nperforming this function since he became convinced of the truth of the\ntheory, although as a youth he had led a different life. He called\nhimself, as well as Maria Pablovna, a phagocite of the world.\n\nHis love for Katiousha did not violate this theory, since it was\npurely platonic. He assumed that such love not only did not prevent\nhis phagocite activity, but aided it.\n\nAnd it was this man who, falling in love with Katiousha, had a\ndecisive influence over her. With the instincts of a woman, Maslova\nsoon discovered it, and the consciousness that she could arouse the\nfeeling of love in such a remarkable man raised her in her own\nestimation. Nekhludoff offered to marry her out of magnanimity, and\nthe obligation for the past, but Simonson loved her as she was now,\nand loved her simply because he loved her. She felt, besides, that he\nconsidered her an unusual woman, distinguished from all other women,\nand possessing high moral qualities. She did not know exactly what\nthose qualities were, but, at all events, not to deceive him, she\nendeavored with all her power to call forth her best qualities and,\nnecessarily, be as good as she could be.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n\nNekhludoff managed to see Maslova only twice between Nijhni and\nPerm--once in Nijhni while the prisoners were being placed on a\nnet-covered lighter, and again in the office of the Perm prison. On\nboth occasions he found her secretive and unkind. When he asked her\nabout her prison conditions, or whether she wanted anything, she\nbecame confused and answered evasively and, as it seemed to him, with\nthat hostile feeling of reproach which she had manifested before. And\nthis gloomy temper, due only to the persecutions to which she was\nbeing subjected by the men, tormented him.\n\nBut at their very first meeting in Tomsk she became again as she was\nbefore her departure. She no longer frowned or became confused when\nshe saw him, but, on the contrary, met him cheerfully and simply,\nthanking him for what he had done for her, especially for bringing her\nin contact with her present company.\n\nAfter two months of journey from prison to prison, this change also\nmanifested itself in her appearance. She became thin, sun-burnt and\napparently older; wrinkles appeared on her temples and around her\nmouth; she no longer curled her hair on her forehead, but wore a\n\'kerchief on her head, and neither in her dress, coiffure, nor in her\nconduct were there any signs of her former coquetry. And this change\ncalled forth in Nekhludoff a particularly joyous feeling. The feeling\nhe now experienced toward her was unlike any he had experienced\nbefore. It had nothing in common with his first poetic impulse, nor\nwith that sentimental love which he felt afterward, nor even with that\nconsciousness of a duty performed, coupled with self-admiration, which\nimpelled him, after the trial, to resolve on marrying her. It was that\nsame simple feeling of pity and contrition which he experienced at\ntheir first meeting in the prison and afterward, with greater force,\nwhen he conquered his disgust and forgave her conduct with the\nphysician\'s assistant in the hospital (the injustice he had done her\nhad subsequently become plain). It was the same feeling with the\ndifference that, while it was temporary then, now it was permanent.\n\nDuring this period, because of Maslova\'s transfer to the politicals,\nNekhludoff became acquainted with many political prisoners. On closer\nacquaintance he was convinced that they were not all villains, as many\npeople imagined them to be, nor all heroes, as some of them considered\nthe members of their party, but that they were ordinary people, among\nwhom, as in other parties, some were good, some bad, the others\nindifferent.\n\nHe became particularly attached to a consumptive young man who was on\nhis way to a life term at hard labor. The story of the young man was a\nvery short one. His father, a rich Southern landlord, died while he\nwas a child. He was the only son, and was brought up by his mother. He\nwas the best scholar in the university, making his specialty\nmathematics. He was offered a chair in the university and a course\nabroad. But he hesitated. There was a girl of whom he became enamored,\nso he contemplated marriage and political activity. He wished\neverything, but resolved on nothing. At that time his college chums\nasked him for money for a common cause. He knew what that common cause\nwas, and at the time took no interest in it whatever, but from a\nfeeling of fellowship and egoism gave the money, that it might not be\nthought that he was afraid. Those who took the money were arrested; a\nnote was found from which it was learned that the money had been given\nby Kryltzoff. He was arrested, taken to the police station, then to\nthe prison.\n\nAfter his discharge he traveled now South, now to St. Petersburg, then\nabroad, and again to Kieff and to Odessa. He was denounced by a man in\nwhom he placed great faith. He was arrested, tried, kept in prison two\nyears and finally death sentence was imposed on him, but was afterward\ncommuted to hard labor for life.\n\nHe was stricken with consumption while in prison, and under the\npresent circumstances had but a few months to live, and he knew it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nAt last Nekhludoff succeeded in obtaining permission to visit Maslova\nin her cell among the politicals.\n\nWhile passing the dimly-lighted court-yard from the officers\'\nheadquarters to "No. 5," escorted by a messenger, he heard a stir and\nbuzzing of voices coming from the one-story dwelling occupied by the\nprisoners. And when he came nearer and the door was opened, the\nbuzzing increased and turned into a Babel of shouting, cursing and\nlaughing. A rattling of chains was heard, and a familiar noisome air\nwas wafted from the doorway. The din of voices with the rattle of\nchains, and the dreadful odor always produced in Nekhludoff the\ntormenting feeling of some moral nausea, turning into physical\nnausea. These two impressions, mingling, strengthened each other.\n\nThe apartment occupied by the political prisoners consisted of two\nsmall cells, the doors of which opened into the corridor, partitioned\noff from the rest. As Nekhludoff got beyond the partition he noticed\nSimonson feeding a billet of pine wood into the oven.\n\nSpying Nekhludoff he looked up without rising and extended his hand.\n\n"I am glad you came; I want to see you!" he said, with a significant\nglance, looking Nekhludoff straight in the eyes.\n\n"What is it?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"I will tell you later; I am busy now."\n\nAnd Simonson again occupied himself with making the fire, which he did\naccording to his special theory of the greatest conservation of heat\nenergy.\n\nNekhludoff was about to enter the first door when Maslova, broom in\nhand, and sweeping a heap of dirt and dust toward the oven, emerged\nfrom the second door. She wore a white waist and white stockings and\nher skirt was tucked up under the waist. A white \'kerchief covered her\nhead to her very eyebrows. Seeing Nekhludoff, she unbent herself and,\nall red and animated, put aside the broom, and wiping her hands on her\nskirt, she stood still.\n\n"You are putting things in order?" asked Nekhludoff, extending his\nhand.\n\n"Yes, my old occupation," she answered and smiled. "There is such dirt\nhere; there is no end to our cleaning."\n\n"Well, is the plaid dry?" she turned to Simonson.\n\n"Almost," said Simonson, glancing at her in a manner which struck\nNekhludoff as very peculiar.\n\n"Then I will fetch the furs to dry. All our people are there," she\nsaid to Nekhludoff, going to the further room and pointing to the\nnearest door.\n\nNekhludoff opened the door and walked into a small cell, dimly lighted\nby a little metallic lamp standing on a low bunk. The cell was cold\nand there was an odor of dust, dampness and tobacco. The tin lamp\nthrew a bright light on those around it, but the bunks were in the\nshade and vacillating shadows moved along the walls. In the small\nroom were all the prisoners, except two men who had gone for boiling\nwater and provisions. There was an old acquaintance of Nekhludoff, the\nyellow-faced and thin Vera Efremovna, with her large, frightened eyes\nand a big vein on her forehead. She was sitting nervously rolling\ncigarettes from a heap of tobacco lying on a newspaper in front of\nher.\n\nIn the far corner there was also Maria Pablovna.\n\n"How opportune your coming! How you seen Katia?" she asked Nekhludoff.\n\nThere was also Anatolie Kryltzoff. Pale and wasted, his legs crossed\nunder him, bending forward and shivering, he sat in the far corner,\nhis hands hidden in the sleeves of his fur jacket, and with feverish\neyes looked at Nekhludoff. Nekhludoff was about to approach him, but\nto the right of the entrance, sorting something in a bag and talking\nto the pretty and smiling Grabetz, sat a man with curly red hair, in a\nrubber jacket and with spectacles. His name was Novodvoroff, and\nNekhludoff hastened to greet him. Of all political prisoners,\nNekhludoff liked him best. Novodvoroff glanced over his spectacles at\nNekhludoff and, frowning, he extended his thin hand.\n\n"Well, are you enjoying your journey?" he said, evidently in irony.\n\n"Yes, there are many interesting things," answered Nekhludoff,\npretending not to see the irony, and treating it as a civility. Then\nhe went over to Kryltzoff. In appearance Nekhludoff seemed to be\nindifferent, but in reality he was far from being so to Novodvoroff.\nThese words of Novodvoroff, and his evident desire to say something\nunpleasant, jarred upon his kindly sentiments, and he became gloomy\nand despondent.\n\n"Well, how is your health?" he said, pressing Kryltzoff\'s cold and\ntrembling hand.\n\n"Pretty fair, only I cannot get warm; I am all wet," said Kryltzoff,\nhastily hiding his hand in the sleeve of his coat. "Those windows are\nbroken." He pointed to the windows behind the iron gratings. "Why did\nyou not come before?"\n\nExpecting to have a private conversation with Katiousha, Nekhludoff\nsat conversing with Kryltzoff. Kryltzoff listened attentively, fixedly\ngazing at Nekhludoff.\n\n"Yes," he said, suddenly, "I have often thought that we were going\ninto exile with those very people on account of whom we were banished.\nAnd yet we not only do not know them, but do not wish to know them.\nAnd, worse of all, they hate us and consider us their enemies. This is\ndreadful."\n\n"There is nothing dreadful about it," said Novodvoroff, overhearing\nthe conversation. "The masses are always churlish and ignorant."\n\nAt that moment there was an outburst of curses behind the partition\nwall, followed by a jostling and banging against walls, a clatter of\nchains, screaming and shouting. Some one was being beaten; some one\nshouted "Help!"\n\n"See those beasts! What have they in common with us?" calmly asked\nNovodvoroff.\n\n"You call them beasts, but you should have heard Nekhludoff telling of\nthe conduct of one of them," Kryltzoff said excitedly.\n\n"You are sentimental!" Novodvoroff said, ironically. "It is hard for\nus to understand the emotions of these people and the motives of their\nacts. Where you see magnanimity, there may only be envy."\n\n"Why is it you do not wish to see good in others?" said Maria\nPablovna, suddenly becoming excited.\n\n"I cannot see that which does not exist."\n\n"How can you say it does not exist when a man risks a terrible death?"\n\n"I think," said Novodvoroff, "that if we wish to serve our cause\neffectively it is necessary that we stop dreaming and look at things\nas they are. We must do everything for the masses, and expect nothing\nfrom them. The masses are the object of our activity, but they cannot\nbe our collaborators while they are as inert as they are now. And it\nis, therefore, perfectly illusive to expect aid from them before they\nhave gone through the process of development--that process of\ndevelopment for which we are preparing them."\n\n"What process of development?" said Kryltzoff, becoming red in the\nface. "We say that we are against the use of force, but is this not\nforce in its worst form?"\n\n"There is no force here," calmly said Novodvoroff. "I only said that\nI know the path the people must follow, and can point it out."\n\n"But how do you know that yours is the right path? Is it not the same\ndespotism which gave rise to the Inquisition and the executions of the\nGreat Revolution? They, too, knew the only scientific path."\n\n"The fact that people erred does not prove that I am erring. Besides,\nthere is a great difference between the ravings of ideologists and the\ndata of positive economic science."\n\nNovodvoroff\'s voice filled the entire cell. He alone was speaking; all\nthe others were silent.\n\n"Those eternal discussions!" said Maria Pablovna at a momentary lull.\n\n"And what do you think of it?" Nekhludoff asked Maria Pablovna.\n\n"I think that Anatolie is right--that we have no right to force our\nideas on the people."\n\n"That is a strange conception of our ideas," said Novodvoroff, and he\nbegan to smoke angrily.\n\n"I cannot talk to them," Kryltzoff said in a whisper, and became\nsilent.\n\n"And it is much better not to talk," said Nekhludoff.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\nAn officer entered the cell and announced that the time for departing\nhad arrived. He counted every prisoner, pointing at every one with his\nfinger. When he reached Nekhludoff he said, familiarly:\n\n"It is too late to remain now, Prince; it is time to go."\n\nNekhludoff, knowing what that meant, approached him and thrust three\nrubles into his hand.\n\n"Nothing can be done with you--stay here a while longer."\n\nSimonson, who was all the while silently sitting on his bunk, his\nhands clasped behind his head, firmly arose, and carefully making his\nway through those sitting around the bunk, went over to Nekhludoff.\n\n"Can you hear me now?" asked Simonson.\n\n"Certainly," said Nekhludoff, also rising to follow him.\n\nMaslova saw Nekhludoff rising, and their eyes meeting, she turned red\nin the face and doubtfully, as it seemed, shook her head.\n\n"My business with you is the following," began Simonson, when they\nreached the corridor. "Knowing your relations toward Catherine\nMichaelovna," and he looked straight into Nekhludoff\'s face, "I\nconsider it my duty----" But at the very door two voices were shouting\nat the same time.\n\n"I tell you, heathen, they are not mine," shouted one voice.\n\n"Choke yourself, you devil!" the other said, hoarsely.\n\nAt that moment Maria Pablovna entered the corridor.\n\n"You cannot talk here," she said. "Walk in here; only Verotchka is\nthere." And she opened the door of a tiny cell, evidently intended for\nsolitary confinement, and now at the disposal of the political\nprisoners. On one of the bunks lay Vera Efremovna, with her head\ncovered.\n\n"She is ill and asleep; she cannot hear you, and I will go," said\nMaria Pablovna.\n\n"On the contrary, stay here," said Simonson. "I keep nothing secret,\nespecially from you."\n\n"Very well," said Maria Pablovna, and childishly moving her whole body\nfrom side to side, and thus getting into a snug corner of the bunks,\nshe prepared to listen, at the same time looking somewhere in the\ndistance with her beautiful, sheepish eyes.\n\n"Well, then, knowing your relations toward Catherine Michaelovna, I\nconsider it my duty to let you know my relations to her."\n\n"Well, go on," said Nekhludoff, involuntarily admiring Simonson\'s\nsimplicity and straightforwardness.\n\n"I wished to tell you that I would like to marry Catherine\nMichaelovna----"\n\n"Remarkable!" exclaimed Maria Pablovna, fixing her gaze on Simonson.\n\n"And I have decided to ask her to be my wife," continued Simonson.\n\n"What, then, can I do? It depends on her," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Yes; but she would not decide the matter without you."\n\n"Why?"\n\n"Because, while the question of your relations remains undecided, she\ncannot choose."\n\n"On my part the question is definitely decided. I only wished to do\nthat which I considered it my duty to do, and also to relieve her\ncondition, but in no case did I intend to influence her choice."\n\n"Yes; but she does not wish your sacrifice."\n\n"There is no sacrifice."\n\n"And I also know that her decision is irrevocable."\n\n"Why, then, talk to me?" said Nekhludoff.\n\n"It is necessary for her that you should also approve of it."\n\n"I can only say that I am not free, but she is free to do what she\nwishes."\n\nSimonson began to ponder.\n\n"Very well, I will tell her so. Do not think that I am in love with\nher," he continued. "I admire her as a good, rare person who has\nsuffered much. I wish nothing from her, but I would very much like to\nhelp her, to relieve her----"\n\nSimonson\'s trembling voice surprised Nekhludoff.\n\n"To relieve her condition," continued Simonson. "If she does not wish\nto accept your help, let her accept mine. If she consented, I would\nask permission to join her in prison. Four years is not an eternity. I\nwould live near her, and perhaps lighten her fate----" His emotion again\ncompelled him to stop.\n\n"What can I say?" said Nekhludoff. "I am glad that she has found such\na protector."\n\n"That is just what I wanted to know," continued Simonson. "I wished to\nknow whether you, loving her and seeking her good, could approve of\nher marrying me?"\n\n"Oh, yes," Nekhludoff answered, decisively.\n\n"It is all for her; all I wish is that that woman, who had suffered so\nmuch, should have some rest," said Simonson, with a childlike\ngentleness that no one would expect from a man of such gloomy aspect.\n\nSimonson rose, took Nekhludoff\'s hand, smiled bashfully and embraced\nhim.\n\n"Well, I will so tell her," he said, and left the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n\n"What do you think of him?" said Maria Pablovna. "In love, and\nearnestly in love! I never thought that Vladimir Simonson could fall\nin love in such a very stupid, childish fashion. It is remarkable, and\nto tell the truth, sad," she concluded, sighing.\n\n"But Katia? How do you think she will take it?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"She?" Maria Pablovna stopped, evidently desiring to give a precise\nanswer. "She? You see, notwithstanding her past, she is naturally of a\nmost moral character. And her feelings are so refined. She loves\nyou--very much so--and is happy to be able to do you the negative good\nof not binding you to herself. Marriage with you would be a dreadful\nfall to her, worse than all her past. For this reason she would never\nconsent to it. At the same time, your presence perplexes her."\n\n"Ought I then to disappear?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\nMaria Pablovna smiled in her pleasant, childish way.\n\n"Yes, partly."\n\n"How can I partly disappear?"\n\n"I take it back. But I will tell you that she probably sees the\nabsurdity of that exalted love of his (he has not spoken to her about\nit), is flattered by it, and fears it. You know that I am not\ncompetent in these matters, but I think that his love is that of the\nordinary man, although it is masked. He says that it rouses his energy\nand that it is a platonic love; but it has nothing but nastiness for\nits basis."\n\n"But what am I to do?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"I think it is best that you have a talk with her. It is always better\nto make everything clear. Shall I call her?" said Maria Pablovna.\n\n"If you please," answered Nekhludoff, and Maria Pablovna went out.\n\nNekhludoff was seized with a strange feeling when, alone in the small\ncell, he listened to the quiet breathing of Vera Efremovna,\ninterrupted by an occasional moan, and the constant din coming from\nthe cells of the convicts.\n\nThat which Simonson had told him freed him from his self-imposed\nobligation, which, in a moment of weakness, seemed to him burdensome\nand dreadful; and yet it was not only unpleasant, but painful. The\noffer of Simonson destroyed the exclusiveness of his act, minimized in\nhis own and other people\'s eyes the value of the sacrifice he was\nmaking. If such a good man as Simonson, who was under no obligation to\nher, wished to join his fate to hers, then his own sacrifice was no\nlonger so important. Maybe there was also the ordinary feeling of\njealousy; he was so used to her love that he could not think that she\nwas capable of loving any one else. Besides, his plans were now\nshattered, especially the plan of living near her while she served her\nsentence. If she married Simonson, his presence was no longer\nnecessary, and that required a rearrangement of his projects. He could\nscarcely collect his thoughts, when Katiousha entered the cell.\n\nWith quick step she approached him.\n\n"Maria Pablovna sent me," she said, stopping near him.\n\n"Yes, I would like to talk with you. Take a seat. Vladimir Ivanovitch\nspoke to me."\n\nShe seated herself, crossed her hands on her knees, and seemed calm.\nBut as soon as Nekhludoff pronounced Simonson\'s name, her face turned\na purple color.\n\n"What did he tell you?" she asked.\n\n"He told me that he wishes to marry you."\n\nHer face suddenly became wrinkled, evidencing suffering, but she\nremained silent, only looking at the floor.\n\n"He asked my consent or advice. I told him that it all rests with you;\nthat you must decide."\n\n"Oh, what is it all for?" she said, and looked at Nekhludoff with that\nsquinting glance that always peculiarly affected him. For a few\nseconds they looked silently at each other. That glance was\nsignificant to both.\n\n"You must decide," repeated Nekhludoff.\n\n"Decide what?" she said. "It has all been decided long ago. It is you\nwho must decide whether you will accept the offer of Vladimir\nIvanovitch," she continued, frowning.\n\n"But if a pardon should come?" said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Oh, leave me alone. It is useless to talk any more," she answered,\nand, rising, left the cell.\n\nGaining the street, Nekhludoff stopped, and, expanding his chest, drew\nin the frosty air.\n\nThe following morning a soldier brought him a note from Maria\nPablovna, in which she said that Kryltzoff\'s condition was worse than\nthey thought it to be.\n\n"At one time we intended to remain here with him, but they would not\nallow it. So we are taking him with us, but we fear the worst. Try to\nso arrange in town that if he is left behind some one of us shall\nremain with him. If it is necessary for that purpose that I should\nmarry him, then, of course, I am ready to do it."\n\nNekhludoff obtained horses and hastened to catch up with the party of\nprisoners. He stopped his team near the wagon carrying Kryltzoff on a\nbed of hay and pillows. Beside Kryltzoff sat Maria Pablovna.\nKryltzoff, in a fur coat and lambskin cap, seemed thinner and more\npale than before. His beautiful eyes seemed particularly larger and\nsparkling. Weakly rolling from side to side from the jostling of the\nwagon, he steadily looked at Nekhludoff, and in answer to questions\nabout his health, he only closed his eyes and angrily shook his head.\nIt required all his energy to withstand the jostling of the wagon.\nMaria Pablovna exchanged glances with Nekhludoff, expressing\napprehension concerning Kryltzoff\'s condition.\n\n"The officer seems to have some shame in him," she shouted, so as to\nbe heard above the rattling of the wheels. "He removed the handcuffs\nfrom Bouzovkin, who is now carrying his child. With him are Katia,\nSimonson and, in my place, Verotchka."\n\nKryltzoff, pointing at Maria Pablovna, said something which could not,\nhowever, be heard. Nekhludoff leaned over him in order to hear him.\nThen Kryltzoff removed the handkerchief, which was tied around his\nmouth, and whispered:\n\n"Now I am better. If I could only keep from catching cold."\n\nNekhludoff nodded affirmatively and glanced at Maria Pablovna.\n\n"Have you received my note, and will you do it?" asked Maria Pablovna.\n\n"Without fail," said Nekhludoff, and seeing the dissatisfied face of\nKryltzoff, went over to his own team, climbed into the wagon, and\nholding fast to the sides of it, drove along the line of gray-coated\nand fettered prisoners which stretched for almost a mile.\n\nNekhludoff crossed the river to a town, and his driver took him to a\nhotel, where, notwithstanding the poor appointments, he found a\nmeasure of comfort entirely wanting in the inns of his stopping\nplaces. He took a bath, dressed himself in city clothes and drove to\nthe governor of the district. He alighted at a large, handsome\nbuilding, in front of which stood a sentry and a policeman.\n\nThe general was ill, and did not receive. Nekhludoff, nevertheless,\nasked the porter to take his card to the general, and the porter\nreturned with a favorable answer:\n\n"You are asked to step in."\n\nThe vestibule, the porter, the messenger, the shining floor of the\nhall--everything reminded him of St. Petersburg, only it was somewhat\ndirtier and more majestic. Nekhludoff was admitted to the cabinet.\n\nThe general, bloated, with a potato nose and prominent bumps on his\nforehead, hairless pate and bags under his eyes, a man of sanguine\ntemperament, was reclining in a silk morning gown, and with a\ncigarette in his hand, was drinking tea from a silver saucer.\n\n"How do you do, sir? Excuse my receiving you in a morning gown; it is\nbetter than not receiving at all," he said, covering his stout,\nwrinkled neck with the collar of his gown. "I am not quite well, and\ndo not go out. What brought you into these wilds?"\n\n"I was following a party of convicts, among whom is a person near to\nme," said Nekhludoff. "And now I come to see Your Excellency about\nthat person, and also another affair."\n\nThe general inhaled the smoke of his cigarette, took a sip of tea,\nplaced his cigarette in a malachite ash-holder, and steadily gazing\nwith his watery, shining eyes at Nekhludoff, listened gravely. He only\ninterrupted Nekhludoff to ask him if he wished to smoke.\n\nNekhludoff told the general that the person in whom he was interested\nwas a woman, that she was unjustly convicted, and that His Majesty\'s\nclemency had been appealed to.\n\n"Yes. Well?" said the general.\n\n"I was promised in St. Petersburg that the news of this woman\'s fate\nwould be sent to this place not later than this month."\n\nLooking steadily at Nekhludoff, the general asked:\n\n"Anything else?"\n\n"My second request would be concerning the political prisoner who is\ngoing to Siberia with this detachment."\n\n"Is that so?" said the general.\n\n"He is very sick--he is a dying man. And he will probably be left here\nin the hospital; for this reason one of the female prisoners would\nlike to remain with him."\n\n"Is she a relative of his?"\n\n"No. But she wishes to marry him, if it will allow her to stay with\nhim."\n\nThe general looked sharply at Nekhludoff from his shining eyes, and,\nsmoking continually, he kept silence, as if wishing to confound his\ncompanion.\n\nWhen Nekhludoff had finished he took a book from the table, and\nfrequently wetting the fingers with which he turned the leaves, he\nlighted on the chapter treating of marriage and perused it.\n\n"What\'s her sentence?" he asked, lifting his eyes from the book.\n\n"Hers? Hard labor."\n\n"If this is the case, the sentence cannot be changed by marriage."\n\n"But----"\n\n"I beg your pardon! If a free man would marry her she would have to\nserve her sentence all the same. Whose sentence is harder, his or\nhers?"\n\n"Both are sentenced to hard labor."\n\n"So they are quits," the general said, laughing. "An equal share for\nboth of them. He may be left here on account of his sickness," he\ncontinued, "and, of course, everything will be done to ameliorate his\ncondition, but she, even if she should marry him, cannot remain here.\nAnyhow, I will think it over. What are their names? Write them down\nhere."\n\nNekhludoff did as he was asked.\n\n"And this I cannot do either," said the general, concerning his\nrequest to see the patient. "Of course I don\'t suspect you, but you\nare interested in them and in others. You have money, and the people\nhere are corrupt. How, then, is it possible for me to watch a person\nwho is five thousand miles distant from me? There he is king, as I am\nhere," and he began to laugh. "You have surely seen the political\nprisoners. You have surely given them money," he added, smiling.\n"Isn\'t it so?"\n\n"Yes, it is true."\n\n"I understand that you must act in this way. You want to see the\npolitical prisoner, and you all sorrow for him, and the soldier on\nguard will surely take money, because he has a family, and his salary\namounts to something less than nothing; he cannot afford to refuse. I\nwould do the same were I in yours or his place. But, being situated as\nI am now, I cannot permit myself to disobey one iota of the law, for\nthe very reason that I, too, am no more than a man, and am liable to\nyield to pity. They confide in me under certain conditions, and I, by\nmy actions, must prove that I am trustworthy. So this question is\nsettled. Well, now tell me what is going on at the metropolis?"\n\nThen the general put various questions, as if he would like to learn\nsome news.\n\n"Well, tell me now whom you are stopping with--at Duke\'s? It is\nunpleasant there. Come to us to dinner," he said, finally, dismissing\nNekhludoff, "at five. Do you speak English?"\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"Well, that is good. You see, there is an English traveler here. He is\nstudying the exile system, and the prisons in Siberia. So he will dine\nwith us, and you come, too. We dine at five, and madam wants us to be\npunctual. I will let you know what will be done with that woman, and\nalso with the patient. Maybe it will be possible to leave somebody\nwith him."\n\nHaving taken leave of the general, Nekhludoff drove to the\npostoffice. Receiving his mail, he walked up to a wooden bench, on\nwhich a soldier was sitting, probably waiting for something; he sat\ndown beside him, and started to look through the letters. Among them\nhe found a registered letter in a beautiful, large envelope, with a\nlarge seal of red wax on it. He tore open the envelope, and, seeing a\nletter from Selenin with some official document, he felt the blood\nmounting to his cheeks, and his heart grow weak. This document was the\ndecision concerning Katiousha\'s trial. What was it? Was it possible\nthat it contained a refusal? Nekhludoff hastily ran over the letter,\nwritten in small, hardly legible, broken handwriting, and breathed\nfreely. The decision was a favorable one.\n\n"Dear friend," wrote Selenin, "our last conversation made a strong\nimpression upon me. You were right concerning Maslova. I have looked\nthrough the accusation. This could be corrected only through the\nCommission for Petitions, to which you sent your petition. They let me\nhave a copy of the pardon, and here I send it to you, to the address\nwhich the Countess Catherine Ivanovna gave me. I press your hand in\nfriendship."\n\nThe news was pleasant and important. All that Nekhludoff could wish\nfor Katiousha and himself was realized. True, those changes in his\nlife changed his relations to her. But now, he thought, all that was\nmost important was to see her as quick as possible and bring her the\ngood news of her freedom. He thought that the copy he had in his hand\nwas sufficient for that. So he bade the cabman drive at once to the\nprison.\n\nThe superintendent of the prison told him that he could not admit him\nwithout a permit from the general. The copy of the petition from their\nmajesty\'s bureau also did not prevail with the superintendent. He\npositively refused admittance. He also refused to admit him to see\nKryltzoff.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\nAfter the disappointment at the prison, Nekhludoff drove down to the\nGovernor\'s Bureau to find out whether they had received there any news\nconcerning the pardon of Maslova. There was no news there, so he drove\nback to his hotel, and wrote at once to the lawyer and to Selenin\nconcerning it. Having finished the letters, he glanced at his watch;\nit was already time to go to the general.\n\nOn the way he thought again of how he might hand over the pardon to\nKatiousha; of the place she would be sent to, and how he would live\nwith her.\n\nAt dinner in the general\'s house all were not only very friendly to\nNekhludoff, but, as it seemed, very favorably inclined to him, as he\nwas a new, interesting personality. The general, who came in to dinner\nwith a white cross on his breast, greeted Nekhludoff like an old\nfriend. On the general\'s inquiry as to what he had done since he saw\nhim in the morning, Nekhludoff answered that he had been at the\npostoffice, that he had found out the facts concerning the pardoning\nof the person they were talking of in the morning, and he asked\npermission to visit her.\n\nThe general seemed displeased, began to frown and said nothing.\n\n"Will you have some whisky?" he said in French to the Englishman who\nhad walked up to him. The Englishman took some, and related that he\nhad been to see the cathedral of the city, and the factory, and\nexpressed the desire to see the great jail in which criminals were\nconfined on their way to Siberia.\n\n"This idea is excellent!" exclaimed the general, turning to\nNekhludoff. "You may go together. Give them a pass!" he added, turning\nto his lieutenant.\n\n"What time do you wish to go?" Nekhludoff asked the Englishman.\n\n"I prefer to visit prisons in the evening," the Englishman replied.\n"All are then at home, and there are no preparations."\n\nAfter dinner, Nekhludoff followed her into the ante-chamber, where\nthe Englishman was already waiting for him to visit the prison, as\nthey had agreed. Having taken leave of the whole family, he walked\nout, followed by the Englishman.\n\nThe sombre looking prison, the soldier on guard, the lantern behind\nthe gate, notwithstanding the pure white layer of snow which had\ncovered everything--the sidewalk, the roof and the walls--made a\ngloomy impression. The proud looking superintendent, walking out to\nthe gate and glancing at Nekhludoff\'s pass in the light of the\nlantern, shrugged his broad shoulders, but obeyed the order and\ninvited the visitors to follow him. He first led them to the yard, and\nthen to a door on the right hand and up the stairs leading to the\noffice. Offering them seats, he asked them in what way he could serve\nthem, and learning from Nekhludoff that he wished to see Maslova, he\nsent the jailer for her and prepared himself to answer the questions\nwhich the Englishman wished to ask him, before going to the cell.\n\nNekhludoff translated the Englishman\'s questions. While they were\nconversing they heard approaching footsteps, the door opened and the\njailer entered, followed by Katiousha in her prison garb, with a scarf\ntied around her head.\n\nNekhludoff rose and made a few steps toward her. She said nothing, but\nher excited expression surprised him. Her face was lit up with a\nwonderful decision. He had never seen her look like that. Now the\nblood rushed to her face, and now she turned pale; now her fingers\ntwisted convulsively the edges of her jacket, now she looked at him,\nand now she dropped her eyes.\n\n"You know what I called you for?" asked Nekhludoff.\n\n"Yes, he told me. But now I am decided. I will ask permission to go\nwith Vladimir Ivanovitch." She said this quickly, as if she had made\nup her mind before what to say.\n\n"How with Vladimir Ivanovitch?" asked Nekhludoff. But she interrupted\nhim.\n\n"But if he wants me to live with him?" Here she stopped in fear, and\nadded, "I mean to stay with him. I could expect nothing better, and\nperhaps I may be useful to him and others. What difference does it\nmake to me?"\n\nOne of the two things had happened--either she had fallen in love\nwith Simonson and did not wish his sacrifice, which weighed so heavily\non him, or she was still in love with Nekhludoff and renounced him for\nhis own good, burning all bridges behind her, and throwing her\nfortunes in the same scale with those of Simonson. Nekhludoff\nunderstood it, and felt ashamed.\n\n"If you are in love with him," he said.\n\n"I never knew such people, you know. It is impossible not to love\nthem. And Vladimir is entirely unlike any person I have ever known."\n\n"Yes, certainly," said Nekhludoff. "He is an excellent man, and I\nthink----"\n\nHere she interrupted him, as if she were afraid that he would speak\ntoo much, or she would not say everything.\n\n"You will forgive me for doing that which you did not wish. You, too,\nmust love."\n\nShe said the very thing that he had just said to himself.\n\nBut now he was no longer thinking so, but felt altogether different.\nHe felt not only shame, but pity.\n\n"Is it possible that all is at an end between us?" he said.\n\n"Yes, it looks like it," she answered, with a strange smile.\n\n"But nevertheless I would like to be useful to you."\n\n"To us," she said, glancing at Nekhludoff. "We don\'t need anything. I\nam very much obliged to you. If it were not for you"--she wished to\nsay something, but her voice began to tremble.\n\n"I don\'t know which of us is under greater obligation to the other.\nGod will settle our accounts," said Nekhludoff.\n\n"Yes, God will settle them," she whispered.\n\n"Are you ready?" asked the Englishman.\n\n"Directly," answered Nekhludoff, and then he inquired of her what she\nknew of Kryltzoff.\n\nShe quieted down and calmly told him:\n\n"Kryltzoff became very weak on the road and was taken to the hospital.\nMaria Pablovna wanted to become a nurse, but there is no answer yet."\n\n"Well, may I go?" she asked, noticing the Englishman who was waiting\nfor him.\n\n"I am not yet taking leave of you," said Nekhludoff, holding out his\nhand to her.\n\n"Pardon me," she said in a low tone.\n\nTheir eyes met, and in that strange, stern look, and in that pitiful\nsmile, with which she said not "good-by," but "pardon me," Nekhludoff\nunderstood, that of the two suppositions concerning her decision the\nlatter was the right one. She still loved him and thought she would\nmar his life by a union with him, and would free him by living with\nSimonson.\n\nShe pressed his hand, turned quickly, and left the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n\nPassing through the hall and the ill-smelling corridors, the\nsuperintendent passed into the first building of the prison in which\nthose condemned to hard labor were confined. Entering the first room\nin that building they found the prisoners stretched on their berths,\nwhich occupied the middle of the room. Hearing the visitors enter they\nall jumped down, and, clinking their chains, placed themselves beside\ntheir berths, while their half-shaven heads were distinctly set off\nagainst the gloom of the prison. Only two of the prisoners remained at\ntheir places. One of them was a young man whose face was evidently\nheated with fever; the other was an old man, who never left off\ngroaning.\n\nThe Englishman asked whether the young man had been sick for a long\ntime. The superintendent replied that he had been taken sick that very\nsame morning, that the old man had had convulsions for a long time,\nand that they kept him in prison because there was no place for him in\nthe hospital.\n\nThe Englishman shook his head discontentedly, said that he would like\nto say a few words to the prisoners, and asked Nekhludoff to translate\nhis remarks. It turned out that, besides the aim of his journey, which\nwas the description of the exile system--he had another one--the\npreaching of the gospel, of salvation through faith.\n\n"Tell them that Christ pitied and loved them," he said to Nekhludoff,\n"and that He died for them. He who will believe in Him will be saved."\n\nWhile he was saying this, all the prisoners were standing erect with\ntheir hands by their sides.\n\n"Tell them," continued the Englishman, "that all I said will be found\nin this book. Are there any among them who can read?" It turned out\nthat there were more than twenty who could.\n\nThe Englishman took out a few leather-bound Bibles from his traveling\nbag, and soon a number of muscular hands, terminating in long black\nnails, were stretched out toward him, pushing each other aside in\norder to reach the Testaments. He left two Testaments in this room,\nand went to the next one.\n\nThere the same thing occurred. There prevailed the same dampness and\nill-smells. But in this room, between the windows, an image of the\nVirgin, before which a small lamp burned dimly, was hung up. To the\nleft side of the door stood the large vat. Here the prisoners were\nstretched out on their berths, and in the same way they rose and\nplaced themselves in a row. Three of them remained in their places.\nTwo of these three lifted themselves and sat up, but the third one\nremained stretched out, and did not even look at the visitors. These\nlatter ones were sick. The Englishman addressed them in the same\nmanner, and left two Testaments.\n\nFrom the cells in which those condemned to hard labor were imprisoned,\nthey passed over to the cells of the exiles, and finally those in\nwhich the relatives who escorted the prisoners to Siberia were\nawaiting the day appointed to start hence.\n\nEverywhere the same cold, hungry, idling, sickly, degraded, brutalized\nhuman beings could be seen.\n\nThe Englishman distributed his Bibles, and, being tired out, he walked\nthrough the rooms saying "All right" to whatever the superintendent\ntold him concerning the prisons.\n\nThey went out into the corridor.\n\nThe Englishman, pointing to an open door, asked what that room was\nfor.\n\n"This is the prison morgue."\n\n"Oh!" exclaimed the Englishman, and he expressed a desire to enter.\nThis room was an ordinary room. A small lamp, fastened to the wall,\nlit up the four bodies which were stretched on berths, with their\nheads toward the wall and the feet protruding toward the door. The\nfirst body, in a plain shirt, was that of a tall young man, with a\nsmall, pointed beard and half-shaven head. The corpse was already\nchilled, and its blue hands were folded over the breast. Beside him,\nin a white dress and jacket, lay a bare-footed old woman, with thin\nhair and wrinkled, yellowish face. Beside this old woman lay a corpse,\nattired in blue.\n\nThis color recalled something in Nekhludoff\'s memory.\n\n"And who is this third one?" he asked, mistrusting his own eyesight.\n\n"This one is a gentleman who was sent hither from the hospital,"\nreplied the superintendent.\n\nNekhludoff walked up to the body and touched the icy cold feet of\nKryltzoff.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n\nNekhludoff, after parting with the Englishman, went straight to his\nhotel, and walked about his room for a long time. The affair with\nKatiousha was at an end. There was something ugly in the very memory\nof it. But it was not that which grieved him. Some other affair of his\nwas yet unsettled--an affair which tortured him and required his\nattention. In his imagination rose the gloomy scenes of the hundreds\nand thousands of human beings pent up in the pestiferous air. The\nlaughter of the prisoners resounded in his ears. He saw again among\nthe dead bodies the beautiful, angry, waxen face of the dead\nKryltzoff; and the question whether he was mad, or all those who\ncommit those evils and think themselves wise were mad, bore in upon\nhis mind with renewed power, and he found no answer to it. The\nprincipal difficulty consisted in finding an answer to the principal\nquestion, which was: What should be done with those who became\nbrutalized in the struggle for life?\n\nWhen he became tired walking about the room he sat down on the\nlounge, close by the lamp, and mechanically opened the Bible which the\nEnglishman had presented him, and which he had thrown on the table\nwhile emptying his pockets. They say, he thought, that this Bible\ncontains the solution to all questions. So, opening it, he began to\nread at the place at which it opened itself--Matt. x., 8. After a\nwhile he inclined close to the lamp and became like one petrified. An\nexultation, the like of which he had not experienced for a long time,\ntook possession of his soul, as though, after long suffering and\nweariness, he found at last liberty and rest. He did not sleep the\nwhole night. As is the case with many who read the Bible for the first\ntime, he now, on reading it again, grasped the full meaning of words\nwhich he had known long ago, but which he had not understood before.\nLike a sponge that absorbs everything, so he absorbed everything that\nwas important, necessary and joyful.\n\n"That is the principal thing," thought Nekhludoff. "We all live in the\nsilly belief that we ourselves are the lords of our world, that this\nworld has been given us for our enjoyment. But this is evidently\nuntrue. Somebody must have sent us here for some reason. And for this\nreason it is plain that we will suffer like those laborers suffer who\ndo not fulfill the wishes of their Master. The will of the Lord is\nexpressed in the teachings of Christ. Let man obey Him, and the\nKingdom of the Lord will come on earth, and man will derive the\ngreatest possible good.\n\n"_Seek the truth and the Kingdom of God, and the rest will come of\nitself._ We seek that which is to come, and do not find it, and not\nonly do we not build the Kingdom of God, but we destroy it.\n\n"So this will henceforth be the task of my life!"\n\nAnd indeed, from that night a new life began for Nekhludoff; not so\nmuch because he had risen into a new stage of existence, but because\nall that had happened to him till then assumed for him an altogether\nnew meaning.\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIBER\'S NOTES:\n(Not part of the original book.)\n\nBelow are listed the spelling inconsistencies in the names of certain\ncharacters.
