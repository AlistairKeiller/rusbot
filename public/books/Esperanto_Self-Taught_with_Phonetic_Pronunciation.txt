His was the rare gift of vitalization: the\nability to breathe life into word-people which survives in them so\nlong as there is any one left to turn up the pages they have made\ntheir abode.\n\nIn the world of writing, many terms that should be illuminative have\nbecome meaningless. So often has the barren been called "pregnant,"\nthe chill of death "the breath of life," the atrophied "pulsating,"\nthat when we really come upon a work with beating heart we find it\ndifficult to give it place that has not already been stuffed to\nsuffocation with misplaced dummies.\n\nWe seat it at table with staring wax figures and bid it to join the\nfeast. There is no exclusion act in art, no passport bureau, not even\nhygienic segregation.\n\nIn writing the briefest introduction to Tolstoi\'s work, I am appointed\nby the publisher, a sort of reception committee of one to escort the\nwork to some fitting place where it may enjoy the surroundings and\ndeference it deserves.\n\nThe place to which I escort it is built of words, but what words have\nbeen left me by the long procession of previous committees? Where they\nhave been truthfully used they have been glorified, and offer all the\nrarer material for my structure, but how often have they been\nsubjected to base use. Perhaps some day we will learn the proper\nrespect of such simple words as love and truth and life, and then when\nwe meet them in books we shall know how to greet them.\n\nThe study of _Redemption_ is so simple that it needs no illumination\nfrom me. The characters may walk in strange lands without\nintroduction. They are part of us. Fedya is in all of us. His one cry\n"There has always been so much lacking between what I felt and what I\ncould do" instantly makes him brother to all mankind. His simultaneous\nphysical degeneration and spiritual regeneration is the glory that all\npeople have invested in death. Tolstoi\'s cry against convention that\ndisregards spiritual struggle, and system that ignores human growth,\nwill find answering cries in many breasts in many lands.\n\nUtterly disregarding effect, technique or method, Tolstoi has explored\nhis own soul and there touched hands with countless other souls, and\nsince he has trod the path of countless millions who will come after\nhim, the mementos of his journey will long be sought.\n\nARTHUR HOPKINS.\n\n\nThe translation of _Redemption_ here published is the one produced by\nMr. Arthur Hopkins at the Plymouth Theatre, New York, in the season of\n1918-1919. The part of FEDYA was played by Mr. John Barrymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREDEMPTION\n\n\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nTHEODORE VASILYEVICH PROTOSOV (FEDYA).\nELISABETH ANDREYEVNA PROTOSOVA (LISA). His wife.\nMISHA.

The scene represents a small dining room.\nANNA PAVLOVNA, a stout, gray-haired lady, tightly laced, is sitting\nalone at the tea-table on which is a samovar.\n\nEnter NURSE carrying a tea-pot.\n\nNURSE (enters R. I, over to table C.). Please, Madam, may I have some\nwater?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (sitting R. of table C.). Certainly. How is the baby\nnow?\n\nNURSE. Oh, restless, fretting all the time. There\'s nothing worse than\nfor a lady to nurse her child. She has her worries and the baby\nsuffers for them. What sort of milk could she have, not peeping all\nnight, and crying and crying?\n\n     [SASHA enters R. I, strolls to L. of table C.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. But I thought she was more calm now?\n\nNURSE. Fine calm! It makes me sick to look at her. She\'s just been\nwriting something and crying all the time.\n\nSASHA (to nurse). Lisa\'s looking for you.\n\n     [Sits in chair L. of table C.\n\nNURSE. I\'m going.\n\n     [Exits R. I.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Nurse says she\'s always crying. Why can\'t she try and\ncalm herself a little?\n\nSASHA. Well, really, Mother, you\'re amazing. How can you expect her to\nbehave as if nothing had happened when she\'s just left her husband and\ntaken her baby with her?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Well, I don\'t exactly, but that\'s all over. If I\napprove of my daughter\'s having left her husband, if I\'m ever glad,\nwell, you may be quite sure he deserved it. She has no reason to be\nmiserable--on the contrary, she ought to be delighted at being freed\nfrom such a wretch.\n\nSASHA. Mother! Why do you go on like this? It\'s not the truth and you\nknow it. He\'s not a wretch, he\'s wonderful. Yes, in spite of all his\nweakness.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. I suppose you\'d like her to wait till he\'d spent every\nkopec they had, and smile sweetly when be brought his gypsy mistresses\nhome with him.\n\nSASHA. He hasn\'t any mistresses.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. There you go again. Why, the man\'s simply bewitched\nyou, but I can see through him, and he knows it. If I\'d been Lisa, I\'d\nleft him a year ago.\n\nSASHA. Oh, how easily you speak of these serious things.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Not easily, not easily at all. Do you suppose it\'s\nagreeable for me to have my daughter admit her marriage a failure? But\nanything\'s better than for her to throw away her life in a lie. Thank\nGod, she\'s made up her mind to finish with him for good.\n\nSASHA. Maybe it won\'t be for good.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. It would be if only he\'d give her a divorce.\n\nSASHA. To what end?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Because she\'s young and has the right to look for\nhappiness.\n\nSASHA. It\'s awful to listen to you. How could she love some one else?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Why not? There are thousands better than your Fedya,\nand they\'d be only too happy to marry Lisa.\n\nSASHA. Oh, it\'s not nice of you. I feel, I can tell, you\'re thinking\nabout Victor Karenin.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Why not? He loved her for ten years, and she him, I\nbelieve.\n\nSASHA. Yes, but she doesn\'t love him as a husband. They grew up\ntogether; they\'ve just been friends.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Ah, those friendships! How should you know what keeps\nthem warm! If only they were both free!\n\n     [Enter a MAID L. U.\n\nWell?\n\nMAID. The porter\'s just come back with an answer to the note.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. What note?\n\nMAID. The note Elizaveta Protosova sent to Victor Karenin.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Well? What answer?\n\nMAID. Victor Karenin told the porter he\'d be here directly.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Very well.\n\n     [MAID exits L. U.\n\n     [To SASHA.\n\nWhy do you suppose she sent for him? Do you know?\n\nSASHA. Maybe I do and maybe I don\'t.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. You\'re always so full of secrets.\n\nSASHA. Ask Lisa, she\'ll tell you.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Just as I thought! She sent for him at once.\n\nSASHA. Yes, but maybe not for the reason you think.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Then what for?\n\nSASHA. Why, Mother, Lisa cares just about as much for Victor Karenin\nas she does for her old nurse.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. You\'ll see. She wants consolation, a special sort of\nconsolation.\n\nSASHA. Really, it shows you don\'t know Lisa at all to talk like this.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. You\'ll see. Sasha. Yes, I shall see.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (alone to herself). And I am very glad. I\'m very, very\nglad.\n\n     [Enter MAID.\n\nMAID. Victor Karenin.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Show him here and tell your mistress.\n\n     [MAID shows in KARENIN and exits door R. I.\n\nKARENIN (goes C. and stands behind table C.). (Shaking hands with Anna\nPavlovna.) Elizaveta Andreyevna sent me a note to come at once. I\nshould have been here to-night anyway. How is she? Well, I hope.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Not very. The baby has been upset again. However,\nshe\'ll be here in a minute. Will you have some tea?\n\nKARENIN. No, thank you.\n\n     [Sits chair R.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Tell me, do you know that he and she--.\n\nKARENIN. Yes, I was here two days ago when she got this letter. Is she\npositive now about their separating?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Oh, absolutely. It would be impossible to begin it all\nover again.\n\nKARENIN. Yes. To cut into living things and then draw back the knife\nis terrible. But are you sure she knows her mind?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. I should think so. To come to this decision has caused\nher much pain. But now it\'s final, and he understands perfectly that\nhis behavior has made it impossible for him to come back on any terms.\n\nKARENIN. Why?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. After breaking every oath he swore to decency, how\ncould he come back? And so why shouldn\'t he give her her freedom?\n\nKARENIN. What freedom is there for a woman still married?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Divorce. He promised her a divorce and we shall insist\nupon it.\n\nKARENIN. But your daughter was so in love with him?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Her love has been tried out of existence. Remember she\nhad everything to contend with: drunkenness, gambling, infidelity--\nwhat was there to go on loving in such a person?\n\nKARENIN. Love can do anything.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. How can one love a rag torn by every wind? Their\naffairs were in dreadful shape; their estate mortgaged; no money\nanywhere. Finally his uncle sends them two thousand rubles to pay the\ninterest on the estate. He takes it, disappears, leaves Lisa home and\nthe baby sick--when suddenly she gets a note asking her to send him\nhis linen.\n\nKARENIN. I know.\n\n     [Enter LISA R.I. KARENIN crosses to LISA.\n\nI\'m sorry to have been a little detained.\n\n     [Shakes hands with LISA.\n\nLISA. Oh, thank you so much for coming. I have a great favor to ask of\nyou. Something I couldn\'t ask of anybody else.\n\nKARENIN. I\'ll do everything I can.\n\n     [LISA moves away a few steps down R.\n\nLISA. You know all about this.\n\n     [Sits chair R.\n\nKARENIN. Yes, I know.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Well, I think I\'ll leave you two young people to\nyourselves. (To SASHA.) Come along, dear, you and I will be just in\nthe way.\n\n     [Exit L. U. ANNA PAVLOVNA and SASHA.\n\nLISA. Fedya wrote to me saying it was all over between us. (She begins\nto cry.) That hurt me so, bewildered me so, that--well, I agreed to\nseparate. I wrote to him saying I was willing to give him up if he\nwanted me to.\n\nKARENIN. And now you\'re sorry?\n\nLISA (nodding). I feel I oughtn\'t to have said yes. I can\'t. Anything\nis better than not to see him again. Victor dear, I want you to give\nhim this letter and tell him what I\'ve told you, and--and bring him\nback to me.\n\n     [Gives VICTOR a letter.\n\nKARENIN. I\'ll do what I can.\n\n     [Takes letter, turns away and sits chair R. of table C.\n\nLISA. Tell him I will forget everything if only he will come back. I\nthought of mailing this, only I know him: he\'d have a good impulse,\nfirst thwarted by some one, some one who would finally make him act\nagainst himself.\n\n     [Pause.\n\nAre you--are you surprised I asked you?\n\nKARENIN. No. (He hesitates.) But--well, candidly, yes. I am rather\nsurprised.\n\nLISA. But you are not angry?\n\nKARENIN. You know I couldn\'t be angry with you.\n\nLISA. I ask you because I know you\'re so fond of him.\n\nKARENIN. Of him--and of you too. Thank you for trusting me. I\'ll do\nall I can.\n\nLISA. I know you will. Now I\'m going to tell you everything. I went\nto-day to Afremov\'s, to find out where he was. They told me he was\nliving with the gypsies. Of course that\'s what I was afraid of. I know\nhe\'ll be swept off his feet if he isn\'t stopped in time. So you\'ll go,\nwon\'t you?\n\nKARENIN. Where\'s the place?\n\nLISA. It\'s that big tenement where the gypsy orchestra lives, on the\nleft bank below the bridge. I went there myself. I went as far as the\ndoor, and was just going to send up the letter, but somehow I was\nafraid. I don\'t know why. And then I thought of you. Tell him, tell\nhim I\'ve forgotten everything and that I\'m here waiting for him to\ncome home. (Crosses to KARENIN--a little pause.) Do it out of love for\nhim, Victor, and out of friendship for me.\n\n     [Another pause.\n\nKARENIN. I\'ll do all I can.\n\n     [He bows to her and goes out L.U. Enter SASHA L.U., goes L. over\n      near table C.\n\nSASHA. Has the letter gone? (LISA nods.) He had no objections to\ntaking it himself?\n\n     [LISA, R. C., shakes head.\n\nSASHA (L.C.). Why did you ask him? I don\'t understand it.\n\nLISA. Who else was there?\n\nSASHA. But you know he\'s in love with you.\n\nLISA. Oh, that\'s all past. (Over to table C.) Do you think Fedya will\ncome back?\n\nSASHA. I\'m sure he will, but--\n\n     [Enter ANNA PAVLOVNA.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Where\'s Victor Karenin?\n\nLISA. Gone.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Gone?\n\nLISA. I\'ve asked him to do something for me.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. What was it? Another secret?\n\nLISA. No, not a secret. I simply asked him to take a letter to Fedya.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. To Fedor Protosov?\n\nLISA. Oh, to Fedya, Fedya.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Then it\'s not going to be over?\n\nLISA. I can\'t let him leave me.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Oh, so we shall commence all over again?\n\nLISA. I\'ll do anything you like, but I can\'t give him up.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. You don\'t mean you want him to come back?\n\nLISA. Yes, yes.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Let that reptile into the house again!\n\nLISA. Please don\'t talk like that. He\'s my husband.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Was your husband.\n\nLISA. No. He\'s still my husband.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Spendthrift. Drunkard. Reprobate. And you\'ll not part\nfrom him!\n\nLISA. Oh, Mother, why do you keep on hurting me! You seem to enjoy it.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Hurt you, do I? Enjoy it, do I? Very well, then, if\nthat\'s the case, I\'d better go.\n\n     [Pause.\n\nI see I\'m in your way. You want me to go. Well, all I can say is I\ncan\'t make you out. I suppose you\'re being "modern" and all that. But\nto me, it\'s just plain disgusting. First, you make up your mind to\nseparate from your husband, and then you up and send for another man\nwho\'s in love with you--\n\nLISA. Mother, he\'s not.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. You know Karenin proposed to you, and he\'s the man you\npick out to bring back your husband. I suppose you do it just to make\nhim jealous.\n\nLISA. Oh, Mother, stop it. Leave me alone.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. That\'s right. Send off your mother. Open the door to\nthat awful husband. Well, I can\'t stand by and see you do it. I\'ll go.\nI\'m going. And God be with you and your extraordinary ways.\n\n     [Exit L. U. with suppressed rage.\n\nLISA (sinking into a chair R. of table C.). That\'s the last straw.\n\nSASHA. Oh, she\'ll come back. We\'ll make her understand. (Going to the\ndoor and following after her mother.) Now, Mother darling, listen--\nlisten--\n\n     [Exit L. U.\n\n     [All lights dim to black out.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\nA room at the gypsies\', dark but beautifully lit. The actual room is\nscarcely seen, and although at first it appears squalid, there are\nflaring touches of Byzantine luxury. Gypsies are singing. FEDYA is\nlying on the sofa, his eyes closed, coat off. An OFFICER sits at the\ntable, on which there are bottles of champagne and glasses. Beside him\nsits a musician taking down the song.\n\nAFREMOV (standing L. U.). Asleep?\n\nFEDYA (on couch L. Raising his hand warningly). Sh! Don\'t talk! Now\nlet\'s have "No More at Evening."\n\nGYPSY LEADER. Impossible, Fedor Protosov. Masha must have her solo\nfirst.\n\nFEDYA. Afterwards. Now let\'s have "No More at Evening."\n\n     [Gypsies sing.\n\nGYPSY WOMAN (R. C., when they finish singing, turning to Musician who\nis sitting at table R., with his back to audience). Have you got it?\n\nMUSICIAN. It\'s impossible to take it down correctly. They change the\ntune each time, and they seem to have a different scale, too. (He\ncalls a gypsy woman.) Is this it?\n\n     [He hums a bar or two.\n\nGYPSY WOMAN (clapping her hands). Splendid! Wonderful! How can you do\nit?\n\nFEDYA (rising. Goes to table L. back of couch and pours out glass of\nwine). He\'ll never get it. And even if he did and shovelled it into an\nopera, he\'d make it seem absolutely meaningless.\n\nAFREMOV. Now we\'ll have "The Fatal Hour."\n\n     [Gypsies sing quartette. During this song, FEDYA is standing down\n      R., keeping time with the wine glass from which he has drunk.\n      When they finish he returns to the couch and falls into MASHA\'S\n      arms.\n\nFEDYA. God! That\'s it! That\'s it! That\'s wonderful. What lovely things\nthat music says. And where does it all come from, what does it all\nmean?\n\n     [Another pause.\n\nTo think that men can touch eternity like that, and then--nothing--\nnothing at all.\n\nMUSICIAN. Yes, it\'s very original.\n\n     [Taking notes.\n\nFEDYA. Original be damned. It\'s real.\n\nMUSICIAN. It\'s all very simple, except the rhythm. That\'s very\nstrange.\n\nFEDYA. Oh, Masha, Masha! You turn my soul inside out.\n\n     [Gypsies hum a song softly.\n\nMASHA (sitting on couch L. with FEDYA). Do I? But what was it I asked\nyou for?\n\nFEDYA. What? Oh, money. Voila, mademoiselle.\n\n     [He takes money front his trousers pocket. MASHA laughs, takes\n      the money, counts it swiftly, and hides it in her dress.\n\nFEDYA. Look at this strange creature. When she sings she rushes me\ninto the sky and all she asks for is money, little presents of money\nfor throwing open the Gates of Paradise. You don\'t know yourself, at\nall, do you?\n\nMASHA. What\'s the use of me wondering about myself? I know when I\'m in\nlove, and I know that I sing best when my love is singing.\n\nFEDYA. Do you love me?\n\nMASHA (murmuring). I love you.\n\nFEDYA. But I am a married man, and you belong to this gypsy troupe.\nThey wouldn\'t let you leave it, and--\n\nMASHA (interrupting). The troupe\'s one thing, and my heart\'s another.\nI love those I love, and I hate those I hate.\n\nFEDYA. Oh, you must be happy to be like that.\n\nMASHA. I\'m always happy when handsome gentlemen come and say nice\nthings to me. (Gypsies stop singing.)\n\n     [A GYPSY entering speaks to FEDYA.\n\nGYPSY. Some one asking for you.\n\nFEDYA. Who?\n\nGypsy. Don\'t know. He\'s rich, though. Fur coat.\n\nFEDYA. Fur coat? O my God, show him in.\n\nAFREMOV. Who the devil wants to see you here?\n\nFEDYA (carelessly). God knows, I don\'t. (Begins to hum a song.)\n\n     [KARENIN comes in, looking around the room.\n\n(Exclaiming). Ha! Victor! You\'re the last man in the world I expected\nto break into this enchanting milieu. Take off your coat, and they\'ll\nsing for you.\n\nKARENIN. Je voudrais vous parler sans temoins.\n\n     [MASHA rises and joins the group R.\n\nFEDYA. Oh.... What about?\n\nKARENIN. Je viens de chez vous. Votre femme ma charge de cette lettre,\net puis--\n\n     [FEDYA takes the letter, opens it, reads. He frowns, then smiles\n      affectionately at KARENIN.\n\nFEDYA. You know what\'s in this letter, Victor?\n\n     [He is smiling gently all the time.\n\nKARENIN (looking at FEDYA rather severely). Yes, I know. But really,\nFedya, you\'re in no--\n\nFEDYA (interrupting). Please, please don\'t think I\'m drunk and don\'t\nrealize what I\'m saying. Of course I\'m drunk, but I see everything\nvery clearly. Now go ahead. What were you told to tell me?\n\nKARENIN (is standing L. C. Shrugging his shoulders). Your wife asked\nme to find you and to tell you she\'s waiting for you. She wants you to\nforget everything and come back.\n\n     [Pause.\n\nKARENIN (stiffly). Elizaveta Protosova sent for me and suggested that\nI--\n\nFEDYA (as he hesitates). Yes.\n\nKARENIN (finishing rather lamely). But I ask you not so much for her\nas for myself--Fedya, come home.\n\nFEDYA (looking up at him, smiling rather whimsically). You\'re a much\nfiner person than I am, Victor. Of course that\'s not saying much. I\'m\nnot very much good, am I? (Laughing gently.) But that\'s exactly why\nI\'m not going to do what you want me to. It\'s not the only reason,\nthough. The real reason is that I just simply can\'t. How could I?\n\nKARENIN (persuasively). Come along to my rooms, Fedya, and I\'ll tell\nher you\'ll be back to-morrow.\n\nFEDYA (wistfully). To-morrows can\'t change what we are. She\'ll still\nbe she, and I will still be I to-morrow. (Goes to the table and\ndrinks.) No, it\'s better to have the tooth out in one pull. Didn\'t I\nsay that if I broke my word she was to leave me? Well, I\'ve broken it,\nand that\'s enough.\n\nKARENIN. Yes. For you, but not for her.\n\nFEDYA (down L. Politely insolent). You know ... it\'s rather odd, that\nyou, of all men, should take so much trouble to keep our marriage from\ngoing to pieces.\n\nKARENIN (revolted). Good God, Fedya! You don\'t think--\n\n     [MASHA crosses L., goes to FEDYA. FEDYA interrupting him with a\n      return of his former friendliness.\n\nFEDYA. Come now, my dear Victor, you shall hear them sing.\n\nMASHA (whispering to FEDYA). What\'s his name? We must honor him with a\nsong.\n\nFEDYA (laughing). O good God, yes! Honor him by all means. His name is\nVictor Michaelovitch. (Saluting Karenin.) Victor, my lord! son of\nMichael!\n\n     [The gypsies sing a song of greeting and laudation. As they begin\n      to sing, MASHA and FEDYA sit on couch L.\n\n(When song is finished.)\n\nKARENIN (in an imploring tone). Fedya!\n\n     [Exits quietly L. U.\n\nFEDYA (business with MASHA). Where\'s the fur coat? Gone, eh? All\nright. May the devil go with it.\n\nFEDYA. Do you know who that was?\n\nMASHA. I heard his name.\n\nFEDYA. Ah, he\'s a splendid fellow. He came to take me home to my wife.\nYou see she loves even a fool like me, (caressing her hair) and look\nwhat I\'m doing.\n\nMASHA. You should go back to her and be very sorry.\n\nFEDYA. Do you think I should? (He kisses her.) Well, I think I\nshouldn\'t.\n\nMASHA. Of course, you needn\'t go back to her if you don\'t love her.\nLove is all that counts.\n\nFEDYA (smiling). How do you know that?\n\nMASHA (looking at him timidly). I don\'t know, but I do.\n\nFEDYA. Now, let\'s have "No More at Evening." (As the gypsies sing,\nMASHA lies on her back across his lap, looking up into his face, which\nshe draws down to her, and they kiss until the music begins to cease.)\nThat\'s wonderful! Divine! If I could only lie this way forever, with\nmy arms around the heart of joy, and sleep ... and die.... (He closes\nhis eyes; his voice trails away.)\n\n     [Lights dim and out, then the\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA\'S boudoir. SOPHIA KARENINA, VICTOR\'S mother, is\nreading a book. She is a great lady, over fifty, but tries to look\nyounger. She likes to interlard her conversation with French words. A\nservant enters.\n\nSERVANT (enters R., announcing). Prince Sergius Abreskov.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (on sofa over L.). Show him in, please.\n\n     [She turns and picks up hand mirror from table back of couch,\n      arranging her hair.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (enters R. I. Entering). J\'espere que je ne force pas\nla consigne.\n\n     [Crossing to sofa L. He kisses her hand. He is a charming old\n      diplomat of seventy.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Ah, you know well que vous etes toujours le bien\nvenu.... Tell me, you have received my letter?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. I did. Me voila. (Sits L. on sofa L.) Sophia Karenina\n(working up to distress). Oh, my dear friend, I begin to lose hope.\nShe\'s bewitched him, positively bewitched him. Il est ensorcele. I\nnever knew he could be so obstinate, so heartless, and so indifferent\nto me. He\'s changed completely since that woman left her husband.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. How do matters actually stand?\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Well, he\'s made up his mind to marry her at any cost.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. And her husband?\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. He agrees to a divorce.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Really?\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. And Victor is willing to put up with all the\nsordidness, the vulgarity of the divorce court, the lawyers, evidences\nof guilt ... tout ca est degoutant. I can\'t understand his sensitive\nnature not being repelled by it.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (smiling). He\'s in love, and when a man\'s really in\nlove--\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (interrupting). In our time love could remain pure,\ncoloring one\'s whole life with a romantic friendship. Such love I\nunderstand and value.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (sighing). However, the present generation refuses to\nlive on dreams. (He coughs delicately.) La possession de l\'ame ne leur\nsuffit plus. So what is the alternative? But tell me more of Victor.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. There\'s not very much to say. He seems bewitched,\nhardly my son. Did you know I\'d called upon her? Victor pressed me so\nit was impossible to refuse. But Dieu merci, I found her out. So I\nmerely left my card, and now she has asked me if I could receive her\nto-day, and I am expecting her (she glances at her watch) any moment\nnow. I am doing all this to please Victor, but conceive my feelings. I\nknow you always can. Really, really, I need your help.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (bowing). Thank you for the honor you do me.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. You realize this visit decides Victor\'s fate. I must\nrefuse my consent, or---- But that\'s impossible.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Have you met her?\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. I\'ve never seen her, but I\'m afraid of her. No good\nwoman leaves her husband, especially when there\'s nothing obviously\nintolerable about him. Why, I\'ve seen Protosov often with Victor, and\nfound him even quite charming.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (murmurs). So I\'ve heard. So I\'ve heard.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (continuing). She should bear her cross without\ncomplaint. And Victor must cease trying to persuade himself that his\nhappiness lies in defying his principles. What I don\'t understand is\nhow Victor, with his religious views, can think of marrying a divorced\nwoman. I\'ve heard him say over and over again--once quite lately--\nthat divorce is totally inconsistent with true Christianity. If she\'s\nbeen able to fascinate him to that point, I am afraid of her.--But how\nstupid of me to talk all the time! Have you spoken to him at all? What\ndoes he say? And don\'t you thoroughly agree with me?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Yes, I\'ve spoken to Victor. I think he really loves\nher, has grown accustomed to the idea of loving her, pour ainsi dire.\n(Shaking his head.) I don\'t believe he could ever now care for another\nwoman.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (sighing). And Varia Casanzeva would have made him\nsuch a charming wife. She\'s so devoted already.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (smiling). I am afraid I hardly see her in the present\n... tableau. (Earnestly.) Why not submit to Victor\'s wish and help\nhim?\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. To marry a divorcee? And afterwards have him running\ninto his wife\'s husband? How can you calmly suggest that a mother\naccept such a situation for her son?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. But, chere amie, why not approve of the inevitable?\nAnd you might console yourself by regarding the dangers he\'ll avoid by\nmarrying this gentle, lovely woman. After all, suppose he conceived a\npassion for some one----\n\n     [Convey the word "disreputable".\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. How can a good woman leave her husband?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Ah, that\'s not like you. You\'re unkind and you\'re\nharsh. Her husband is the sort of man--well, he\'s his own worst enemy.\nA weakling, a ne\'er-do-well--he\'s spent all his money and hers too.\nShe has a child. Do you think you can condemn her for leaving him? As\na matter of fact she didn\'t leave him, he left her.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (faintly). Oh what a mud-pen I\'m slipping into!\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (amused). Could your religion aid you?\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (smelling her salts). In this instance, religion would\nrequire of me the impossible. C\'est plus fort que moi.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Fedya himself--you know what a charming clever\ncreature he is when he\'s in his senses--he advised her to leave him.\n\n     [Enter VICTOR who kisses his mother\'s hand and greets PRINCE SERGIUS.\n\nKARENIN. Ah, Prince Sergius! (Shakes hands with Prince--formally.)\nMaman, I\'ve come to tell you that Elizaveta Protosova will be here\ndirectly. There\'s only one thing I ask you: do you still refuse your\nconsent to my marriage----\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (interrupting). And I most assuredly do.\n\nKARENIN (continuing. Frowning). In that case all I ask is for you not\nto speak to her about it.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. I don\'t suppose we shall even mention the subject. I\ncertainly shan\'t.\n\nKARENIN (standing at head of sofa L.). If you don\'t, she won\'t.\n(Pleadingly.) Mother dear, I just want you to know her.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. One thing I can\'t understand. How is it you want to\nmarry Lisa Protosova, a woman with a living husband, and at the same\ntime believe divorce is a crime against Christianity?\n\nKARENIN. Oh, Maman, that\'s cruel of you. Life is far too complex to be\nmanaged by a few formulas. Why are you so bitter about it all?\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (honestly). I love you. I want you to be happy.\n\nKARENIN (imploringly to PRINCE SERGIUS) Sergius Abreskov!\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (to SOPHIA KARENINA). Naturally you want him happy. But\nit\'s difficult for our hearts, wearied from the weight of years, to\nfeel the pulse of youth and sympathize, especially is it difficult for\nyou, my friend, who have schooled yourself to view Victor\'s happiness\nin a single way....\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Oh, you\'re all against me. Do as you like. Vous etes\nmajeur. (Sniffing into her pocket handkerchief.) But you\'ll kill me.\n\nKARENIN (deeply distressed). Ah, Mother, please. It\'s worse than cruel\nto say things like that.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (smiling to VICTOR). Come, come, Victor, you know your\nmother speaks more severely than she could ever act.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. I shall tell her exactly what I think and feel, and I\nhope I can do it without offending her.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. I am sure of it.\n\n     [Enter FOOTMAN.\n\nHere she is.\n\nKARENIN. I\'ll go. (Goes to back of sofa.)\n\nFOOTMAN (announcing). Elizaveta Andreyevna Protosova.\n\nKARENIN (warningly). Now, Mother.\n\n     [He goes out L. PRINCE SERGIUS rises.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (majestically). Show her in. (To PRINCE SERGIUS.)\nPlease remain.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. I thought you might prefer a tete-a-tete?\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. No, no. I rather dread it. And if I want to be left\nalone in the room with her, I\'ll drop my handkerchief. Ca dependra.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. I\'m sure you\'re going to like her immensely.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Oh you\'re all against me.\n\n     [Enter LISA R. and crosses to R. C.\n\n(Rising) How do you do? I was so sorry not to find you at home and it\nis most kind of you to come to see me.\n\nLISA (R.C.). I never expected the honor of your visit, and I am so\ngrateful that you permit me to come and see you.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (C.). You know Prince Sergius Abreskov?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (L.--Heartily). Yes, I have had the pleasure. (Crossing\nto her, he shakes hands.) My niece Nellie has spoken often of you to\nme.\n\n     [Goes to L.C.\n\nLISA. Yes, we were great friends. (She glances shyly around her.) And\nstill are. (To SOPHIA.) I never hoped that you would wish to see me.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. I knew your husband quite well. He was a great friend\nof Victor\'s and used frequently to visit us in Tambov, (politely)\nwhere you were married, I believe.\n\nLISA (looking down). Yes.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. But when you returned to Moscow we were deprived of\nthe pleasure of his visit.\n\nLISA. Yes, then he stopped going anywhere.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Ah, that explains our missing him.\n\n     [Awkward pause.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (to LISA). The last time I\'d the pleasure of seeing you\nwas in those tableaux at the Dennishovs. You were charming in your\npart.\n\nLISA. How good of you to think so! Yes, I remember perfectly.\n\n     [Another awkward silence.\n\n(To SOPHIA KARENINA.) Sophia Karenina, please forgive me if what I am\ngoing to say offends you, but I don\'t know how to cover up what\'s in\nmy heart. I came here to-day because Victor Karenin said--because he\nsaid that--because he--I mean because you wanted to see me. (With a\ncatch in her voice.) It\'s rather difficult--but you\'re so sweet.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (very sympathetic). There, there, my dear child, I\nassure you there\'s nothing in the world to---- (He breaks off when he\nsees SOPHIA KARENINA pointing impatiently to the floor. She has\ndropped her handkerchief.) Permit me. (He picks it up, presenting it\nto her with a smile and a bow; then looks casually at his watch.) Ah,\nfive o\'clock already. (To SOPHIA KARENINA.) Madame, in your salon\npleasure destroys the memory of time. You will excuse me.\n\n     [He kisses her hand.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (smiling). Au revoir, mon ami.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (bowing and shaking hands with LISA). Elizaveta\nProtosova, au revoir.\n\n     [He goes out R.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Now listen, my child. Please believe how truly sorry\nfor you I am and that you are most sympathetique to me. But I love my\nson alone in this world, and I know his soul as I do my own. He\'s very\nproud--oh I don\'t mean of his position and money--but of his high\nideals, his purity. It may sound strange to you, but you must believe\nme when I tell you that at heart he is as pure as a young girl.\n\nLISA. I know.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. He\'s never loved a woman before. You\'re the first. I\ndon\'t say I\'m not a little jealous. I am. But that\'s something we\nmothers have to face. Oh, but your son\'s still a baby, you don\'t know.\nI was ready to give him up, though--but I wanted his wife to be as\npure as himself.\n\nLISA (flushing hotly). And I, am I not----\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (interrupting her kindly). Forgive me, my dear. I know\nit\'s not your fault and that you\'ve been most unhappy. And also I know\nmy son. He will bear anything, and he\'ll bear it without saying a\nword, but his hurt pride will suffer and bring you infinite remorse.\nYou must know how strongly he has always felt that the bond of\nmarriage is indissoluble.\n\nLISA. Yes. I\'ve thought of all that.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Lisa, my dear, you\'re a wise woman and you\'re a good\nwoman too. If you love him, you must want his happiness more than you\nwant your own. You can\'t want to cripple him so that he\'ll be sorry\nall his life--yes, sorry even though he never says a word.\n\nLISA. I\'ve thought about it so much. I\'ve thought about it and I\'ve\ntalked to him about it. But what can I do when he says he can\'t live\nwithout me? I said to him only the other day, "Victor, let\'s just be\nfriends. Don\'t spoil your life. Don\'t ruin yourself by trying to help\nme." And do you know what he did? He laughed.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Of course he would, at the time.\n\nLISA. If you could persuade him not to marry me, you know I\'ll agree,\ndon\'t you? I just want him to be happy. I don\'t care about myself.\nOnly please help me. Please don\'t hate me. Let\'s do all we can for\nhim, because, after all, we both love him.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Yes, I know. And I think I love you too. I really do.\n(She kisses her. LISA begins to cry.) Oh, it\'s all so dreadful. If\nonly he had fallen in love with you before you were married!\n\nLISA (sobbing). He--he says he did--but he had to be loyal to his\nfriend.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Alas, it\'s all very heart-breaking. But let us love\neach other, and God will help us to find what we are seeking.\n\nKARENIN (entering L. I). Mother darling. I\'ve heard what you just\nsaid. I knew you\'d love her. And now everything must come right.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (hastily). But nothing\'s decided. All I can say is,\nhad things been different, I should have been very glad. (Tenderly.)\nSo very glad.\n\n     [She kisses LISA.\n\nKARENIN (smiling). Please don\'t change. That\'s all I ask.\n\n     [Lights down and out.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\nSCENE IV\n\nA plainly furnished room, bed, table and stove. FEDYA alone writing.\n\nAt rise MASHA is heard outside calling "FEDYA! FEDYA!" MASHA enters R.\nI, crosses to FEDYA on bed C. and embraces him.\n\nFEDYA. Ah, thank Heaven you\'ve come. I was wasting away in boredom.\n\nMASHA. Then why didn\'t you come over to us? (Sees wine glass on chair\nnear bed.) So, you\'ve been drinking again? And after all your\npromises!\n\nFEDYA (embarrassed). I didn\'t come over because I had no money.\n\nMASHA. Oh, why is it I love you so.\n\nFEDYA. Masha!\n\nMASHA (imitating him). Masha! Masha! What\'s that mean? If you loved\nme, by now you\'d have your divorce. You say you don\'t love your wife.\n(FEDYA winces.) But you stick to her like grim death.\n\nFEDYA (interrupting her). You know why I don\'t want to.\n\nMASHA. Nonsense. They\'re right when they say you\'re no good. It\'s your\nmind that you can never make up comfortably causing you all the worry.\n\nFEDYA. You know perfectly well that the only joy I\'ve got in life is\nbeing in love with you.\n\nMASHA. Oh, it\'s always "My joy," "Your love." Where\'s your love and my\njoy?\n\nFEDYA (a little wearily). Well, Masha, after all, you\'ve got all I can\ngive, the best I\'ve ever had to give, perhaps, because you\'re so\nstrong, so beautiful, that sometimes you\'ve made me know how to make\nyou glad. So why torture yourself?\n\nMASHA (kneels and puts her arms around his neck). I won\'t if you\'re\nsure you love me.\n\nFEDYA (coming closer to her). My beautiful young Masha.\n\nMASHA (tearfully, searching his face). You do love me?\n\nFEDYA. Of course, of course.\n\nMASHA. Only me, only me?\n\nFEDYA (kissing her). Darling, only you.\n\nMASHA (with a return to brightness). Now read me what you\'ve written.\n\nFEDYA. It may bore you.\n\nMASHA (reproachfully). How could it?\n\nFEDYA (reads).\n\n     "The snow was flooded in moonlight and the birch trees wavered\n      their stark shadows across it like supplicating arms. Suddenly\n      I heard the soft padded sound of snow falling upon snow, to\n      slowly perceive a figure, the slender figure of a young child\n      attempting to arouse itself almost at my feet--I----"\n\n     [Enter IVAN and NASTASIA. They are two old gypsies, MASHA\'S\n      parents.\n\nNASTASIA (stepping up to MASHA). So here you are--you cursed little\nstray sheep. No disrespect to you, sir. (To MASHA.) You black-hearted,\nungrateful little snake. How dare you treat us like this, how dare\nyou, eh?\n\nIvan (to FEDYA). It\'s not right, sir, what you\'ve done, bringing to\nher ruin our only child. It\'s against God\'s law.\n\nNASTASIA (to MASHA). Come and get out of here with me. You thought\nyou\'d skip, didn\'t you? And what was I supposed to tell the troupe\nwhile you dangled around here with this tramp? What can you get out of\nhim, tell me that? Did you know he hasn\'t got a kopek to his name,\ndidn\'t you?\n\n     [During scene with parents, FEDYA sits dumbly on the bed, bewildered.\nHe puts his forehead against MASHA\'S face and clings to her like a\nchild.\n\nMASHA (sullenly). I haven\'t done anything wrong. I love this\ngentleman, that\'s all. I didn\'t leave the troupe either. I\'ll go on\nsinging just the same.\n\nIvan. If you talk any more, I\'ll pull your hair all out for you, you\nloose little beast, you. (To FEDYA, reproachfully.) And you, sir, when\nwe were so fond of you--why, often and often we used to sing for you\nfor nothing and this is how you pay us back.\n\nNASTASIA (rocking herself to and fro). You\'ve ruined our daughter, our\nvery own, our only one, our best beloved, our diamond, our precious\none, (with sudden fury). You\'ve stamped her into the dirt, you have.\nWhere\'s your fear of God?\n\nFEDYA. Nastasia, Nastasia, you\'ve made a mistake. Your daughter is\nlike a sister to me. I haven\'t harmed her at all. I love her, that\'s\ntrue. But how can I help it?\n\nIVAN. Well, why didn\'t you love her when you had some money? If you\'d\npaid us ten thousand rubles, you could have owned her, body and soul.\nThat\'s what respectable gentlemen do. But you--you throw away every\nkopek you\'ve got and then you steal her like you\'d steal a sack of\nmeal. You ought to be ashamed, sir.\n\nMASHA (rising, puts her arm around his neck). He didn\'t steal me. I\nwent to him myself, and if you take me away now, I\'ll come right back.\nIf you take me away a thousand times, I\'ll come back to him. I love\nhim and that\'s enough. My love will break through anything--through\nanything. Through anything in the whole damn world.\n\nNASTASIA (trying to soothe her). Now, Mashenka darling, don\'t get\ncross. You know you haven\'t behaved well to your poor old parents.\nThere, there, come along with us now.\n\n     [With greedy fingers that pretend to caress, NASTASIA seizes her\n      savagely and suddenly at the end of this speech and draws her to\n      the door. MASHA cries out "FEDYA! FEDYA!" as she exits R.\n\nIVAN (alongside). You open your mouth again and I\'ll smash you dumb.\n(To FEDYA.) Good-bye, your worship.\n\n     [All exit R. I.\n\n     [FEDYA sits as though stupefied. The gypsies exit noisily. There\n      is a pause. He drinks; then PRINCE SERGIUS appears, very quiet\n      and dignified, at the door.\n\nPRINCE. Excuse me. I\'m afraid I\'m intruding upon a rather painful\nscene.\n\nFEDYA (getting up). With whom have I the honor---- (recognizing the\nPrince). Ah, Prince Sergius, how do you do?\n\n     [They shake hands.\n\nPRINCE (in a distinguished manner). I repeat that I am afraid to be\nmost inopportune. I would rather not have heard, but since I have,\nit\'s my duty to say so. When I arrived I knocked several times, but I\npresume you could not have heard through such uproar.\n\nFEDYA. Do sit down. (PRINCE sits chair R.C.) Thanks for telling me you\nheard. (Sits on bed up C.) It gives me a chance to explain it all.\nForgive me for saying your opinion of me can\'t concern me, but I want\nto tell you that the way her parents talked to that young girl, that\ngypsy singer, was absolutely unjust. She\'s as pure as your own mother.\nMy relations with her are simply friendly ones. Possibly there is a\nray of poetry in them, but that could hardly degrade her. However,\nwhat can I do for you?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Well, to begin----\n\nFEDYA (interrupting). Excuse me, Prince, but my present social\nposition hardly warrants a visit from you.\n\n     [Smiling.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. I know that, but I ask you to believe that your\nchanged position does not influence me in what I am about to tell you.\n\nFEDYA (interrogatively). Then?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. To be as brief as possible, Victor Karenin, the son of\nmy old friend, Sophia Karenina, and she herself, have asked me to\ndiscover from you personally what your present relations are with your\nwife, and what intentions you have regarding them.\n\nFEDYA. My relations with my wife--I should say my former wife--are\nseveral.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. As I thought, and for this reason accepted my somewhat\ndifficult mission.\n\nFEDYA (quickly). I wish to say first of all that the fault was\nentirely mine. She is, just as she always was, absolutely stainless,\nfaultless.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Victor Karenin and especially his mother are anxious\nto know your exact intentions regarding the future.\n\nFEDYA. I\'ve got no intentions. I\'ve given her full freedom. I know she\nloves Victor Karenin, let her. Personally, I think he is a bore, but\nhe is a good bore. So they\'ll probably be very happy together, at\nleast in the ordinary sense and que le bon Dieu les benisse.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Yes, but we----\n\nFEDYA (rising, goes L., leans on table). Please don\'t think I\'m\njealous. If I just said Victor was dull, I take it back. He\'s\nsplendid, very decent, in fact the opposite of myself, and he\'s loved\nher since her childhood (slowly) and maybe she loved him even when we\nwere married. After all, that happens, and the strongest love is\nperhaps unconscious love. Yes, I think she\'s always loved him far, far\ndown beneath what she would admit to herself, and this feeling of nine\nhas been a black shadow across our married life. But--I--I really\ndon\'t suppose I ought to be talking to you like this, ought I?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Please go on. My only object in coming was to\nunderstand this situation completely, and I begin to see how the\nshadow--as you charmingly express it--could have been----\n\nFEDYA (looking strangely ahead of him). Yes, no brightness could suck\nup that shadow. And so I suppose I never was satisfied with what my\nwife gave me, and I looked for every kind of distraction, sick at\nheart because I did so. I see it more and more clearly since we\'ve\nbeen apart. Oh, but I sound as if I were defending myself. God knows I\ndon\'t want to do that. No, I was a shocking bad husband. I say was,\nbecause now I don\'t consider myself her husband at all. She\'s\nperfectly free. There, does that satisfy you?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Yes, but you know how strictly orthodox Victor and his\nfamily are. Of course I don\'t agree with them--perhaps I have broader\nviews--(with a shrug) but I understand how they feel. They consider\nthat any union without a church marriage is--well, to put it mildly,\nunthinkable.\n\nFEDYA. Yes, I know he\'s very stu--I mean strict. (With a slight\nsmile.) "Conservative" is the word, isn\'t it? But what in God\'s name\n(crossing to C.) do they want, a divorce? I told them long ago I was\nperfectly willing. But the business of hiring a street-woman and\ntaking her to a shady hotel and arranging to be caught by competent\nwitnesses--ugh--it\'s all so--so loathsome.\n\n     [He shudders--pauses; and sits on bed.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. I know. I know. I assure you, I can sympathize with\nsuch a repugnance, but how can one avoid it? You see, it\'s the only\nway out. But, my dear boy, you mustn\'t think I don\'t sympathize with\nyou. It\'s a horrible situation for a sensitive man and I quite\nunderstand how you must hate it.\n\nFEDYA. Thank you, Prince Sergius. I always knew you were kind and\njust. Now tell me what to do. Put yourself in my place. I don\'t\npretend to be any better than I really am. I am a blackguard but there\nare some things that even I can\'t do. (With a smile and helpless\ngesture.) I can\'t tell lies.\n\n     [A pause.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. I must confess that you bewilder me. You with your\ngifts and charm and really au fond--a wonderful sense of what\'s right.\nHow could you have permitted yourself to plunge into such tawdry\ndistractions? How could you have forgotten so far what you owed to\nyourself? Tell me, why did you let your life fall into this ruin?\n\nFEDYA (suppressing emotion). I\'ve led this sort of life for ten years\nand you\'re the first real person to show me sympathy. Of course, I\'ve\nbeen pitied by the degraded ones but never before by a sensible, kind\nman like you. Thanks more than it\'s possible to say. (He seems to\nforget his train of thought and suddenly to recall it.) Ah, yes, my\nruin. Well, first, drink, not because it tasted well, but because\neverything I did disappointed me so, made me so ashamed of myself. I\nfeel ashamed now, while I talk to you. Whenever I drank, shame was\ndrowned in the first glass, and sadness. Then music, not opera or\nBeethoven, but gypsy music; the passion of it poured energy into my\nbody, while those dark bewitching eyes looked into the bottom of my\nsoul. (He sighs.) And the more alluring it all was, the more shame I\nfelt afterwards.\n\n     [Pause.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. But what about your career?\n\nFEDYA. My career? This seems to be it. Once I was a director of a\nbank. There was something terribly lacking between what I felt and\nwhat I could do. (Abruptly.) But enough, enough of myself. It makes me\nrather nervous to think about myself.\n\n     [Rises.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. What answer am I to take back?\n\nFEDYA (very nervous). Oh, tell them I\'m quite at their disposal.\n(Walking up and down) They want to marry, and there mustn\'t be\nanything in their way (pause); is that it? (Stops walking very\nsuddenly. Repeats.) There mustn\'t be anything in their way--is that\nit?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (pause. FEDYA sits on table L.). Yes. When do you--when\ndo you think--you\'ll--you\'ll have it ready? The evidence?\n\nFEDYA (turns and looks at the PRINCE, suppressing a slight, strained\nsmile). Will a fortnight do?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS (rising). Yes, I am sure it will. (Rises and crosses to\nFEDYA.) May I say that you give them your word?\n\nFEDYA (with some impatience). Yes. Yes. (PRINCE offers his hand.)\nGood-bye, Prince Sergius. And again thanks.\n\n     [Exit PRINCE SERGIUS, R. I. FEDYA sits down in an attitude of\n      deep thought.\n\nWhy not? Why not? And it\'s good not to be ashamed----\n\n     [Lights dim and out.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\nSCENE V\n\nPrivate room in a cheap restaurant. FEDYA is shown in by a shabby\nwaiter.\n\nWAITER. This way, sir. No one will disturb you here. Here\'s the\nwriting paper.\n\n     [Starts to exit.\n\nFEDYA (as waiter starts to exit). Bring me a bottle of champagne.\n\nWAITER. Yes, sir.\n\n     [Exits R. C.\n\n     [FEDYA sits at table L. C., and begins to write. IVAN PETROVICH\n      appearing in the doorway R. C.\n\nIVAN PETROVICH. I\'ll come in, shall I?\n\nFEDYA (sitting L. of table L. C. Very serious). If you want to, but\nI\'m awfully busy, and--(seeing he has already entered) Oh, all right,\ndo come in.\n\nIVAN PETROVICH (C.). You\'re going to write an answer to their demand.\nI\'ll help you. I\'ll tell you what to say Speak out. Say what you mean.\nIt\'s straight from the shoulder. That\'s my system. (Picks up box that\nFEDYA has placed on table--opens it and takes out a revolver.) Hallo!\nWhat\'s this? Going to shoot yourself. Of course, why not? I\nunderstand. They want to humiliate you, and you show them where the\ncourage is--put a bullet through your head and heap coals of fire on\ntheirs. I understand perfectly. (The waiter enters with champagne on\ntray, pours a glass for FEDYA, then exits. PETROVICH takes up the\nglass of wine and starts to drink. FEDYA looks up from his writing.) I\nunderstand everything and everybody, because I\'m a genius.\n\nFEDYA. So you are, but----\n\nIVAN PETROVICH (filling and lifting his glass). Here\'s to your\nimmortal journey. May it be swift and pleasant. Oh, I see it from your\npoint of view. So why should I stop you? Life and death are the same\nto genius. I\'m dead during life and I live after death. You kill\nyourself in order to make a few people miss you, but I--but I--am\ngoing to kill myself to make the whole world know what it lost. I\nwon\'t hesitate or think about it. I\'ll just take the revolver--one,\ntwo--and all is over--um. But I am premature. My hour is not yet\nstruck. (He puts the revolver down.) But I shall write nothing. The\nworld will have to understand all by itself. (FEDYA continues to\nwrite.) The world, what is it but a mass of preposterous creatures,\nwho crawl around through life, understanding nothing--nothing at all\n--do you hear me? (FEDYA looks up, rather exasperated.) Oh, I\'m not\ntalking to you. All this is between me and the cosmos. (Pours himself\nout another drink.) After all, what does humanity most lack?\nAppreciation for its geniuses. As it is, we\'re persecuted, tortured,\nracked, through a lifetime of perpetual agony, into the asylum or the\ngrave. But no longer will I be their bauble. Humanity, hypocrite that\nyou are--to hell with you.\n\n     [Drinks wine.\n\nFEDYA (having finished his letter). Oh, go away, please.\n\nIVAN PETROVICH. Away? (With a gesture.) Away? Me? (With profound\nresolve.) So be it. (He leans over the table, faces FEDYA.) I shall\naway. I\'ll not deter you from accomplishing what I also shall commit--\nall in its proper moment, however. Only I should like to say this----\n\nFEDYA. Later. Later. But now, listen, old man, give this to the head\nwaiter. (Handing him some money.) You understand?\n\nIVAN PETROVICH. Yes, but for God\'s sake wait for me to come back.\n(Moves away.) I\'ve something rare to tell you, something you\'ll never\nhear in the next world--at least not till I get there---- Look here,\nshall I give him all this money?\n\nFEDYA. No, just what I owe him.\n\n     [Exit IVAN PETROVICH, whistling. FEDYA sighs with a sense of\n      relief, takes the revolver, cocks it, stands at mirror on wall\n      up R., and puts it close to his temple. Then shivers, and lets\n      his hand drop.\n\nI can\'t do it. I can\'t do it.\n\n     [Pause. MASHA is heard singing. MASHA bursts into the room.\n\nMASHA (breathless). I\'ve been everywhere looking for you. To Popov\'s,\nAfremov\'s, then I guessed you\'d be here. (Crosses to him. Sees\nrevolver, turns, faces him quickly, concealing it with her body,\nstands very tense and taut, looking at him.) Oh, you fool! You hideous\nfool! Did you think you\'d----\n\nFEDYA (still completely unnerved). Awful! It\'s been awful! I tried----\n(With a gesture of despair.) I couldn\'t----\n\n     [Crosses to table L. C.--leans against it.\n\nMASHA (puts her hand to her face as if terribly hurt). As if I didn\'t\nexist. (Crosses over to table L. C., puts down revolver.) As if I\nweren\'t in your life at all. Oh, how godless you are! (Brokenly.) Tell\nme, tell me, what about all my love for you?\n\nFEDYA (as if suddenly aware of a great fatigue). I wanted to set them\nfree. I promised to--and when the time came I couldn\'t.\n\nMASHA. And what about me? What about me?\n\nFEDYA. I thought you\'d be free, too. Surely my torturing you can\'t\nmake you happy.\n\nMASHA. Oh, I can look out for myself. Maybe I\'d rather be unhappy,\nmiserable, wretched with you every minute than even think of living\nwithout you.\n\nFEDYA (up R.--half to himself). If I\'d finished just now, you would\nhave cried bitterly perhaps, my Masha, but you would have lived past\nit.\n\nMASHA. Oh, damn you, don\'t be so sure I\'d cry at all. Can\'t you even\nbe sorry for me?\n\n     [She tries to conceal her tears.\n\nFEDYA. Oh God, I only wanted to make everybody happier.\n\nMASHA. Yourself happier, you mean.\n\nFEDYA (smiling). Would I have been happier to be dead now?\n\nMASHA (sulkily). I suppose you would. (Suddenly in a tender voice,\ncrossing to him.) But, Fedya, do you know what you want? Tell me, what\ndo you want?\n\nFEDYA (R). I want so many things.\n\nMASHA (impatiently and clinging to him). But what? What?\n\nFEDYA. First of all, I want to set them free. How can I lie? How can I\ncrawl through the muck and filth of a divorce? I can\'t. (Moves to end\nof table and stands there facing front.) But I must set them free\nsomehow. They\'re such good people, my wife and Victor. I can\'t bear\nhaving them suffer.\n\nMASHA (R. of table L. C.--scornfully). Where\'s the good in her if she\nleft you?\n\nFEDYA. She didn\'t. I left her.\n\nMASHA. She made you think she\'d be happier without you. But go on----\n(Impatiently.) Blame yourself, what else.\n\nFEDYA. There\'s you, Masha. Young, lovely, awfully dear to me. If I\nstay alive, ah, where will you be?\n\nMASHA. Don\'t bother about me. You can\'t hurt me.\n\nFEDYA (sighing). But the big reason, the biggest reason of all, is\nmyself. I\'m just lost. Your father is right, my dear. I\'m no good.\n\nMASHA (crossing to him, at once tenderly and savagely). I won\'t\nunfasten myself from you. I\'ll stick to you, no matter where you take\nme, no matter what you do. You\'re alive, terribly alive, and I love\nyou. Fedya, drop all this horror.\n\nFEDYA. How can I?\n\nMASHA (trying to project the very essence of her vitality into him).\nOh, you can, you can.\n\nFEDYA (slowly). When I look at you, I feel as though I could do\nanything.\n\nMASHA (proudly, fondly). My love, my love. You can do anything, get\nanywhere you want to. (FEDYA moves away impatiently up R. She sees\nletter.) So you have been writing to them--to tell them you\'ll kill\nyourself. You just told them you\'d kill yourself, is that it? But you\ndidn\'t say anything about a revolver. Oh, Fedya, let me think, there\nmust be some way. Fedya--listen to me. Do you remember the day we all\nwent to the picnic to the White Lakes with Mama and Afremov and the\nyoung Cossack officer? And you buried the bottles of wine in the sand\nto keep them cool while we went in bathing? Do you remember how you\ntook my hands and drew me out beyond the waves till the water was\nquite silent and flashing almost up to our throats, and then suddenly\nit seemed as if there were nothing under our feet? We tried to get\nback. We couldn\'t and you shouted out, "Afremov," and if he hadn\'t\nbeen almost beside us and pulled us in--and how cross he was with you\nfor forgetting that you couldn\'t swim, and after, how wonderful it was\nto stretch out safely on the sands in the sunlight. Oh, how nice every\none was to us that day and you kept on being so sorry for forgetting\nyou couldn\'t swim! And, Fedya, don\'t you see? Of course, she must know\nyou can\'t swim. Oh, it\'s all getting as clear as daylight. You will\nsend her this beautiful letter. Your clothes will be found on the\nriver bank--but instead of being in the river you will be far away\nwith me--Fedya, don\'t you see, don\'t you see? You will be dead to her,\nbut alive for me. (Embraces FEDYA.)\n\n     [The lights down and out.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\nSCENE VI\n\nThe PROTOSOVS\' drawing-room.\n\nKARENIN and LISA.\n\nKARENIN (sitting chair R.). He\'s promised me\ndefinitely, and I\'m sure he\'ll keep to it.\n\nLISA (sitting chair R. C.). I\'m rather ashamed to confess it, Victor,\nbut since I found out about this--this gypsy, I feel completely free\nof him. Of course, I am not in the least jealous, but knowing this\nmakes me see that I owe him nothing more. Am I clear to you, I wonder?\n\nKARENIN (coming closer to her). Yes, dear, I think I\'ll always\nunderstand you.\n\nLISA (smiling). Don\'t interrupt me, but let me speak as I think. The\nthing that tortured me most was I seemed to love both of you at once,\nand that made me seem so indecent to myself.\n\nKARENIN (incredulously amused). You indecent?\n\nLISA (continuing). But since I\'ve found out that there\'s another\nwoman, that he doesn\'t need me any more, I feel free, quite free of\nhim. And now I can say truthfully, I love you. Because everything is\nclear in my soul. My only worry is the divorce, and all the waiting to\nbe gone through before we can---- Ah, that\'s torturing.\n\nKARENIN. Dearest, everything will be settled soon. After all, he\'s\npromised, and I\'ve asked my secretary to go to him with the petition\nand not to leave until he\'s signed it. Really, sometimes, if I didn\'t\nknow him as I do, I\'d think he was trying on purpose to discomfort us.\n\nLISA. No. No. It\'s, only the same weakness and honesty fighting\ntogether in him. He doesn\'t want to lie. However, I\'m sorry you sent\nhim money.\n\nKARENIN. If I hadn\'t, it might have delayed things. Lisa. I know, but\nmoney seems so ugly.\n\nKARENIN (slightly ruffled). I hardly think it\'s necessary to be so\ndelicate with Fedya.\n\nLISA. Perhaps, perhaps. (Smiling.) But don\'t you think we are becoming\nvery selfish?\n\nKARENIN. Maybe. But it\'s all your fault, dear. After all, this\nhopelessness and waiting, to think of being happy at last! I suppose\nhappiness does make us selfish.\n\nLISA. Don\'t believe you\'re alone in your happiness or selfishness. I\nam so filled with joy it makes me almost afraid. Misha\'s all right,\nyour mother loves me, and above all, you are here, close to me, loving\nme as I love you.\n\nKARENIN (bending over her and searching her eyes). You\'re sure you\'ve\nno regret?\n\nLISA. From the day I found out about that gypsy woman, my mind\nunderwent a change that has set me free.\n\nKARENIN. You\'re sure?\n\n     [Kissing her hands.\n\nLISA (passionately). Darling, I\'ve only one desire now, and that is to\nhave you forget the past and love as I do.\n\n     [Her little boy toddles in R., sees them and stops.\n\n     [To the child.\n\nCome here, my sweetheart.\n\n     [He goes to her and she takes him on her knees.\n\nKARENIN. What strange contradictory instincts and desires make up our\nbeings!\n\nLISA. Why?\n\nKARENIN (slowly). I don\'t know. When I came back from abroad, knew I\'d\nlost you, I was unhappy, terribly. Yet, it was enough for me to learn\nthat you at least remembered me. Afterward, when we became friends,\nand you were kind to me, and into our friendship wavered a spark of\nsomething more than friendship, ah, I was almost happy! Only one thing\ntormented me: fear that such a feeling wronged Fedya. Afterwards, when\nFedya tortured you so, I saw I could help. Then a certain definite\nhope sprang up in me. And later, when he became impossible and you\ndecided to leave him, and I showed you my heart for the first time,\nand you didn\'t say no, but went away in tears--then I was happy through\nand through. Then came the possibility of joining our lives. Mamma\nloved you. You told me you loved me, that Fedya was gone out of your\nheart, out of your life forever, and there was only, only me.... Ah,\nLisa, for what more could I ask! Yet the past tortured me. Awful\nfancies would flush up into my happiness, turning it all into hatred\nfor your past.\n\nLISA (interrupting reproachfully). Victor!\n\nKARENIN. Forgive me, Lisa. I only tell you this because I don\'t want\nto hide a single thought from you. I want you to know how bad I am,\nand what a weakness I\'ve got to fight down. But don\'t worry, I\'ll get\npast it. It\'s all right, dear. (He bends over, kissing the child on\nthe head.) And I love him, too.\n\nLISA. Dearest, I\'m so happy. Everything has happened in my heart to\nmake it as you\'d wish.\n\nKARENIN. All?\n\nLISA. All, beloved, or I never could say so.\n\n     [Enter the NURSE L. U.\n\nNURSE. Your secretary has come back.\n\n     [LISA and KARENIN exchange glances.\n\nLISA. Show him in here, nurse, and take Misha, will you?\n\nNURSE. Come along, my pet. It\'s time for your rest.\n\n     [Exit NURSE with the little boy, R.\n\nKARENIN (gets up, walks to the door). This will be Fedya\'s answer.\n\nLISA (kissing Karenin). At last, at last we shall know when. (She\nkisses him.)\n\n     [Enter VOZNESENSKY L. U.\n\nKARENIN. Well?\n\nSECRETARY. He\'s not there, sir.\n\nKARENIN. Not there? He\'s not signed the petition, then?\n\nSECRETARY. No. But here is a letter addressed to you and Elizaveta\nProtosova.\n\n     [Takes letter from his pocket and gives it to KARENIN.\n\nKARENIN (interrupting angrily). More excuses, more excuses. It\'s\nperfectly outrageous. How without conscience he is. Really, he has\nlost every claim to----\n\nLISA. But read the letter, dear; see what he says.\n\n     [KARENIN opens the letter.\n\nSECRETARY. Shall you need me, sir?\n\nKarenin. No. That\'s all. Thank you.\n\n     [Exit SECRETARY. KARENIN reads the letter growing astonishment\n      and concern. LISA watches his face.\n\n(Reading.)\n\n     "Lisa, Victor, I write you both without using terms of\n      endearment, since I can\'t feel them, nor can I conquer a sense\n      of bitterness and reproach, self-reproach principally, when I\n      think of you together in your love. I know, in spite of being\n      the husband, I was also the barrier, preventing you from coming\n      earlier to one another. C\'est moi qui suis l\'intrue. I stood in\n      your way, I worried you to death. Yet I can\'t help feeling\n      bitterly, coldly, toward you. In one way I love both of you,\n      especially Lisa Lizenska, but in reality I am more than cold\n      toward you. Yes, it\'s unjust, isn\'t it, but to change is\n      impossible."\n\nLISA. What\'s all that for?\n\nKARENIN (standing L. of table C., continuing).\n\n     "However, to the point. I am going to fulfill your wishes in\n      perhaps a little different way from what you desire. To lie, to\n      act a degrading comedy, to bribe women of the streets for\n      evidence--the ugliness of it all disgusts me. I am a bad man,\n      but this despicable thing I am utterly unable to do. My solution\n      is after all the simplest. You must marry to be happy. I am the\n      obstacle, consequently that obstacle must be removed."\n\nLISA (R. of table). Victor!\n\nKARENIN (reading). Must be removed? "By the time this letter reaches\nyou, I shall no longer exist. All I ask you is to be happy, and\nwhenever you think of me, think tender thoughts. God bless you both.\nGood-bye. FEDYA."\n\nLISA. He\'s killed himself!\n\nKARENIN (going hurriedly up stage L. and calls of). My secretary! Call\nback my secretary!\n\nLISA. Fedya! Fedya, darling!\n\nKARENIN. Lisa!\n\nLISA. It\'s not true! It\'s not true that I\'ve stopped loving him! He\'s\nthe only man in all the world I love! And now I\'ve killed him! I\'ve\nkilled him as surely as if I\'d murdered him with my own two hands!\n\nKARENIN. Lisa, for God\'s sake!\n\nLISA. Stop it! Don\'t come near me! Don\'t be angry with me, Victor. You\nsee I, too, cannot lie!\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\nSCENE I\n\nA dirty, ill-lighted underground dive; people are lying around\ndrinking, sleeping, playing cards and making love. Near the front a\nsmall table at which FEDYA sits; he is in rags and has fallen very\nlow. By his side is PETUSHKOV, a delicate spiritual man, with long\nyellow hair and beard. Both are rather drunk.\n\nCandle light is the only lighting in this Scene.\n\nPETUSHKOV (R.C. of table C.). I know. I know. Well, that\'s real love.\nSo what happened then?\n\nFEDYA (L. C. of table C., pensively). You might perhaps expect a girl\nof our own class, tenderly brought up, to be capable of sacrificing\nfor the man she loved, but this girl was a gypsy, reared in greed, yet\nshe gave me the purest sort of self-sacrificing love. She\'d have done\nanything for nothing. Such contrasts are amazing.\n\nPETUSHKOV. I see. In painting we call that value. Only to realize\nbright red fully when there is green around it. But that\'s not the\npoint. What happened?\n\nFEDYA. Oh, we parted. I felt it wasn\'t right to go on taking, taking\nwhere I couldn\'t give. So one night we were having dinner in a little\nrestaurant, I told her we\'d have to say good-bye. My heart was so\nwrung all the time I could hardly help crying.\n\nPETUSHKOV. And she?\n\nFEDYA. Oh, she was awfully unhappy, but she knew I was right. So we\nkissed each other a long while, and she went back to her gypsy troupe\n--(Slowly.) Maybe she was glad to go----\n\n     [A pause.\n\nPETUSHKOV. I wonder.\n\nFEDYA. Yes. The single good act of my soul was not ruining that girl.\n\nPETUSHKOV. Was it from pity?\n\nFEDYA. I sorry for her? Oh, never. Quite the contrary. I worshipped\nher unclouded sincerity, the energy of her clear, strong will, and God\nin Heaven, how she sang. And probably she is singing now, for some one\nelse. Yes, I always looked up at her from beneath, as you do at some\nradiance in the sky. I loved her really. And now it\'s a tender\nbeautiful memory.\n\nPETUSHKOV. I understand. It was ideal, and you left it like that.\n\nFEDYA (ruminatingly). And I\'ve been attracted often, you know. Once I\nwas in love with a grande dame, bestially in love, dog-like. Well,\nshe gave me a rendezvous, and I didn\'t, couldn\'t, keep it, because\nsuddenly I thought of her husband, and it made me feel sick. And you\nknow, it\'s queer, that now, when I look back, instead of being glad\nthat I was decent, I am as sorry as if I had sinned. But with Masha\nit\'s so different; I\'m filled with joy that I\'ve never soiled the\nbrightness of my feeling for her. (He points his finger at the floor.)\nI may go much further down.\n\nPETUSHKOV (interrupting). I know so well what you mean. But where is\nshe now?\n\nFEDYA. I don\'t know. I don\'t want to know. All that belongs to another\nlife, and I couldn\'t bear to mix that life and this life.\n\n     [A POLICE OFFICER enters from up R., kicks a man who is lying on\n      the floor--walks down stage, looks at FEDYA and PETUSHKOV, then\n      exits.\n\nPETUSHKOV. Your life\'s wonderful. I believe you\'re a real idealist.\n\nFEDYA. No. It\'s awfully simple. You know among our class--I mean the\nclass I was born in--there are only three courses: the first, to go\ninto the civil service or join the army and make money to squander\nover your sensual appetites. And all that was appalling to me--perhaps\nbecause I couldn\'t do it. The second thing is to live to clear out, to\ndestroy what is foul, to make way for the beautiful. But for that\nyou\'ve got to be a hero, and I\'m not a hero. And the third is to\nforget it all--overwhelm it with music, drown it with wine. That\'s\nwhat I did. And look (he spreads his arms out) where my singing led me\nto.\n\n     [He drinks.\n\nPETUSHKOV. And what about family life? The sanctity of the home and\nall that--I would have been awfully happy if I\'d had a decent wife. As\nit was, she ruined me.\n\nFEDYA. I beg your pardon. Did you say marriage? Oh, yes, of course.\nWell, I\'ve been married, too. Oh, my wife was quite an ideal woman. I\ndon\'t know why I should say was, by the way, because she\'s still\nliving. But there\'s something--I don\'t know; it\'s rather difficult to\nexplain--But you know how pouring champagne into a glass makes it\nfroth up into a million iridescent little bubbles? Well, there was\nnone of that in our married life. There was no fizz in it, no sparkle,\nno taste, phew! The days were all one color--flat and stale and gray\nas the devil. And that\'s why I wanted to get away and forget. You\ncan\'t forget unless you play. So trying to play I crawled in every\nsort of muck there is. And you know, it\'s a funny thing, but we love\npeople for the good we do them, and we hate them for the harm. That\'s\nwhy I hated Lisa. That\'s why she seemed to love me.\n\nPETUSHKOV. Why do you say seemed?\n\nFEDYA (wistfully). Oh, she couldn\'t creep into the center of my being\nlike Masha. But that\'s not what I mean. Before the baby was born, and\nafterwards, when she was nursing him, I used to stay away for days and\ndays, and come back drunk, drunk, and love her less and less each\ntime, because I was wronging her so terribly. (Excitedly.) Yes. That\'s\nit, I never realized it before. The reason why I loved Masha was\nbecause I did her good, not harm. But I crucified my wife, and her\ncontortions filled me almost with hatred.\n\n     [FEDYA drinks.\n\nPETUSHKOV. I think I understand. Now in my case----\n\n     [ARTIMIEV enters R. U., approaches with a cockade on his cap,\n      dyed mustache, and shabby, but carefully mended clothes.\n\nARTIMIEV (stands L. of table). Good appetite, gentlemen! (Bowing to\nFEDYA.) I see you\'ve made the acquaintance of our great artist.\n\nFEDYA (coolly). Yes, I have.\n\nARTIMIEV (to PETUSHKOV). Have you finished your portrait?\n\nPETUSHKOV. No, they didn\'t give me the commission, after all.\n\nARTIMIEV (sitting down on end of table). I\'m not in your way, am I?\n\n     [FEDYA and PETUSHKOV don\'t answer.\n\nPETUSHKOV. This gentleman was telling me about his life.\n\nARTIMIEV. Oh, secrets? Then I won\'t disturb you. Pardon me for\ninterrupting. (To himself as he moves away.) Damn swine!\n\n     [He goes to the next table, sits down and in the dim candlelight\n      he can just be seen listening to the conversation.\n\nFEDYA. I don\'t like that man.\n\nPETUSHKOV. I think he\'s offended.\n\nFEDYA. Let him be. I can\'t stand him. If he\'d stayed I shouldn\'t have\nsaid a word. Now, it\'s different with you. You make me feel all\ncomfortable, you know. Well, what was I saying?\n\nPETUSHKOV. You were talking about your wife. How did you happen to\nseparate?\n\nFEDYA. Oh, that? (A pause.) It\'s a rather curious story. My wife\'s\nmarried.\n\nPETUSHKOV. Oh, I see! You\'re divorced.\n\nFEDYA. No. (Smiling.) She\'s a widow.\n\nPETUSHKOV. A widow? What do you mean?\n\nFEDYA. I mean exactly what I say. She\'s a widow. I don\'t exist.\n\nPETUSHKOV (puzzled). What?\n\nFEDYA (smiling drunkenly). I\'m dead. You\'re talking to a corpse.\n\n     [ARTIMIEV leans towards them and listens intently.\n\nFunny, I seem to be able to say anything to you. And it\'s so long ago,\nso long ago. And what is it after all to you but a story? Well, when I\ngot to the climax of torturing my wife, when I\'d squandered everything\nI had or could get, and become utterly rotten, then, there appeared a\nprotector.\n\nPETUSHKOV. The usual thing, I suppose?\n\nFEDYA. Don\'t think anything filthy about it. He was just her friend,\nmine too, a very good, decent fellow; in fact the opposite of myself.\nHe\'d known my wife since she was a child, and I suppose he\'d loved her\nsince then. He used to come to our house a lot. First I was very glad\nhe did, then I began to see they were falling in love with each other,\nand then--an odd thing began to happen to me at night. Do you know\nwhen she lay there asleep beside me (he laughs shrilly) I would hear\nhim, pushing open the door, crawling into the room, coming to me on\nhis hands and knees, grovelling, whining, begging me (he is almost\nshouting) for her, for her, imagine it! And I, I had to get up and\ngive my place to him. (He covers his eyes with his hands in a.\nconvulsive moment.) Phew! Then I\'d come to myself.\n\nPETUSHKOV. God! It must have been horrible.\n\nFEDYA (wearily). Well, later on I left her--and after a while, they\nasked me for a divorce. I couldn\'t bear all the lying there was to be\ngot through. Believe me it was easier to think of killing myself. And\nso I tried to commit suicide, and I tried and I couldn\'t. Then a kind\nfriend came along and said, "Now, don\'t be foolish!" And she arranged\nthe whole business for me. I sent my wife a farewell letter--and the\nnext day my clothes and pocketbook were found on the bank of the\nriver. Everybody knew I couldn\'t swim. (Pause.) You understand, don\'t\nyou?\n\nPETUSHKOV. Yes, but what about the body? They didn\'t find that?\n\nFEDYA (smiling drunkenly). Oh yes, they did! You just listen! About a\nweek afterwards some horror was dragged out of the water. My wife was\ncalled in to identify it. It was in pretty bad shape, you know. She\ntook one glance. "Is that your husband?" they asked her. And she said,\n"Yes." Well, that settled it! I was buried, they were married, and\nthey\'re living very happily right here in this city. I\'m living here,\ntoo! We\'re all living here together! Yesterday I walked right by their\nhouse. The windows were lit and somebody\'s shadow went across the\nblind. (A pause.) Of course there\'re times when I feel like hell about\nit, but they don\'t last. The worst is when there\'s no money to buy\ndrinks with.\n\n     [He drinks.\n\nARTIMIEV. (rising and approaching them). Excuse me, but you know I\'ve\nbeen listening to that story of yours? It\'s a very good story, and\nwhat\'s more a very useful one. You say you don\'t like being without\nmoney, but really there\'s no need of your ever finding yourself in\nthat position.\n\nFEDYA. (interrupting). Look here, I wasn\'t talking to you and I don\'t\nneed your advice!\n\nARTIMIEV. But I\'m going to give it to you just the same. Now you\'re a\ncorpse. Well, suppose you come to life again!\n\nFEDYA. What?\n\nARTIMIEV. Then your wife and that fellow she\'s so happy with--they\'d\nbe arrested for bigamy. The best they\'d get would be ten years in\nSiberia. Now you see where you can have a steady income, don\'t you?\n\nFEDYA. (furiously). Stop talking and get out of here!\n\nARTIMIEV. The best way is to write them a letter. If you don\'t know\nhow I\'ll do it for you. Just give me their address and afterwards when\nthe ruble notes commence to drop in, how grateful you\'ll be!\n\nFEDYA. Get out! Get out, I say! I haven\'t told you anything!\n\nARTIMIEV. Oh, yes, you have! Here\'s my witness! This waiter heard you\nsaying you were a corpse!\n\nFEDYA. (beside himself). You damn blackmailing beast----\n\n     [Rising.\n\nARTIMIEV. Oh, I\'m a beast, am I? We\'ll see about that! (FEDYA rises to\ngo, ARTIMIEV seizes him.) Police! Police! (FEDYA struggles frantically\nto escape.)\n\n     [The POLICE enter and drag him away.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\nIn the country. A veranda covered by a gay awning; sunlight; flowers;\nSOPHIA KARENINA, LISA, her little boy and nurse.\n\nLISA (standing C. in door. To the little boy, smiling), Who do you\nthink is on his way from the station?\n\nMISHA (excitedly). Who? Who?\n\nLISA. Papa.\n\nMISHA (rapturously). Papa\'s coming! Papa\'s coming!\n\n     [Exits L. through C. door.\n\nLISA (contentedly, to SOPHIA KARENINA). How much he loves Victor! As\nif he were his real father!\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA (on sofa L. knitting--back to audience). Tant mieux.\nDo you think he ever remembers his father?\n\nLISA (sighing). I can\'t tell. Of course I\'ve never said anything to\nhim. What\'s the use of confusing his little head? Yet sometimes I feel\nas though I ought. What do you think, Mamma?\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. I think it\'s a matter of feeling. If you can trust\nyour heart, let it guide you. What extraordinary adjustments death\nbrings about! I confess I used to think very unkindly of Fedya, when\nhe seemed a barrier to all this. (She makes a gesture with her hand.)\nBut now I think of him as that nice boy who was my son\'s friend, and a\nman who was capable of sacrificing himself for those he loved. (She\nknits.) I hope Victor hasn\'t forgotten to bring me some wool.\n\nLISA. Here he comes. (LISA runs to the edge of the veranda.) There\'s\nsome one with him--a lady in a bonnet! Oh, it\'s mother! How splendid!\nI haven\'t seen her for an age!\n\n     [Enter ANNA PAVLOVNA up C.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (kissing LISA). My darling. (To SOPHIA KARENINA.) How do\nyou do? Victor met me and insisted on my coming down.\n\n     [Sits bench L. C. beside SOPHIA.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. This is perfectly charming!\n\n     [Enter VICTOR and MISHA.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. I did want to see Lisa and the boy. So now, if you\ndon\'t turn me out, I\'ll stay till the evening train.\n\nKARENIN. (L. C., kissing his wife, his mother and the boy).\nCongratulate me--everybody--I\'ve a bit of luck, I don\'t have to go to\ntown again for two days. Isn\'t that wonderful?\n\nLISA. (R. C.). Two days! That\'s glorious! We\'ll drive over to the\nHermitage to-morrow and show it to mother.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. (holding the boy). He\'s so like his father, isn\'t he? I\ndo hope he hasn\'t inherited his father\'s disposition.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. After all, Fedya\'s heart was in the right place.\nLISA. Victor thinks if he\'d only been brought up more carefully\neverything would have been different.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Well, I\'m not so sure about that, but I do feel sorry\nfor him. I can\'t think of him without wanting to cry.\n\nLISA. I know. That\'s how Victor and I feel. All the bitterness is\ngone. There\'s nothing left but a very tender memory.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. (sighing). I\'m sure of it. Lisa. Isn\'t it funny? It all\nseemed so hopeless back there, and now see how beautifully\neverything\'s come out!\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Oh, by the way, Victor, did you get my wool?\n\nKARENIN. I certainly did. (Brings a bag and takes out parcels.) Here\'s\nthe wool, here\'s the eau-de-cologne, here are the letters--one on\n"Government Service" for you, Lisa---- (Hands her the letter. LISA\nopens letter, then strolls R, reading it, suddenly stops.) Well, Anna\nPavlovna, I know you want to make yourself beautiful! I must tidy up,\ntoo. It\'s almost dinner time. Lisa, you\'ve put your another in the\nBlue Room, haven\'t you?\n\n     [Pause.\n\n     [LISA is pale. She holds the letter with trembling hands and\n      reads it, KARENIN seeing her.\n\nWhat\'s the matter, Lisa? What is it?\n\nLISA. He\'s alive. He\'s alive. My God! I shall never be free from him.\n(VICTOR crosses to LISA.) What does this mean? What\'s going to happen\nto us?\n\nKARENIN (taking the letter and reading). I don\'t believe it.\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. What is it? (Rising.) What\'s the matter? Why don\'t\nyou tell us?\n\nKARENIN. He\'s alive! They\'re accusing us of bigamy! It\'s a summons for\nLisa to go before the Examining Magistrate.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. No--no! It can\'t be!\n\nSOPHIA KARENINA. Oh, that horrible man!\n\nKARENIN. So it was all a lie!\n\nLISA (with a cry of rage). Oh! I hate him so! Victor!--Fedya!--My God!\nI don\'t know what I\'m saying. I don\'t know what I\'m saying.\n\n     [Sinks in chair down R.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (rising). He\'s not really alive?\n\n     [Lights dim and out.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\nSCENE III\n\nThe room of the examining magistrate, who sits at a table talking to\nMELNIKOV, a smartly dressed, languid, man-about-town.\n\nAt a side-table a CLERK is sorting papers.\n\nMAGISTRATE. (sitting R. of table R. C.). Oh, I never said so. It\'s her\nown notion. And now she is reproaching me with it.\n\nMELNIKOV. (sitting C. back to audience). She\'s not reproaching you,\nonly her feelings are awfully hurt.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Are they? Oh, well, tell her I\'ll come to supper after the\nperformance. But you\'d better wait on. I\'ve rather an interesting\ncase. (To the CLERK.) Here, you, show them in.\n\nClerk. (sitting C. facing audience). Both? Excellency. Magistrate. No,\nonly Madame Karenina.\n\n     [CLERK exits L. I.\n\nCLERK (calling off stage). Madame Protosova, Madame Protosova.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Or, to dot my i\'s, Madame Protosova.\n\nMELNIKOV (starting to go out). Ah, it\'s the Karenin case.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Yes, and an ugly one. I\'m just beginning the\ninvestigation. But I assure you it\'s a first-rate scandal already.\nMust you go? Well, see you at supper. Good-bye.\n\n     [Exit MELNIKOV, R.\n\n     [The CLERK shows in LISA; she wears a black dress and veil.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Please sit down, won\'t you? (He points to a chair L. C.\nLISA sits down.) I am extremely sorry that it\'s necessary to ask you\nquestions.\n\n     [LISA appears very much agitated. MAGISTRATE appears unconcerned\n      and is reading a newspaper as he speaks.\n\nBut please be calm. You needn\'t answer them unless you wish. Only in\nthe interest of every one concerned, I advise you to help me reach the\nentire truth.\n\nLISA. I\'ve nothing to conceal.\n\nMAGISTRATE (looking at papers). Let\'s see. Your name, station,\nreligion. I\'ve got all that. You are accused of contracting a marriage\nwith another man, knowing your first husband to be alive.\n\nLISA. But I did not know it.\n\nMAGISTRATE (continuing). And also you are accused of having persuaded\nwith bribes your first husband to commit a fraud, a pretended suicide,\nin order to rid yourself of him.\n\nLISA. All that\'s not true.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Then permit me to ask you these questions: Did you or did\nyou not send him 1200 rubles in July of last year?\n\nLISA. That was his own money obtained from selling his things, which I\nsent to him during our separation, while I was waiting for my divorce.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Just so. Very well. When the police asked you to identify\nthe corpse, how were you sure it was your husband\'s?\n\nLISA. Oh, I was so terribly distressed that I couldn\'t bear to look at\nthe body. Besides, I felt so sure it was he, and when they asked me, I\njust said yes.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Very good indeed. I can well understand your distraction,\nand permit me to observe, Madame, that although servants of the law,\nwe remain human beings, and I beg you to be assured that I sympathize\nwith your situation. You were bound to a spendthrift, a drunkard, a\nman whose dissipation caused you infinite misery.\n\nLISA (interrupting). Please, I loved him.\n\nMAGISTRATE (tolerantly). Of course. Yet naturally you desired to be\nfree, and you took this simple course without counting the\nconsequence, which is considered a crime, or bigamy. I understand you,\nand so will both judges and jury. And it\'s for this reason, Madam, I\nurge you to disclose the entire truth.\n\nLISA. I\'ve nothing to disclose. I never have lied. (She begins to\ncry.) Do you want me any longer?\n\nMAGISTRATE. Yes. I must ask you to remain a few minutes longer. No\nmore questions, however. (To the CLERK.) Show in Victor Karenin. (To\nLISA.) I think you\'ll find that a comfortable chair. (Sits L. C.)\n\n     [Enter KARENIN, stern and solemn.\n\nPlease, sit down.\n\nKARENIN. Thank you. (He remains standing L. U.) What do you want from\nme?\n\nMAGISTRATE. I have to take your deposition.\n\nKARENIN. In what capacity?\n\nMAGISTRATE (smiling). In my capacity of investigating magistrate. You\nare here, you know, because you are charged with a crime.\n\nKARENIN. Really? What crime?\n\nMAGISTRATE. Bigamy, since you\'ve married a woman already married. But\nI\'ll put the questions to you in their proper order. Sure you\'ll not\nsit down?\n\nKARENIN. Quite sure.\n\nMAGISTRATE (writing). Your name?\n\nKARENIN. Victor Karenin.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Rank?\n\nKARENIN. Chamberlain of the Imperial Court.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Your age?\n\nKARENIN. Thirty-eight.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Religion?\n\nKARENIN. Orthodox, and I\'ve never been tried before of any charge.\n(Pause.) What else?\n\nMAGISTRATE. Did you know that Fedor Protosov was alive when you\nmarried his wife?\n\nKARENIN. No, we were both convinced that he was drowned.\n\nMAGISTRATE. All right. And why did you send 1200 rubles to him a few\ndays before he simulated death on July 17th?\n\nKARENIN. That money was given me by my wife.\n\nMAGISTRATE (interrupting him). Excuse me, you mean by Madame\nProtosova.\n\nKARENIN. By my wife to send to her husband. She considered this money\nhis property, and having broken off all relations with him, felt it\nunjust to withhold it. What else do you want?\n\nMAGISTRATE. I don\'t want anything, except to do my official duty, and\nto aid you in doing yours, through causing you to tell me the whole\ntruth, in order that your innocence be proved. You\'d certainly better\nnot conceal things which are sure to be found out, since Protosov is\nin such a weakened condition, physically and mentally, that he is\ncertain to come out with the entire truth as soon as he gets into\ncourt, so from your point of view I advise....\n\nKARENIN. Please don\'t advise me, but remain within the limits of your\nofficial capacity. Are we at liberty to leave?\n\n     [He goes to LISA who takes his arm.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Sorry, but it\'s necessary to detain you. (KARENIN looks\naround in astonishment.) No, I\'ve no intention of arresting you,\nalthough it might be a quicker way of reaching the truth. I merely\nwant to take Protosov\'s deposition in your presence, to confront him\nwith you, that you may facilitate your chances by proving his\nstatements to be false. Kindly sit down. (To CLERK.) Show in Fedor\nProtosov.\n\n     [There is a pause. The CLERK shows in FEDYA in rags, a total\n      wreck. He enters slowly, dragging his feet. He catches sight of\n      his wife, who is bowed in grief. For a moment he is about to\n      take her in his arms--he hesitates--then stands before the\n      MAGISTRATE.\n\nMAGISTRATE. I shall ask you to answer some questions.\n\nFEDYA. (rises, confronting the MAGISTRATE). Ask them.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Your name?\n\nFEDYA. You know it.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Answer my questions exactly, please.\n\n     [Rapping on his desk.\n\nFEDYA (shrugs). Fedor Protosov.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Your rank, age, religion?\n\nFEDYA. (silent for a moment). Aren\'t you ashamed to ask me these\nabsurd questions? Ask me what you need to know, only that.\n\nMAGISTRATE. I shall ask you to take care how you express yourself.\n\nFEDYA. Well, since you\'re not ashamed. My rank, graduate of the\nUniversity of Moscow; age 40; religion orthodox. What else?\n\nMAGISTRATE. Did Victor Karenin and Elizaveta Andreyevna know you were\nalive when you left your clothes on the bank of the river and\ndisappeared?\n\nFEDYA. Of course not. I really wished to commit suicide. But--\nhowever, why should I tell you? The fact\'s enough. They knew nothing\nof it.\n\nMAGISTRATE. You gave a somewhat different account to the police\nofficer. How do you explain that?\n\nFEDYA. Which police officer? Oh yes, the one who arrested me in that\ndive. I was drunk, and I lied to him--about what, I don\'t remember.\nBut I\'m not drunk now and I\'m telling you the whole truth. They knew\nnothing; they thought I was dead, and I was glad of it. Everything\nwould have stayed all right except for that damned beast Artimiev. So\nif any one\'s guilty, it\'s I.\n\nMAGISTRATE. I perceive you wish to be generous. Unfortunately the law\ndemands the truth. Come, why did you receive money from them?\n\n     [FEDYA is silent.\n\nWhy don\'t you answer me? Do you realize that it will be stated in your\ndeposition that the accused refused to answer these questions, and\nthat will harm (he includes LISA and VICTOR in a gesture) all of you?\n\n     [FEDYA remains silent.\n\nAren\'t you ashamed of your stubborn refusal to aid these others and\nyourself by telling the entire truth?\n\nFEDYA (breaking out passionately). The truth--Oh, God! what do you\nknow about the truth? Your business is crawling up into a little\npower, that you may use it by tantalizing, morally and physically,\npeople a thousand times better than you.... You sit there in your smug\nauthority torturing people.\n\nMAGISTRATE. I must ask you----\n\nFEDYA (interrupts him). Don\'t ask me for I\'ll speak as I feel.\n(Turning to CLERK.) And you write it down. So for once some human\nwords will get into a deposition.\n\n     [Raising his voice, which ascends to a climax during this speech.\n\nThere were three human beings alive: I, he, and she.\n\n     [He turns to his wife with a gesture indicating his love for her.\n      He pauses, then proceeds.\n\nWe all bore towards one another a most complex relation. We were all\nengaged in a spiritual struggle beyond your comprehension: the\nstruggle between anguish and peace; between falsehood and truth.\nSuddenly this struggle ended in a way that set us free. Everybody was\nat peace. They loved my memory, and I was happy even in my downfall,\nbecause I\'d done what should have been done, and cleared away my weak\nlife from interfering with their strong good lives. And yet we\'re all\nalive. When suddenly a bastard adventurer appears, who demands that I\nabet his filthy scheme. I drive him off as I would a diseased dog, but\nhe finds you, the defender of public justice, the appointed guardian\nof morality, to listen to him. And you, who receive on the 20th of\neach month a few kopeks\' gratuity for your wretched business, you get\ninto your uniform, and in good spirits proceed to torture--bully\npeople whose threshold you\'re not clean enough to pass. Then when\nyou\'ve had your fill of showing off your wretched power, oh, then you\nare satisfied, and sit and smile there in your damned complacent\ndignity. And....\n\nMAGISTRATE (raising his voice. Rising excitedly). Be silent or I\'ll\nhave you turned out.\n\nFEDYA. God! Who should I be afraid of! I\'m dead, dead, and away out of\nyour power. (Suddenly overcome with the horror of the situation.) What\ncan you do to me? How can you punish me--a corpse?\n\n     [Beating his breast.\n\nMAGISTRATE. Be silent! (To CLERK, who is down L.) Take him out!\n\n     [FEDYA turns, seeing his wife, he falls on his knees before\n      her ... kisses the hem of her dress, crying bitterly.\n\n     [Slowly he rises, pulls himself together with a great effort,\n      then exits L.\n\n     [The lights dim and out.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\nSCENE IV\n\nA corridor at the lower courts; in the background a door opposite\nwhich stands a GUARD; to the right is another door through which the\nPRISONERS are conducted to the court. IVAN PETROVICH in rags enters\nL., goes to this last door, trying to pass through it.\n\nGUARD (at door R. C.). Where do you think you\'re going, shoving in\nlike that?\n\nIVAN PETROVICH. Why shouldn\'t I? The law says these sessions are\npublic.\n\nGUARD. You can\'t get by and that\'s enough.\n\nIVAN PETROVICH (in pity). Wretched peasant, you have no idea to whom\nyou are speaking.\n\nGUARD. Be silent!\n\n     [Enter a YOUNG LAWYER from R. I.\n\nLAWYER (to Petrovich). Are you here on business?\n\nIVAN PETROVICH. No. I\'m the public. But this wretched peasant won\'t\nlet me pass.\n\nLAWYER. There\'s no room for the public at this trial.\n\nIVAN PETROVICH. Perhaps, but I am above the general rule.\n\nLAWYER. Well, you wait outside; they\'ll adjourn presently.\n\n     [He is just going into courtroom through door R. C. when PRINCE\n      SERGIUS enters L. and stops him.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. How does the case stand?\n\nLAWYER. The defense has just begun. Petrushin is speaking now.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. Are the Karenins bearing up well?\n\nLAWYER. Yes, with extraordinary dignity. They look as if they were the\njudges instead of the accused. That\'s felt all the way through, and\nPETRUSHIN is taking advantage of it.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. What of Protosov?\n\nLAWYER. He\'s frightfully unnerved, trembling all over, but that\'s\nnatural considering the sort of life he\'s led. Yes, he\'s all on edge,\nand he\'s interrupted, both judge and jury several times already.\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. How do you think it will end?\n\nLAWYER. Hard to say. The jury are mixed. At any rate I don\'t think\nthey\'ll find the Karenins guilty of premeditation. Do you want to go\nin?\n\nPRINCE SERGIUS. I should very much like to.\n\nLAWYER. Excuse me, you\'re Prince Sergius Abreskov, aren\'t you? (To the\nPrince.) There\'s an empty chair just at the left.\n\n     [The guard lets PRINCE SERGIUS pass.\n\nIVAN PETROVICH. Prince! Bah! I am an aristocrat of the soul, and\nthat\'s a higher title.\n\nLAWYER. Excuse me.\n\n     [And exits down R. C. into courtroom.\n\n     [PETUSHKOV, FEDYA\'S companion in the dive, enters approaching\n      IVAN PETROVICH.\n\nPETUSHKOV (R.). Oh, there you are. Well, how\'re things going?\n\nIVAN PETROVICH (L.). The speeches for the defense have begun, but this\nignorant rascal won\'t let us in. Curse his damned petty soul.\n\nGUARD (C.) Silence! Where do you think you are?\n\n     [Further applause is heard; door of the court opens, and there is\n      a rush of lawyers and the general public into the corridor.\n\nA LADY. Oh, it\'s simply wonderful! When he spoke I felt as if my heart\nwere breaking.\n\nAN OFFICER. It\'s all far better than a novel. But I don\'t see how she\ncould ever have loved him.

There.\n\n     [He hands FEDYA something; FEDYA hides it in his pocket.\n\nFEDYA (seeing PETUSHKOV). How foolish!

C., FEDYA\'S counsel, a stout man with\n      red cheeks; very animated.\n\nPETRUSHIN (rubbing his hands). Well, well, my friend. It\'s going along\nsplendidly. Only remember, don\'t go and spoil things for me in your\nlast speech.\n\nFEDYA (takes him by the arm). Tell me, what\'ll the worst be?\n\nPETRUSHIN. I\'ve already told you. Exile to Siberia.\n\nFEDYA. Who\'ll be exiled to Siberia?\n\nPETRUSHIN. You and your wife, naturally.\n\nFEDYA. And at the best?\n\nPETRUSHIN. Religious pardon and the annulment of the second marriage.\n\nFEDYA. You mean--that we should be bound again--to one another----\n\nPETRUSHIN. Yes. Only try to collect yourself. Keep up your courage.\nAfter all, there\'s no occasion for alarm.\n\nFEDYA. There couldn\'t be any other sentence, you\'re sure?\n\nPETRUSHIN. None other. None other.\n\n     [Exits R. I.

That piebald\nalways will....\n\nPETER. And where\'s Nikita?\n\nAKOULINA. Where\'s Nikita? Why, standing out there in the street.\n\nPETER. What\'s he standing there for?\n\nAKOULINA. What\'s he standing there for? He stands there jabbering.\n\nPETER. One can\'t get any sense out of her! Who\'s he jabbering with?\n\nAKOULINA (does not hear). Eh, what?\n\n     [PETER waves her off. She sits down to her spinning.\n\nNAN (running in to her mother). Nikita\'s father and mother have come.\nThey\'re going to take him away. It\'s true!\n\nANISYA. Nonsense!\n\nNAN. Yes. Blest if they\'re not! (Laughing.) I was just going by, and\nNikita, he says, "Good-bye, Anna Petrovna," he says, "you must come\nand dance at my wedding. I\'m leaving you," he says, and laughs.\n\nANISYA (to her husband). There now. Much he cares. You see, he wants\nto leave of himself. "Sack him" indeed!\n\nPETER. Well, let him go. Just as if I couldn\'t find somebody else.\n\nANISYA. And what about the money he\'s had in advance?\n\n     [NAN stands listening at the door for awhile, and then exit.\n\nPETER (frowning). The money? Well, he can work it off in summer,\nanyhow.\n\nANISYA. Well, of course you\'ll be glad if he goes and you\'ve not got\nto feed him. It\'s only me as\'ll have to work like a horse all the\nwinter. That lass of yours isn\'t over fond of work either. And you\'ll\nbe lying up on the oven. I know you.\n\nPETER. What\'s the good of wearing out one\'s tongue before one has the\nhang of the matter?\n\nANISYA. The yard\'s full of cattle. You\'ve not sold the cow, and have\nkept all the sheep for the winter: feeding and watering \'em alone\ntakes all one\'s time, and you want to sack the laborer. But I tell you\nstraight, I\'m not going to do a man\'s work! I\'ll go and lie on the top\nof the oven same as you, and let everything go to pot! You may do what\nyou like.\n\nPETER (to Akoulina). Go and see about the feeding, will you? it\'s\ntime.\n\nAKOULINA. The feeding? All right.\n\n     [Puts on a coat and takes a rope.\n\nANISYA. I\'m not going to work for you. You go and work yourself. I\'ve\nhad enough of it, so there!\n\nPETER. That\'ll do. What are you raving about? Like a sheep with the\nstaggers!\n\nANISYA. You\'re a crazy cur, you are! One gets neither work nor\npleasure from you. Eating your fill, that\'s all you do; you palsied\ncur, you!\n\nPETER (spits and puts on coat). Faugh! The Lord have mercy! I\'d better\ngo myself and see what\'s up.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nANISYA (after him). Scurvy long-nosed devil!\n\nAKOULINA. What are you swearing at dad for?\n\nANISYA. Hold your noise, you idiot!\n\nAKOULINA (going to the door). I know why you\'re swearing at him.\nYou\'re an idiot yourself, you bitch. I\'m not afraid of you.\n\nANISYA. What do you mean? (Jumps up and looks round for something to\nhit her with.) Mind, or I\'ll give you one with the poker.\n\nAKOULINA (opening the door). Bitch! devil! that\'s what you are! Devil!\nbitch! bitch! devil!\n\n     [Runs off.\n\nANISYA (ponders). "Come and dance at my wedding!" What new plan is\nthis? Marry? Mind. Nikita, if that\'s your intention, I\'ll go and....\nNo, I can\'t live without him. I won\'t let him go.\n\nNIKITA (enters, looks round, and, seeing Anisya alone, approaches\nquickly. In a low tone). Here\'s a go; I\'m in a regular fix! That\ngovernor of mine wants to take me away,--tells me I\'m to come home.\nSays quite straight I\'m to marry and live at home.\n\nANISYA. Well, go and marry! What\'s that to me?\n\nNIKITA. Is that it? Why, here am I reckoning how best to consider\nmatters, and just hear her! She tells me to go and marry. Why\'s that?\n(Winking.) Has she forgotten?\n\nANISYA. Yes, go and marry! What do I care?\n\nNIKITA. What are you spitting for? Just see, she won\'t even let me\nstroke her.... What\'s the matter?\n\nANISYA. This! That you want to play me false.... If you do,--why, I\ndon\'t want you either. So now you know!\n\nNIKITA. That\'ll do, Anisya. Do you think I\'ll forget you? Never while\nI live! I\'ll not play you false, that\'s flat. I\'ve been thinking that\nsupposing they do go and make me marry, I\'d still come back to you. If\nonly he don\'t make me live at home.\n\nANISYA. Much need I\'ll have of you, once you\'re married.\n\nNIKITA. There\'s a go now. How is it possible to go against one\'s\nfather\'s will?\n\nANISYA. Yes, I daresay, shove it all on your father. You know it\'s\nyour own doing. You\'ve long been plotting with that slut of yours,\nMARINA. It\'s she has put you up to it. She didn\'t come here for\nnothing t\'other day.\n\nNIKITA. Marina? What\'s she to me? Much I care about her!... Plenty of\nthem buzzing around.\n\nANISYA. Then what has made your father come here? It\'s you have told\nhim to. You\'ve gone and deceived me.\n\n     [Cries.\n\nNIKITA. Anisya, do you believe in a God or not? I never so much as\ndreamt of it. I know nothing at all about it. I never even dreamt of\nit--that\'s flat. My old dad has got it all out of his own pate.\n\nANISYA. If you don\'t wish it yourself who can force you? He can\'t\ndrive you like an ass.\n\nNIKITA. Well, I reckon it\'s not possible to go against one\'s parent.\nBut it\'s not by my wish.\n\nANISYA. Don\'t you budge, that\'s all about it!\n\nNIKITA. There was a fellow wouldn\'t budge, and the village elder gave\nhim such a hiding.... That\'s what it might come to! I\'ve no great wish\nfor that sort of thing. They say it touches one up....\n\nANISYA. Shut up with your nonsense. Nikita, listen to me: if you marry\nthat Marina I don\'t know what I won\'t do to myself.... I shall lay\nhands on myself! I have sinned, I have gone against the law, but I\ncan\'t go back now. If you go away I\'ll....\n\nNIKITA. Why should I go? Had I wanted to go--I should have gone long\nago. There was Ivan Semyonitch t\'other day--offered me a place as his\ncoachman.... Only fancy what a life that would have been! But I did\nnot go. Because, I reckon, I am good enough for any one. Now if you\ndid not love me it would be a different matter.\n\nANISYA. Yes, and that\'s what you should remember. My old man will die\none of these fine days, I\'m thinking; then we could cover our sin,\nmake it all right and lawful, and then you\'ll be master here.\n\nNIKITA. Where\'s the good of making plans? What do I care? I work as\nhard as if I were doing it for myself. My master loves me, and his\nmissus loves me. And if the wenches run after me, it\'s not my fault,\nthat\'s flat.\n\nANISYA. And you\'ll love me?\n\nNIKITA (embracing her). There, as you have ever been in my heart....\n\nMATRYONA (enters and crosses herself a long time before the icon.\nNIKITA and ANISYA step apart). What I saw I didn\'t perceive, what I\nheard, I didn\'t hearken to. Playing with the lass, eh? Well,--even a\ncalf will play. Why shouldn\'t one have some fun when one\'s young? But\nyour master is out in the yard a-calling you, sonny.\n\nNIKITA. I only came to get the axe.\n\nMATRYONA. I know, sonny, I know; them sort of axes are mostly to be\nfound where the women are.\n\nNIKITA (stooping to pick up axe). I say, mother, is it true you want\nme to marry? As I reckon, that\'s quite unnecessary. Besides, I\'ve got\nno wish that way.\n\nMATRYONA. Eh, honey! why should you marry? Go on as you are. It\'s all\nthe old man. You\'d better go, sonny; we can talk these matters over\nwithout you.\n\nNIKITA. It\'s a queer go! One moment I\'m to be married, the next, not.\nI can\'t make head or tail of it.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nANISYA. What\'s it all about, then? Do you really wish him to get\nmarried?\n\nMATRYONA. Eh, why should he marry, my jewel? It\'s all nonsense, all my\nold man\'s drivel. "Marry, marry." But he\'s reckoning without his host.\nYou know the saying, "From oats and hay, why should horses stray?"\nWhen you\'ve enough to spare, why look elsewhere? And so in this case.\n(Winks.) Don\'t I see which way the wind blows?\n\nANISYA. Where\'s the good of my pretending to you, Mother Matryona? You\nknow all about it. I have sinned. I love your son.\n\nMATRYONA. Dear me, here\'s news! D\'you think Mother Matryona didn\'t\nknow? Eh, lassie,--Mother Matryona\'s been ground, and ground again,\nground fine! This much I can tell you, my jewel: Mother Matryona can\nsee through a brick wall three feet thick. I know it all, my jewel! I\nknow what young wives need sleeping draughts for, so I\'ve brought some\nalong.\n\n     [Unties a knot in her handkerchief and brings out paper-packets.\n\nAs much as is wanted, I see, and what\'s not wanted I neither see nor\nperceive! There! Mother Matryona has also been young. I had to know a\nthing or two to live with my old fool. I know seventy-and-seven\ndodges. But I see your old man\'s quite seedy, quite seedy! How\'s one\nto live with such as him? Why, if you pricked him with a hayfork it\nwouldn\'t fetch blood. See if you don\'t bury him before the spring.\nThen you\'ll need some one in the house. Well, what\'s wrong with my\nson? He\'ll do as well as another. Then where\'s the advantage of my\ntaking him away from a good place? Am I my child\'s enemy?\n\nANISYA. Oh, if only he does not go away!\n\nMATRYONA. He won\'t go away, birdie. It\'s all nonsense. You know my old\nman. His wits are always wool-gathering; yet sometimes he takes a\nthing into his pate, and it\'s as if it were wedged in, you can\'t knock\nit out with a hammer.\n\nANISYA. And what started this business?\n\nMATRYONA. Well, you see, my jewel, you yourself know what a fellow\nwith women the lad is,--and he\'s handsome too, though I say it as\nshouldn\'t. Well, you know, he was living at the railway, and they had\nan orphan wench there to cook for them. Well, that same wench took to\nrunning after him.\n\nANISYA. Marina?\n\nMATRYONA. Yes, the plague seize her! Whether anything happened or not,\nanyhow something got to my old man\'s ears. Maybe he heard from the\nneighbors, maybe she\'s been and blabbed....\n\nANISYA. Well, she is a bold hussy!\n\nMATRYONA. So my old man--the old blockhead--off he goes: "Marry,\nmarry," he says, "he must marry her and cover the sin," he says. "We\nmust take the lad home," he says, "and he shall marry," he says. Well,\nI did my best to make him change his mind, but, dear me, no. So, all\nright, thinks I,--I\'ll try another dodge. One always has to entice\nthem fools in this way, just pretend to be of their mind, and when it\ncomes to the point one goes and turns it all one\'s own way. You know,\na woman has time to think seventy-and-seven thoughts while falling off\nthe oven, so how\'s such as he to see through it? "Well, yes," says I,\n"it would be a good job,--only we must consider well beforehand. Why\nnot go and see our son, and talk it over with Peter Ignatitch and hear\nwhat he has to say?" So here we are.\n\nANISYA. Oh dear, oh dear, how will it all end? Supposing his father\njust orders him to marry her?\n\nMATRYONA. Orders, indeed! Chuck his orders to the dogs! Don\'t you\nworry; that affair will never come off. I\'ll go to your old man\nmyself, and sift and strain this matter clear--there will be none of\nit left. I have come here only for the look of the thing. A very\nlikely thing! Here\'s my son living in happiness and expecting\nhappiness, and I\'ll go and match him with a slut! No fear, I\'m not a\nfool!\n\nANISYA. And she--this Marina--came dangling after him here! Mother,\nwould you believe, when they said he was going to marry, it was as if\na knife had gone right through my heart. I thought he cared for her.\n\nMATRYONA. Oh, my jewel! Why, you don\'t think him such a fool, that he\nshould go and care for a homeless baggage like that? Nikita is a\nsensible fellow, you see. He knows whom to love. So don\'t you go and\nfret, my jewel. We\'ll not take him away, and we won\'t marry him. No,\nwe\'ll let him stay on, if you\'ll only oblige us with a little money.\n\nANISYA. All I know is, that I could not live if Nikita went away.\n\nMATRYONA. Naturally, when one\'s young it\'s no easy matter! You, a\nwench in full bloom, to be living with the dregs of a man like that\nhusband of yours.\n\nANISYA. Mother Matryona, would you believe it? I\'m that sick of him,\nthat sick of this long-nosed cur of mine, I can hardly bear to look at\nhim.\n\nMATRYONA. Yes, I see, it\'s one of them cases. Just look here. (Looks\nround and whispers.) I\'ve been to see that old man, you know he\'s\ngiven me simples of two kinds. This, you see, is a sleeping draught.\n"Just give him one of these powders," he says, "and he\'ll sleep so\nsound you might jump on him!" And this here, "This is that kind of\nsimple," he says, "that if you give one some of it to drink it has no\nsmell whatever, but its strength is very great. There are seven doses\nhere, a pinch at a time. Give him seven pinches," he says, "and she\nwon\'t have far to look for freedom," he says.\n\nANISYA. O-o-oh! What\'s that?\n\nMATRYONA. "No sign whatever," he says. He\'s taken a rouble for it.\n"Can\'t sell it for less," he says. Because it\'s no easy matter to get\n\'em, you know. I paid him, dearie, out of my own money. If she takes\nthem, thinks I, it\'s all right; if she don\'t, I can let old Michael\'s\ndaughter have them.\n\nANISYA. O-o-oh! But mayn\'t some evil come of them? I\'m frightened!\n\nMATRYONA. What evil, my jewel? If your old man was hale and hearty,\n\'twould be a different matter, but he\'s neither alive nor dead as it\nis. He\'s not for this world. Such things often happen.\n\nANISYA. O-o-oh, my poor head! I\'m afeared, Mother Matryona, lest some\nevil come of them. No. That won\'t do.\n\nMATRYONA. Just as you like. I might even return them to him.\n\nANISYA. And are they to be used in the same way as the others? Mixed\nin water?\n\nMATRYONA. Better in tea, he says. "You can\'t notice anything," he says,\n"no smell nor nothing." He\'s a cute old fellow, too.\n\nANISYA (taking the powder). O-oh, my poor head! Could I have ever\nthought of such a thing if my life were not a very hell?\n\nMATRYONA. You\'ll not forget that rouble? I promised to take it to the\nold man. He\'s had some trouble, too.\n\nANISYA. Of course?\n\n     [Goes to her box and hides the powders.\n\nMATRYONA. And now, my jewel, keep it as close as you can, so that no\none should find it out. Heaven defend that it should happen, but if\nany one notices it, tell \'em it\'s for the black-beetles. (Takes the\nrouble.) It\'s also used for beetles. (Stops short.)\n\n     [Enter AKIM, who crosses himself in front of the icon, and then\n      PETER, who sits down.\n\nPETER. Well, then, how\'s it to be, Daddy Akim?\n\nAKIM. As it\'s best, Peter Ignatitch, as it\'s best.... I mean--as it\'s\nbest. \'Cos why? I\'m afeared of what d\'you call \'ems, some tomfoolery,\nyou know. I\'d like to, what d\'you call it.... to start, you know,\nstart the lad honest, I mean. But supposing you\'d rather, what d\'you\ncall it, we might, I mean, what\'s name? As it\'s best....\n\nPETER. All right. All right. Sit down and let\'s talk it over. (Akim\nsits down.) Well, then, what\'s it all about? You want him to marry?\n\nMATRYONA. As to marrying, he might bide a while, Peter Ignatitch. You\nknow our poverty, Peter Ignatitch. What\'s he to marry on? We\'ve hardly\nenough to eat ourselves. How can he marry then?...\n\nPETER. You must consider what will be best.\n\nMATRYONA. Where\'s the hurry for him to get married? Marriage is not\nthat sort of thing, it\'s not like ripe raspberries that drop off if\nnot picked in time.\n\nPETER. If he were to get married, \'twould be a good thing in a way.\n\nAKIM. We\'d like to ... what d\'you call it? \'Cos why, you see. I\'ve\nwhat d\'you call it ... a job. I mean, I\'ve found a paying job in town,\nyou know.\n\nMATRYONA. And a fine job too--cleaning out cesspools. The other day\nwhen he came home, I could do nothing but spew and spew. Faugh!\n\nAKIM. It\'s true, at first it does seem what d\'you call it ... "knocks\none clean over," you know,--the smell, I mean. But one gets used to\nit, and then it\'s nothing, no worse than malt grain, and then it\'s,\nwhat d\'you call it, ... pays, pays, I mean. And as to the smell being,\nwhat d\'you call it, it\'s not for the likes of us to complain. And one\nchanges one\'s clothes. So we\'d like to take what\'s his name ...\nNIKITA, I mean, home. Let him manage things at home while I, what\nd\'you call it,--earn something in town.\n\nPETER. You want to keep your son at home? Yes, that would be well: but\nhow about the money he has had in advance?\n\nAKIM. That\'s it, that\'s it! It\'s just as you Say, Ignatitch, it\'s just\nwhat d\'you call it. \'Cos why? If you go into service, it\'s as good as\nif you had sold yourself, they say. That will be all right. I mean he\nmay stay and serve his time, only he must, what d\'you call it, get\nmarried. I mean--so: you let him off for a little while, that he may,\nwhat d\'you call it?\n\nPETER. Yes, we could manage that.\n\nMATRYONA. Ah, but it\'s not yet settled between ourselves, Peter\nIgnatitch. I\'ll speak to you as I would before God, and you may judge\nbetween my old man and me. He goes on harping on that marriage. But\njust ask--who it is he wants him to marry. If it were a girl of the\nright sort now--I am not my child\'s enemy, but the wench is not\nhonest.\n\nAKIM. No, that\'s wrong! Wrong, I say. \'Cos why? She, that same girl--\nit\'s my son as has offended, offended the girl I mean.\n\nPETER. How offended?\n\nAKIM. That\'s how. She\'s what d\'you call it, with him, with my son,\nNIKITA. With Nikita, what d\'you call it, mean.\n\nMATRYONA. You wait a bit, my tongue runs smoother--let me tell it. You\nknow, this lad of ours lived at the railway before he came to you.\nThere was a girl there as kept dangling after him. A girl of no\naccount, you know; her name\'s Marina. She used to cook for the men. So\nnow this same girl accuses our son, Nikita, that he, so to say,\ndeceived her.\n\nPETER. Well, there\'s nothing good in that.\n\nMATRYONA. But she\'s no honest girl herself; she runs after the fellows\nlike a common slut.\n\nAKIM. There you are again, old woman, and it\'s not at all what d\'you\ncall it, it\'s all not what d\'you call it, I mean....\n\nMATRYONA. There now, that\'s all the sense one gets from my old owl--\n"what d\'you call it, what d\'you call it," and he doesn\'t know himself\nwhat he means. Peter Ignatitch, don\'t listen to me, but go yourself\nand ask any one you like about the girl, everybody will say the same.\nShe\'s just a homeless good-for-nothing.\n\nPETER. You know, Daddy Akim, if that\'s how things are, there\'s no\nreason for him to marry her. A daughter-in-law\'s not like a shoe, you\ncan\'t kick her off.\n\nAKIM (excitedly). It\'s false, old woman, it\'s what d\'you call it,\nfalse; I mean, about the girl; false! \'Cos why? The lass is a good\nlass, a very good lass, you know. I\'m sorry, sorry for the lassie, I\nmean.\n\nMATRYONA. It\'s an old saying: "For the wide world old Miriam grieves,\nand at home without bread her children she leaves." He\'s sorry for the\ngirl, but not sorry for his own son! Sling her round your neck and\ncarry her about with you! That\'s enough of such empty cackle!\n\nAKIM. No, it\'s not empty.\n\nMATRYONA. There, don\'t interrupt, let me have my say.\n\nAKIM (interrupts). No, not empty! I mean, you twist things your own\nway, about the lass or about yourself. Twist them, I mean, to make it\nbetter for yourself; but God, what d\'you call it, turns them His way.\nThat\'s how it is.\n\nMATRYONA. Eh! One only wears out one\'s tongue with you.\n\nAKIM. The lass is hard-working and spruce, and keeps everything round\nherself ... what d\'you call it. And in our poverty, you know, it\'s a\npair of hands, I mean; and the wedding needn\'t cost much. But the\nchief thing\'s the offence, the offence to the lass, and she\'s a what\nd\'you call it, an orphan, you know; that\'s what she is, and there\'s\nthe offence.\n\nMATRYONA. Eh! they\'ll all tell you a tale of that sort....\n\nANISYA. Daddy Akim, you\'d better listen to us women; we can tell you a\nthing or two.\n\nAKIM. And God, how about God? Isn\'t she a human being, the lass? A\nwhat d\'you call it,--also a human being I mean, before God. And how do\nyou look at it?\n\nMATRYONA. Eh! ... started off again?...\n\nPETER. Wait a bit, Daddy Akim. One can\'t believe all these girls say,\neither. The lad\'s alive, and not far away; send for him, and find out\nstraight from him if it\'s true. He won\'t wish to lose his soul. Go and\ncall the fellow, (Anisya rises) and tell him his father wants him.\n\n     [Exit ANISYA.\n\nMATRYONA. That\'s right, dear friend; you\'ve cleared the way clean, as\nwith water. Yes, let the lad speak for himself. Nowadays, you know,\nthey\'ll not let you force a son to marry; one must first of all ask\nthe lad. He\'ll never consent to marry her and disgrace himself, not\nfor all the world. To my thinking, it\'s best he should go on living\nwith you and serving you as his master. And we need not take him home\nfor the summer either; we can hire a help. If you would only give us\nten roubles now, we\'ll let him stay on. Peter. All in good time. First\nlet us settle one thing before we start another. Akim. You see, Peter\nIgnatitch, I speak. \'Cos why? you know how it happens. We try to fix\nthings up as seems best for ourselves, you know; and as to God, we\nwhat d\'you call it, we forget Him. We think it\'s best so, turn it our\nown way, and lo! we\'ve got into a fix, you know. We think it will be\nbest, I mean; and lo! it turns out much worse--without God, I mean.\n\nPETER. Of course one must not forget God.\n\nAKIM. It turns out worse! But when it\'s the right way--God\'s way--it\nwhat d\'you call it, it gives one joy; seems pleasant, I mean. So I\nreckon, you see, get him, the lad, I mean, get him to marry her, to\nkeep him from sin, I mean, and let him what d\'you call it at home, as\nit\'s lawful, I mean, while I go and get the job in town. The work is\nof the right sort--it\'s payin\', I mean. And in God\'s sight it\'s what\nd\'you call it--it\'s best, I mean. Ain\'t she an orphan? Here, for\nexample, a year ago some fellows went and took timber from the\nsteward,--thought they\'d do the steward, you know. Yes, they did the\nsteward, but they couldn\'t what d\'you call it--do God, I mean. Well,\nand so....\n\n     [Enter NIKITA and NAN.\n\nNIKITA. You called me?\n\n     [Sits down and takes out his tobacco-pouch.\n\nPETER (in a low, reproachful voice). What are you thinking about--have\nyou no manners? Your father is going to speak to you, and you sit down\nand fool about with tobacco. Come, get up!\n\n     [NIKITA rises, leans carelessly with his elbow on the table, and\nsmiles.\n\nAKIM. It seems there\'s a complaint, you know, about you, Nikita--a\ncomplaint, I mean, a complaint.\n\nNIKITA. Who\'s been complaining?\n\nAKIM. Complaining? It\'s a maid, an orphan maid, complaining, I mean.\nIt\'s her, you know--a complaint against you, from Marina, I mean.\n\nNIKITA (laughs). Well, that\'s a good one. What\'s the complaint? And\nwho\'s told you--she herself?\n\nAKIM. It\'s I am asking you, and you must now, what d\'you call it, give\nme an answer. Have you got mixed up with the lass, I mean--mixed up,\nyou know?\n\nNIKITA. I don\'t know what you mean. What\'s up?\n\nAKIM. Foolin\', I mean, what d\'you call it? foolin\'. Have you been\nfoolin\' with her, I mean?\n\nNIKITA. Never mind what\'s been! Of course one does have some fun with\na cook now and then to while away the time. One plays the concertina\nand gets her to dance. What of that?\n\nPETER. Don\'t shuffle, Nikita, but answer your father straight out.\n\nAKIM (solemnly). You can hide it from men but not from God, Nikita.\nYou, what d\'you call it--think, I mean, and don\'t tell lies. She\'s an\norphan; so, you see, any one is free to insult her. An orphan, you\nsee. So you should say what\'s rightest.\n\nNIKITA. But what if I have nothing to say? I have told you everything\n--because there isn\'t anything to tell, that\'s flat! (Getting excited.)\nShe can go and say anything about me, same as if she was speaking of\none as is dead. Why don\'t she say anything about Fedka Mikishin?\nBesides, how\'s this, that one mayn\'t even have a bit of fun nowadays?\nAnd as for her, well, she\'s free to say anything she likes.\n\nAKIM. Ah, Nikita, mind! A lie will out. Did anything happen?\n\nNIKITA (aside). How he sticks to it; it\'s too bad. (To Akim.) I tell\nyou, I know nothing more. There\'s been nothing between us. (Angrily.)\nBy God! and may I never leave this spot (crosses himself) if I know\nanything about it. (Silence. Then still more excitedly.) Why! have you\nbeen thinking of getting me to marry her? What do you mean by it?--\nit\'s a confounded shame. Besides, nowadays you\'ve got no such rights\nas to force a fellow to marry. That\'s plain enough. Besides, haven\'t I\nsworn I know nothing about it?\n\nMATRYONA (to her husband). There now, that\'s just like your silly\npate, to believe all they tell you. He\'s gone and put the lad to shame\nall for nothing. The best thing is to let him live as he is living,\nwith his master. His master will help us in our present need, and give\nus ten roubles, and when the time comes....\n\nPETER. Well, Daddy Akim, how\'s it to be?\n\nAKIM (looks at his son, clicking his tongue disapprovingly). Mind,\nNikita, the tears of one that\'s been wronged never, what d\'you call\nit--never fall beside the mark but always on, what\'s name--the head of\nthe man as did the wrong. So mind, don\'t what d\'you call it.\n\nNIKITA (sits down). What\'s there to mind? mind yourself.\n\nNAN (aside). I must run and tell mother.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nMATRYONA (to Peter). That\'s always the way with this old mumbler of\nmine, Peter Ignatitch. Once he\'s got anything wedged in his pate\nthere\'s no knocking it out. We\'ve gone and troubled you all for\nnothing. The lad can go on living as he has been. Keep him; he\'s your\nservant.\n\nPETER. Well, Daddy Akim, what do you say?\n\nAKIM. Why, the lad\'s his own master, if only he what d\'you call it....\nI only wish that, what d\'you call it, I mean.\n\nMATRYONA. You don\'t know yourself what you\'re jawing about. The lad\nhimself has no wish to leave. Besides, what do we want with him at\nhome? We can manage without him.\n\nPETER. Only one thing, Daddy Akim--if you are thinking of taking him\nback in summer, I don\'t want him here for the winter. If he is to stay\nat all, it must be for the whole year.\n\nMATRYONA. And it\'s for a year he\'ll bind himself. If we want help when\nthe press of work comes, we can hire help, and the lad shall remain\nwith you. Only give us ten roubles now....\n\nPETER. Well then, is it to be for another year?\n\nAKIM (sighing). Yes, it seems, it what d\'you call it ... if it\'s so, I\nmean, it seems that it must be what d\'you call it.\n\nMATRYONA. For a year, counting from St. Dimitry\'s day. We know you\'ll\npay him fair wages. But give us ten roubles now. Help us out of our\ndifficulties. (Gets up and bows to Peter.)\n\n     [Enter NAN and ANISYA. The latter sits down at one side.\n\nPETER. Well, if that\'s settled we might step across to the inn and\nhave a drink. Come, Daddy Akim, what do you say to a glass of vodka?\n\nAKIM. No, I never drink that sort of thing.\n\nPETER. Well, you\'ll have some tea?\n\nAKIM. Ah, tea! yes, I do sin that way. Yes, tea\'s the thing.\n\nPETER. And the women will also have some tea. Come. And you, Nikita,\ngo and drive the sheep in and clear away the straw.\n\nNIKITA. All right. (Exeunt all but NIKITA. NIKITA lights a cigarette.\nIt grows darker.) Just see how they bother one. Want a fellow to tell\n\'em how he larks about with the wenches! It would take long to tell\n\'em all those stories--"Marry her," he says. Marry them all! One would\nhave a good lot of wives! And what need have I to marry? Am as good as\nmarried now! There\'s many a chap as envies me. Yet how strange it felt\nwhen I crossed myself before the icon. It was just as if some one\nshoved me. The whole web fell to pieces at once. They say it\'s\nfrightening to swear what\'s not true. That\'s all humbug. It\'s all\ntalk, that is. It\'s simple enough.\n\nAKOULINA (enters with a rope, which she puts down. She takes off her\noutdoor things and goes into closet). You might at least have got a\nlight.\n\nNIKITA. What, to look at you? I can see you well enough without.\n\nAKOULINA. Oh, bother you!\n\n     [NAN enters and whispers to NIKITA.\n\nNAN. Nikita, there\'s a person wants you. There is!\n\nNIKITA. What person?\n\nNAN. Marina from the railway; she\'s out there, round the corner.\n\nNIKITA. Nonsense!\n\nNAN. Blest if she isn\'t! Nikita. What does she want?\n\nNAN. She wants you to come out. She says, "I only want to say a word\nto Nikita." I began asking, but she won\'t tell, but only says, "Is it\ntrue he\'s leaving you?" And I say, "No, only his father wanted to take\nhim away and get him to marry, but he won\'t, and is going to stay with\nus another year." And she says, "For goodness\' sake send him out to\nme. I must see him," she says, "I must say a word to him somehow."\nShe\'s been waiting a long time. Why don\'t you go?\n\nNIKITA. Bother her! What should I go for?\n\nNAN. She says, "If he don\'t come, I\'ll go into the hut to him." Blest\nif she didn\'t say she\'d come in!\n\nNIKITA. Not likely. She\'ll wait a bit and then go away.\n\nNAN. "Or is it," she says, "that they want him to marry Akoulina?"\n\n     [Re-enter AKOULINA, passing near NIKITA to take her distaff.\n\nAKOULINA. Marry whom to Akoulina?\n\nNAN. Why, Nikita. Akoulina. A likely thing! Who says it?\n\nNIKITA (looks at her and laughs). It seems people do say it. Would you\nmarry me, Akoulina?\n\nAKOULINA. Who, you? Perhaps I might have afore, but I won\'t now.\n\nNIKITA. And why not now? Akoulina. \'Cos you wouldn\'t love me.\n\nNIKITA. Why not? Akoulina. \'Cos you\'d be forbidden to.\n\n     [Laughs.\n\nNIKITA. Who\'d forbid it?\n\nAKOULINA. Who? My step-mother. She does nothing but grumble, and is\nalways staring at you.\n\nNIKITA (laughing). Just hear her! Ain\'t she cute?\n\nAKOULINA. Who? Me? What\'s there to be cute about? Am I blind? She\'s\nbeen rowing and rowing at dad all day. The fat-muzzled witch!\n\n     [Goes into closet.\n\nNAN (looking out of the window). Look, Nikita, she\'s coming! I\'m blest\nif she isn\'t! I\'ll go away.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nMARINA (enters). What are you doing with me?\n\nNIKITA. Doing? I\'m not doing anything.\n\nMARINA. You mean to desert me.\n\nNIKITA (gets up angrily). What does this look like, your coming here?\n\nMARINA. Oh, Nikita!\n\nNIKITA. Well, you are strange! What have you come for?\n\nMARINA. Nikita!\n\nNIKITA. That\'s my name. What do you want with Nikita? Well, what next?\nGo away, I tell you!\n\nMARINA. I see, you do want to throw me over.\n\nNIKITA. Well, and what\'s there to remember? You yourself don\'t know.\nWhen you stood out there round the corner and sent Nan for me, and I\ndidn\'t come, wasn\'t it plain enough that you\'re not wanted? It seems\npretty simple. So there--go!\n\nMARINA. Not wanted! So now I\'m not wanted! I believed you when you\nsaid you would love me. And now that you\'ve ruined me, I\'m not wanted.\n\nNIKITA. Where\'s the good of talking? This is quite improper. You\'ve\nbeen telling tales to father. Now, do go away, will you?\n\nMARINA. You know yourself I never loved any one but you. Whether you\nmarried me or not, I\'d not have been angry. I\'ve done you no wrong,\nthen why have you left off caring for me? Why?\n\nNIKITA. Where\'s the use of baying at the moon? You go away. Goodness\nme! what a duffer!\n\nMARINA. It\'s not that you deceived me when you promised to marry me\nthat hurts, but that you\'ve left off loving. No, it\'s not that you\'ve\nstopped loving me either, but that you\'ve changed me for another,\nthat\'s what hurts. I know who it is!\n\nNIKITA (comes up to her viciously). Eh! what\'s the good of talking to\nthe likes of you, that won\'t listen to reason? Be off, or you\'ll drive\nme to do something you\'ll be sorry for.\n\nMARINA. What, will you strike me, then? Well then, strike me! What are\nyou turning away for? Ah, Nikita!\n\nNIKITA. Supposing some one came in. Of course, it\'s quite improper.\nAnd what\'s the good of talking?\n\nMARINA. So this is the end of it! What has been has flown. You want me\nto forget it? Well then, Nikita, listen. I kept my maiden honor as the\napple of my eye. You have ruined me for nothing, you have deceived me.\nYou have no pity on a fatherless and motherless girl! (Weeping.) You\nhave deserted, you have killed me, but I bear you no malice. God\nforgive you! If you find a better one you\'ll forget me, if a worse one\nyou\'ll remember me. Yes, you will remember, Nikita! Good-bye, then, if\nit is to be. Oh, how I loved you! Good-bye for the last time.\n\n     [Takes his head in her hands and tries to kiss him.\n\nNIKITA (tossing his head back). I\'m not going to talk with the likes\nof you. If you won\'t go away I will, and you may stay here by\nyourself.\n\nMARINA (screams). You are a brute. (In the doorway.) God will give you\nno joy.\n\n     [Exit, crying.\n\nAKOULINA (comes out of closet). You\'re a dog, Nikita!\n\nNIKITA. What\'s up?\n\nAKOULINA. What a cry she gave!\n\n     [Cries.\n\nNIKITA. What\'s up with you?\n\nAKOULINA. What\'s up? You\'ve hurt her, ... That\'s the way you\'ll hurt\nme also. You\'re a dog.\n\n     [Exit into closet.\n\n     [Silence.\n\nNIKITA. Here\'s a fine muddle. I\'m as sweet as honey on the lasses, but\nwhen a fellow\'s sinned with \'em it\'s a bad look-out!\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\nThe scene represents the village street. To the left the outside of\nPETER\'S hut, built of logs, with a porch in the middle; to the right\nof the hut the gates and a corner of the yard buildings. ANISYA is\nbeating hemp in the street near the corner of the yard. Six months\nhave elapsed since the First Act.\n\nANISYA (stops and listens). Mumbling something again. He\'s probably\ngot off the stove.\n\n     [AKOULINA enters, carrying two pails on a yoke.\n\nANISYA. He\'s calling. You go and see what he wants, kicking up such a\nrow.\n\nAKOULINA. Why don\'t you go?\n\nANISYA. Go, I tell you!\n\n     [Exit AKOULINA into hut.\n\nHe\'s bothering me to death. Won\'t let out where the money is, and\nthat\'s all about it. He was out in the passage the other day. He must\nhave been hiding it there. Now, I don\'t know myself where it is. Thank\ngoodness he\'s afraid of parting with it, so that at least it will stay\nin the house. If only I could manage to find it. He hadn\'t it on him\nyesterday. Now I don\'t know where it can be. He has quite worn the\nlife out of me.\n\n     [Enter AKOULINA, tying her kerchief over her head.\n\nANISYA. Where are you off to?\n\nAKOULINA. Where? Why, he\'s told me to go for Aunt Martha. "Fetch my\nsister," he says. "I am going to die," he says. "I have a word to say\nto her."\n\nANISYA (aside). Asking for his sister? Oh, my poor head! Sure he wants\nto give it her. What shall I do? Oh! (To AKOULINA.) Don\'t go! Where\nare you off to?\n\nAKOULINA. To call Aunt.\n\nANISYA. Don\'t go I tell you, I\'ll go myself. You go and take the\nclothes to the river to rinse. Else you\'ll not have finished by the\nevening.\n\nAKOULINA. But he told me to go.\n\nANISYA. You go and do as you\'re bid. I tell you I\'ll fetch Martha\nmyself. Take the shirts off the fence.\n\nAKOULINA. The shirts? But maybe you\'ll not go. He\'s given the order.\n\nANISYA. Didn\'t I say I\'d go? Where\'s Nan?\n\nAKOULINA. Nan? Minding the calves.\n\nANISYA. Send her here. I dare say they\'ll not run away.\n\n     [AKOULINA collects the clothes, and exit.\n\nANISYA. If one doesn\'t go he\'ll scold. If one goes he\'ll give the\nmoney to his sister. All my trouble will be wasted. I don\'t myself\nknow what I\'m to do. My poor head\'s splitting.\n\n     [Continues to work.\n\n     [Enter MATRYONA, with a stick and a bundle, in outdoor clothes.\n\nMATRYONA. May the Lord help you, honey.\n\nANISYA (looks round, stops working, and claps her hands with joy).\nWell, I never expected this! Mother Matryona, God has sent the right\nguest at the right time.\n\nMATRYONA. Well, how are things?\n\nANISYA. Ah, I\'m driven well-nigh crazy. It\'s awful!\n\nMATRYONA. Well, still alive, I hear?\n\nANISYA. Oh, don\'t talk about it. He doesn\'t live and doesn\'t die!\n\nMATRYONA. But the money--has he given it to anybody?\n\nANISYA. He\'s just sending for his sister Martha--probably about the\nmoney.\n\nMATRYONA. Well, naturally! But hasn\'t he given it to any one else?\n\nANISYA. To no one. I watch like a hawk.\n\nMATRYONA. And where is it?\n\nANISYA. He doesn\'t let out. And I can\'t find out in any way. He hides\nit now here, now there, and I can\'t do anything because of Akoulina.\nIdiot though she is, she keeps watch, and is always about. Oh my poor\nhead! I\'m bothered to death.\n\nMATRYONA. Oh, my jewel, if he gives the money to any one but you,\nyou\'ll never cease regretting it as long as you live! They\'ll turn you\nout of house and home without anything. You\'ve been worriting, and\nworriting all your life with one you don\'t love, and will have to go\na-begging when you are a widow.\n\nANISYA. No need to tell me, mother. My heart\'s that weary, and I don\'t\nknow what to do. No one to get a bit of advice from. I told Nikita,\nbut he\'s frightened of the job. The only thing he did was to tell me\nyesterday it was hidden under the floor.\n\nMATRYONA. Well, and did you look there?\n\nANISYA. I couldn\'t. The old man himself was in the room. I notice that\nsometimes he carries it about on him, and sometimes he hides it.\n\nMATRYONA. But you, my lass, must remember that if once he gives you\nthe slip there\'s no getting it right again! (Whispering.) Well, and\ndid you give him the strong tea?\n\nANISYA. Oh! oh!...\n\n     [About to answer, but sees neighbor and stops.\n\n     [The NEIGHBOR (a woman) passes the hut, and listens to a call from\n      within.\n\nNEIGHBOR (to Anisya). I say, Anisya! Oh, Anisya! There\'s your old man\ncalling, I think.\n\nANISYA. That\'s the way he always coughs,--just as if he were screaming.\nHe\'s getting very bad.\n\nNEIGHBOR (approaches MATRYONA). How do you do, granny? Have you come\nfar?\n\nMATRYONA. Straight from home, dear. Come to see my son. Brought him\nsome shirts--can\'t help thinking of these things, you see, when it\'s\none\'s own child.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Yes, that\'s always so. (To Anisya.) And I was thinking of\nbeginning to bleach the linen, but it is a bit early, no one has begun\nyet.\n\nANISYA. Where\'s the hurry?\n\nMATRYONA. Well, and has he had communion?\n\nANISYA. Oh, dear, yes, the priest was here yesterday.\n\nNEIGHBOR. I had a look at him yesterday. Dearie me! one wonders his\nbody and soul keep together. And, O Lord, the other day he seemed just\nat his last gasp, so that they laid him under the holy icons.[1] They\nstarted lamenting and got ready to lay him out.\n\nANISYA. He came to, and creeps about again.\n\nMATRYONA. Well, and is he to have extreme unction?\n\nANISYA. The neighbors advise it. If he lives till to-morrow we\'ll send\nfor the priest.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Oh, Anisya dear, I should think your heart must be heavy. As\nthe saying goes, "Not he is sick that\'s ill in bed, but he that sits\nand waits in dread."\n\nANISYA. Yes, if it were only over one way or other!\n\nNEIGHBOR. Yes, that\'s true, dying for a year, it\'s no joke. You\'re\nbound hand and foot like that.\n\nMATRYONA. Ah, but a widow\'s lot is also bitter. It\'s all right as long\nas one\'s young, but who\'ll care for you when you\'re old? Oh yes, old\nage is not pleasure. Just look at me. I\'ve not walked very far, and\nyet am so footsore I don\'t know how to stand. Where\'s my son?\n\nANISYA. Ploughing. But you come in and we\'ll get the samovar ready;\nthe tea\'ll set you up again.\n\nMATRYONA (sitting down). Yes, it\'s true, I\'m quite done up, my dears.\nAs to extreme unction, that\'s absolutely necessary. Besides, they say\nit\'s good for the soul.\n\nANISYA. Yes, we\'ll send to-morrow.\n\nMATRYONA. Yes, you had better. And we\'ve had a wedding down in our\nparts.\n\nNEIGHBOR. What, in spring?[2]\n\nMATRYONA. Ah, now if it were a poor man, then, as the saying is, it\'s\nalways unseasonable for a poor man to marry. But it\'s Simon\nMatveyitch, he\'s married that Marina.\n\nANISYA. What luck for her!\n\nNEIGHBOR. He\'s a widower. I suppose there are children?\n\nMATRYONA. Four of \'em. What decent girl would have him! Well, so he\'s\ntaken her, and she\'s glad. You see, the vessel was not sound, so the\nwine trickled out.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Oh, my! And what do people say to it? And he, a rich\npeasant!\n\nMATRYONA. They are living well enough so far.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Yes, it\'s true enough. Who wants to marry where there are\nchildren? There now, there\'s our Michael. He\'s such a fellow, dear\nme....\n\nPEASANT\'S VOICE. Hullo, Mavra. Where the devil are you? Go and drive\nthe cow in.\n\n     [Exit NEIGHBOR.\n\nMATRYONA (while the NEIGHBOR is within hearing speaks in her ordinary\nvoice). Yes, lass, thank goodness, she\'s married. At any rate my old\nfool won\'t go bothering about Nikita. Now (suddenly changing her\ntone), she\'s gone! (Whispers.) I say, did you give him the tea?\n\nANISYA. Don\'t speak about it. He\'d better die of himself. It\'s no use\n--he doesn\'t die, and I have only taken a sin on my soul. O-oh, my\nhead, my head! Oh, why did you give me those powders?\n\nMATRYONA. What of the powders? The sleeping powders, lass,--why not\ngive them? No evil can come of them.\n\nANISYA. I am not talking of the sleeping ones, but the others, the\nwhite ones.\n\nMATRYONA. Well, honey, those powders are medicinal.\n\nANISYA (sighs). I know, yet it\'s frightening. Though he\'s worried me\nto death.\n\nMATRYONA. Well, and did you use many?\n\nANISYA. I gave two doses.\n\nMATRYONA. Was anything noticeable?\n\nANISYA. I had a taste of the tea myself--just a little bitter. And he\ndrank them with the tea and says, "Even tea disgusts me," and I say,\n"Everything tastes bitter when one\'s sick." But I felt that scared,\nmother.\n\nMATRYONA. Don\'t go thinking about it. The more one thinks the worse it\nis.\n\nANISYA. I wish you\'d never given them to me and led me into sin. When\nI think of it something seems to tear my heart. Oh, dear, why did you\ngive them to me?\n\nMATRYONA. What do you mean, honey? Lord help you! Why are you turning\nit on to me? Mind, lass, don\'t go twisting matters from the sick on to\nthe healthy. If anything were to happen, I stand aside! I know\nnothing! I\'m aware of nothing! I\'ll kiss the cross on it; I never gave\nyou any kind of powders, never saw any, never heard of any, and never\nknew there were such powders. You think about yourself, lass. Why, we\nwere talking about you the other day. "Poor thing, what torture she\nendures. The step-daughter an idiot; the old man rotten, sucking her\nlifeblood. What wouldn\'t one be ready to do in such a case!"\n\nANISYA. I\'m not going to deny it. A life such as mine could make one\ndo worse than that. It could make you hang yourself or throttle him.\nIs this a life?\n\nMATRYONA. That\'s just it. There\'s no time to stand gaping; the money\nmust be found one way or other, and then he must have his tea.\n\nANISYA. O-oh, my head, my head! I can\'t think what to do. I am so\nfrightened; he\'d better die of himself. I don\'t want to have it on my\nsoul.\n\nMATRYONA (viciously). And why doesn\'t he show the money? Does he mean\nto take it along with him? Is no one to have it? Is that right? God\nforbid such a sum should be lost all for nothing. Isn\'t that a sin?\nWhat\'s he doing? Is he worth considering?\n\nANISYA. I don\'t know anything. He\'s worried me to death.\n\nMATRYONA. What is it you don\'t know? The business is clear. If you\nmake a slip now, you\'ll repent it all your life. He\'ll give the money\nto his sister and you\'ll be left without.\n\nANISYA. O--oh dear! Yes, and he did send for her--I must go.\n\nMATRYONA. You wait a bit and light the samovar first. We\'ll give him\nsome tea and search him together--we\'ll find it, no fear.\n\nANISYA. Oh dear, oh dear; supposing something were to happen.\n\nMATRYONA. What now? What\'s the good of waiting? Do you want the money\nto slip from your hand when it\'s just in sight? You go and do as I\nsay.\n\nANISYA. Well, I\'ll go and light the samovar.\n\nMATRYONA. Go, honey, do the business so as not to regret it\nafterwards. That\'s right!\n\n     [ANISYA turns to go. MATRYONA calls her back.\n\nMATRYONA. Just a word. Don\'t tell Nikita about the business. He\'s\nsilly. God forbid he should find out about the powders. The Lord only\nknows what he would do. He\'s so tender-hearted. D\'you know, he usen\'t\nto be able to kill a chicken. Don\'t tell him. \'Twould be a fine go, he\nwouldn\'t understand things.\n\n     [Stops horror-struck as PETER appears in the doorway.\n\nPETER (holding on to the wall, creeps out into the porch and calls\nwith a faint voice). How\'s it one can\'t make you hear? Oh, oh, Anisya!\nWho\'s there?\n\n     [Drops on the bench.\n\nANISYA (steps from behind the corner). Why have you come out? You\nshould have stayed where you were lying.\n\nPETER. Has the girl gone for Martha? It\'s very hard.... Oh, if only\ndeath would come quicker!\n\nANISYA. She had no time. I sent her to the river. Wait a bit, I\'ll go\nmyself when I\'m ready.\n\nPETER. Send Nan. Where\'s she? Oh, I\'m that bad! Oh, death\'s at hand!\n\nANISYA. I\'ve sent for her already. Peter. Oh, dear! Then where is she?\n\nANISYA. Where\'s she got to, the plague seize her!\n\nPETER. Oh, dear! I can\'t bear it. All my inside\'s on fire. It\'s as if\na gimlet were boring me. Why have you left me as if I were a dog? ...\nno one to give me a drink.... Oh ... send Nan to me.\n\nANISYA. Here she is. Nan, go to father.\n\n     [NAN runs in. ANISYA goes behind the corner of the house.\n\nPETER. Go you. Oh ... to Aunt Martha, tell her father wants her; say\nshe\'s to come, I want her.\n\nNAN. All right.\n\nPETER. Wait a bit. Tell her she\'s to come quick. Tell her I\'m dying.\nO--oh!\n\nNAN. I\'ll just get my shawl and be off.\n\n     [Runs off.\n\nMATRYONA (winking). Now, then, mind and look sharp, lass. Go into the\nhut, hunt about everywhere, like a dog that\'s hunting for fleas: look\nunder everything, and I\'ll search him.\n\nANISYA (to MATRYONA). I feel a bit bolder, somehow, now you\'re here.\n(Goes up to porch. To PETER.) Hadn\'t I better light the samovar?\nHere\'s Mother Matryona come to see her son; you\'ll have a cup of tea\nwith her?\n\nPETER. Well, then, light it.\n\n     [ANISYA goes into the house. MATRYONA comes up to the porch.\n\nPETER. How do you do?\n\nMATRYONA (bowing). How d\'you do, my benefactor; how d\'you do, my\nprecious ... still ill, I see. And my old man, he\'s that sorry! "Go,"\nsays he, "see how he\'s getting on." He sends his respects to you.\n\n     [Bows again.\n\nPETER. I\'m dying.\n\nMATRYONA. Ah, yes, Peter Ignatitch, now I look at you I see, as the\nsaying has it, "Sickness lives where men live." You\'ve shrivelled,\nshrivelled, all to nothing, poor dear, now I come to look at you.\nSeems illness does not add to good looks.\n\nPETER. My last hour has come.\n\nMATRYONA. Oh well, Peter Ignatitch, it\'s God\'s will you know, you\'ve\nhad communion, and you\'ll have unction, God willing. Your missus is a\nwise woman, the Lord be thanked; she\'ll give you a good burial, and\nhave prayers said for your soul, all most respectable! And my son,\nhe\'ll look after things meanwhile.\n\nPETER. There\'ll be no one to manage things! She\'s not steady. Has her\nhead full of folly--why, I know all about it, I know. And my girl is\nsilly and young. I\'ve got the homestead together, and there\'s no one\nto attend to things. One can\'t help feeling it.\n\n     [Whimpers.\n\nMATRYONA. Why, if it\'s money, or something, you can leave orders?\n\nPETER (to Anisya inside the house). Has Nan gone?\n\nMATRYONA (aside). There now, he\'s remembered!\n\nANISYA (from inside). She went then and there. Come inside, won\'t you?\nI\'ll help you in.\n\nPETER. Let me sit here a bit for the last time. The air\'s so stuffy\ninside. Oh, how bad I feel! Oh, my heart\'s burning.... Oh, if death\nwould only come!\n\nMATRYONA. If God don\'t take a soul, the soul can\'t go out. Death and\nlife are in God\'s will. Peter Ignatitch. You can\'t be sure of death\neither. Maybe you\'ll recover yet. There was a man in our village just\nlike that, at the very point of death....\n\nPETER. No, I feel I shall die to-day, I feel it.\n\n     [Leans back and shuts his eyes.\n\nANISYA (enters). Well, now, are you coming in or not? You do keep one\nwaiting. Peter! eh, Peter!\n\nMATRYONA (steps aside and beckons to ANISYA with her finger). Well?\n\nANISYA (comes down the porch steps). Not there.\n\nMATRYONA. But have you searched everywhere? Under the floor?\n\nANISYA. No, it\'s not there either. In the shed perhaps; he was\nrummaging there yesterday.\n\nMATRYONA. Go, search, search for all you\'re worth. Go all over\neverywhere, as if you licked with your tongue! But I see he\'ll die\nthis very day, his nails are turning blue and his face looks earthy.\nIs the samovar ready?\n\nANISYA. Just on the boil.\n\nNIKITA (comes from the other side, if possible on horse-back, up to\nthe gate, and does not see PETER. To MATRYONA). How d\'you do, mother,\nis all well at home?\n\nMATRYONA. The Lord be thanked, we\'re all alive and have a crust to\nbite.\n\nNIKITA. Well and how\'s master?\n\nMATRYONA. Hush, there he sits.\n\n     [Points to porch.\n\nNIKITA. Well, let him sit. What\'s it to me?\n\nPETER (opens his eyes). Nikita, I say, Nikita, come here!\n\n     [NIKITA approaches. ANISYA and MATRYONA whisper together.\n\nPETER. Why have you come back so early?\n\nNIKITA. I\'ve finished ploughing.\n\nPETER. Have you done the strip beyond the bridge?\n\nNIKITA. It\'s too far to go there.\n\nPETER. Too far? From here it\'s still farther. You\'ll have to go on\npurpose now. You might have made one job of it.\n\n     [ANISYA, without showing herself, stands and listens.\n\nMATRYONA (approaches). Oh, sonny, why don\'t you take more pains for\nyour master? Your master is ill and depends on you; you should serve\nhim as you would your own father, straining every muscle just as I\nalways tell you to.\n\nPETER. Well, then--o--oh!... Get out the seed potatoes, and the women\nwill go and sort them.\n\nANISYA (aside). No fear, I\'m not going. He\'s again sending every one\naway; he must have the money on him now, and wants to hide it\nsomewhere.\n\nPETER. Else ... o--oh! when the time comes for planting, they\'ll all\nbe rotten. Oh, I can\'t stand it!\n\n     [Rises.\n\nMATRYONA (runs up into the porch and holds PETER up). Shall I help you\ninto the hut?\n\nPETER. Help me in. (Stops.) Nikita!\n\nNIKITA (angrily). What now?\n\nPETER. I shan\'t see you again.... I\'ll die to-day.... Forgive me,[3]\nfor Christ\'s sake, forgive me if I have ever sinned against you.... If\nI have sinned in word or deed.... There\'s been all sorts of things.\nForgive me!\n\nNIKITA. What\'s there to forgive? I\'m a sinner myself.\n\nMATRYONA. Ah, sonny, have some feeling.\n\nPETER. Forgive me, for Christ\'s sake.\n\n     [Weeps.\n\nNIKITA (snivels). God will forgive you, Daddy Peter. I have no cause\nto complain of you. You\'ve never done me any wrong. You forgive me;\nmaybe I\'ve sinned worse against you. (Weeps.)\n\n     [PETER goes in whimpering, MATRYONA supporting him.\n\nANISYA. Oh, my poor head! It\'s not without some reason he\'s hit on\nthat. (Approaches NIKITA.) Why did you say the money was under the\nfloor? It\'s not there.\n\nNIKITA (does not answer, but cries). I have never had anything bad\nfrom him, nothing but good, and what have I gone and done!\n\nANISYA. Enough now! Where\'s the money?\n\nNIKITA (angrily). How should I know? Go and look for it yourself!\n\nANISYA. What\'s made you so tender?\n\nNIKITA. I am sorry for him,--that sorry. How he cried! Oh, dear!\n\nANISYA. Look at him,--seized with pity! He has found some one to pity\ntoo! He\'s been treating you like a dog, and even just now was giving\norders to have you turned out of the house. You\'d better show me some\npity!\n\nNIKITA. What are you to be pitied for?\n\nANISYA. If he dies, and the money\'s been hidden away....\n\nNIKITA. No fear, he\'ll not hide it....\n\nANISYA. Oh, Nikita darling! he\'s sent for his sister, and wants to\ngive it to her. It will be a bad lookout for us. How are we going to\nlive, if he gives her the money? They\'ll turn me out of the house! You\ntry and manage somehow! You said he went to the shed last night.\n\nNIKITA. I saw him coming from there, but where he\'s shoved it to, who\ncan tell?\n\nANISYA. Oh, my poor head! I\'ll go and have a look there.\n\n     [NIKITA steps aside.\n\nMATRYONA (comes out of the hut and down the steps of the porch to\nANISYA and NIKITA). Don\'t go anywhere. He\'s got the money on him. I\nfelt it on a string round his neck.\n\nANISYA. Oh my head, my head!\n\nMATRYONA. If you don\'t keep wide awake now, then you may whistle for\nit. If his sister comes--then good-bye to it!\n\nANISYA. That\'s true. She\'ll come and he\'ll give it her. What\'s to be\ndone? Oh, my poor head!\n\nMATRYONA. What is to be done? Why, look here; the samovar is boiling,\ngo and make the tea and pour him out a cup, and then (whispers) put in\nall that\'s left in the paper. When he\'s drunk the cup, then just take\nit. He\'ll not tell, no fear.\n\nANISYA. Oh! I\'m afeared!\n\nMATRYONA. Don\'t be talking now, but look alive, and I\'ll keep his\nsister off if need be. Mind, don\'t make a blunder! Get hold of the\nmoney and bring it here, and Nikita will hide it.\n\nANISYA. Oh my head, my head! I don\'t know how I\'m going to....\n\nMATRYONA. Don\'t talk about it I tell you, do as I bid you. Nikita!\n\nNIKITA. What is it?\n\nMATRYONA. You stay here--sit down--in case something is wanted.\n\nNIKITA (waves his hand). Oh, these women, what won\'t they be up to?\nMuddle one up completely. Bother them! I\'ll really go and fetch out\nthe potatoes.\n\nMATRYONA (catches him by the arm). Stay here, I tell you.\n\n     [NAN enters.\n\nANISYA. Well?\n\nNAN. She was down in her daughter\'s vegetable plot--she\'s coming.\n\nANISYA. Coming! What shall we do?\n\nMATRYONA. There\'s plenty of time if you do as I tell you.\n\nANISYA. I don\'t know what to do; I know nothing, my brain\'s all in a\nwhirl. Nan! Go, daughter, and see to the calves, they\'ll have run\naway, I\'m afraid.... Oh dear, I haven\'t the courage.\n\nMATRYONA. Go on! I should think the samovar\'s boiling over.\n\nANISYA. Oh my head, my poor head!\n\n     [Exit.\n\nMATRYONA (approaches NIKITA). Now then, sonny. (Sits down beside him.)\nYour affairs must also be thought about, and not left anyhow.\n\nNIKITA. What affairs?\n\nMATRYONA. Why, this affair--how you\'re to live your life.\n\nNIKITA. How to live my life? Others live, and I shall live!\n\nMATRYONA. The old man will probably die to-day.\n\nNIKITA. Well, if he dies, God give him rest! What\'s that to me?\n\nMATRYONA (keeps looking towards the porch while she speaks). Eh,\nsonny! Those that are alive have to think about living. One needs\nplenty of sense in these matters, honey. What do you think? I\'ve\ntramped all over the place after your affairs, I\'ve got quite footsore\nbothering about matters. And you must not forget me when the time\ncomes.\n\nNIKITA. And what\'s it you\'ve been bothering about?\n\nMATRYONA. About your affairs, about your future. If you don\'t take\ntrouble in good time you\'ll get nothing. You know Ivan Mosevitch?\nWell, I\'ve been to him too. I went there the other day. I had\nsomething else to settle, you know. Well, so I sat and chatted awhile\nand then came to the point. "Tell me, Ivan Mosevitch," says I, "how\'s\none to manage an affair of this kind? Supposing," says I, "a peasant\nas is a widower married a second wife, and supposing all the children\nhe has is a daughter by the first wife, and a daughter by the second.\nThen," says I, "when that peasant dies, could an outsider get hold of\nthe homestead by marrying the widow? Could he," says I, "give both the\ndaughters in marriage and remain master of the house himself?" "Yes,\nhe could," says he, "but," says he, "it would mean a deal of trouble;\nstill the thing could be managed by means of money, but if there\'s no\nmoney it\'s no good trying."\n\nNIKITA (laughs). That goes without saying, only fork out the money.\nWho does not want money?\n\nMATRYONA. Well then, honey, so I spoke out plainly about the affair.\nAnd he says, "First and foremost, your son will have to get himself on\nthe register of that village--that will cost something. The elders\nwill have to be treated. And they, you see, they\'ll sign. Everything,"\nsays he, "must be done sensibly." Look (unwraps her kerchief and takes\nout a paper), he\'s written out this paper; just read it, you\'re a\nscholar, you know.\n\n     [NIKITA reads.\n\nNIKITA. This paper\'s only a decision for the elders to sign. There\'s\nno great wisdom needed for that.\n\nMATRYONA. But you just hear what Ivan Mosevitch bids us do. "Above\nall," he says, "mind and don\'t let the money slip away, dame. If she\ndon\'t get hold of the money," he says, "they\'ll not let her do it.\nMoney\'s the great thing!" So look out, sonny, things are coming to a\nhead.\n\nNIKITA. What\'s that to me? The money\'s hers--so let her look out.\n\nMATRYONA. Ah, sonny, how you look at it! How can a woman manage such\naffairs? Even if she does get the money, is she capable of arranging\nit all? One knows what a woman is! You\'re a man anyhow. You can hide\nit, and all that. You see, you\'ve after all got more sense, in case of\nanything happening.\n\nNIKITA. Oh, your woman\'s notions are all so inexpedient!\n\nMATRYONA. Why inexpedient? You just collar the money, and the woman\'s\nin your hands. And then should she ever turn snappish you\'d be able to\ntighten the reins!\n\nNIKITA. Bother you all,--I\'m going.\n\nANISYA (quite pale, runs out of the hut and round the corner to\nMATRYONA). So it was, it was on him! Here it is!\n\n     [Shows that she has something under her apron.\n\nMATRYONA. Give it to Nikita; he\'ll hide it. Nikita, take it and hide\nit somewhere.\n\nNIKITA. All right, give here!\n\nANISYA. O--oh, my poor head! No, I\'d better do it myself.\n\n     [Goes towards the gate.\n\nMATRYONA (seizing her by the arm). Where are you going to? You\'ll be\nmissed. There\'s the sister coming; give it him; he knows what to do.\nEh, you blockhead!\n\nANISYA (stops irresolutely). Oh, my head, my head!\n\nNIKITA. Well, give it here. I\'ll shove it away somewhere.\n\nANISYA. Where will you shove it to?\n\nNIKITA (laughing). Why, are you afraid?\n\n     [Enter AKOULINA, carrying clothes from the wash.\n\nANISYA. O--oh, my poor head! (Gives the money.) Mind, Nikita.\n\nNIKITA. What are you afraid of? I\'ll hide it so that I\'ll not be able\nto find it myself.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nANISYA (stands in terror). Oh dear, and supposing he....\n\nMATRYONA. Well, is he dead?\n\nANISYA. Yes, he seems dead. He did not move when I took it.\n\nMATRYONA. Go in, there\'s Akoulina.\n\nANISYA. Well there, I\'ve done the sin and he has the money....\n\nMATRYONA. Have done and go in! There\'s Martha coming!\n\nANISYA. There now, I\'ve trusted him. What\'s going to happen now?\n\n     [Exit.\n\nMartha (enters from one side, AKOULINA enters from the other. To\nAKOULINA). I should have come before, but I was at my daughter\'s.\nWell, how\'s the old man? Is he dying?\n\nAKOULINA (puts down the clothes). Don\'t know; I\'ve been to the river.\n\nMartha (pointing to MATRYONA). Who\'s that?\n\nMATRYONA. I\'m from Zouevo. I\'m Nikita\'s mother from Zouevo, my dearie.\nGood afternoon to you. He\'s withering, withering away, poor dear--your\nbrother, I mean. He came out himself. "Send for my sister," he said,\n"because," said he.... Dear me, why, I do believe he\'s dead!\n\nANISYA (runs out screaming. Clings to a post, and begins wailing).[4]\nOh, oh, ah! who-o-o-o-m have you left me to, why-y-y have you\ndese-e-e-e-rted me--a miserable widow ... to live my life alone....\nWhy have you closed your bright eyes....\n\n     [Enter NEIGHBOR. MATRYONA and NEIGHBOR catch hold of ANISYA under\n      the arms to support her. AKOULINA and MARTHA go into the hut. A\n      crowd assembles.\n\nA VOICE IN THE CROWD. Send for the old women to lay out the body.\n\nMATRYONA (rolls up her sleeves). Is there any water in the copper? But\nI daresay the samovar is still hot. I\'ll also go and help a bit.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\nThe same hut. Winter. Nine months have passed since Act II. ANISYA,\nplainly dressed, sits before a loom weaving. NAN is on the oven.\n\nMITRITCH (an old laborer, enters and slowly takes off his outdoor\nthings). Oh Lord, have mercy! Well, hasn\'t the master come home yet?\n\nANISYA. What?\n\nMITRITCH. Nikita isn\'t back from town, is he?\n\nANISYA. No.\n\nMITRITCH. Must have been on the spree. Oh Lord!\n\nANISYA. Have you finished in the stackyard?\n\nMITRITCH. What d\'you think? Got it all as it should be, and covered\neverything with straw! I don\'t like doing things by halves! Oh Lord!\nholy Nicholas! (Picks at the corns on his hands.) But it\'s time he was\nback.\n\nANISYA. What need has he to hurry? He\'s got money. Merry-making with\nthat girl, I daresay....\n\nMITRITCH. Why shouldn\'t one make merry if one has the money? And why\ndid Akoulina go to town?\n\nANISYA. You\'d better ask her. How do I know what the devil took her\nthere!\n\nMITRITCH. What! to town? There\'s all sorts of things to be got in town\nif one\'s got the means. Oh Lord!\n\nNAN. Mother, I heard myself. "I\'ll get you a little shawl," he says,\nblest if he didn\'t; "you shall choose it yourself," he says. And she\ngot herself up so fine; she put on her velveteen coat and the French\nshawl.\n\nANISYA. Really, a girl\'s modesty reaches only to the door. Step over\nthe threshold and it\'s forgotten. She is a shameless creature.\n\nMITRITCH. Oh my! What\'s the use of being ashamed? While there\'s plenty\nof money make merry. Oh Lord! It is too soon to have supper, eh?\n(ANISYA does not answer.) I\'ll go and get warm meanwhile. (Climbs on\nthe stove.) Oh, Lord! Blessed Virgin Mother! Holy Nicholas!\n\nNEIGHBOR (enters). Seems your good man\'s not back yet?\n\nANISYA. No.\n\nNEIGHBOR. It\'s time he was. Hasn\'t he perhaps stopped at our inn? My\nsister, Thekla, says there\'s heaps of sledges standing there as have\ncome from the town.\n\nANISYA. Nan! Nan, I say!\n\nNAN. Yes?\n\nANISYA. You run to the inn and see! Mayhap, being drunk, he\'s gone\nthere.\n\nNAN (jumps down from the oven and dresses). All right.\n\nNEIGHBOR. And he\'s taken Akoulina with him?\n\nANISYA. Else he\'d not have had any need of going. It\'s because of her\nhe\'s unearthed all the business there. "Must go to the bank," he says;\n"it\'s time to receive the payments," he says. But it\'s all her\nfooling.\n\nNEIGHBOR (shakes her head). It\'s a bad look-out.\n\n     [Silence.\n\nNAN (at the door). And if he\'s there, what am I to say?\n\nANISYA. You only see if he\'s there.\n\nNAN. All right. I\'ll be back in a winking.\n\n     [Long silence.\n\nMITRITCH (roars). Oh Lord! merciful Nicholas!\n\nNEIGHBOR (starting). Oh, how he scared me! Who is it?\n\nANISYA. Why, Mitritch, our laborer.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Oh dear, oh dear, what a fright he did give me! I had quite\nforgotten. But tell me, dear, I\'ve heard some one\'s been wooing\nAkoulina?\n\nANISYA (gets up from the loom and sits down by the table). There was\nsome one from Dedlovo; but it seems the affair\'s got wind there too.\nThey made a start, and then stopped; so the thing fell through. Of\ncourse, who\'d care to?\n\nNEIGHBOR. And the Lizounofs from Zouevo?\n\nANISYA. They made some steps too, but it didn\'t come off either. They\nwon\'t even see us.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Yet it\'s time she was married.\n\nANISYA. Time and more than time! Ah, my dear, I\'m that impatient to\nget her out of the house; but the matter does not come off. He does\nnot wish it, nor she either. He\'s not yet had enough of his beauty,\nyou see.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Eh, eh, eh, what doings! Only think of it. Why, he\'s her\nstep-father!\n\nANISYA. Ah, friend, they\'ve taken me in completely. They\'ve done me so\nfine it\'s beyond saying. I, fool that I was, noticed nothing,\nsuspected nothing, and so I married him. I guessed nothing, but they\nalready understood one another.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Oh dear, what goings on!\n\nANISYA. So it went on from bad to worse, and I see they begin hiding\nfrom me. Ah, friend, I was that sick--that sick of my life! It\'s not\nas if I didn\'t love him.\n\nNEIGHBOR. That goes without saying.\n\nANISYA. Ah, how hard it is to bear such treatment from him! Oh, how it\nhurts!\n\nNEIGHBOR. Yes, and I\'ve heard say he\'s becoming too free with his\nfists?\n\nANISYA. And that too! There was a time when he was gentle when he\'d\nhad a drop. He used to hit out before, but of me he was always fond!\nBut now when he\'s in a temper he goes for me and is ready to trample\nme under his feet. The other day he got both my hands entangled in my\nhair so that I could hardly get away. And the girl\'s worse than a\nserpent; it\'s a wonder the earth bears such furies.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Ah, ah, my dear, now I look at you, you are a sufferer! To\nsuffer like that is no joke. To have given shelter to a beggar, and he\nto lead you such a dance! Why don\'t you pull in the reins?\n\nANISYA. Ah, but, my dear, if it weren\'t for my heart! Him as is gone\nwas stern enough, still I could twist him about any way I liked; but\nwith this one I can do nothing. As soon as I see him all my anger\ngoes. I haven\'t a grain of courage before him; I go about like a\ndrowned hen.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Ah, neighbor, you must be under a spell. I\'ve heard that\nMatryona goes in for that sort of thing. It must be her.\n\nANISYA. Yes, dear; I think so myself sometimes. Gracious me, how hurt\nI feel at times! I\'d like to tear him to pieces. But when I set eyes\non him, my heart won\'t go against him.\n\nNEIGHBOR. It\'s plain you\'re bewitched. It don\'t take long to blight a\nbody. There now, when I look at you, what you have dwindled to!\n\nANISYA. Growing a regular spindle-shanks. And just look at that fool\nAkoulina. Wasn\'t the girl a regular untidy slattern, and just look at\nher now! Where has it all come from? Yes, he has fitted her out. She\'s\ngrown so smart, so puffed up, just like a bubble that\'s ready to\nburst. And, though she\'s a fool, she\'s got it into her head. "I\'m the\nmistress," she says; "the house is mine; it\'s me father wanted him to\nmarry." And she\'s that vicious! Lord help us, when she gets into a\nrage she\'s ready to tear the thatch off the house.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Oh dear, what a life yours is, now I come to look at you.\nAnd yet there\'s people envying you: "They\'re rich," they say; but it\nseems that gold don\'t keep tears from falling.\n\nANISYA. Much reason for envy indeed! And the riches, too, will soon be\nmade ducks and drakes of. Dear me, how he squanders money!\n\nNEIGHBOR. But how\'s it, dear, you\'ve been so simple to give up the\nmoney? It\'s yours.\n\nANISYA. Ah, if you knew all! The thing is that I\'ve made one little\nmistake.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Well, if I were you, I\'d go straight and have the law of\nhim. The money\'s yours; how dare he squander it? There\'s no such\nrights.\n\nANISYA. They don\'t pay heed to that nowadays.\n\nNEIGHBOR. Ah, my dear, now I come to look at you, you\'ve got that\nweak. Anisya. Yes, quite weak, dear, quite weak. He\'s got me into a\nregular fix. I don\'t myself know anything. Oh, my poor head!\n\nNEIGHBOR (listening). There\'s some one coming, I think.\n\n     [The door opens and AKIM enters.\n\nAKIM (crosses himself, knocks the snow off his feet, and takes off his\ncoat). Peace be to this house! How do you do? Are you well, daughter?\n\nANISYA. How d\'you do, father? Do you come straight from home?\n\nAKIM. I\'ve been a-thinking I\'ll go and see what\'s name, go to see my\nson, I mean,--my son. I didn\'t start early--had my dinner, I mean; I\nwent, and it\'s so what d\'you call it--so snowy, hard walking, and so\nthere I\'m what d\'you call it--late, I mean. And my son--is he at home?\nAt home? My son, I mean.\n\nANISYA. No; he\'s gone to the town.\n\nAKIM (sits down on a bench). I\'ve some business with him, d\'you see,\nsome business, I mean. I told him t\'other day, told him I was in need\n--told him, I mean, that our horse was done for, our horse, you see. So\nwe must what d\'ye call it, get a horse, I mean, some kind of a horse,\nI mean. So there, I\'ve come, you see.\n\nANISYA. Nikita told me. When he comes back you\'ll have a talk. (Goes\nto the oven.) Have some supper now, and he\'ll soon come. Mitritch, eh,\nMitritch, come have your supper.\n\nMITRITCH. Oh Lord! merciful Nicholas!\n\nANISYA. Come to supper.\n\nNEIGHBOR. I shall go now. Good-night.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nMITRITCH (gets down from the oven). I never noticed how I fell asleep.\nOh, Lord! gracious Nicholas! How d\'you do, Daddy Akim?\n\nAKIM. Ah, Mitritch! What are you, what d\'ye call it, I mean?...\n\nMITRITCH. Why, I\'m working for your son, Nikita.\n\nAKIM. Dear me! What d\'ye call ... working for my son, I mean. Dear me!\n\nMITRITCH. I was living with a tradesman in town, but drank all I had\nthere. Now I\'ve come back to the village. I\'ve no home, so I\'ve gone\ninto service. (Gapes.) Oh Lord!\n\nAKIM. But how\'s that, what d\'you call it, or what\'s name, Nikita, what\ndoes he do? Has he some business, I mean besides, that he should hire\na laborer, a laborer, I mean, hire a laborer?\n\nANISYA. What business should he have? He used to manage, but now he\'s\nother things on his mind, so he\'s hired a laborer.\n\nMITRITCH. Why shouldn\'t he, seeing he has money?\n\nAKIM. Now that\'s what d\'you call it, that\'s wrong, I mean, quite\nwrong, I mean. That\'s spoiling oneself.\n\nANISYA. Oh, he has got spoilt, that spoilt, it\'s just awful.\n\nAKIM. There now, what d\'you call it, one thinks how to make things\nbetter, and it gets worse I mean. Riches spoil a man, spoil, I mean.\n\nMITRITCH. Fatness makes even a dog go mad; how\'s one not to get spoilt\nby fat living? Myself now; how I went on with fat living. I drank for\nthree weeks without being sober. I drank my last breeches. When I had\nnothing left, I gave it up. Now I\'ve determined not to. Bother it!\n\nAKIM. And where\'s what d\'you call, your old woman?\n\nMITRITCH. My old woman has found her right place, old fellow. She\'s\nhanging about the gin-shops in town. She\'s a swell too; one eye\nknocked out, and the other black, and her muzzle twisted to one side.\nAnd she\'s never sober; drat her!\n\nAKIM. Oh, oh, oh, how\'s that?\n\nMITRITCH. And where\'s a soldier\'s wife to go? She has found her right\nplace.\n\n     [Silence.\n\nAKIM (to ANISYA). And Nikita,--has he what d\'you call it, taken\nanything up to town? I mean, anything to sell?\n\nANISYA (laying the table and serving up). No, he\'s taken nothing. He\'s\ngone to get money from the bank.\n\nAKIM (sitting down to supper). Why? D\'you wish to put it to another\nuse, the money I mean?\n\nANISYA. No, we don\'t touch it. Only some twenty or thirty roubles as\nhave come due; they must be taken.\n\nAKIM. Must be taken. Why take it, the money I mean? You\'ll take some\nto-day I mean, and some to-morrow; and so you\'ll what d\'you call it,\ntake it all, I mean.\n\nANISYA. We get this besides. The money is all safe.\n\nAKIM. All safe? How\'s that, safe? You take it, and it what d\'you call\nit, it\'s all safe. How\'s that? You put a heap of meal into a bin, or a\nbarn, I mean, and go on taking meal, will it remain there, what d\'you\ncall it, all safe, I mean? That\'s, what d\'you call it, it\'s cheating.\nYou\'d better find out, or else they\'ll cheat you. Safe indeed! I mean\nyou what d\'ye call ... you take it and it remains all safe there?\n\nANISYA. I know nothing about it. Ivan Mosevitch advised us at the\ntime. "Put the money in the bank," he said, "the money will be safe,\nand you\'ll get interest," he said.\n\nMITRITCH (having finished his supper). That\'s so. I\'ve lived with a\ntradesman. They all do like that. Put the money in the bank, then lie\ndown on the oven and it will keep coming in.\n\nAKIM. That\'s queer talk. How\'s that--what d\'ye call, coming in, how\'s\nthat coming in, and they, who do they get it from I mean, the money I\nmean?\n\nANISYA. They take the money out of the bank.\n\nMITRITCH. Get along! Tain\'t a thing a woman can understand! You look\nhere, I\'ll make it all clear to you. Mind and remember. You see,\nsuppose you\'ve got some money, and I, for instance, have spring coming\non, my land\'s idle, I\'ve got no seeds, or I have to pay taxes. So, you\nsee, I go to you. "Akim," I say, "give us a ten-rouble note, and when\nI\'ve harvested in autumn I\'ll return it, and till two acres for you\nbesides, for having obliged me!" And you, seeing I\'ve something to\nfall back on--a horse say, or a cow--you say, "No, give two or three\nroubles for the obligation," and there\'s an end of it. I\'m stuck in\nthe mud, and can\'t do without. So I say, "All right!" and take a\ntenner. In the autumn, when I\'ve made my turnover, I bring it back,\nand you squeeze the extra three roubles out of me.\n\nAKIM. Yes, but that\'s what peasants do when they what d\'ye call it,\nwhen they forget God. It\'s not honest, I mean, it\'s no good, I mean.\n\nMITRITCH. You wait. You\'ll see it comes just to the same thing. Now\ndon\'t forget how you\'ve skinned me. And Anisya, say, has got some\nmoney lying idle. She does not know what to do with it, besides, she\'s\na woman, and does not know how to use it. She comes to you. "Couldn\'t\nyou make some profit with my money too?" she says. "Why not?" say you,\nand you wait. Before the summer I come again and say, "Give me another\ntenner, and I\'ll be obliged." Then you find out if my hide isn\'t all\ngone, and if I can be skinned again you give me Anisya\'s money. But\nsupposing I\'m clean shorn,--have nothing to eat,--then you see I can\'t\nbe fleeced any more, and you say, "Go your way, friend," and you look\nout for another, and lend him your own and Anisya\'s money and skin\nhim. That\'s what the bank is. So it goes round and round. It\'s a cute\nthing, old fellow!\n\nAKIM (excitedly). Gracious me, whatever is that like? It\'s what d\'ye\ncall it, it\'s filthy! The peasants--what d\'ye call it, the peasants do\nso I mean, and know it\'s, what d\'ye call it, a sin! It\'s what d\'you\ncall, not right, not right, I mean. It\'s filthy! How can people as\nhave learnt ... what d\'ye call it....\n\nMITRITCH. That, old fellow, is just what they\'re fond off And\nremember, them that are stupid, or the women folk, as can\'t put their\nmoney into use themselves, they take it to the bank, and they there,\ndeuce take \'em, clutch hold of it, and with this money they fleece the\npeople. It\'s a cute thing!\n\nAKIM (sighing). Oh dear, I see, what d\'ye call it, without money it\'s\nbad, and with money it\'s worse! How\'s that? God told us to work, but\nyou, what d\'you call ... I mean you put money into the bank and go to\nsleep, and the money will what d\'ye call it, will feed you while you\nsleep. It\'s filthy, that\'s what I call it; it\'s not right.\n\nMITRITCH. Not right? Eh, old fellow, who cares about that nowadays? And\nhow clean they pluck you, too! That\'s the fact of the matter.\n\nAKIM (sighs). Ah, yes, seems the time\'s what d\'ye call it, the time\'s\ngrowing ripe. There, I\'ve had a look at the closets in town. What\nthey\'ve come to! It\'s all polished and polished I mean, it\'s fine,\nit\'s what d\'ye call it, it\'s like inside an inn. And what\'s it all\nfor? What\'s the good of it? Oh, they\'ve forgotten God. Forgotten, I\nmean. We\'ve forgotten, forgotten God, God, I mean! Thank you, my dear,\nI\'ve had enough. I\'m quite satisfied.\n\n     [Rises. MITRITCH climbs on to the oven.\n\nANISYA (eats, and collects the dishes). If his father would only take\nhim to task! But I\'m ashamed to tell him.\n\nAKIM. What d\'you say?\n\nANISYA. Oh! it\'s nothing.\n\n     [Enter NAN.\n\nAKIM. Here\'s a good girl, always busy! You\'re cold, I should think?\n\nNAN. Yes, I am, terribly. How d\'you do, grandfather?\n\nANISYA. Well? Is he there?\n\nNAN. No. But Andriyan is there. He\'s been to town, and he says he saw\nthem at an inn in town. He says Dad\'s as drunk as drunk can be!\n\nANISYA. Do you want anything to eat? Here you are.\n\nNAN (goes to the oven). Well, it is cold. My hands are quite numb.\n\n     [AKIM takes off his leg-bands and bast-shoes. ANISYA washes up.\n\nANISYA. Father!\n\nAKIM. Well, what is it?\n\nANISYA. And is Marina living well?\n\nAKIM. Yes, she\'s living all right. The little woman is what d\'ye call\nit, clever and steady; she\'s living, and what d\'ye call it, doing her\nbest. She\'s all right; the little woman\'s of the right sort I mean;\npainstaking and what d\'ye call it, submissive; the little woman\'s all\nright I mean, all right, you know.\n\nANISYA. And is there no talk in your village that a relative of\nMarina\'s husband thinks of marrying our Akoulina? Have you heard\nnothing of it?\n\nAKIM. Ah; that\'s Mironof. Yes, the women did chatter something. But I\ndidn\'t pay heed, you know. It don\'t interest me I mean, I don\'t know\nanything. Yes, the old women did say something, but I\'ve a bad memory,\nbad memory, I mean. But the Mironofs are what d\'ye call it, they\'re\nall right, I mean they\'re all right.\n\nANISYA. I\'m that impatient to get her settled.\n\nAKIM. And why?\n\nNAN (listens). They\'ve come!\n\nANISYA. Well, don\'t you go bothering them.\n\n     [Goes on washing the spoons without turning her head.\n\nNIKITA (enters). Anisya! Wife! who has come?\n\n     [ANISYA looks up and turns away in silence.\n\nNIKITA (severely). Who has come? Have you forgotten?\n\nANISYA. Now don\'t humbug. Come in!\n\nNIKITA (still more severely). Who\'s come?\n\nANISYA (goes up and takes him by the arm). Well, then, husband has\ncome. Now then, come in!\n\nNIKITA (holds back). Ah, that\'s it! Husband! And what\'s husband\ncalled? Speak properly.\n\nANISYA. Oh bother you! Nikita!\n\nNIKITA. Where have you learnt manners? The full name.\n\nANISYA. Nikita Akimitch! Now then!\n\nNIKITA. (still in the doorway). Ah, that\'s it! But now--the surname?\n\nANISYA (laughs and pulls him by the arm). Tchilikin. Dear me, what\nairs!\n\nNIKITA. Ah, that\'s it. (Holds on to the door-post.) No, now say with\nwhich foot Tchilikin steps into this house!\n\nANISYA. That\'s enough! You\'re letting the cold in!\n\nNIKITA. Say with which foot he steps? You\'ve got to say it,--that\'s\nflat.\n\nANISYA (aside). He\'ll go on worrying. (To NIKITA.) Well then, with the\nleft. Come in!\n\nNIKITA. Ah, that\'s it.\n\nANISYA. You look who\'s in the hut!\n\nNIKITA. Ah, my parent! Well, what of that? I\'m not ashamed of my\nparent. I can pay my respects to my parent. How d\'you do, father?\n(Bows and puts out his hand.) My respects to you.\n\nAKIM (does not answer). Drink, I mean drink, what it does! It\'s\nfilthy!\n\nNIKITA. Drink, what\'s that? I\'ve been drinking? I\'m to blame, that\'s\nflat! I\'ve had a glass with a friend, drank his health.\n\nANISYA. Go and lie down, I say.\n\nNIKITA. Wife, say where am I standing?\n\nANISYA. Now then, it\'s all right, lie down!\n\nNIKITA. No, I\'ll first drink a samovar with my parent. Go and light\nthe samovar. Akoulina, I say, come here!\n\n     [Enter AKOULINA, smartly dressed and carrying their purchases.\n\nAKOULINA. Why have you thrown everything about? Where\'s the yarn?\n\nNIKITA. The yarn? The yarn\'s there. Hullo, Mitritch, where are you?\nAsleep? Asleep? Go and put the horse up.\n\nAKIM (not seeing AKOULINA but looking at his son). Dear me, what is he\ndoing? The old man\'s what d\'ye call it, quite done up, I mean,--been\nthrashing,--and look at him, what d\'ye call it, putting on airs! Put\nup the horse! Faugh, what filth!\n\nMITRITCH (climbs down from the oven, and puts on felt boots). Oh,\nmerciful Lord! Is the horse in the yard? Done it to death, I dare say.\nJust see how he\'s been swilling, the deuce take him. Up to his very\nthroat. Oh Lord, Holy Nicholas!\n\n     [Puts on sheepskin and exit.\n\nNIKITA (sits down). You must forgive me, father. It\'s true I\'ve had a\ndrop; well, what of that? Even a hen will drink. Ain\'t it true? So you\nmust forgive me. Never mind Mitritch, he doesn\'t mind, he\'ll put it\nup.\n\nANISYA. Shall I really light the samovar?\n\nNIKITA. Light it! My parent has come. I wish to talk to him, and shall\ndrink tea with him. (To AKOULINA.) Have you brought all the parcels?\n\nAKOULINA. The parcels? I\'ve brought mine, the rest\'s in the sledge.\nHi, take this, this isn\'t mine!\n\n     [Throws a parcel on the table and puts the others into her box.\n      NAN watches her while she puts them away. AKIM does not look at\n      his son, but puts his leg-bands and bast-shoes on the oven.\n\nANISYA (going out with the samovar). Her box is full as it is, and\nstill he\'s bought more!\n\nNIKITA (pretending to be sober). You must not be cross with me,\nfather. You think I\'m drunk? I am all there, that\'s flat! As they say,\n"Drink, but keep your wits about you." I can talk with you at once,\nfather. I can attend to any business. You told me about the money;\nyour horse is worn-out,--I remember! That can all be managed. That\'s\nall in our hands. If it was an enormous sum that\'s wanted, then we\nmight wait; but as it is I can do everything. That\'s the case.\n\nAKIM (goes on fidgeting with the leg-bands). Eh, lad, "It\'s ill\nsledging when the thaw has set in."\n\nNIKITA. What do you mean by that? "And it\'s ill talking with one who\nis drunk?" But don\'t you worry, let\'s have some tea. And I can do\nanything; that\'s flat! I can put everything to rights.\n\nAKIM (shakes his head). Eh, eh, eh!\n\nNIKITA. The money, here it is. (Puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out\npocket-book, handles the notes in it and takes out a ten-rouble\nnote.) Take this to get a horse; I can\'t forget my parent. I shan\'t\nforsake him, that\'s flat. Because he\'s my parent! Here you are, take\nit! Really now, I don\'t grudge it. (Comes up and pushes the note\ntowards AKIM, who won\'t take it. NIKITA catches hold of his father\'s\nhand.) Take it, I tell you. I don\'t grudge it.\n\nAKIM. I can\'t what d\'you call it, I mean, can\'t take it! And can\'t\nwhat d\'ye call it, talk to you, because you\'re not yourself, I mean.\n\nNIKITA. I\'ll not let you go! Take it!\n\n     [Puts the money into AKIM\'S hand.\n\nANISYA (enters, and stops). You\'d better take it, he\'ll give you no\npeace!\n\nAKIM (takes it, and shakes his head). Oh! that liquor. Not like a man,\nI mean!\n\nNIKITA. That\'s better! If you repay it you\'ll repay it, if not I\'ll\nmake no bother. That\'s what I am! (Sees AKOULINA.) Akoulina, show your\npresents.\n\nAKOULINA. What?\n\nNIKITA. Show your presents.\n\nAKOULINA. The presents, what\'s the use of showing \'em? I\'ve put \'em\naway.\n\nNIKITA. Get them, I tell you. Nan will like to see \'em. Undo the\nshawl. Give it here.\n\nAKIM. Oh, oh! It\'s sickening!\n\n     [Climbs on the oven.\n\nAKOULINA (gets out the parcels and puts them on the table). Well,\nthere you are,--what\'s the good of looking at \'em?\n\nNAN. Oh how lovely! It\'s as good as Stepanida\'s.\n\nAKOULINA. Stepanida\'s? What\'s Stepanida\'s compared to this?\n(Brightening up and undoing the parcels.) Just look here,--see the\nquality! It\'s a French one.\n\nNAN. The print is fine! Mary has a dress like it, only lighter on a\nblue ground. This is pretty.\n\nNIKITA. Ah, that\'s it!\n\n     [ANISYA passes angrily into the closet, returns with a tablecloth\n      and the chimney of the Samovar, and goes up to the table.\n\nANISYA. Drat you, littering the table!\n\nNIKITA. You look here!\n\nANISYA. What am I to look at? Have I never seen anything? Put it away!\n\n     [Sweeps the shawl on to the floor with her arm.\n\nAKOULINA. What are you pitching things down for? You pitch your own\nthings about!\n\n     [Picks up the shawl.\n\nNIKITA. Anisya! Look here!\n\nANISYA. Why am I to look?\n\nNIKITA. You think I have forgotten you? Look here! (Shows her a parcel\nand sits down on it.) It\'s a present for you. Only you must earn it!\nWife, where am I sitting?\n\nANISYA. Enough of your humbug. I\'m not afraid of you. Whose money are\nyou spreeing on and buying your fat wench presents with? Mine!\n\nAKOULINA. Yours indeed? No fear! You wished to steal it, but it did\nnot come off! Get out of the way!\n\n     [Pushes her while trying to pass.\n\nANISYA. What are you shoving for? I\'ll teach you to shove!\n\nAKOULINA. Shove me? You try!\n\n     [Presses against ANISYA.\n\nNIKITA. Now then, now then, you women. Have done now!\n\n     [Steps between them.\n\nAKOULINA. Comes shoving herself in! You ought to keep quiet and\nremember your doings! You think no one knows!\n\nANISYA. Knows what? Out with it, out with it! What do they know?\n\nAKOULINA. I know something about you!\n\nANISYA. You\'re a slut who goes with another\'s husband!\n\nAKOULINA. And you did yours to death!\n\nANISYA (throwing herself on AKOULINA). You\'re raving!\n\nNIKITA (holding her back). Anisya, you seem to have forgotten!\n\nANISYA. Want to frighten me! I\'m not afraid of you!\n\nNIKITA (turns ANISYA round and pushes her out). Be off!\n\nANISYA. Where am I to go? I\'ll not go out of my own house!\n\nNIKITA. Be off, I tell you, and don\'t dare to come in here!\n\nANISYA. I won\'t go! (NIKITA pushes her, ANISYA cries and screams and\nclings to the door.) What! am I to be turned out of my own house by\nthe scruff of the neck? What are you doing, you scoundrel? Do you\nthink there\'s no law for you? You wait a bit!\n\nNIKITA. Now then!\n\nANISYA. I\'ll go to the Elder! To the policeman!\n\nNIKITA. Off, I tell you!\n\n     [Pushes her out.\n\nANISYA (behind the door). I\'ll hang myself!\n\nNIKITA. No fear!\n\nNAN. Oh, oh, oh! Mother, dear, darling!\n\n     [Cries.\n\nNIKITA. Me frightened of her! A likely thing! What are you crying for?\nShe\'ll come back, no fear. Go and see to the samovar.\n\n     [Exit NAN.\n\nAKOULINA (collects and folds her presents). The mean wretch, how she\'s\nmessed it up. But wait a bit, I\'ll cut up her jacket for her! Sure I\nwill!\n\nNIKITA. I\'ve turned her out; what more do you want?\n\nAKOULINA. She\'s dirtied my new shawl. If that bitch hadn\'t gone away,\nI\'d have torn her eyes out!\n\nNIKITA. That\'s enough. Why should you be angry? Now if I loved her....\n\nAKOULINA. Loved her? She\'s worth loving, with her fat mug! If you\'d\nhave given her up, then nothing would have happened. You should have\nsent her to the devil. And the house was mine all the same, and the\nmoney was mine! Says she is the mistress, but what sort of mistress is\nshe to her husband? She\'s a murderess, that\'s what she is! She\'ll\nserve you the same way!\n\nNIKITA. Oh dear, how\'s one to stop a woman\'s jaw? You don\'t yourself\nknow what you\'re jabbering about!\n\nAKOULINA. Yes, I do. I\'ll not live with her! I\'ll turn her out of the\nhouse! She can\'t live here with me. The mistress indeed! She\'s not the\nmistress,--that jailbird!\n\nNIKITA. That\'s enough! What have you to do with her? Don\'t mind her.\nYou look at me! I am the master! I do as I like. I\'ve ceased to love\nher, and now I love you. I love who I like! The power is mine, she\'s\nunder me. That\'s where I keep her. (Points to his feet.) A pity we\'ve\nno concertina.\n\n     [Sings.\n\n"We have loaves on the stoves, We have porridge on the shelf. So we\'ll\nlive and be gay, Making merry every day, And when death comes, Then\nwe\'ll die! We have loaves on the stoves, We have porridge on the\nshelf...."\n\n     [Enter MITRITCH. He takes off his outdoor things and climbs on\n      the oven.\n\nMITRITCH. Seems the women have been fighting again! Tearing each\nother\'s hair. Oh Lord, gracious Nicholas!\n\nAKIM. (sitting on the edge of the oven, takes his leg-bands and shoes\nand begins putting them on). Get in, get into the corner.\n\nMITRITCH. Seems they can\'t settle matters between them. Oh Lord!\n\nNIKITA. Get out the liquor, we\'ll have some with our tea.\n\nNAN (to AKOULINA). Sister, the samovar is just boiling over.\n\nNIKITA. And where\'s your mother?\n\nNAN. She\'s standing and crying out there in the passage.\n\nNIKITA. Oh, that\'s it! Call her, and tell her to bring the samovar.\nAnd you, Akoulina, get the tea things.\n\nAKOULINA. The tea things? All right.\n\n     [Brings the things.\n\nNIKITA (unpacks spirits, rusks, and salt herrings). That\'s for myself.\nThis is yarn for the wife. The paraffin is out there in the passage,\nand here\'s the money. Wait a bit (takes a counting-frame); I\'ll add it\nup. (Adds.) Wheat-flour, 80 kopeykas, oil ... Father, 10 roubles ...\nFather, come let\'s have some tea!\n\n     [Silence. AKIM sits on the oven and winds the bands round his\n      legs. Enter ANISYA with samovar.\n\nANISYA. Where shall I put it?\n\nNIKITA. Here on the table. Well! have you been to the Elder? Ah,\nthat\'s it! Have your say and then eat your words. Now then, that\'s\nenough. Don\'t be cross; sit down and drink this. (Fills a wine-glass\nfor her.) And here\'s your present.\n\n     [Gives her the parcel he had been sitting on. ANISYA takes it\n      silently and shakes her head.\n\nAKIM (gets down and puts on his sheepskin, then comes up to the table\nand puts down the money). Here, take your money back! Put it away.\n\nNIKITA (does not see the money). Why have you put on your things?\n\nAKIM. I\'m going, going, I mean; forgive me, for the Lord\'s sake.\n\n     [Takes up his cap and belt.\n\nNIKITA. My gracious! Where are you going to at this time of night?\n\nAKIM. I can\'t, I mean what d\'ye call \'em, in your house, what d\'ye\ncall \'em, can\'t stay I mean, stay, can\'t stay, forgive me.\n\nNIKITA. But are you going without having any tea?\n\nAKIM (fastens his belt). Going because, I mean, it\'s not right in your\nhouse, I mean, what d\'you call it, not right, Nikita, in the house,\nwhat d\'ye call it, not right! I mean, you are living a bad life,\nNikita, bad,--I\'ll go.\n\nNIKITA. Eh, now! Have done talking! Sit down and drink your tea!\n\nANISYA. Why, father, you\'ll shame us before the neighbors. What has\noffended you?\n\nAKIM. Nothing what d\'ye call it, nothing has offended me, nothing at\nall! I mean only, I see, what d\'you call it, I mean, I see my son, to\nruin, I mean, to ruin, I mean my son\'s on the road to ruin, I mean.\n\nNIKITA. What ruin? Just prove it!\n\nAKIM. Ruin, ruin; you\'re in the midst of it! What did I tell you that\ntime?\n\nNIKITA. You said all sorts of things! Akim. I told you, what d\'ye call\nit, I told you about the orphan lass. That you had wronged an orphan--\nMarina, I mean, wronged her!\n\nNIKITA. Eh! he\'s at it again. Let bygones be bygones.... All that\'s\npast!\n\nAKIM (excited). Past! No, lad, it\'s not past. Sin, I mean, fastens on\nto sin--drags sin after it, and you\'ve stuck fast, Nikita, fast in\nsin! Stuck fast in sin! I see you\'re fast in sin. Stuck fast, sunk in\nsin, I mean!\n\nNIKITA. Sit down and drink your tea, and have done with it!\n\nAKIM. I can\'t, I mean can\'t what d\'ye call it, can\'t drink tea.\nBecause of your filth, I mean; I feel what d\'ye call it, I feel sick,\nvery sick! I can\'t what d\'ye call it, I can\'t drink tea with you.\n\nNIKITA. Eh! There he goes rambling! Come to the table.\n\nAKIM. You\'re in your riches same as in a net--you\'re in a net, I mean.\nAh, Nikita, it\'s the soul that God needs!\n\nNIKITA. Now really, what right have you to reprove me in my own house?\nWhy do you keep on at me? Am I a child that you can pull by the hair?\nNowadays those things have been dropped!\n\nAKIM. That\'s true. I have heard that nowadays, what d\'ye call it, that\nnowadays children pull their fathers\' beards, I mean! But that\'s ruin,\nthat\'s ruin, I mean!\n\nNIKITA (angrily). We are living without help from you, and it\'s you\nwho came to us with your wants!\n\nAKIM. The money? There\'s your money! I\'ll go begging, begging I mean,\nbefore I\'ll take it, I mean.\n\nNIKITA. That\'s enough! Why be angry and upset the whole company!\n\n     [Holds him by the arm.\n\nAKIM (shrieks). Let go! I\'ll not stay. I\'d rather sleep under some\nfence than in the midst of your filth! Faugh! God forgive me!\n\n     [Exit.\n\nNIKITA. Here\'s a go!\n\nAKIM (reopens the door). Come to your senses, Nikita! It\'s the soul\nthat God wants!\n\n     [Exit.\n\nAKOULINA (takes cups). Well, shall I pour out the tea?\n\n     [Takes a cup. All are silent.\n\nMITRITCH (roars). Oh Lord be merciful to me a sinner!\n\n     [All start.\n\nNIKITA (lies down on the bench). Oh, it\'s dull, it\'s dull! (To\nAKOULINA.) Where\'s the concertina?\n\nAKOULINA. The concertina? He\'s bethought himself of it. Why, you took\nit to be mended. I\'ve poured out your tea. Drink it!\n\nNIKITA. I don\'t want it! Put out the light.... Oh, how dull I feel,\nhow dull!\n\n     [Sobs.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\nAutumn. Evening. The moon is shining. The stage represents the\ninterior of courtyard. The scenery at the back shows, in the middle,\nthe back porch of the hut. To the right the winter half of the hut and\nthe gate; to the left the summer half and the cellar. To the right of\nthe stage is a shed. The sound of tipsy voices and shouts are heard\nfrom the hut.[5] SECOND NEIGHBOR WOMAN comes out of the hut and\nbeckons to FIRST NEIGHBOR WOMAN.\n\nSECOND NEIGHBOR. How\'s it Akoulina has not shown herself?\n\nFIRST NEIGHBOR. Why hasn\'t she shown herself? She\'d have been glad to;\nbut she\'s too ill, you know. The suitor\'s relatives have come, and\nwant to see the girl; and she, my dear, she\'s lying in the cold hut\nand can\'t come out, poor thing!\n\nSECOND NEIGHBOR. But how\'s that?\n\nFIRST NEIGHBOR. They say she\'s been bewitched by an evil eye! She\'s\ngot pains in the stomach!\n\nSECOND NEIGHBOR. You don\'t say so?\n\nFIRST NEIGHBOR. What else could it be?\n\n     [Whispers.\n\nSECOND NEIGHBOR. Dear me! There\'s a go! But his relatives will surely\nfind it out?\n\nFIRST NEIGHBOR. They find it out! They\'re all drunk! Besides, they are\nchiefly after her dowry. Just think what they give with the girl! Two\nfurs, my dear, six dresses, a French shawl, and I don\'t know how many\npieces of linen, and money as well,--two hundred roubles, it\'s said!\n\nSECOND NEIGHBOR. That\'s all very well, but even money can\'t give much\npleasure in the face of such a disgrace.\n\nFIRST NEIGHBOR. Hush!... There\'s his father, I think.\n\n     [They cease talking and go into the hut.\n\n     [The SUITOR\'S FATHER comes out of the hut hiccoughing.\n\nTHE FATHER. Oh, I\'m all in a sweat. It\'s awfully hot! Will just cool\nmyself a bit. (Stands puffing.) The Lord only knows what--something\nis not right. I can\'t feel happy.--Well, it\'s the old woman\'s affair.\n\n     [Enter MATRYONA from hut.\n\nMATRYONA. And I was just thinking, where\'s the father? Where\'s the\nfather? And here you are, dear friend.... Well, dear friend, the Lord\nbe thanked! Everything is as honorable as can be! When one\'s arranging\na match one should not boast. And I have never learnt to boast. But as\nyou\'ve come about the right business, so with the Lord\'s help, you\'ll\nbe grateful to me all your life! She\'s a wonderful girl! There\'s no\nother like her in all the district!\n\nTHE FATHER. That\'s true enough, but how about the money?\n\nMATRYONA. Don\'t you trouble about the money! All she had from her\nfather goes with her. And it\'s more than one gets easily, as things\nare nowadays. Three times fifty roubles!\n\nTHE FATHER. We don\'t complain, but it\'s for our own child. Naturally\nwe want to get the best we can.\n\nMATRYONA. I\'ll tell you straight, friend: if it hadn\'t been for me,\nyou\'d never have found anything like her! They\'ve had an offer from\nthe Karmilins, but I stood out against it. And as for the money, I\'ll\ntell you truly: when her father, God be merciful to his soul, was\ndying, he gave orders that the widow should take Nikita into the\nhomestead--of course I know all about it from my son,--and the money\nwas to go to Akoulina. Why, another one might have thought of his own\ninterests, but Nikita gives everything clean! It\'s no trifle. Fancy\nwhat a sum it is!\n\nTHE FATHER. People are saying that more money was left her? The lad\'s\nsharp too!\n\nMATRYONA. Oh, dear soul alive! A slice in another\'s hand always looks\nbig; all she had will be handed over. I tell you, throw doubts to the\nwind and make all sure! What a girl she is! as fresh as a daisy!\n\nTHE FATHER. That\'s so. But my old woman and I were only wondering\nabout the girl; why has she not come out? We\'ve been thinking, suppose\nshe\'s sickly?\n\nMATRYONA. Ah, ah.... Who? She? Sickly? Why, there\'s none to compare\nwith her in the district. The girl\'s as sound as a bell; you can\'t\npinch her. But you saw her the other day! And as for work, she\'s\nwonderful! She\'s a bit deaf, that\'s true, but there are spots on the\nsun, you know. And her not coming out, you see, it\'s from an evil eye!\nA spell\'s been cast on her! And I know the bitch who\'s done the\nbusiness! They know of the betrothal and they bewitched her. But I\nknow a counter-spell. The girl will get up to-morrow. Don\'t you worry\nabout the girl!\n\nTHE FATHER. Well, of course, the thing\'s settled.\n\nMATRYONA. Yes, of course! Don\'t you turn back. And don\'t forget me,\nI\'ve had a lot of trouble. Don\'t forget....\n\n     [A woman\'s voice from the hut.\n\nVoice. If we are to go, let\'s go. Come along, Ivan!\n\nTHE FATHER. I\'m coming.\n\n     [Exeunt. Guests crowd together in the passage and prepare to go\n      away.\n\nNAN (runs out of the hut and calls to ANISYA). Mother!\n\nANISYA (from inside.) What d\'you want?\n\nNAN. Mother, come here, or they\'ll hear.\n\n     [ANISYA enters and they go together to the shed.\n\nANISYA. Well? What is it? Where\'s Akoulina?\n\nNAN She\'s gone into the barn. It\'s awful what\'s she\'s doing there! I\'m\nblest! "I can\'t bear it," she says. "I\'ll scream," she says, "I\'ll\nscream out loud." Blest if she didn\'t.\n\nANISYA. She\'ll have to wait. We\'ll see our visitors off first.\n\nNAN. Oh, mother! She\'s so bad! And she\'s angry too. "What\'s the good\nof their drinking my health?" she says. "I shan\'t marry," she says. "I\nshall die," she says. Mother, supposing she does die! It\'s awful. I\'m\nso frightened!\n\nANISYA. No fear, she\'ll not die. But don\'t you go near her. Come\nalong.\n\n     [Exit ANISYA and NAN.\n\nMITRITCH (comes in at the gate and begins collecting the scattered\nhay). Oh, Lord! Merciful Nicholas! What a lot of liquor they\'ve been\nand swilled, and the smell they\'ve made! It smells even out here! But\nno, I don\'t want any, drat it! See how they\'ve scattered the hay\nabout. They don\'t eat it, but only trample it under foot. A truss gone\nbefore you know it. Oh, that smell, it seems to be just under my nose!\nDrat it! (Yawns.) It\'s time to go to sleep! But I don\'t care to go\ninto the hut. It seems to float just round my nose! It has a strong\nscent, the damned stuff! (The guests are heard driving off.) They\'re\noff at last. Oh Lord! Merciful Nicholas! There they go, binding\nthemselves and gulling one another. And it\'s all gammon!\n\n     [Enter NIKITA.\n\nNIKITA. Mitritch, you get off to sleep and I\'ll put this straight.\n\nMITRITCH. All right, you throw it to the sheep. Well, have you seen\n\'em all off?\n\nNIKITA. Yes, they\'re off! But things are not right! I don\'t know what\nto do!\n\nMITRITCH. It\'s a fine mess. But there\'s the Foundlings\'[6] for that\nsort of thing. Whoever likes may drop one there; they\'ll take \'em all.\nGive \'em as many as you like, they ask no questions, and even pay--if\nthe mother goes in as a wet-nurse. It\'s easy enough nowadays.\n\nNIKITA. But mind, Mitritch, don\'t go blabbing.\n\nMITRITCH. It\'s no concern of mine. Cover the tracks as you think best.\nDear me, how you smell of liquor! I\'ll go in. Oh, Lord!\n\n     [Exit, yawning.\n\n     [NIKITA is long silent. Sits down on a sledge.\n\nNIKITA. Here\'s a go!\n\n     [Enter ANISYA.\n\nANISYA. Where are you?\n\nNIKITA. Here.\n\nANISYA. What are you doing there? There\'s no time to be lost! We must\ntake it out directly!\n\nNIKITA. What are we to do?\n\nANISYA. I\'ll tell you what you are to do. And you\'ll have to do it!\n\nNIKITA. You\'d better take it to the Foundlings\'--if anything.\n\nANISYA. Then you\'d better take it there yourself if you like! You\'ve a\nhankering for smut, but you\'re weak when it comes to settling up, I\nsee!\n\nNIKITA. What\'s to be done?\n\nANISYA. Go down into the cellar, I tell you, and dig a hole!\n\nNIKITA. Couldn\'t you manage, somehow, some other way?\n\nANISYA (imitating him). "Some other way?" Seems we can\'t "some other\nway!" You should have thought about it a year ago. Do what you\'re told\nto! Nikita. Oh, dear, what a go!\n\n     [Enter NAN.\n\nNAN. Mother! Grandmother\'s calling! I think sister\'s got a baby! I\'m\nblest if it didn\'t scream!\n\nANISYA. What are you babbling about? Plague take you! It\'s kittens\nwhining there. Go into the hut and sleep, or I\'ll give it you!\n\nNAN. Mammy dear, truly, I swear....\n\nANISYA (raising her arm as if to strike). I\'ll give it you! You be off\nand don\'t let me catch sight of you! (Nan runs into hut. To Nikita.)\nDo as you\'re told, or else mind!\n\n     [Exit.\n\nNIKITA (alone. After a long silence). Here\'s a go! Oh, these women!\nWhat a fix! Says you should have thought of it a year ago. When\'s one\nto think beforehand? When\'s one to think? Why, last year this Anisya\ndangled after me. What was I to do? Am I a monk? The master died; and\nI covered my sin as was proper, so I was not to blame there. Aren\'t\nthere lots of such cases? And then those powders. Did I put her up to\nthat? Why, had I known what the bitch was up to, I\'d have killed her!\nI\'m sure I should have killed her! She\'s made me her partner in these\nhorrors--that jade! And she became loathsome to me from that day! She\nbecame loathsome, loathsome to me as soon as mother told me about it.\nI can\'t bear the sight of her! Well, then, how could I live with her?\nAnd then it begun.... That wench began hanging round. Well, what was I\nto do! If I had not done it, some one else would. And this is what\ncomes of it! Still I\'m not to blame in this either. Oh, what a go!\n(Sits thinking.) They are bold, these women! What a plan to think of!\nBut I won\'t have a hand in it!\n\n     [Enter MATRYONA with a lantern and spade, panting.\n\nMATRYONA. Why are you sitting there like a hen on a perch? What did\nyour wife tell you to do? You just get things ready!\n\nNIKITA. What do you mean to do?\n\nMATRYONA. We know what to do. You do your share!\n\nNIKITA. You\'ll be getting me into a mess!\n\nMATRYONA. What? You\'re not thinking of backing out, are you? Now it\'s\ncome to this, and you back out!\n\nNIKITA. Think what a thing it would be! It\'s a living soul.\n\nMATRYONA. A living soul indeed! Why, it\'s more dead than alive. And\nwhat\'s one to do with it? Go and take it to the Foundlings\'--it will\ndie just the same, and the rumor will get about, and people will talk,\nand the girl be left on our hands.\n\nNIKITA. And supposing it\'s found out?\n\nMATRYONA. Not manage to do it in one\'s own house? We\'ll manage it so\nthat no one will have an inkling. Only do as I tell you. We women\ncan\'t do it without a man. There, take the spade, and get it done\nthere,--I\'ll hold the light.\n\nNIKITA. What am I to get done?\n\nMATRYONA (in a low voice). Dig a hole; then we\'ll bring it out and get\nit out of the way in a trice! There, she\'s calling again. Now then,\nget in, and I\'ll go.\n\nNIKITA. Is it dead then?\n\nMATRYONA. Of course it is. Only you must be quick, or else people will\nnotice! They\'ll see or they\'ll hear! The rascals must needs know\neverything. And the policeman went by this evening. Well then, you see\n(gives him the spade), you get down into the cellar and dig a hole\nright in the corner; the earth is soft there, and you\'ll smooth it\nover. Mother earth will not blab to any one; she\'ll keep it close. Go\nthen; go, dear.\n\nNIKITA. You\'ll get me into a mess, bother you! I\'ll go away! You do it\nalone as best you can!\n\nANISYA (through the doorway). Well? Has he dug it?\n\nMATRYONA. Why have you come away? What have you done with it?\n\nANISYA. I\'ve covered it with rags. No one can hear it. Well, has he\ndug it?\n\nMATRYONA. He doesn\'t want to!\n\nANISYA (springs out enraged). Doesn\'t want to! How will he like\nfeeding vermin in prison! I\'ll go straight away and tell everything to\nthe police! It\'s all the same if one must perish. I\'ll go straight and\ntell!\n\nNIKITA (taken aback). What will you tell?\n\nANISYA. What? Everything! Who took the money? You! (NIKITA is silent.)\nAnd who gave the poison? I did! But you knew! You knew! You knew! We\nwere in agreement!\n\nMATRYONA. That\'s enough now. Nikita dear, why are you obstinate?\nWhat\'s to be done now? One must take some trouble. Go, honey.\n\nANISYA. See the fine gentleman! He doesn\'t like it! You\'ve put upon me\nlong enough! You\'ve trampled me under foot! Now it\'s my turn! Go, I\ntell you, or else I\'ll do what I said.... There, take the spade;\nthere, now go!\n\nNIKITA. Drat you! Can\'t you leave a fellow alone! (Takes the spade,\nbut shrinks.) If I don\'t choose to, I\'ll not go!\n\nANISYA. Not go? (Begins to shout.) Neighbors! Heh! heh!\n\nMATRYONA (closes her mouth). What are you about? You\'re mad! He\'ll\ngo.... Go, sonny, go, my own.\n\nANISYA. I\'ll cry murder!\n\nNIKITA. Now stop! Oh, what people! You\'d better be quick.... As well\nbe hung for a sheep as a lamb!\n\n     [Goes towards the cellar.\n\nMATRYONA. Yes, that\'s just it, honey. If you know how to amuse\nyourself, you must know how to hide the consequences.\n\nANISYA (still excited). He\'s trampled on me ... he and his slut! But\nit\'s enough! I\'m not going to be the only one! Let him also be a\nmurderer! Then he\'ll know how it feels!\n\nMATRYONA. There, there! How she flares up! Don\'t you be cross, lass,\nbut do things quietly little by little, as it\'s best. You go to the\ngirl, and he\'ll do the work.\n\n     [Follows NIKITA to the cellar with a lantern. He descends into\n      the cellar.\n\nANISYA. And I\'ll make him strangle his dirty brat! (Still excited.)\nI\'ve worried myself to death all alone, with Peter\'s bones weighing on\nmy mind! Let him feel it too! I\'ll not spare myself; I\'ve said I\'ll\nnot spare myself!\n\nNIKITA (from the cellar). Show a light!\n\nMATRYONA (holds up the lantern to him. To ANISYA). He\'s digging. Go\nand bring it.\n\nANISYA. You stay with him, or he\'ll go away, the wretch! And I\'ll go\nand bring it.\n\nMATRYONA. Mind, don\'t forget to baptize it, or I will if you like.\nHave you a cross?\n\nANISYA. I\'ll find one. I know how to do it.\n\n     [Exit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSee at end of Act, VARIATION, which may be used instead of the\nfollowing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMATRYONA. How the woman bristled up! But one must allow she\'s been put\nupon. Well, but with the Lord\'s help, when we\'ve covered this\nbusiness, there\'ll be an end of it. We\'ll shove the girl off without\nany trouble. My son will live in comfort. The house, thank God, is as\nfull as an egg. They\'ll not forget me either. Where would they have\nbeen without Matryona? They\'d not have known how to contrive things.\n(Peering into the cellar.) Is it ready, sonny? Nikita (puts out his\nhead). What are you about there? Bring it quick! What are you dawdling\nfor? If it is to be done, let it be done.\n\nMATRYONA (goes towards door of the hut and meets ANISYA. ANISYA comes\nout with a baby wrapped in rags). Well, have you baptized it?\n\nANISYA. Why, of course. It was all I could do to take it away--she\nwouldn\'t give it up!\n\n     [Comes forward and hands it to NIKITA.\n\nNIKITA (does not take it). You bring it yourself!\n\nANISYA. Take it, I tell you!\n\n     [Throws the baby to him.\n\nNIKITA (catches it). It\'s alive! Gracious me, it\'s moving! It\'s alive!\nWhat am I to....\n\nANISYA (snatches the baby from him and throws it into the cellar). Be\nquick and smother it, and then it won\'t be alive! (Pushes NIKITA\ndown.) It\'s your doing, and you must finish it.\n\nMATRYONA (sits on the doorstep of the hut). He\'s tender-hearted. It\'s\nhard on him, poor dear. Well, what of that? Isn\'t it also his sin?\n\n     [ANISYA stands by the cellar.\n\nMATRYONA (sits looking at her and discourses). Oh, oh, oh! How\nfrightened he was: well, but what of that? If it is hard, it\'s the\nonly thing to be done. Where was one to put it? And just think, how\noften it happens that people pray to God to have children! But no, God\ngives them none; or they are all still-born. Look at our priest\'s wife\nnow.... And here, where it\'s not wanted, here it lives. (Looks towards\nthe cellar.) I suppose he\'s finished. (To ANISYA.) Well?\n\nANISYA (looking into the cellar). He\'s put a board on it and is\nsitting on it. It must be finished!\n\nMATRYONA. Oh, oh! One would be glad not to sin, but what\'s one to do?\n\n     [Re-enter NIKITA from cellar, trembling all over.\n\nNIKITA. It\'s still alive! I can\'t! It\'s alive!\n\nANISYA. If it\'s alive, where are you off to?\n\n     [Tries to stop him.\n\nNIKITA (rushes at her). Go away! I\'ll kill you! (Catches hold of her\narms; she escapes, he runs after her with the spade. MATRYONA runs\ntowards him and stops him. ANISYA runs into the porch. MATRYONA tries\nto wrench the spade from him. To his mother.) I\'ll kill you! I\'ll kill\nyou! Go away! (MATRYONA runs to ANISYA in the porch. NIKITA stops.)\nI\'ll kill you! I\'ll kill you all!\n\nMATRYONA. That\'s because he\'s so frightened! Never mind, it will pass!\n\nNIKITA. What have they made me do? What have they made me do? How it\nwhimpered.... How it crunched under me! What have they done with\nme?... And it\'s really alive, still alive! (Listens in silence.) It\'s\nwhimpering... There, it\'s whimpering.\n\n     [Runs to the cellar.\n\nMATRYONA (to ANISYA). He\'s going; it seems he means to bury it.\nNikita, you\'d better take the lantern!\n\nNIKITA (does not heed her, but listens by the cellar door). I can hear\nnothing! I suppose it was fancy! (Moves away, then stops.) How the\nlittle bones crunched under me. Krr ... kr.... What have they made me\ndo? (Listens again.) Again whimpering! It\'s really whimpering! What\ncan it be? Mother! Mother, I say!\n\n     [Goes up to her.\n\nMATRYONA. What is it, sonny?\n\nNIKITA. Mother, my own mother, I can\'t do any more! Can\'t do any more!\nMy own mother, have some pity on me!\n\nMATRYONA. Oh dear, how frightened you are, my darling! Come, come,\ndrink a drop to give you courage!\n\nNIKITA. Mother, mother! It seems my time has come! What have you done\nwith me? How the little bones crunched, and how it whimpered! My own\nmother! What have you done with me?\n\n     [Steps aside and sits down on the sledge.\n\nMATRYONA. Come, my own, have a drink! It certainly does seem uncanny\nat night-time. But wait a bit. When the day breaks, you know, and one\nday and another passes, you\'ll forget even to think of it. Wait a bit;\nwhen the girl\'s married we\'ll even forget to think of it. But you go\nand have a drink; have a drink! I\'ll go and put things straight in the\ncellar myself.\n\nNIKITA (rouses himself). Is there any drink left? Perhaps I can drink\nit off!\n\n     [Exit.\n\n     [ANISYA, who has stood all the time by the door, silently makes\n      way for him.\n\nMATRYONA. Go, go, honey, and I\'ll set to work! I\'ll go down myself and\ndig! Where has he thrown the spade to? (Finds the spade, and goes down\ninto the cellar.) Anisya, come here! Hold the light, will you?\n\nANISYA. And what of him?\n\nMATRYONA. He\'s so frightened! You\'ve been too hard with him. Leave him\nalone, he\'ll come to his senses. God help him! I\'ll set to work\nmyself. Put the lantern down here. I can see.\n\n     [MATRYONA disappears into the cellar.\n\nANISYA. (looking towards the door by which Nikita entered the hut).\nWell, have you had enough spree? You\'ve been puffing yourself up, but\nnow you\'ll know how it feels! You\'ll lose some of your bluster!\n\nNIKITA (rushes out of the hut towards the cellar). Mother! Mother, I\nsay!\n\nMATRYONA (puts out her head). What is it, sonny?\n\nNIKITA (listening) Don\'t bury it, it\'s alive? Don\'t you hear? Alive!\nThere--it\'s whimpering! There ... quite plain!\n\nMATRYONA. How can it whimper? Why, you\'ve flattened it into a pancake!\nThe whole head is smashed to bits!\n\nNIKITA. What is it then? (Stops his ears.) It\'s still whimpering! I am\nlost! Lost! What have they done with me?... Where shall I go?\n\n     [Sits down on the step.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nVARIATION\n\nInstead of the end of Act IV. (from the words, "ANISYA.

MITRITCH is sitting\non the oven smoking.\n\nMITRITCH. Dear me! How they\'ve made the place smell I Drat \'em!\nThey\'ve been spilling the fine stuff. Even tobacco don\'t get rid of\nthe smell! It keeps tickling one\'s nose so. Oh Lord! But it\'s bedtime,\nI guess.\n\n     [Approaches the lamp to put it out.\n\nNAN (jumps up, and remains sitting up). Daddy dear,[7] don\'t put it\nout!\n\nMITRITCH. Not put it out? Why?\n\nNAN. Didn\'t you hear them making a row in the yard? (Listens.) D\'you\nhear, there in the barn again now?\n\nMITRITCH. What\'s that to you? I guess no one\'s asked you to mind! Lie\ndown and sleep! And I\'ll turn down the light.\n\n     [Turns down lamp.\n\nNAN. Daddy darling! Don\'t put it right out; leave a little bit if only\nas big as a mouse\'s eye, else it\'s so frightening!\n\nMITRITCH (laughs). All right, all right. (Sits down by her.) What\'s\nthere to be afraid of?\n\nNAN. How can one help being frightened, daddy! Sister did go on so!\nShe was beating her head against the box! (Whispers.) You know, I know\n... a little baby is going to be born.... It\'s already born, I\nthink....\n\nMITRITCH. Eh, what a little busybody it is! May the frogs tick her!\nMust needs know everything. Lie down and sleep! (NAN lies down.)\nThat\'s right! (Tucks her up.) That\'s right! There now, if you know too\nmuch you\'ll grow old too soon.\n\nNAN. And you are going to lie on the oven?\n\nMitrich. Well, of course! What a little silly you are, now I come to\nlook at you! Must needs know everything. (Tucks her up again, then\nstands up to go.) There now, lie still and sleep!\n\n     [Goes up to the oven.\n\nNAN. It gave just one cry, and now there\'s nothing to be heard.\n\nMITRITCH. Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas! What is it you can\'t hear?\n\nNAN. The baby.\n\nMITRITCH. There is none, that\'s why you can\'t hear it.\n\nNAN. But I heard it! Blest if I didn\'t hear it! Such a thin voice!\n\nMITRITCH. Heard indeed! Much you heard! Well, if you know,--why then\nit was just such a little girl as you that the bogey popped into his\nbag and made off with.\n\nNAN. What bogey?\n\nMITRITCH. Why, just his very self! (Climbs up on to the oven.) The\noven is beautifully warm to-night. Quite a treat! Oh Lord! Gracious\nNicholas!\n\nNAN. Daddy! are you going to sleep?\n\nMITRITCH. What else? Do you think I\'m going to sing songs?\n\n     [Silence.\n\nNAN. Daddy! Daddy, I say! They are digging! they\'re digging--don\'t\nyou hear? Blest if they\'re not, they\'re digging!\n\nMITRITCH. What are you dreaming about? Digging! Digging in the night!\nWho\'s digging? The cow\'s rubbing herself, that\'s all. Digging indeed!\nGo to sleep I tell you, else I\'ll just put out the light!\n\nNAN. Daddy darling, don\'t put it out! I won\'t ... truly, truly, I\nwon\'t. It\'s so frightful!\n\nMITRITCH. Frightful? Don\'t be afraid and then it won\'t be frightful.\nLook at her, she\'s afraid, and then says it\'s frightful. How can it\nhelp being frightful if you are afraid? Eh, what a stupid little girl!\n\n     [Silence. The cricket chirps.\n\nNAN (whispers). Daddy! I say, daddy! Are you asleep?\n\nMITRITCH. Now then, what d\'you want?\n\nNAN. What\'s the bogey like?\n\nMITRITCH. Why, like this! When he finds such a one as you, who won\'t\nsleep, he comes with a sack and pops the girl into it, then in he gets\nhimself, head and all, lifts her dress, and gives her a fine whipping!\n\nNAN. What with?\n\nMITRITCH. He takes a birch-broom with him.\n\nNAN. But he can\'t see there--inside the sack!\n\nMITRITCH. He\'ll see, no fear!\n\nNAN. But I\'ll bite him.\n\nMITRITCH. No, friend, him you can\'t bite!\n\nNAN. Daddy, there\'s some one coming! Who is it? Oh gracious goodness!\nWho can it be?\n\nMITRITCH. Well, if some one\'s coming, let them come! What\'s the matter\nwith you? I suppose it\'s your mother!\n\n     [Enter ANISYA.\n\nANISYA (NAN pretends to be asleep). Mitritch!\n\nMITRITCH. What?\n\nANISYA. What\'s the lamp burning for? We are going to sleep in the\nsummer-hut.\n\nMITRITCH. Why, you see I\'ve only just got straight. I\'ll put the light\nout all right.\n\nANISYA (rummages in her box and grumbles). When a thing\'s wanted one\nnever can find it!\n\nMITRITCH. Why, what is it you are looking for?\n\nANISYA. I\'m looking for a cross. Suppose it were to die unbaptized! It\nwould be a sin, you know!\n\nMITRITCH. Of course it would! Everything in due order.... Have you\nfound it?\n\nANISYA. Yes, I\'ve found it.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nMITRITCH. That\'s right, else I\'d have lent her mine. Oh Lord!\n\nNAN (jumps up trembling). Oh, oh, daddy! Don\'t go to sleep; for\ngoodness\' sake, don\'t! It\'s so frightful!\n\nMITRITCH. What\'s frightful?\n\nNAN. It will die--the little baby will! At Aunt Irene\'s the old woman\nalso baptized the baby, and it died!\n\nMITRITCH. If it dies, they\'ll bury it!\n\nNAN. But maybe it wouldn\'t have died, only old Granny Matryona\'s\nthere! Didn\'t I hear what granny was saying? I heard her! Blest if I\ndidn\'t!\n\nMITRITCH. What did you hear? Go to sleep, I tell you. Cover yourself\nup, head and all, and let\'s have an end of it!\n\nNAN. If it lived, I\'d nurse it!\n\nMITRITCH (roars). Oh Lord!\n\nNAN. Where will they put it?\n\nMITRITCH. In the right place! It\'s no business of yours! Go to sleep I\ntell you, else mother will come; she\'ll give it you!\n\n     [Silence.\n\nNAN. Daddy! Eh, daddy! That girl, you know, you were telling about\n--they didn\'t kill her?\n\nMITRITCH. That girl? Oh yes. That girl turned out all right!\n\nNAN. How was it? You were saying you found her?\n\nMITRITCH. Well, we just found her!\n\nNAN. But where did you find her? Do tell!\n\nMITRITCH. Why, in their own house; that\'s where! We came to a village,\nthe soldiers began hunting about in the house, when suddenly there\'s\nthat same little girl lying on the floor, flat on her stomach. We were\ngoing to give her a knock on the head, but all at once I felt that\nsorry, that I took her up in my arms; but no, she wouldn\'t let me!\nMade herself so heavy, quite a hundredweight, and caught hold where\nshe could with her hands, so that one couldn\'t get them off! Well, so\nI began stroking her head. It was so bristly,--just like a hedgehog! So\nI stroked and stroked, and she quieted down at last. I soaked a bit of\nrusk and gave it her. She understood that, and began nibbling. What\nwere we to do with her? We took her; took her, and began feeding and\nfeeding her, and she got so used to us that we took her with us on the\nmarch, and so she went about with us. Ah, she was a fine girl!\n\nNAN. Yes, and not baptized?\n\nMITRITCH. Who can tell! They used to say, not altogether. \'Cos why,\nthose people weren\'t our own.\n\nNAN. Germans?\n\nMITRITCH. What an idea! Germans! Not Germans, but Asiatics. They are\njust the same as Jews, but still not Jews. Polish, yet Asiatics. Curls\n... or, Curdlys is their name.... I\'ve forgotten what it is![8] We\ncalled the girl Sashka. She was a fine girl, Sashka was! There now,\nI\'ve forgotten everything I used to know! But that girl--the deuce\ntake her--seems to be before my eyes now! Out of all my time of\nservice, I remember how they flogged me, and I remember that girl.\nThat\'s all I remember! She\'d hang round one\'s neck, and one \'ud carry\nher so. That was a girl,--if you wanted a better you\'d not find one!\nWe gave her away afterwards. The captain\'s wife took her to bring up\nas her daughter. So--she was all right! How sorry the soldiers were to\nlet her go!\n\nNAN. There now, daddy, and I remember when father was dying,--you\nwere not living with us then. Well, he called Nikita and says,\n"Forgive me, Nikita!" he says, and begins to cry. (Sighs.) That also\nfelt very sad!\n\nMITRITCH. Yes; there now, so it is....\n\nNAN. Daddy! Daddy, I say! There they are again, making a noise in the\ncellar! Oh gracious heavens! Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh, daddy! They\'ll do\nsomething to it! They\'ll make away with it, and it\'s so little! Oh,\noh!\n\n     [Covers up her head and cries.\n\nMITRITCH (listening). Really they\'re up to some villainy, blow them to\nshivers! Oh, these women are vile creatures! One can\'t say much for\nmen either; but women!... They are like wild beasts, and stick at\nnothing!\n\nNAN (rising). Daddy; I say, daddy!\n\nMITRITCH. Well, what now?\n\nNAN. The other day a traveller stayed the night; he said that when an\ninfant died its soul goes up straight to heaven. Is that true?\n\nMITRITCH. Who can tell? I suppose so. Well?\n\nNAN. Oh, it would be best if I died too.\n\n     [Whimpers.\n\nMITRITCH. Then you\'d be off the list!\n\nNAN. Up to ten one\'s an infant, and maybe one\'s soul would go to God.\nElse one\'s sure to go to the bad!\n\nMITRITCH. And how to the bad? How should the likes of you not go to\nthe bad? Who teaches you? What do you see? What do you hear? Only\nvileness! I, though I\'ve not been taught much, still know a thing or\ntwo. I\'m not quite like a peasant woman. A peasant woman, what is she?\nJust mud! There are many millions of the likes of you in Russia, and\nall as blind as moles--knowing nothing! All sorts of spells: how to\nstop the cattle-plague with a plough, and how to cure children by\nputting them under the perches in the hen-house! That\'s what they\nknow!\n\nNAN. Yes, mother also did that!\n\nMITRITCH. Yes,--there it is,--just so! So many millions of girls and\nwomen, and all like beasts in a forest! As she grows up, so she dies!\nNever sees anything; never hears anything. A peasant,--he may learn\nsomething at the pub, or maybe in prison, or in the army,--as I did.\nBut a woman? Let alone about God, she doesn\'t even know rightly what\nFriday it is! Friday! Friday! But ask her what\'s Friday? She don\'t\nknow! They\'re like blind puppies, creeping about and poking their\nnoses into the dungheap.... All they know are their silly songs. Ho,\nho, ho, ho! But what they mean by ho-ho, they don\'t know themselves!\n\nNAN. But I, daddy, I do know half the Lord\'s Prayer!\n\nMITRITCH. A lot you know! But what Can one expect of you? Who teaches\nyou? Only a tipsy peasant--with the strap perhaps! That\'s all the\nteaching you get! I don\'t know who\'ll have to answer for you. For a\nrecruit, the drill-sergeant or the corporal has to answer; but for the\nlikes of you there\'s no one responsible! Just as the cattle that have\nno herdsman are the most mischievous, so with you women--you are the\nstupidest class! The most foolish class is yours!\n\nNAN. Then what\'s one to do?\n\nMITRITCH. That\'s what one has to do.... You just cover up your head\nand sleep! Oh Lord!\n\n     [Silence. The cricket chirps.\n\nNAN (jumps up). Daddy! Some one\'s screaming awfully! Blest if some one\nisn\'t screaming! Daddy darling, it\'s coming here!\n\nMITRITCH. Cover up your head, I tell you!\n\n     [Enter NIKITA, followed by MATRYONA.\n\nNIKITA. What have they done with me? What have they done with me?\n\nMATRYONA. Have a drop, honey; have a drop of drink! What\'s the matter?\n\n     [Fetches the spirits and sets the bottle before him.\n\nNIKITA. Give it here! Perhaps the drink will help me!\n\nMATRYONA. Mind! They\'re not asleep! Here you are, have a drop!\n\nNIKITA. What does it all mean? Why did you plan it? You might have\ntaken it somewhere!\n\nMATRYONA (whispers). Sit still a bit and drink a little more, or have\na smoke. It will ease your thoughts!\n\nNIKITA. My own mother! My turn seems to have come! How it began to\nwhimper, and how the little bones crunched ... krr.... I\'m not a man\nnow!\n\nMATRYONA. Eh, now, what\'s the use of talking so silly! Of course it\ndoes seem fearsome at night, but wait till the daylight comes, and a\nday or two passes, and you\'ll forget to think of it!\n\n     [Goes up to NIKITA and puts her hand on his shoulder.\n\nNIKITA. Go away from me! What have you done with me?\n\nMATRYONA. Come, come, sonny! Now, really, what\'s the matter with you?\n\n     [Takes his hand.\n\nNIKITA. Go away from me! I\'ll kill you! It\'s all one to me now! I\'ll\nkill you!\n\nMATRYONA. Oh, oh, how frightened he\'s got! You should go and have a\nsleep now!\n\nNIKITA. I have nowhere to go; I\'m lost!\n\nMATRYONA (shaking her head). Oh, oh, I\'d better go and tidy things up.\nHe\'ll sit and rest a bit, and it will pass!\n\n     [Exit.\n\n     [NIKITA sits with his face in his hands. MITRITCH and NAN seem\nstunned.\n\nNIKITA. It\'s whining! It\'s whining! It is really--there, there, quite\nplain! She\'ll bury it, really she will! (Runs to the door.) Mother,\ndon\'t bury it, it\'s alive....\n\n     [Enter MATRYONA.\n\nMATRYONA (whispers). Now then, what is it? Heaven help you! Why won\'t\nyou get to rest? How can it be alive? All its bones are crushed!\n\nNIKITA. Give me more drink.\n\n     [Drinks.\n\nMATRYONA. Now go, sonny. You\'ll fall asleep now all right.\n\nNIKITA (stands listening). Still alive ... there ... it\'s whining!\nDon\'t you hear?... There!\n\nMATRYONA (whispers). No! I tell you!\n\nNIKITA. Mother! My own mother! I\'ve ruined my life! What have you done\nwith me? Where am I to go?\n\n     [Runs out of the hut; MATRYONA follows him.\n\nNAN. Daddy dear, darling, they\'ve smothered it!\n\nMITRITCH (angrily). Go to sleep, I tell you! Oh dear, may the frogs\nkick you! I\'ll give it to you with the broom! Go to sleep, I tell you!\n\nNAN. Daddy, my treasure! Something is catching hold of my shoulders,\nsomething is catching hold with its paws! Daddy dear ... really,\nreally ... I must go! Daddy, darling! let me get up on the oven with\nyou! Let me, for Heaven\'s sake! Catching hold ... catching hold! Oh!\n\n     [Runs to the stove.\n\nMITRITCH. See how they\'ve frightened the girl.... What vile creatures\nthey are! May the frogs kick them! Well then, climb up. Nan (climbs on\noven). But don\'t you go away! Mitritch. Where should I go to? Climb\nup, climb up! Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas! Holy Mother!... How they\nhave frightened the girl. (Covers her up.) There\'s a little fool--\nreally a little fool! How they\'ve frightened her; really, they are\nvile creatures! The deuce take \'em!\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nACT V\n\nSCENE I\n\nIn front of scene a stack-stand, to the left a thrashing ground, to\nthe right a barn. The barn doors are open. Straw is strewn about in\nthe doorway. The hut with yard and out-buildings is seen in the\nbackground, whence proceed sounds of singing and of a tambourine. Two\nGIRLS are walking past the barn towards the hut.\n\nFIRST GIRL. There, you see we\'ve managed to pass without so much as\ngetting our boots dirty! But to come by the street is terribly muddy!\n(Stop and wipe their boots on the straw. FIRST GIRL looks at the straw\nand sees something .) What\'s that?\n\nSECOND GIRL (looks where the straw lies and sees some one). It\'s\nMITRITCH, their laborer. Just look how drunk he is!\n\nFIRST GIRL. Why, I thought be didn\'t drink.\n\nSECOND GIRL. It seems he didn\'t, until it was going around. First\nGirl. Just see! He must have come to fetch some straw. Look! he\'s got\na rope in his hand, and he\'s fallen asleep.\n\nSECOND GIRL (listening). They\'re still singing the praises.[9] So I\ns\'pose the bride and bridegroom have not yet been blessed! They say\nAkoulina didn\'t even lament![10]\n\nFIRST GIRL. Mammie says she is marrying against her will. Her\nstepfather threatened her, or else she\'d not have done it for the\nworld! Why, you know what they\'ve been saying about her?\n\nMARINA (catching up the GIRLS). How d\'you you do, lassies?\n\nGIRLS. How d\'you do?\n\nMARINA. Going to the wedding, my dears?\n\nFIRST GIRL. It\'s nearly over! We\'ve come just to have a look.\n\nMARINA. Would you call my old man for me? Simon, from Zouevo; but\nsurely you know him?\n\nFIRST GIRL. To be sure we do; he\'s a relative of the bridegroom\'s, I\nthink?\n\nMARINA. Of course; he\'s my old man\'s nephew, the bridegroom is.\n\nSECOND GIRL. Why don\'t you go yourself? Fancy not going to a wedding!\n\nMARINA. I have no mind for it, and no time either. It\'s time for us to\nbe going home. We didn\'t mean to come to the wedding. We were taking\noats to town. We only stopped to feed the horse, and they made my old\nman go in.\n\nFIRST GIRL. Where did you put up then? At Fyodoritch\'s?\n\nMARINA. Yes. Well then, I\'ll stay here and you go and call him, my\ndear--my old man. Call him, my pet, and say "Your missis, Marina, says\nyou must go now!" His mates are harnessing.\n\nFIRST GIRL. Well, all right--if you won\'t go in yourself.\n\n     [The GIRLS go away towards the house along a footpath. Sounds of\n      songs and tambourine.\n\nMARINA (alone, stands thinking). I might go in, but I don\'t like to,\nbecause I have not met him since that day he threw me over. It\'s more\nthan a year now. But I\'d have liked to have a peep and see how he\nlives with his Anisya. People say they don\'t get on. She\'s a coarse\nwoman, and with a character of her own. I should think he\'s remembered\nme more than once. He\'s been caught by the idea of a comfortable life\nand has changed me for it. But, God help him, I don\'t cherish\nill-will! Then it hurt! Oh dear, it was pain! But now it\'s worn away\nand been forgotten. But I\'d like to have seen him. (Looks towards hut\nand sees NIKITA.) Look there! Why, he is coming here! Have the girls\ntold him? How\'s it he has left his guests? I\'ll go away! (NIKITA\napproaches, hanging his head down, swinging his arms, and muttering.)\nAnd how sullen he looks!\n\nNIKITA (sees and recognises MARINA). Marina, dearest friend, little\nMARINA, what do you want?\n\nMARINA. I have come for my old man.\n\nNIKITA. Why didn\'t you come to the wedding? You might have had a look\nround, and a laugh at my expense!\n\nMARINA. What have I to laugh at? I\'ve come for my husband.\n\nNIKITA. Ah, Marina dear!\n\n     [Tries to embrace her.\n\nMARINA (steps angrily aside). You\'d better drop that sort of thing,\nNikita! What has been is past! I\'ve come for my husband. Is he in your\nhouse?\n\nNIKITA. So I must not remember the past? You won\'t let me?\n\nMARINA. It\'s no use recalling the past! What used to be is over now!\n\nNIKITA. And can never come back, you mean?\n\nMARINA. And will never come back! But why have you gone away? You, the\nmaster,--and to go away from the feast!\n\nNIKITA (sits down on the straw). Why have I gone away? Eh, if you\nknew, if you had any idea.... I\'m dull, Marina, so dull that I wish my\neyes would not see! I rose from the table and left them, to get away\nfrom the people. If I could only avoid seeing any one!\n\nMARINA (coming nearer to him). How\'s that?\n\nNIKITA. This is how it is: when I eat, it\'s there! When I drink, it\'s\nthere! When I sleep, it\'s there! I\'m so sick of it--so sick! But it\'s\nchiefly because I\'m all alone that I\'m so sick, Marina. I have no one\nto share my trouble.\n\nMARINA. You can\'t live your life without trouble, Nikita. However,\nI\'ve wept over mine and wept it away.\n\nNIKITA. The former, the old trouble! Ah, dear friend, you\'ve wept\nyours away, and I\'ve got mine up to there!\n\n     [Puts his hand to his throat.\n\nMARINA. But why?\n\nNIKITA. Why, I\'m sick of my whole life! I am sick of myself! Ah,\nMARINA, why did you not know how to keep me? You\'ve ruined me, and\nyourself too! Is this life?\n\nMARINA (stands by the barn crying, but restrains herself). I do not\ncomplain of my life, Nikita! God grant every one a life like mine. I\ndo not complain. I confessed to my old man at the time, and he forgave\nme. And he does not reproach me. I\'m not discontented with my life.\nThe old man is quiet, and is fond of me, and I keep his children\nclothed and washed! He is really kind to me. Why should I complain? It\nseems God willed it so. And what\'s the matter with your life? You are\nrich....\n\nNIKITA. My life!... It\'s only that I don\'t wish to disturb the wedding\nfeast, or I\'d take this rope here (takes hold of the rope on the\nstraw) and throw it across that rafter there. Then I\'d make a noose\nand stretch it out, and I\'d climb on to that rafter and jump down with\nmy head in the noose! That\'s what my life is!\n\nMARINA. That\'s enough! Lord help you!\n\nNIKITA. You think I\'m joking? You think I\'m drunk? I\'m not drunk!\nTo-day even drink takes no hold on me! I\'m devoured by misery! Misery\nis eating me up completely, so that I care for nothing! Oh little\nMarina, it\'s only with you I ever lived! Do you remember how we used\nto while away the nights together at the railway?\n\nMARINA. Don\'t you rub the sores, Nikita! I\'m bound legally now, and\nyou too. My sin has been forgiven, don\'t disturb...\n\nNIKITA. What shall I do with my heart? Where am I to turn to?\n\nMARINA. What\'s there to be done? You\'ve got a wife. Don\'t go looking\nat others, but keep to your own! You loved Anisya, then go on loving\nher!\n\nNIKITA. Oh, that Anisya, she\'s gall and wormwood to me, but she\'s\nround my feet like rank weeds!\n\nMARINA. Whatever she is, still she\'s your wife.... But what\'s the use\nof talking; you\'d better go to your visitors, and send my husband to\nme.\n\nNIKITA. Oh dear, if you knew the whole business... but there\'s no good\ntalking!\n\n     [Enter MARINA\'S husband, red and tipsy, and NAN.\n\nMARINA\'S HUSBAND. Marina! Missis! My old woman! are you here?\n\nNIKITA. There\'s your husband calling you. Go!\n\nMARINA. And you?\n\nNIKITA. I? I\'ll lie down here for a bit!\n\n     [Lies down on the straw.\n\nHusband. Where is she then?\n\nNAN. There she is, near the barn.\n\nHUSBAND. What are you standing there for? Come to the feast! The hosts\nwant you to come and do them honor! The wedding party is just going to\nstart, and then we can go too.\n\nMARINA (going towards her husband). I didn\'t want to go in.\n\nHUSBAND. Come on, I tell you! You\'ll drink a glass to our nephew\nPeter\'s health, the rascal! Else the hosts might take offense! There\'s\nplenty of time for our business.\n\n     [MARINA\'S husband puts his arm around her, and goes reeling out\n      with her.\n\nNIKITA (rises and sits down on the straw). Ah, now that I\'ve seen her,\nlife seems more sickening than ever! It was only with her that I ever\nreally lived! I\'ve ruined my life for nothing! I\'ve done for myself!\n(Lies down.) Where can I go? If mother earth would but open and\nswallow me!\n\nNAN (sees NIKITA, and runs towards him). Daddy, I say, daddy! They\'re\nlooking for you! Her godfather and all of them have already blessed\nher. Truly they have, they\'re getting cross!\n\nNIKITA (aside). Where can I go to?\n\nNAN. What? What are you saying?\n\nNIKITA. I\'m not saying anything! Don\'t bother!\n\nNAN. Daddy! Come, I say! (NIKITA is silent, NAN pulls him by the\nhand.) Dad, go and bless them! My word, they\'re angry, they\'re\ngrumbling!\n\nNIKITA (drags away his hand). Leave me alone!\n\nNAN. Now then!\n\nNIKITA (threatens her with the rope). Go, I say! I\'ll give it you!\n\nNAN. Then I\'ll send mother!\n\n     [Runs away.\n\nNIKITA (rises). How can I go? How can I take the holy icon in my\nhands? How am I to look her in the face! (Lies down again.) Oh, if\nthere were a hole in the ground, I\'d jump in! No one should see me,\nand I should see no one! (Rises again.) No, I shan\'t go.... May they\nall go to the devil, I shan\'t go! (Takes the rope and makes a noose,\nand tries it on his neck.) That\'s the way!\n\n     [Enter MATRYONA. NIKITA sees his mother, takes the rope off his\n      neck, and again lies down in the straw.\n\nMATRYONA (comes in hurriedly). Nikita! Nikita, I say! He don\'t even\nanswer! Nikita, what\'s the matter? Have you had a drop too much? Come,\nNikita dear; come, honey! The people are tired of waiting.\n\nNIKITA. Oh dear, what have you done with me? I\'m a lost man!\n\nMATRYONA. But what is the matter then? Come, my own; come, give them\nyour blessing, as is proper and honorable, and then it\'ll all be over!\nWhy, the people are waiting!\n\nNIKITA. How can I give blessings?\n\nMATRYONA. Why, in the usual way! Don\'t you know?\n\nNIKITA. I know, I know! But who is it I am to bless? What have I done\nto her?\n\nMATRYONA. What have you done? Eh, now he\'s going to remember it! Why,\nwho knows anything about it? Not a soul! And the girl is going of her\nown accord.\n\nNIKITA. Yes, but how?\n\nMATRYONA. Because she\'s afraid, of course. But still she\'s going.\nBesides, what\'s to be done now? She should have thought sooner! Now\nshe can\'t refuse. And his kinsfolks can\'t take offense either. They\nsaw the girl twice, and get money with her too! It\'s all safe and\nsound!\n\nNIKITA. Yes, but what\'s in the cellar?\n\nMATRYONA (laughs). In the cellar? Why, cabbages, mushrooms, potatoes,\nI suppose! Why remember the past?\n\nNIKITA. I\'d be only too glad to forget it; but I can\'t! When I let my\nmind go, it\'s just as if I heard.... Oh, what have you done with me?\n\nMATRYONA. Now, what are you humbugging for?\n\nNIKITA (turns face downward). Mother! Don\'t torment me! I\'ve got it up\nto there!\n\n     [Puts his hand to his throat.\n\nMATRYONA. Still it has to be done! As it is, people are talking. "The\nmaster\'s gone away and won\'t come; he can\'t make up his mind to give\nhis blessing." They\'ll be putting two and two together. As soon as\nthey see you\'re frightened they\'ll begin guessing. "The thief none\nsuspect who walks bold and erect!" But you\'ll be getting out of the\nfrying-pan into the fire! Above all, lad, don\'t show it; don\'t lose\ncourage, else they\'ll find out all the more!\n\nNIKITA. Oh dear! You have snared me into a trap!\n\nMATRYONA. That\'ll do, I tell you; come along! Come in and give your\nblessing, as is right and honorable;--and there\'s an end of the\nmatter!\n\nNIKITA (lies face down). I can\'t!\n\nMATRYONA (aside). What has come over him? He seemed all right, and\nsuddenly this comes over him! It seems he\'s bewitched! Get up, Nikita!\nSee! There\'s Anisya coming; she\'s left her guests!\n\n     [ANISYA enters, dressed up, red and tipsy.\n\nANISYA. Oh, how nice it is, mother! So nice, so respectable! And how\nthe people are pleased.... But where is he?\n\nMATRYONA. Here, honey, he\'s here; he\'s laid down on the straw and\nthere he lies! He won\'t come!\n\nNIKITA (looking at his wife). Just see, she\'s tipsy too! When I look\nat her my heart seems to turn! How can one live with her? (Turns on\nhis face.) I\'ll kill her some day! It\'ll be worse then!\n\nANISYA. Only look, how he\'s got all among the straw! Is it the drink?\n(Laughs.) I\'d not mind lying down there with you, but I\'ve no time!\nCome, I\'ll lead you! It is so nice in the house! It\'s a treat to look\non! A concertina! And the women singing so well! All tipsy! Everything\nso respectable, so nice!\n\nNIKITA. What\'s nice?\n\nANISYA. The wedding--such a jolly wedding! They all say it\'s quite an\nuncommon fine wedding. All so respectable, so nice! Come along! We\'ll\ngo together! I have had a drop, but I can give you a hand yet!\n\n     [Takes his hand.\n\nNIKITA. (pulls it back with disgust). Go alone! I\'ll come!\n\nANISYA. What, are you humbugging for? We\'ve got rid of all the bother,\nwe\'ve got rid of her as came between us; now we have nothing to do but\nto live and be merry! And all so respectable, and quite legal! I\'m so\npleased! I have no words for it! It\'s just as if I were going to marry\nyou over again! And oh, the people, they are pleased! They\'re all\nthanking us! And the guests are all of the best: Ivan Mosevitch is\nthere, and the Police Officer; they\'ve also been singing songs of\npraise!\n\nNIKITA. Then you should have stayed with them! What have you come for?\n\nANISYA. True enough, I must go back! Else what does it look like! The\nhosts both go and leave the visitors! And the guests are all of the\nbest!\n\nNIKITA (gets up and brushes the straw off himself). Go, and I\'ll come\nat once!\n\nMATRYONA. Just see! He listens to the young bird, but wouldn\'t listen\nto the old one! He would not hear me, but he follows his wife at once!\n(MATRYONA and ANISYA turn to go.) Well, are you coming?\n\nNIKITA. I\'ll come directly! You go and I\'ll follow! I\'ll come and give\nmy blessing! (The women stop.) Go on! I\'ll follow! Now then, go! (Exit\nwomen. Sits down and takes his boots off.) Yes, I\'m going! A likely\nthing! No, you\'d better look at the rafter for me! I\'ll fix the noose\nand jump with it from the rafter, then you can look for me! And the\nrope is here just handy. (Ponders.) I\'d have got over it, over any\nsorrow--I\'d have got over that. But this now--here it is, deep in my\nheart, and I can\'t get over it! (Looks towards the yard.) Surely she\'s\nnot coming back? (Imitates ANISYA.) "So nice, so nice. I\'d lie down\nhere with you." Oh, the baggage! Well, then, here I am! Come and\ncuddle when they\'ve taken me down from the rafter! There\'s only one\nway!\n\n     [Takes the rope and pulls it.\n\n     [MITRITCH, who is tipsy, sits up and won\'t let go of the rope.\n\nMITRITCH. Shan\'t give it up! Shan\'t give it to no one! I\'ll bring it\nmyself! I said I\'d bring the straw--and so I will! Nikita, is that\nyou? (Laughs.) Oh, the devil! Have you come to get the straw?\n\nNIKITA. Give me the rope!\n\nMitrich. No, you wait a bit! The peasants sent me! I\'ll bring it....\n(Rises to his feet and begins getting the straw together, but reels\nfor a time, then falls.) It has beaten me. It\'s stronger....\n\nNIKITA. Give me the rope!\n\nMITRITCH. Didn\'t I say I won\'t! Oh, Nikita, you\'re as stupid as a hog!\n(Laughs.) I love you, but you\'re a fool! You see that I\'m drunk ...\ndevil take you! You think I need you?... You just look at me; I\'m a\nNon ... fool, can\'t say it--Non-commissioned Officer of Her Majesty\'s\nvery First Regiment of Grenadier Guards! I\'ve served Tsar and country,\nloyal and true! But who am I? You think I\'m a warrior? No, I\'m not a\nwarrior; I\'m the very least of men, a poor lost orphan! I swore not to\ndrink, and now I had a smoke, and.... Well then, do you think I\'m\nafraid of you? No fear; I\'m afraid of no man! I\'ve taken to drink, and\nI\'ll drink! Now I\'ll go it for a fortnight; I\'ll go it hard! I\'ll\ndrink my last shirt; I\'ll drink my cap; I\'ll pawn my passport; and I\'m\nafraid of no one! They flogged me in the army to stop me drinking!\nThey switched and switched! "Well," they say, "will you leave off?"\n"No," says I! Why should I be afraid of them? Here I am! Such as I am,\nGod made me! I swore off drinking, and didn\'t drink. Now I\'ve took to\ndrink, and I\'ll drink! And I fear no man! \'Cos I don\'t lie; but just\nas.... Why should one mind them--such muck as they are! "Here you\nare," I say; that\'s me. A priest told me, the devil\'s the biggest\nbragger! "As soon," says he, "as you begin to brag, you get\nfrightened; and as soon as you fear men then the hoofed one just\ncollars you and pushes you where he likes!" But as I don\'t fear men,\nI\'m easy! I can spit in the devil\'s beard, and at the sow his mother!\nHe can\'t do me no harm! There, put that in your pipe!\n\nNIKITA (crossing himself). True enough! What was I about?\n\n     [Throws down the rope.\n\nMITRITCH. What?\n\nNIKITA (rises). You tell me not to fear men?\n\nMITRITCH. Why fear such muck as they are? You look at \'em in the\nbath-house! All made of one paste! One has a bigger belly, another a\nsmaller; that\'s all the difference there is! Fancy being afraid of\n\'em! Deuce take \'em!\n\nMATRYONA (from the yard). Well, are you coming?\n\nNIKITA. Ah! Better so! I\'m coming!\n\n     [Goes towards yard.\n\n\nSCENE II\n\nInterior of hut, full of people, some sitting round tables and others\nstanding. In the front corner AKOULINA and the BRIDEGROOM. On one of\nthe tables an Icon and a loaf of rye-bread. Among the visitors are\nMARINA, her husband, and a POLICE OFFICER, also a HIRED DRIVER, the\nMATCHMAKER, and the BEST MAN. The women are singing. ANISYA carries\nround the drink. The singing stops.\n\nTHE DRIVER. If we are to go, let\'s go! The church ain\'t so near.\n\nTHE BEST MAN. All right; you wait a bit till the step-father has given\nhis blessing. But where is he?\n\nANISYA. He is coming--coming at once, dear friends! Have another\nglass, all of you; don\'t refuse!\n\nTHE MATCHMAKER. Why is he so long? We\'ve been waiting such a time!\n\nANISYA. He\'s coming; coming directly, coming in no time! He\'ll be here\nbefore one could plait a girl\'s hair who\'s had her hair cropped!\nDrink, friends! (Offers the drink.) Coming at once! Sing again, my\npets, meanwhile!\n\nTHE DRIVER. They\'ve sung all their songs, waiting here!\n\n     [The women sing. NIKITA and AKIM enter during the singing.\n\nNIKITA (holds his father\'s arm and pushes him in before him). Go,\nfather; I can\'t do without you!\n\nAKIM. I don\'t like--I mean what d\'ye call it....\n\nNIKITA (to the women). Enough! Be quiet! (Looks round the hut.)\nMarina, are you there?\n\nTHE MATCHMAKER. Go, take the icon, and give them your blessing!\n\nNIKITA. Wait a while! (Looks round.) Akoulina, are you there?\n\nMATCHMAKER. What are you calling everybody for? Where should she be?\nHow queer he seems!\n\nANISYA. Gracious goodness! Why, he\'s barefoot!\n\nNIKITA. Father, you are here! Look at me! Christian Commune, you are\nall here, and I am here! I am....\n\n     [Falls on his knees.\n\nANISYA. Nikita, darling, what\'s the matter with you? Oh, my head, my\nhead!\n\nMATCHMAKER. Here\'s a go!\n\nMATRYONA. I did say he was taking too much of that French wine! Come\nto your senses; what are you about?\n\n     [They try to lift him; he takes no heed of them, but looks in\n      front of him.\n\nNIKITA. Christian Commune! I have sinned, and I wish to confess!\n\nMATRYONA (shakes him by the shoulder). Are you mad? Dear friends, he\'s\ngone crazy! He must be taken away!\n\nNIKITA (shakes her off). Leave me alone! And you, father, hear me! And\nfirst, Marina, look here! (Bows to the ground to her and rises.) I\nhave sinned towards you! I promised to marry you, I tempted you, and\nforsook you! Forgive me, in Christ\'s name!\n\n     [Again bows to the ground before her.\n\nANISYA. And what are you drivelling about? It\'s not becoming! No one\nwants to know! Get up! It\'s like your impudence!\n\nMATRYONA. Oh, oh, he\'s bewitched! And however did it happen? It\'s a\nspell! Get up! what nonsense are you jabbering?\n\n     [Pulls him.\n\nNIKITA (shakes his head). Don\'t touch me! Forgive me my sin towards\nyou, Marina! Forgive me, for Christ\'s sake!\n\n     [MARINA covers her face with her hands in silence.\n\nANISYA. Get up, I tell you! Don\'t be so impudent! What are you\nthinking about--to recall it? Enough humbug! It\'s shameful! Oh my poor\nhead! He\'s quite crazy!\n\nNIKITA (pushes his wife away and turns to AKOULINA). Akoulina, now\nI\'ll speak to you! Listen, Christian Commune! I\'m a fiend, Akoulina! I\nhave sinned against you! Your father died no natural death! He was\npoisoned!\n\nANISYA (screams). Oh my head! What\'s he about?\n\nMATRYONA. The man\'s beside himself! Lead him away!\n\n     [The folk come up and try to seize him.\n\nAKIM (motions them back with his arms). Wait! You lads, what d\'ye call\nit, wait, I mean!\n\nNIKITA. Akoulina, I poisoned him! Forgive me, in Christ\'s name!\n\nAKOULINA (jumps up). He\'s telling lies! I know who did it!\n\nMATCHMAKER. What are you about? You sit still!\n\nAKIM. Oh Lord, what sins, what sins!\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. Seize him, and send for the Elder! We must draw up an\nindictment and have witnesses to it! Get up and come here!\n\nAKIM (to POLICE OFFICER). Now you--with the bright buttons--I mean,\nyou wait! Let him, what d\'ye call it, speak out, I mean!\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. Mind, old man, and don\'t interfere! I have to draw up\nan indictment!\n\nAKIM. Eh, what a fellow you are; wait, I say! Don\'t talk, I mean,\nabout, what d\'ye call it, \'ditements\' Here God\'s work is being\ndone.... A man is confessing, I mean! And you, what d\'ye call it ...\n\'ditements!\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. The Elder!\n\nAKIM. Let God\'s work be done, I mean, and then you. I mean you, do\nyour business!\n\nNIKITA. And, Akoulina, my sin is great towards you; I seduced you;\nforgive me in Christ\'s name!\n\n     [Bows to the ground before her.\n\nAKOULINA (leaves the table). Let me go! I shan\'t be married! He told\nme to, but I shan\'t now!\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. Repeat what you have said.\n\nNIKITA. Wait, sir, let me finish!\n\nAKIM (with rapture). Speak, my son! Tell everything--you\'ll feel\nbetter! Confess to God, don\'t fear men! God--God! It is He!\n\nNIKITA. I poisoned the father, dog that I am, and I ruined the\ndaughter! She was in my power, and I ruined her, and her baby!\n\nAKOULINA. True, that\'s true!\n\nNIKITA. I smothered the baby in the cellar with a board! I sat on it\nand smothered it--and its bones crunched! (Weeps.) And I buried it! I\ndid it, all alone!\n\nAKOULINA. He raves! I told him to!\n\nNIKITA. Don\'t shield me! I fear no one now! Forgive me, Christian\nCommune!\n\n     [Bows to the ground.\n\n     [Silence.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. Bind him! The marriage is evidently off!\n\n     [Men come up with their belts.\n\nNIKITA. Wait, there\'s plenty of time! (Bows to the ground before his\nfather.) Father, dear father, forgive me too,--fiend that I am! You\ntold me from the first, when I took to bad ways, you said then, "If a\nclaw is caught, the bird is lost!" I would not listen to your words,\ndog that I was, and it has turned out as you said! Forgive me, for\nChrist\'s sake!\n\nAKIM (rapturously). God will forgive you, my own son! (Embraces him.)\nYou have had no mercy on yourself; He will show mercy on you! God--\nGod! It is He!\n\n     [Enter ELDER.\n\nELDER. There are witnesses enough here.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. We will have the examination at once.\n\n     [NIKITA is bound.\n\nAKOULINA. (goes and stands by his side). I shall tell the truth! Ask\nme!\n\nNIKITA (bound). No need to ask! I did it all myself. The design was\nmine, and the deed was mine. Take me where you like. I will say no\nmore!\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES FOR THE POWER OF DARKNESS\n\n1.   It is customary to place a dying person under the icon. One or\n     more icons hang in the hut of each Orthodox peasant.\n\n2.   Peasant weddings are usually in autumn. They are forbidden in\n     Lent, and soon after Easter the peasants become too busy to marry\n     till harvest is over.\n\n3.   A formal request for forgiveness is customary among Russians, but\n     it is often no mere formality. Nikita\'s first reply is evasive;\n     his second reply, "God will forgive you," is the correct one\n     sanctioned by custom.\n\n4.   Loud public wailing of this kind is customary, and considered\n     indispensable, among the peasants.\n\n5.   Where not otherwise mentioned in the stage directions, it is\n     always the winter half of the hut that is referred to as "the\n     hut." The summer half is not heated, and not used in winter\n     under ordinary circumstances.\n\n6.   The Foundlings\' Hospital in Moscow, where 80 to 90 percent of the\n     children die.\n\n7.   Nan calls Mitritch "daddy" merely as a term of endearment.\n\n8.   Probably Kurds\n\n9.   This refers to the songs customary at the wedding of Russian\n     peasants, praising the bride and bridegroom.\n\n10.  It is etiquette for a bride to bewail the approaching loss of her\n     maidenhood.\n\nEND OF _THE POWER OF DARKNESS_\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFRUITS OF CULTURE\n\n\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH ZVEZDINTSEF.

A staircase leads up to the other rooms;\nbehind it is another door leading to the servants\' quarters.\n\n\nSCENE I\n\nGREGORY (looks at himself in the glass and arranges his hair, etc.). I\nam sorry about those moustaches of mine! "Moustaches are not becoming\nto a footman," she says! And why? Why, so that any one might see\nyou\'re a footman,--else my looks might put her darling son to shame.\nHe\'s a likely one! There\'s not much fear of his coming anywhere near\nme, moustaches or no moustaches! (Smiling into the glass.) And what a\nlot of \'em swarm round me. And yet I don\'t care for any of them as\nmuch as for that Tanya. And she only a lady\'s-maid! Ah well, she\'s\nnicer than any young lady. (Smiles.) She\'s a duck! (Listening.) Ah,\nhere she comes. (Smiles.) Yes, that\'s her, clattering with her little\nheels. Oh!\n\n     [Enter TANYA, carrying a cloak and boots.\n\nGREGORY. My respects to you, Tatyana Markovna.\n\nTANYA. What are you always looking in the glass for? Do you think\nyourself so good-looking?\n\nGREGORY. Well, and are my looks not agreeable?\n\nTANYA. So, so; neither agreeable nor disagreeable, but just betwixt\nand between! Why are all those cloaks hanging there?\n\nGREGORY. I am just going to put them away, your lady-ship! (Takes down\na fur cloak and, wrapping it round her, embraces her.) I say, Tanya,\nI\'ll tell you something....\n\nTANYA. Oh, get away, do! What do you mean by it? (Pulls herself\nangrily away.) Leave me alone, I tell you!\n\nGREGORY (looks cautiously around). Then give me a kiss!\n\nTANYA. Now, really, what are you bothering for? I\'ll give you such a\nkiss!\n\n     [Raises her hand to strike.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (off the scene, rings and then shouts). Gregory!\n\nTANYA. There now, go! Vasily Leoniditch is calling you.\n\nGREGORY. He\'ll wait! He\'s only just opened his eyes! I say, why don\'t\nyou love me?\n\nTANYA. What sort of loving have you imagined now? I don\'t love\nanybody.\n\nGREGORY. That\'s a fib. You love Simon! You have found a nice one to\nlove--a common, dirty-pawed peasant, a butler\'s assistant!\n\nTANYA. Never mind; such as he is, you are jealous of him!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (off the scene). Gregory!\n\nGREGORY. All in good time.... Jealous indeed! Of what? Why, you have\nonly just begun to get licked into shape, and who are you tying\nyourself up with? Now, wouldn\'t it be altogether a different matter if\nyou loved me?.... I say, Tanya....\n\nTANYA (angrily and severely). You\'ll get nothing from me, I tell you!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (off the scene). Gregory!\n\nGREGORY.

Gregory!\n\n     [TANYA and GREGORY laugh.\n\nGREGORY. You should have seen the girls that have been sweet on me.\n\n     [Bell rings.\n\nTANYA. Well then, go to them, and leave me alone!\n\nGREGORY. You are a silly, now I think of it. I\'m not Simon!\n\nTANYA. Simon means marriage, and not tomfoolery!\n\n     [Enter PORTER, carrying a large cardboard box.\n\nPORTER. Good morning!\n\nGREGORY. Good morning! Where are you from?\n\nPORTER. From Bourdey\'s. I\'ve brought a dress, and here\'s a note for\nthe lady.\n\nTANYA (taking the note).

I beg your pardon, but the footman has just gone away. This\nway, sir. Allow me, please.\n\n     [Takes his fur cloak.\n\nSAHATOF (adjusting his clothes). Is Leonid Fyodoritch at home? Is he\nup?\n\n     [Bell rings.\n\nTANYA. Oh yes, sir. He\'s been up a long time.\n\n     [DOCTOR enters and looks around for the footman. Sees SAHATOF and\n      addresses him in an offhand manner.\n\nDOCTOR. Ah, my respects to you!\n\nSAHATOF (looks fixedly at him). The Doctor, I believe?\n\nDOCTOR. And I thought you were abroad! Dropped in to see Leonid\nFyodoritch?\n\nSAHATOF. Yes. And you? Is any one ill?\n\nDOCTOR (laughing). Not exactly ill but, you know.... It\'s awful with\nthese ladies! Sits up at cards till three every morning, and pulls her\nwaist into the shape of a wine-glass. And the lady is flabby and fat,\nand carries the weight of a good many years on her back.\n\nSAHATOF. Is this the way you state your diagnosis to Anna Pavlovna? I\nshould hardly think it quite pleases her!\n\nDOCTOR (laughing). Well, it\'s the truth. They do all these tricks--and\nthen come derangements of the digestive organs, pressure on the liver,\nnerves, and all sorts of things, and one has to come and patch them\nup. It\'s just awful! (Laughs.) And you? You are also a spiritualist,\nit seems?\n\nSAHATOF. I? No, I am not also a spiritualist.... Good morning!\n\n     [Is about to go, but is stopped by the DOCTOR.\n\nDOCTOR. No! But I can\'t myself, you know, positively deny the\npossibility of it, when a man like Krougosvetlof is connected with it\nall. How can one? Is he not a professor,--a European celebrity? There\nmust be something in it. I should like to see for myself, but I never\nhave the time. I have other things to do.\n\nSAHATOF. Yes, yes! Good morning.\n\n     [Exit, bowing slightly.\n\nDOCTOR (to Tanya). Is Anna Pavlovna up?\n\nTANYA. She\'s in her bedroom, but please come up.\n\n     [DOCTOR goes upstairs.\n\n     [THEODORE IVANITCH enters with a newspaper In his hand.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (to PORTER). What is it you want?\n\nPORTER. I\'m from Bourdey\'s. I brought a dress and a note, and was told\nto wait.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Ah, from Bourdey\'s! (To Tanya.) Who came in just\nnow?\n\nTANYA. It was Sergey Ivanitch Sahatof and the Doctor. They stood\ntalking here a bit. It was all about spiritalism.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (correcting her). Spiritualism.\n\nTANYA. Yes, that\'s just what I said--spiritalism. Have you heard how\nwell it went off last time, Theodore Ivanitch? (Laughs). There was\nknocks, and things flew about!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. And how do you know?\n\nTANYA. Miss Elizabeth told me.\n\n     [JACOB runs in with a tumbler of tea on a tray.\n\nJACOB (to the PORTER). Good morning!\n\nPORTER (disconsolately). Good morning!\n\n     [JACOB knocks at VASILY LEONIDITCH\'S door.\n\n     [GREGORY enters.\n\nGREGORY. Give it here.\n\nJACOB. You didn\'t bring back all yesterday\'s tumblers, nor the tray\nVasily Leoniditch had. And it\'s me that have to answer for them!\n\nGREGORY. The tray is full of cigars.\n\nJACOB. Well, put them somewhere else. It\'s me who\'s answerable for it.\n\nGREGORY. I\'ll bring it back! I\'ll bring it back!\n\nJACOB. Yes, so you say, but it is not where it ought to be. The other\nday, just as the tea had to be served, it was not to be found.\n\nGREGORY. I\'ll bring it back, I tell you. What a fuss!\n\nJACOB. It\'s easy for you to talk. Here am I serving tea for the third\ntime, and now there\'s the lunch to get ready. One does nothing but\nrush about the livelong day. Is there any one in the house who has\nmore to do than me? Yet they are never satisfied with me.\n\nGREGORY. Dear me! Who could wish for any one more satisfactory? You\'re\nsuch a fine fellow!\n\nTANYA. Nobody is good enough for you! You alone....\n\nGREGORY (to TANYA). No one asked your opinion!\n\n     [Exit.\n\nJACOB. Ah, well, I don\'t mind. Tatyana Markovna, did the mistress say\nanything about yesterday?\n\nTANYA. About the lamp, you mean?\n\nJACOB. And how it managed to drop out of my hands, the Lord only\nknows! Just as I began rubbing it, and was going to take hold of it in\nanother place, out it slips and goes all to pieces. It\'s just my luck!\nIt\'s easy for that Gregory Mihaylitch to talk--a single man like him!\nBut when one has a family, one has to consider things: they have to be\nfed. I don\'t mind work.... So she didn\'t say anything? The Lord be\nthanked!... Oh, Theodore Ivanitch, have you one spoon or two?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. One. Only one!\n\n     [Reads newspaper.\n\n     [Exit JACOB.\n\n     [Bell rings. Enter GREGORY carrying a tray and the DOORKEEPER.\n\nDOORKEEPER (to GREGORY). Tell the master some peasants have come from\nthe village.\n\nGREGORY (pointing to THEODORE IVANITCH). Tell the major-domo here,\nit\'s his business. I have no time.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nTANYA. Where are these peasants from?\n\nDOORKEEPER. From Koursk, I think.\n\nTANYA. (shrieks with delight). It\'s them.... It\'s Simon\'s father come\nabout the land! I\'ll go and meet them!\n\n     [Runs off.\n\nDOORKEEPER. Well, then what shall I say to them? Shall they come in\nhere? They say they\'ve come about the land--the master knows, they\nsay.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Yes, they want to purchase some land. All right!\nBut he has a visitor now, so you had better tell them to wait.\n\nDOORKEEPER. Where shall they wait?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Let them wait outside. I\'ll send for them when the\ntime comes.\n\n     [Exit DOORKEEPER.\n\n     [Enter TANYA, followed by three PEASANTS.\n\nTANYA. To the right. In here! In here!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. I did not want them brought in here!\n\nGREGORY. Forward minx!\n\nTANYA. Oh, Theodore Ivanitch, it won\'t matter, they\'ll stand in this\ncorner.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. They\'ll dirty the floor.\n\nTANYA. They\'ve scraped their shoes, and I\'ll wipe the floor up\nafterwards. (To PEASANTS.) Here, stand just here.\n\n     [PEASANTS come forward, carrying presents tied in cotton\n      handkerchiefs: cake, eggs and embroidered towels. They look\n      around for an icon before which to cross themselves; not finding\n      one, they cross themselves, looking at the staircase.\n\nGREGORY (to THEODORE IVANITCH). There now, Theodore Ivanitch, they say\nPironnet\'s boots are an elegant shape. But those there are ever so\nmuch better.\n\n     [Pointing to the third PEASANT\'S bast shoes.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Why will you always be ridiculing people?\n\n     [Exit GREGORY.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (rises and goes up to the PEASANTS). So you are from\nKoursk? And have come to arrange about buying some land?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Just so. We might say, it is for the completion of the\npurchase of the land we have come. How could we announce ourselves to\nthe master?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Yes, yes, I know. You wait a bit and I\'ll go and\ninform him.\n\n     [Exit.\n\n     [The PEASANTS look around; they are embarrassed where to put their\n      presents.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. There now, couldn\'t we have what d\'you call it?\nSomething to present these here things on? To do it in a genteel way,\nlike,--a little dish or something.\n\nTANYA. All right, directly; put them down here for the present.\n\n     [Puts bundles on settle.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. There now,--that respectable gentleman that was here\njust now,--what might be his station?\n\nTANYA. He\'s the master\'s valet.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. I see. So he\'s also in service. And you, now, are you a\nservant too?\n\nTANYA. I am lady\'s-maid. Do you know, I also come from Demen! I know\nyou, and you, but I don\'t know him.\n\n     [Pointing to THIRD PEASANT.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Them two you know, but me you don\'t know?\n\nTANYA. You are Efim Antonitch.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it!\n\nTANYA. And you are Simon\'s father, Zachary Trifanitch.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Right!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. And let me tell you, I\'m Mitry Vlasitch Tchilikin. Now\ndo you know?\n\nTANYA. Now I shall know you too!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And who may you be?\n\nTANYA. I am Aksinya\'s, the soldier\'s wife\'s, orphan.\n\nFIRST AND THIRD PEASANTS (with surprise). Never!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. The proverb says true: "Buy a penny pig, put it in the\nrye, And you\'ll have a wonderful fat porker by-and-by."\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it! She\'s got the resemblance of a duchess!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. That be so truly. Oh Lord!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (off the scene, rings, and then shouts). Gregory!\nGregory!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Now who\'s that, for example, disturbing himself in such\na way, if I may say so?\n\nTANYA. That\'s the young master.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord! Didn\'t I say we\'d better wait outside until\nthe time comes?\n\n     [Silence.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Is it you, Simon wants to marry?\n\nTANYA. Why, has he been writing?\n\n     [Hides her face in her apron.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. It\'s evident he\'s written! But it\'s a bad business\nhe\'s imagined here. I see the lad\'s got spoilt!\n\nTANYA (quickly). No, he\'s not at all spoilt! Shall I send him to you?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why send him? All in good time. Where\'s the hurry?\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (desperately, behind scene). Gregory! Where the\ndevil are you?...\n\n     [Enters from his room in shirt-sleeves, adjusting his pince-nez.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Is every one dead?\n\nTANYA. He\'s not here, sir.... I\'ll send him to you at once.\n\n     [Moves towards the back door.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. I could hear you talking, you know. How have these\nscarecrows sprung up here? Eh? What?\n\nTANYA. They\'re peasants from the Koursk village, sir.\n\n     [PEASANTS bow.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. And who is this? Oh yes, from Bourdier.\n\n     [VASILY LEONIDITCH pays no attention to the PEASANTS\' bow. TANYA\n      meets GREGORY at the doorway and remains on the scene.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (to GREGORY). I told you the other boots.... I can\'t\nwear these!\n\nGREGORY. Well, the others are also there.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. But where is there?\n\nGREGORY. Just in the same place!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. They\'re not!\n\nGREGORY. Well, come and see.\n\n     [Exeunt GREGORY and VASILY LEONIDITCH.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say, now, might we not in the meantime just go and\nwait, say, in some lodging-house or somewhere?\n\nTANYA. No, no, wait a little. I\'ll go and bring you some plates to put\nthe presents on.\n\n     [Exit.\n\n     [Enter SAHATOF and LEONID FYODORITCH, followed by THEODORE IVANITCH.\n\n     [The PEASANTS take up the presents, and pose themselves.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (to PEASANTS). Presently, presently! Wait a bit!\n(Points to PORTER.) Who is this?\n\nPORTER. From Bourdey\'s.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Ah, from Bourdier.\n\nSAHATOF (smiling). Well, I don\'t deny it: still you understand that,\nnever having seen it, we, the uninitiated, have some difficulty in\nbelieving.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. You say you find it difficult to believe! We do not\nask for faith; all we demand of you is to investigate! How can I help\nbelieving in this ring? Yet this ring came from there!\n\nSAHATOF. From there? What do you mean? From where?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. From the other world. Yes!\n\nSAHATOF (smiling). That\'s very interesting--very interesting!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well, supposing we admit that I\'m a man carried\naway by an idea, as you think, and that I am deluding myself. Well,\nbut what of Alexey Vladimiritch Krougosvetlof--he is not just an\nordinary man, but a distinguished professor, and yet he admits it to\nbe a fact. And not he alone. What of Crookes? What of Wallace?\n\nSAHATOF. But I don\'t deny anything. I only say it is very interesting.\nIt would be interesting to know how Krougosvetlof explains it!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. He has a theory of his own. Could you come\nto-night?--he is sure to be here. First we shall have Grossman--you\nknow, the famous thought-reader?\n\nSAHATOF. Yes, I have heard of him but have never happened to meet him.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Then you must come! We shall first have Grossman,\nthen Kaptchitch, and our mediumistic seance.... (To THEODORE\nIVANITCH.) Has the man returned from Kaptchitch?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Not yet, sir.\n\nSAHATOF. Then how am I to know?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Never mind, come in any case! If Kaptchitch can\'t\ncome we shall find our own medium. Marya Ignatievna is a medium--not\nsuch a good one as Kaptchitch, but still....\n\n     [TANYA enters with plates for the presents, and stands listening.\n\nSAHATOF (smiling). Oh, yes, yes. But here is one puzzling point:--how\nis it that the mediums are always of the, so-called, educated class,\nsuch as Kaptchitch and Marya Ignatievna? If there were such a special\nforce, would it not be met with also among the common people--the\npeasants?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Oh yes, and it is! That is very common. Even here\nin our own house we have a peasant whom we discovered to be a medium.\nA few days ago we called him in--a sofa had to be moved, during a\nseance--and we forgot all about him. In all probability he fell\nasleep. And, fancy, after our seance was over and Kaptchitch had come\nto again, we suddenly noticed mediumistic phenomena in another part of\nthe room, near the peasant: the table gave a jerk and moved!\n\nTANYA (aside). That was when I was getting out from under it!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. It is quite evident he also is a medium. Especially\nas he is very like Home in appearance. You remember Home--a\nfair-haired naif sort of fellow?\n\nSAHATOF (shrugging his shoulders). Dear me, this is very interesting,\nyou know. I think you should try him.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. So we will! And he is not alone; there are\nthousands of mediums, only we do not know them. Why, only a short time\nago a bedridden old woman moved a brick wall!\n\nSAHATOF. Moved a brick ... a brick wall?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, yes. She was lying in bed, and did not even\nknow she was a medium. She just leant her arm against the wall, and\nthe wall moved!\n\nSAHATOF. And did not cave in?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. And did not cave in.\n\nSAHATOF. Very strange! Well, then, I\'ll come this evening.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Pray, do. We shall have a seance in any case.\n\n     [SAHATOF puts on his outdoor things; LEONID FYODORITCH sees him\n      to the door.\n\nPORTER (to TANYA). Do tell your mistress! Am I to spend the night\nhere?\n\nTANYA. Wait a little; she\'s going to drive out with the young lady, so\nshe\'ll soon be coming downstairs.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (comes up to the PEASANTS, who bow and offer him\ntheir presents). That\'s not necessary!\n\nFIRST PEASANT (smiling). Oh, but this-here is our first duty, it is!\nIt\'s also the Commune\'s orders that we should do it!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That\'s always been the proper way.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say no more about it! \'Cause as we are much\nsatisfied.... As our parents, let\'s say, served, let\'s say, your\nparents, so we would like the same with all our hearts ... and not\njust anyhow!\n\n     [Bows.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. But what is it about? What do you want?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. It\'s to your honor we\'ve come....\n\n     [Enter PETRISTCHEF briskly, in fur-lined overcoat.\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Is Vasily Leoniditch awake yet?\n\n     [Seeing LEONID FYODORITCH, bows, moving only his head.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. You have come to see my son?\n\nPETRISTCHEF. I? Yes, just to see Vovo for a moment.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Step in, step in.\n\n     [PETRISTCHEF takes off his overcoat and walks in briskly. Exit.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (to PEASANTS). Well, what is it you want?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Please accept our presents!\n\nFIRST PEASANT (smiling). That\'s to say, the peasants\' offerings.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say no more about it; what\'s the good? We wish you the\nsame as if you were our own father! Say no more about it!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. All right. Here, Theodore, take these.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (to PEASANTS). Give them here.\n\n     [Takes the presents.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well, what is the business?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. We\'ve come to your honor....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. I see you have; but what do you want?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. It\'s about making a move towards completing the sale of\nthe land. It comes to this....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Do you mean to buy the land?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. It comes to this.... I mean the buying\nof the property of the land. The Commune has given us, let\'s say, the\npower of atturning, to enter, let\'s say, as is lawful, through the\nGovernment bank, with a stamp for the lawful amount.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. You mean that you want to buy the land through the\nland-bank.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. Just as you offered it to us last year.\nIt comes to this, then, the whole sum in full for the buying of the\nproperty of the land is 32,864 roubles.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. That\'s all right, but how about paying up?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. As to the payment, the Commune offers just as it was\nsaid last year--to pay in \'stalments, and your receipt of the ready\nmoney by lawful regulations, 4000 roubles in full. [2]\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Take 4000 now, and wait for the rest of the money.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT (unwrapping a parcel of money). And about this be quite\neasy. We should pawn our own selves rather than do such a thing just\nanyhow say, but in this way, let\'s say, as it ought to be done.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. But did I not write and tell you that I should not\nagree to it unless you brought the whole sum?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. It would be more agreeable, but it is\nnot in our possibilities, I mean.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well then, the thing can\'t be done!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. The Commune, for example, relied its hopes on that,\nthat you made the offer last year to sell it in easy \'stalments....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. That was last year. I would have agreed to it then,\nbut now I can\'t.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But how\'s that? We\'ve been depending on your promise--\nwe\'ve got the papers ready and have collected the money!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Be merciful, master! We\'re short of land; we\'ll say\nnothing about cattle, but even a hen, let\'s say, we\'ve no room to\nkeep. (Bows.) Don\'t wrong us, master!\n\n     [Bows.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Of course it\'s quite true, that I agreed last year\nto let you have the land for payment by instalments, but now\ncircumstances are such that it would be inconvenient.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Without this land we cannot live!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. Without land our lives must grow weaker\nand come to a decline.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT (bowing). Master, we have so little land, let\'s not talk\nabout the cattle, but even a chicken, let\'s say, we\'ve no room for.\nMaster, be merciful, accept the money, master!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (examining the document). I quite understand, and\nshould like to help you. Wait a little; I will give you an answer in\nhalf-an-hour.... Theodore, say I am engaged and am not to be\ndisturbed.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Yes, sir.\n\n     [Exit LEONID FYODORITCH.\n\n     [The PEASANTS look dejected.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Here\'s a go! "Give me the whole sum," he says. And\nwhere are we to get it from?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If he had not given us hopes, for example. As it is we\nfelt quite insured it would be as was said last year.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh, Lord! and I had begun unwrapping the money. (Begins\nwrapping up the bundle of bank-notes again.) What are we to do now?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. What is your business, then?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Our business, respected sir, depends in this. Last year\nhe made us the offer of our buying the land in \'stalments. The Commune\nentered upon these terms and gave us the powers of atturning, and now\nd\'you see he makes the offering that we should pay the whole in full!\nAnd as it turns out, the business is no ways convenient for us.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. What is the whole sum?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. The whole sum in readiness is 4000 roubles, you see.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Well, what of that? Make an effort and collect\nmore.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Such as it is, it was collected with much effort. We\nhave, so to say, in this sense, not got ammunition enough.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You can\'t get blood out of a stone.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. We\'d be glad with all our hearts, but we have swept\neven this together, as you might say, with a broom.\n\n     [VASILY LEONIDITCH and PETRISTCHEF appear in the doorway both\n      smoking cigarettes.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. I have told you already I\'ll do my best, so, of\ncourse, I will do all that is possible! Eh, what?\n\nPETRISTCHEF. You must just understand that if you do not get it, the\ndevil only knows what a mess we shall be in!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. But I\'ve already said I\'ll do my best, and so I\nwill. Eh, what?\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Nothing. I only say, get some at any cost; I will wait.\n\n     [Exit into VASILY LEONIDITCH\'S room, closing door.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (waving his arm). It\'s a deuce of a go!\n\n     [The PEASANTS bow.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (looking at PORTER, to THEODORE IVANITCH). Why don\'t\nyou attend to this fellow from Bourdier? He hasn\'t come to take\nlodgings with us, has he? Just look, he is asleep! Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. The note he brought has been sent in, and he has\nbeen told to wait until Anna Pavlovna comes down.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (looks at PEASANTS and notices the money). And what\nis this? Money? For whom? Is it for us? (To THEODORE IVANITCH.) Who\nare they?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. They are peasants from Koursk. They are buying\nland.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Has it been sold them?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. No, they have not yet come to any agreement. They\nare too stingy?\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Eh? Well, we must try and persuade them. (To the\nPEASANTS.) Here, I say, are you buying land? Eh?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. We have made an offering as how we\nshould like to acquire the possession of the land.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Then you should not be so stingy, you know. Just\nlet me tell you how necessary land is to peasants! Eh, what? It\'s very\nnecessary, isn\'t it?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. The land appears as the very first and\nforemost necessity to a peasant. That\'s just it.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Then why be so stingy? Just you think what land is!\nWhy, one can sow wheat on it in rows! I tell you, you could get eighty\nbushels of wheat, at a rouble and a half a bushel--that would be 120\nroubles. Eh, what? Or else mint! I tell you, you could collar 400\nroubles off an acre by sowing mint!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. All sorts of products one could put\ninto action if one had the right understanding.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Mint! Decidedly mint! I have learnt about it, you\nknow. It\'s all printed in books. I can show them you. Eh, what?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it, all concerns are clearer to you through\nyour books. That\'s learnedness, of course.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Then pay up and don\'t be stingy! (To THEODORE\nIVANITCH.) Where\'s papa?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. He gave orders not to be disturbed just now.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Oh, I suppose he\'s consulting a spirit whether to\nsell the land or not? Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. I can\'t say. All I know is that be went away\nundecided about it.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. What d\'you think, Theodore Ivanitch, is he flush of\ncash? Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. I don\'t know. I hardly think so. But what does it\nmatter to you? You drew a good sum not more than a week ago.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. But didn\'t I pay for those dogs? And now, you know,\nthere\'s our new Society, and Petristchef has been chosen, and I had\nborrowed money from Petristchef and must pay the subscription both for\nhim and for myself. Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. And what is this new Society? A Cycling Club?\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. No. Just let me tell you. It is quite a new\nSociety. It is a very serious Society, you know. And who do you think\nis President? Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. What\'s the object of this new Society?\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. It is a "Society to Promote the Breeding of\nPure-Bred Russian Hounds." Eh, what? And I\'ll tell you, they\'re\nhaving the first meeting and a lunch, to-day. And I\'ve no money. I\'ll\ngo to him and have a try!\n\n     [Exit through study door.\n\nFIRST PEASANT (to THEODORE IVANITCH). And who might he be, respected\nsir?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (smiles). The young master.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. The heir, so to say. Oh, Lord! (Puts away the money.)\nI\'d better hide it meanwhile.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And we were told he was in military service, in the\ncav\'rely, for example.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. No, as an only son he is exempt from military\nservice.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Left for to keep his parents, so to say! That\'s right!\n\nSECOND PEASANT (shaking his head). He\'s the right sort. He\'ll feed\nthem finely!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh, Lord!\n\n     [Enter VASILY LEONIDITCH, followed by LEONID FYODORITCH.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. That\'s always the way. It\'s really surprising!\nFirst I\'m asked why I have no occupation, and now when I have found a\nfield and am occupied, when a Society with serious and noble aims has\nbeen founded, I can\'t even have 300 roubles to go on with!...\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. I tell you I can\'t do it, and I can\'t! I haven\'t\ngot it.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Why, you have just sold some land.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. In the first place I have not sold it! And above\nall, do leave me in peace! Weren\'t you told I was engaged?\n\n     [Exit, slamming door.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. I told you this was not the right moment.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Well, I say! Here\'s a position to be in! I\'ll go\nand see mamma--that\'s my only hope. He\'s going crazy over his\nspiritualism and forgets everything else.\n\n     [Goes upstairs.\n\n     [THEODORE IVANITCH takes newspaper and is just going to sit down,\n      when BETSY and MARYA KONSTANTINOVNA, followed by GREGORY, come\n      down the stairs.\n\nBETSY. Is the carriage ready?\n\nGREGORY. Just coming to the door.\n\nBETSY (to MARYA KONSTANTINOVNA). Come along, come along, I know it is\nhe.\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. Which he?\n\nBETSY. You know very well whom I mean--Petristchef, of course.\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. But where is he?\n\nBETSY. Sitting in Vovo\'s room. You\'ll see!\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. And suppose it is not he?\n\n     [The PEASANTS and PORTER bow.\n\nBETSY (to PORTER). You brought a dress from Bourdier\'s?\n\nPORTER. Yes, Miss. May I go?\n\nBETSY. Well, I don\'t know. Ask my mother.\n\nPORTER. I don\'t know whose it is, Miss; I was ordered to bring it here\nand receive the money.\n\nBETSY. Well, then, wait.\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. Is it still that costume for the charade?\n\nBETSY. Yes, a charming costume. But mamma won\'t take it or pay for it.\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. But why not?\n\nBETSY. You\'d better ask mamma. She doesn\'t grudge Vovo 500 roubles for\nhis dogs, but 100 is too much for a dress. I can\'t act dressed like a\nscarecrow. (Pointing to PEASANTS.) And who are these?\n\nGREGORY. Peasants who have come to buy some land or other.\n\nBETSY. And I thought they were the beaters. Are you not beaters?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. No, no, lady. We have come to see Leonid Fyodoritch\nabout the signing into our possession of the title-deeds to some land.\n\nBETSY. Then how is it? Vovo was expecting some beaters who were to\ncome to-day. Are you sure you are not the beaters? (The PEASANTS are\nsilent.) How stupid they are! (Goes to VASILY LEONIDITCH\'S door.)\nVovo?\n\n     [Laughs.\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. But we met him just now upstairs!\n\nBETSY. Why need you remember that? Vovo, are you there?\n\n     [PETRISTCHEF enters.\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Vovo is not here, but I am prepared to fulfil on his\nbehalf anything that may be required. How do you do? How do you do,\nMarya Konstantinovna?\n\n     [Shakes hands long and violently with BETSY, and then with MARYA\n      KONSTANTINOVNA.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. See, it\'s as if he were pumping water!\n\nBETSY. You can\'t replace him,--still you\'re better than nobody.\n(Laughs.) What are these affairs of yours with Vovo?\n\nPETRISTCHEF. What affairs? Our affairs are fie-nancial that is, our\nbusiness is fie! It\'s also nancial, and besides it is financial.\n\nBETSY. What does nancial mean?\n\nPETRISTCHEF. What a question! It means nothing, that\'s just the point.\n\nBETSY. No, no, you have missed fire.\n\n     [Laughs.\n\nPETRISTCHEF. One can\'t always hit the mark, you know. It\'s something\nlike a lottery. Blanks and blanks again, and at last you win!\n\n     [THEODORE IVANITCH goes into the study.\n\nBETSY. Well, this was blank then; but tell me, were you at the\nMergasofs\' last night?\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Not exactly at the Mere Gasof\'s, but rather at the Pere\nGasof\'s, or better still, at the Fils Gasof\'s.\n\nBETSY. You can\'t do without puns. It\'s an illness. And were the\nGypsies there? [3]\n\n     [Laughs.\n\nPETRISTCHEF (sings). "On their aprons silken threads, little birds\nwith golden heads!"....\n\nBETSY. Happy mortals! And we were yawning at Fofo\'s.\n\nPETRISTCHEF (continues to sing). "And she promised and she swore, she\nwould ope\' her ... her ... her...." how does it go on, Marya\nKonstantinovna?\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. "Closet door."\n\nPETRISTCHEF. How? What? How, Marya Konstantinovna?\n\nBETSY. Cessez, vous devenez impossible! [4]\n\nPETRISTCHEF. J\'ai cesse, j\'ai bebe, j\'ai dede....[5]\n\nBETSY. I see the only way to rid ourselves of your wit is to make you\nsing! Let us go into Vovo\'s room, his guitar is there. Come, Marya\nKonstantinovna, come!\n\n     [Exeunt BETSY, MARYA KONSTANTINOVNA, and PETRISTCHEF.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Who be they?\n\nGREGORY. One is our young lady, the other is a girl who teaches her\nmusic.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Administrates learning, so to say. And ain\'t she smart?\nA reg\'lar picture!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why don\'t they marry her? She is old enough, I should\nsay.\n\nGREGORY. Do you think it\'s the same as among you peasants,--marry at\nfifteen?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And that man, for example, is he also in the musitional\nline?\n\nGREGORY (mimicking him). "Musitional," indeed! You don\'t understand\nanything!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. And stupidity, one might say, is our\nignorance.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh, Lord!\n\n     [Gypsy songs and guitar accompaniment are heard from VASILY\n      LEONIDITCH\'S room.\n\n     [Enter SIMON, followed by TANYA, who watches the meeting between\n      father and son.\n\nGREGORY (to SIMON). What do you want?\n\nSIMON. I have been to Mr. Kaptchitch.\n\nGREGORY. Well, and what\'s the answer?\n\nSIMON. He sent word he couldn\'t possibly come to-night.\n\nGREGORY. All right, I\'ll let them know.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nSIMON (to his father). How d\'you do, father! My respects to Daddy Efim\nand Daddy Mitry! How are all at home?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Very well, Simon.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. How d\'you do, lad?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. How d\'you do, sonny?\n\nSIMON (smiles). Well, come along, father, and have some tea.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Wait till we\'ve finished our business. Don\'t you see\nwe are not ready yet?\n\nSIMON. Well, I\'ll wait for you by the porch.\n\n     [Wishes to go away.\n\nTANYA (running after him). I say, why didn\'t you tell him anything?\n\nSIMON. How could I before all those people? Give me time, I\'ll tell\nhim over our tea.\n\n     [Exit.\n\n     [THEODORE IVANITCH enters and sits down by the window.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Respected sir, how\'s our business proceeding?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Wait a bit, he\'ll be out presently, he\'s just\nfinishing.\n\nTANYA (to THEODORE IVANITCH). And how do you know, Theodore Ivanitch,\nhe is finishing?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. I know that when he has finished questioning, he\nreads the question and answer aloud.\n\nTANYA. Can one really talk with spirits by means of a saucer?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. It seems so.\n\nTANYA. But supposing they tell him to sign, will he sign?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Of course he will.\n\nTANYA. But they do not speak with words?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Oh, yes. By means of the alphabet. He notices at\nwhich letter the saucer stops.\n\nTANYA. Yes, but at a si-ance?....\n\n     [Enter LEONID FYODORITCH.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well, friends, I can\'t do it! I should be very glad\nto, but it is quite impossible. If it were for ready money it would be\na different matter.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. What more could any one desire? But the\npeople are so inpennycuous--it is quite impossible!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well, I can\'t do it, I really can\'t. Here is your\ndocument; I can\'t sign it.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Show some pity, master; be merciful!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. How can you act so? It is doing us a wrong.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Nothing wrong about it, friends. I offered it you\nin summer, but then you did not agree; and now I can\'t agree to it.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Master, be merciful! How are we to get along? We have\nso little land. We\'ll say nothing about the cattle; a hen, let\'s say,\nthere\'s no room to let a hen run about.\n\n     [LEONID FYODORITCH goes up to the door and stops. Enter,\n      descending the staircase, ANNA PAVLOVNA and DOCTOR, followed by\n      VASILY LEONIDITCH, who is in a merry and playful mood and is\n      putting some bank-notes into his purse.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (tightly laced, and wearing a bonnet). Then I am to take\nit?\n\nDOCTOR. If the symptoms recur you must certainly take it, but above\nall, you must behave better. How can you expect thick syrup to pass\nthrough a thin little hair tube, especially when we squeeze the tube?\nIt\'s impossible; and so it is with the biliary duct. It\'s simple\nenough.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. All right, all right!\n\nDOCTOR. Yes. "All right, all right," and you go on in the same old\nway. It won\'t do, madam--it won\'t do. Well, good-bye!\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. No, not good-bye, only au revoir! For I still expect\nyou to-night. I shall not be able to make up my mind without you.\n\nDOCTOR. All right, if I have time I\'ll pop in.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (noticing the PEASANTS). What\'s this? What? What people\nare these?\n\n     [PEASANTS bow.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. These are peasants from Koursk, come to see Leonid\nFyodoritch about the sale of some land.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. I see they are peasants, but who let them in?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Leonid Fyodoritch gave the order. He has just been\nspeaking to them about the sale of the land.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. What sale? There is no need to sell any. But above all,\nhow can one let in people from the street into the house? One can\'t\nlet people in from the street! One can\'t let people into the house who\nhave spent the night heaven knows where!... (Getting more and more\nexcited.) I daresay every fold of their clothes is full of microbes--\nof scarlet-fever microbes, of smallpox microbes, of diphtheria\nmicrobes! Why, they are from Koursk Government, where there is an\nepidemic of diphtheria ... Doctor! Doctor! Call the doctor back!\n\n     [LEONID FYODORITCH goes into his room and shuts the door. GREGORY\n      goes to recall the DOCTOR.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (smokes at the PEASANTS). Never mind, mamma; if you\nlike I\'ll fumigate them so that all the microbes will go to pot! Eh,\nwhat?\n\n     [ANNA PAVLOVNA remains severely silent, awaiting the DOCTOR\'S\n      return.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (to PEASANTS). And do you fatten pigs? There\'s a\nfirst-rate business!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. We do go in for the pig-fattening line\nnow and then.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. This kind?...\n\n     [Grunts like a pig.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Vovo, Vovo, leave off!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Isn\'t it like? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. It\'s very resemblant.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Vovo, leave off, I tell you!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. What\'s it all about?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. I said, we\'d better go to some lodging meanwhile!\n\n     [Enter DOCTOR and GREGORY.\n\nDOCTOR. What\'s the matter? What\'s happened?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Why, you\'re always saying I must not get excited. Now,\nhow is it possible to keep calm? I do not see my own sister for two\nmonths, and am careful about any doubtful visitor--and here are people\nfrom Koursk, straight from Koursk, where there is an epidemic of\ndiphtheria, right in my house!\n\nDOCTOR. These good fellows you mean, I suppose?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Of course. Straight from a diphtheric place!\n\nDOCTOR. Well, of course, if they come from an infected place it is\nrash; but still there is no reason to excite yourself so much about\nit.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. But don\'t you yourself advise carefulness?\n\nDOCTOR. Of course, of course. Still, why excite yourself?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. How can I help it? Now we shall have to have the house\ncompletely disinfected.\n\nDOCTOR. Oh, no! Why completely? That would cost 300 roubles or more.\nI\'ll arrange it cheaply and well for you. Take, to a large bottle of\nwater....\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Boiled?\n\nDOCTOR. It\'s all the same. Boiled would be better. To one bottle of\nwater take a tablespoon of salicylic acid, and have everything they\nhave come in contact with washed with the solution. As to the fellows\nthemselves, they must be off, of course. That\'s all. Then you\'re quite\nsafe. And it would do no harm to sprinkle some of the same solution\nthrough a spray--two or three tumblers--you\'ll see how well it will\nact. No danger whatever.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Tanya! Where is Tanya?\n\n     [Enter TANYA.\n\nTANYA. Did you call, M\'m?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. You know that big bottle in my dressing-room?\n\nTANYA. Out of which we sprinkled the laundress yesterday?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Well, of course! What other bottle could I mean? Well,\nthen, take that bottle and first wash with soap the place where they\nhave been standing, and then with....\n\nTANYA. Yes, M\'m; I know how.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. And then take the spray.... However, I had better do\nthat myself when I get back.\n\nDOCTOR. Well, then, do so, and don\'t be afraid! Well, au revoir till\nthis evening.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. And they must be off! Not a trace of them must remain!\nGet out, get out! Go--what are you looking at?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. It\'s because of our stupidity, as we\nwere instructed....\n\nGREGORY (pushes the PEASANTS out). There, there; be off!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Let me have my handkerchief back!\n\n     [The handkerchief in which the presents were wrapped.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh, Lord, oh, Lord! didn\'t I say--some lodging-house\nmeanwhile!\n\n     [GREGORY pushes him out. Exeunt PEASANTS.\n\nPORTER (who has repeatedly tried to say something).--Will there be any\nanswer?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Ah, from Bourdier? (Excitedly.) None! None! You can\ntake it back. I told her I never ordered such a costume, and I will\nnot allow my daughter to wear it!\n\nPORTER. I know nothing about it. I was sent....\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Go, go, take it back! I will call myself about it!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (solemnly). Sir Messenger from Bourdier, depart!\n\nPORTER. I might have been told that long ago. I have sat here nearly\nfive hours!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Ambassador from Bourdier, begone!\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Cease, please!\n\n     [Exit PORTER.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Betsy! Where is she? I always have to wait for her.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (shouting at the top of his voice). Betsy!\nPETRISTCHEF! Come quick, quick, quick! Eh? What?\n\n     [Enter PETRISTCHEF, BETSY, and MARYA KONSTANTINOVNA.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. You always keep one waiting!\n\nBETSY. On the contrary, I was waiting for you!\n\n     [PETRISTCHEF bows with his head only, then kisses ANNA PAVLOVNA\'S\n      hand.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. How d\'you do! (To BETSY.) You always have an answer\nready!\n\nBETSY. If you are upset, mamma, I had better not go.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Are we going or not?\n\nBETSY. Well, let us go; it can\'t be helped.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Did you see the man from Bourdier?\n\nBETSY. Yes, and I was very glad. I ordered the costume, and am going\nto wear it when it is paid for.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. I am not going to pay for a costume that is indecent!\n\nBETSY. Why has it become indecent? First it was decent, and now you\nhave a fit of prudery.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Not prudery at all! If the bodice were completely\naltered, then it would do.\n\nBETSY. Mamma, that is quite impossible.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Well, get dressed.\n\n     [They sit down. GREGORY puts on their over-shoes for them.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Marya Konstantinovna, do you notice a vacuum in the\nhall?\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. What is it?\n\n     [Laughs in anticipation.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Bourdier\'s man has gone! Eh, what? Good, eh?\n\n     [Laughs loudly.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Well, let us go. (Goes out of the door, but returns at\nonce.) Tanya!\n\nTANYA. Yes, M\'m?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Don\'t let Frisk catch cold while I am away. If she\nwants to be let out, put on her little yellow cloak. She is not quite\nwell to-day.\n\nTANYA. Yes, M\'m.\n\n     [Exeunt ANNA PAVLOVNA, BETSY, and GREGORY.\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Well, have you got it?\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Not without trouble, I can tell you! First I rushed\nat the gov\'nor; he began to bellow and turned me out. Off to the\nmater--I got it out of her. It\'s here! (Slaps his breast pocket.) If\nonce I make up my mind, there\'s no getting away from me. I have a\ndeadly grip! Eh, what? And d\'you know, my wolf-hounds are coming\nto-day.\n\n     [PETRISTCHEF and VASILY LEONIDITCH put on their outdoor things\n      and go out. TANYA follows.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (alone). Yes, nothing but unpleasantness. How is it\nthey can\'t live in peace? But one must say the new generation are not\n--the thing. And as to the women\'s dominion!... Why, Leonid Fyodoritch\njust now was going to put in a word, but seeing what a frenzy she was\nin--slammed the door behind him. He is a wonderfully kind-hearted man.\nYes, wonderfully kind. What\'s this? Here\'s Tanya bringing them back\nagain!\n\nTANYA. Come in, come in, grand-dads, never mind!\n\n     [Enter TANYA and the PEASANTS.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Why have you brought them back?\n\nTANYA. Well, Theodore Ivanitch, we must do something about their\nbusiness. I shall have to wash the place anyhow.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. But the business will not come off, I see that\nalready.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. How could we best put our affair into action, respected\nsir? Your reverence might take a little trouble over it, and we should\ngive you full thankings from the Commune for your trouble.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Do try, honey! We can\'t live! We have so little land.\nTalk of cattle--why, we have no room to keep a hen!\n\n     [They bow.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. I am sorry for you, friends, but I can\'t think of\nany way to help you. I understand your case very well, but he has\nrefused. So what can one do? Besides, the lady is also against it.\nWell, give me your papers--I\'ll try and see what I can do, but I\nhardly hope to succeed.\n\n     [Exit.\n\n     [TANYA and the three PEASANTS sigh.\n\nTANYA. But tell me, grand-dads, what is it that is wanted?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Why, only that he should put his signature to our\ndocument.\n\nTANYA. That the master should sign? Is that all?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Yes, only lay his signature on the deed and take the\nmoney, and there would be an end of the matter.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. He only has to write and sign, as the peasants, let\'s\nsay, desire, so, let\'s say, I also desire. That\'s the whole affair--if\nhe\'d only take it and sign it, it\'s all done.\n\nTANYA (considering). He need only sign the paper and it\'s done?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. The whole matter is in dependence on\nthat, and nothing else. Let him sign, and we ask no more.\n\nTANYA. Just wait and see what Theodore Ivanitch will say. If he cannot\npersuade the master, I\'ll try something.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Get round him, will you?\n\nTANYA. I\'ll try.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Ay, the lass is going to bestir herself. Only get the\nthing settled, and the Commune will bind itself to keep you all your\nlife. See there, now!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If the affair can be put into action, truly we might\nput her in a gold frame.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That goes without saying!\n\nTANYA. I can\'t promise for certain, but as the saying is: "An attempt\nis no sin, if you try...."\n\nFIRST PEASANT. "You may win." That\'s just so.\n\n     [Enter THEODORE IVANITCH.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. No, friends, it\'s no go! He has not done it, and he\nwon\'t do it. Here, take your document. You may go.\n\nFIRST PEASANT (gives TANYA the paper). Then it\'s on you we pin all our\nreliance, for example.\n\nTANYA. Yes, yes! You go into the street, and I\'ll run out to you in a\nminute and have a word with you.\n\n     [Exeunt PEASANTS.\n\nTANYA. Theodore Ivanitch, dear Theodore Ivanitch, ask the master to\ncome out and speak to me for a moment. I have something to say to him.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. What next?\n\nTANYA. I must, Theodore Ivanitch. Ask him, do; there\'s nothing wrong\nabout it, on my sacred word.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. But what do you want with him?\n\nTANYA. That\'s a little secret. I will tell you later on, only ask him.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (smiling). I can\'t think what you are up to! All\nright, I\'ll go and ask him.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nTANYA. I\'ll do it! Didn\'t he say himself that there is that power in\nSimon? And I know how to manage. No one found me out that time, and\nnow I\'ll teach Simon what to do. If it doesn\'t succeed it\'s no great\nmatter. After all it\'s not a sin.\n\n     [Enter LEONID FYODORITCH, followed by THEODORE IVANITCH.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (smiling). Is this the petitioner? Well, what is\nyour business?\n\nTANYA. It\'s a little secret, Leonid Fyodoritch; let me tell it you\nalone.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. What is it? Theodore, leave us for a minute.\n\n     [Exit THEODORE IVANITCH.\n\nTANYA. As I have grown up and lived in your house, Leonid Fyodoritch,\nand as I am very grateful to you for everything, I shall open my heart\nto you as to a father. Simon, who is living in your house, wants to\nmarry me.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. So that\'s it!\n\nTANYA. I open my heart to you as to a father! I have no one to advise\nme, being an orphan.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well, and why not? He seems a nice lad.\n\nTANYA. Yes, that\'s true. He would be all right; there is only one\nthing I have my doubts about. It\'s something about him that I have\nnoticed and can\'t make out ... perhaps it is something bad.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. What is it? Does he drink?\n\nTANYA. God forbid! But since I know that there is such a thing as\nspiritalism....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Ah, you know that?\n\nTANYA. Of course! I understand it very well. Some, of course, through\nignorance, don\'t understand it.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well, what then?\n\nTANYA. I am very much afraid for Simon. It does happen to him.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. What happens to him?\n\nTANYA. Something of a kind like spiritalism. You ask any of the\nservants. As soon as he gets drowsy at the table, the table begins to\ntremble, and creak like that: tuke, ... tuke! All the servants have\nheard it.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Why, it\'s the very thing I was saying to Sergey\nIvanitch this morning! Yes?...\n\nTANYA. Or else ... when was it?... Oh, yes, last Wednesday. We sat\ndown to dinner, and the spoon just jumps into his hand of itself!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Ah, that is interesting! Jumps into his hand? When\nhe was drowsing?\n\nTANYA. That I didn\'t notice. I think he was, though.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes?...\n\nTANYA. And that\'s what I\'m afraid of, and what I wanted to ask you\nabout. May not some harm come of it? To live one\'s life together, and\nhim having such a thing in him!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (smiling). No, you need not be afraid, there is\nnothing bad in that. It only proves him to be a medium--simply a\nmedium. I knew him to be a medium before this.\n\nTANYA. So that\'s what it is! And I was afraid!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. No, there\'s nothing to be afraid of. (Aside.)\nThat\'s capital! Kaptchitch can\'t come, so we will test him\nto-night.... (To TANYA.) No, my dear, don\'t be afraid, he will be a\ngood husband and ... that is only a kind of special power, and every\none has it, only in some it is weaker and in others stronger.\n\nTANYA. Thank you, sir. Now I shan\'t think any more about it; but I was\nso frightened.... What a thing it is, our want of education!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. No, no, don\'t be frightened.... Theodore!\n\n     [Enter THEODORE IVANITCH.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. I am going out now. Get everything ready for\nto-night\'s seance.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. But Mr. Kaptchitch is not coming.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. That does not matter. (Puts on overcoat.) We shall\nhave a trial seance with our own medium.\n\n     [Exit. THEODORE IVANITCH goes out with him.\n\nTANYA (alone). He believes it! He believes it! (Shrieks and jumps with\njoy.) He really believes it! Isn\'t it wonderful! (Shrieks.) Now I\'ll\ndo it, if only Simon has pluck for it!\n\n     [THEODORE IVANITCH returns.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Well, have you told him your secret?\n\nTANYA. I\'ll tell you, too, only later on.... But I have a favor to ask\nof you, too, Theodore Ivanitch.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Yes? What is it?\n\nTANYA (shyly). You have been a second father to me, and I will open my\nheart before you as before God.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Don\'t beat about the bush, but come straight to the\npoint.\n\nTANYA. The point is ... well, the point is, that Simon wants to marry\nme.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Is that it? I thought I noticed....\n\nTANYA. Well, why should I hide it? I am an orphan, and you know\nyourself how matters are in these town establishments. Every one comes\nbothering; there\'s that Gregory Mihaylitch, for instance, he gives me\nno peace. And also that other one ... you know. They think I have no\nsoul, and am only here for their amusement.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Good girl, that\'s right! Well, what then?\n\nTANYA. Well, Simon wrote to his father; and he, his father, sees me\nto-day, and says: "He\'s spoilt"--he means his son. Theodore Ivanitch\n(bows), take the place of a father to me, speak to the old man,--to\nSimon\'s father! I could take them into the kitchen, and you might come\nin and speak to the old man!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (smiling). Then I am to turn match-maker--am I?\nWell, I can do that.\n\nTANYA. Theodore Ivanitch, dearest, be a father to me, and I\'ll pray\nfor you all my life long.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. All right, all right, I\'ll come later on. Haven\'t I\npromised?\n\n     [Takes up newspaper.\n\nTANYA. You are a second father to me!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. All right, all right.\n\nTANYA. Then I\'ll rely on you.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (alone, shaking his head). A good affectionate girl.\nTo think that so many like her perish! Get but once into trouble and\nshe\'ll go from hand to hand until she sinks into the mire, and can\nnever be found again! There was that dear little Nataly. She, too, was\na good girl, reared and cared for by a mother. (Takes up paper.) Well,\nlet\'s see what tricks Ferdinand is up to in Bulgaria.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\nEvening of the same day. The scene represents the interior of the\nservants\' kitchen. The PEASANTS have taken off their outer garments\nand sit drinking tea at the table, and perspiring. THEODORE IVANITCH\nis smoking a cigar at the other side of the stage. The discharged COOK\nis lying on the brick oven, and is unseen during the early part of the\nscene.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. My advice is, don\'t hinder him! If it\'s his wish\nand hers, in Heaven\'s name, let him do it. She is a good, honest girl.\nNever mind her being a bit dressy; she can\'t help that, living in\ntown: she is a good girl all the same.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, of course, if it is his wish, let him! He\'ll\nhave to live with her, not me. But she\'s certainly uncommon spruce.\nHow\'s one to take her into one\'s hut? Why, she\'ll not let her\nmother-in-law so much as pat her on the head.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. That does not depend on the spruceness, but on\ncharacter. If her nature is good, she\'s sure to be docile and\nrespectful.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Ah, well, we\'ll have her if the lad\'s bent on having\nher. After all, it\'s a bad job to live with one as one don\'t care for.\nI\'ll consult my missus, and then may Heaven bless them!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Then let\'s shake hands on it!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, it seems it will have to come off.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Eh, Zachary! fortune\'s a-smiling on you! You\'ve come to\naccomplish a piece of business, and just see what a duchess of a\ndaughter-in-law you\'ve obtained. All that\'s left to be done is to have\na drink on it, and then it will be all in order.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. That\'s not at all necessary.\n\n     [An awkward silence.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. I know something of your way of life, too, you\nknow. I am even thinking of purchasing a bit of land, building a\ncottage, and working on the land myself somewhere; maybe in your\nneighborhood.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. A very good thing, too.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. When one has got the money one can get\nall kinds of pleasure in the country.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say no more about it! Country life let\'s say, is freer\nin every way, not like the town!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. There now, would you let me join your Commune if I\nsettled among you?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why not? If you stand drink for the Elders, they\'ll\naccept you soon enough!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And if you open a public-house, for example, or an inn,\nwhy, you\'d have such a life you\'d never need to die! You might live\nlike a king, and no mistake.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Well, we\'ll see. I should certainly like to have a\nfew quiet years in my old age. Though my life here is good enough, and\nI should be sorry to leave. Leonid Fyodoritch is an exceedingly\nkind-hearted man.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. But how about our business? Is it\npossible that he is going to leave it without any termination?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. He\'d do it willingly.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. It seems he\'s afraid of his wife.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. It\'s not that he\'s afraid, but they don\'t hit\nthings off together.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. But you should try, father! How are we to live else?\nWe\'ve so little land....\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. We\'ll see what comes of Tanya\'s attempt. She\'s\ntaken the business into her hands now!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT (takes a sip of tea). Father, be merciful. We\'ve so\nlittle land. A hen, let\'s say, we\'ve no room for a hen, let alone the\ncattle.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. If the business depended on me.... (To SECOND\nPEASANT.) Well, friend, so we\'ve done our bit of match-making! It\'s\nagreed then about Tanya?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. I\'ve given my word, and I\'ll not go back on it without\na good reason. If only our business succeeds!\n\n     [Enter SERVANTS\' COOK, who looks up at the oven, makes a sign,\n      and then begins to speak animatedly to THEODORE IVANITCH.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Just now Simon was called upstairs from the front\nkitchen! The master and that other bald-headed one who calls up\nspirits with him, ordered him to sit down and take the place of\nKaptchitch!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. You don\'t say so!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Yes, Jacob told Tanya.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Extraordinary!\n\n     [Enter COACHMAN.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. What do you want?\n\nCOACHMAN (to THEODORE IVANITCH). You may just tell them I never agreed\nto live with a lot of dogs! Let any one who likes do it, but I will\nnever agree to live among dogs!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. What dogs?\n\nCOACHMAN. Three dogs have been sent into our room by Vasily\nLeoniditch! They\'ve messed it all over. They\'re whining, and if one\ncomes near them they bite--the devils! They\'d tear you to pieces if\nyou didn\'t mind. I\'ve a good mind to take a club and smash their legs\nfor them!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. But when did they come?\n\nCOACHMAN. Why, to-day, from the Dog Show; the devil knows what kind\nthey are, but they\'re an expensive sort. Are we or the dogs to live in\nthe coachmen\'s quarters? You just go and ask!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Yes, that will never do. I\'ll go and ask about it.\n\nCOACHMAN. They\'d better be brought here to Loukerya.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK (angrily). People have to eat here, and you\'d like to\nlock dogs in here! As it is....\n\nCOACHMAN. And I\'ve got the liveries, and the sledge-covers and the\nharness there, and they expect things kept clean! Perhaps the porter\'s\nlodge might do.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. I must ask Vasily Leoniditch.\n\nCOACHMAN (angrily). He\'d better hang the brutes round his neck and lug\nthem about with him! But no fear: he\'d rather ride on horseback\nhimself. It\'s he as spoilt. Beauty without rhyme or reason. That was a\nhorse!... Oh, dear! what a life!\n\n     [Exit, slamming door.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. That\'s not right! Certainly not right! (To\nPEASANTS.) Well, then, it\'s time we were saying good-bye, friends.\n\nPEASANTS. Good-bye!\n\n     [Exit THEODORE IVANITCH.\n\n     [As soon as he is gone a sound of groaning is heard from the top\n      of the oven.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. He\'s sleek, that one; looks like a general.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Rather! Why he has a room all to himself; he gets his\nwashing, his tea and sugar, and food from the master\'s table.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK (on the oven). Why shouldn\'t the old beggar live well?\nHe\'s lined his pockets all right!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Who\'s that up there, on the oven?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Oh, it\'s only a man.\n\n     [Silence.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, and you, too, as I noticed a while since when you\nwere supping, have capital food to eat.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. We can\'t complain. She\'s not mean about the food. We\nhave wheat bread every Sunday, and fish when a holiday happens to be a\nfast-day, too, and those who like may eat meat.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And does any one tuck into flesh on fast-days?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Oh, they nearly all do! Only the old coachman--not the\none who was here just now but the old one--and Simon, and I and the\nhousekeeper, fast--all the others eat meat.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And the master himself?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Catch him! Why, I bet he\'s forgotten there is such a\nthing as fasting!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh, Lord!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s the gentlefolks\' way: they have got it all out\nof their books. \'Cos of their intelex!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Shouldn\'t wonder if they feed on wheat bread every day!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Wheat bread, indeed! Much they think of wheat bread!\nYou should see what food they eat. No end of different things!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. In course gentlefolks\' food is of an airial kind.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Airial, of course, but all the same they\'re good at\nstuffing themselves, they are!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Have healthy appekites, so to say.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. \'Cos they always rinse it down! All with sweet wines,\nand spirits, and fizzy liquors. They have a different one to suit\nevery kind of food. They eat and rinse it down, and eat and rinse it\ndown, they do.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And so the food\'s floated down in proportion, so to\nsay.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Ah, yes, they are good at stuffing! It\'s awful! You\nsee, it\'s not just sitting down, eating, then saying grace and going\naway--they\'re always at it!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Like pigs with their feet in the trough!\n\n     [Peasants laugh.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. As soon as, by God\'s grace, they have opened their\neyes, the samovar is brought in--tea, coffee, chocolate. Hardly is the\nsecond samovar emptied, a third has to be set. Then lunch, then\ndinner, then again coffee. They\'ve hardly left off, then comes tea,\nand all sorts of tit-bits and sweetmeats--there\'s never an end to it!\nThey even lie in bed and eat!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. There now; that\'s good.\n\n     [Laughs.\n\nFIRST AND SECOND PEASANTS. What are you about?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. If I could only live a single day like that!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But when do they do their work?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Work indeed! What is their work? Cards and piano--\nthat\'s all their work. The young lady used to sit down to the piano as\nsoon as she opened her eyes, and off she\'d go! And that other one who\nlives here, the teacher, stands and waits. "When will the piano be\nfree?" When one has finished, off rattles the other, and sometimes\nthey\'d put two pianos near one another and four of \'em would bust out\nat once. Bust out in such a manner, you could hear \'em down here!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh, Lord!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Well, and that\'s all the work they do! Piano or cards!\nAs soon as they have met together--cards, wine, smoking, and so on,\nall night long. And as soon as they are up: eating again!\n\n     [Enter SIMON.\n\nSIMON. Hope you\'re enjoying your tea!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Come and join us.\n\nSIMON. (comes up to the table). Thank you kindly.\n\n     [First PEASANT pours out a cup of tea for him.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Where have you been?\n\nSIMON. Upstairs.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, and what was being done there?\n\nSIMON. Why, I couldn\'t make it out at all! I don\'t know how to explain\nit.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But what was it?\n\nSIMON. I can\'t explain it. They have been trying some kind of strength\nin me. I can\'t make it out. Tanya says, "Do it, and we\'ll get the land\nfor our peasants; he\'ll sell it them."\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But how is she going to manage it?\n\nSIMON. I can\'t make it out, and she won\'t say. She says, "Do as I tell\nyou," and that\'s all.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But what is it you have to do?\n\nSIMON. Nothing just now. They made me sit down, put out the lights and\ntold me to sleep. And Tanya had hidden herself there. They didn\'t see\nher, but I did.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why? What for?\n\nSIMON. The Lord only knows--I can\'t make it out.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Naturally, it is for the distraction of time.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, it\'s clear you and I can make nothing of it. You\nhad better tell me whether you have taken all your wages yet.\n\nSIMON. No, I\'ve not drawn any. I have twenty-eight roubles to the\ngood, I think.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That\'s all right! Well, if God grants that we get the\nland, I\'ll take you home, Simon.\n\nSIMON. With all my heart!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You\'ve got spoilt, I should say. You\'ll not want to\nplough?\n\nSIMON. Plough? Only give me the chance! Plough or mow,--I\'m game.\nThose are things one doesn\'t forget.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. But it don\'t seem very desirous after town life, for\nexample? Eh!\n\nSIMON. It\'s good enough for me. One can live in the country, too.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And Daddy Mitry here is already on the look-out for\nyour place; he\'s hankering after a life of luckshury!\n\nSIMON. Eh, Daddy Mitry, you\'d soon get sick of it. It seems easy\nenough when one looks at it, but there\'s a lot of running about that\ntakes it out of one.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. You should see one of their balls, Daddy Mitry, then\nyou would be surprised!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Why, do they eat all the time?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. My eye! You should have seen what we had here awhile\nago. Theodore Ivanitch took me upstairs and I peeped in. The ladies--\nawful! Dressed up! Dressed up, bless my heart, and all bare down to\nhere, and their arms bare.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh, Lord!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Faugh! How beastly!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. I take it the climate allows of that sort of thing!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Well, daddy, so I peeped in. Dear me, what it was\nlike! All of \'em in their natural skins! Would you believe it: old\nwomen--our mistress, only think, she\'s a grandmother, and even she\'d\ngone and bared her shoulders.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh, Lord!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. And what next? The music strikes up, and each man of\n\'em went up to his own, catches hold of her, and off they go twirling\nround and round!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. The old women, too?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Yes, the old ones, too.\n\nSIMON. No, the old ones sit still.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Get along,--I\'ve seen it myself!\n\nSIMON. No, they don\'t.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK (in a hoarse voice, looking down from the oven).\nThat\'s the Polka-Mazurka. You fools don\'t understand what dancing is.\nThe way they dance....\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Shut up, you dancer! And keep quiet--there\'s some one\ncoming.\n\n     [Enter GREGORY; old COOK hides hurriedly.\n\nGREGORY (to SERVANTS\' COOK). Bring some sour cabbage.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. I am only just up from the cellar, and now I must go\ndown again! Who is it for?\n\nGREGORY. For the young ladies. Be quick, and send it up with Simon. I\ncan\'t wait!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. There now, they tuck into sweetmeats till they are\nfull up, and then they crave for sour cabbage!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s to make a clearance.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Of course, and as soon as there is room inside, they\nbegin again!\n\n     [Takes basin, and exit.\n\nGREGORY (at PEASANTS). Look at them, how they\'ve established\nthemselves down here! Mind, if the mistress finds it out she\'ll give\nit you hot, like she did this morning!\n\n     [Exit, laughing.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it, she did raise a storm that time--awful!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That time it looked as if the master was going to step\nin, but seeing that the missus was about to blow the very roof off the\nhouse, he slams the door. Have your own way, thinks he.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT (waving his arm). It\'s the same everywhere. My old\nwoman, let\'s say, she kicks up such a rumpus sometimes--it\'s just\nawful! Then I just get out of the hut. Let her go to Jericho! She\'ll\ngive you one with the poker if you don\'t mind. Oh, Lord!\n\n     [JACOB enters hurriedly with a prescription.\n\nJACOB. Here, Simon, you run to the chemist\'s and get these powders for\nthe mistress!\n\nSIMON. But master told me not to go out.\n\nJACOB. You\'ve plenty of time; your business won\'t begin till after\ntheir tea. Hope you are enjoying your tea!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Thanks, come and join us.\n\n     [Exit SIMON.\n\nJACOB. I haven\'t time. However, I\'ll just have one cup for company\'s\nsake.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And we\'ve just been having a conversation as to how\nyour mistress carried on so haughty this morning.\n\nJACOB. Oh, she\'s a reg\'lar fury! So hot-tempered, that she gets quite\nbeside herself. Sometimes she even bursts out crying.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Now, there\'s a thing I wanted to ask you about. What,\nfor example, be these mikerots she was illuding to erewhile? "They\'ve\ninfested the house with mikerots, with mikerots," she says. What is\none to make of these same mikerots?\n\nJACOB. Mikerogues, you mean! Well, it seems there is such a kind of\nbugs; all illnesses come from them, they say. So she says there are\nsome of \'em on you. After you were gone, they washed and washed and\nsprinkled the place where you had stood. There\'s a kind of physic as\nkills these same bugs, they say. Second Peasant. Then where have we\ngot these bugs on us?\n\nJACOB (drinking his tea). Why, they say they\'re so small that one\ncan\'t see \'em even through a glass.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then how does she know I\'ve got \'em on me? Perhaps\nthere\'s more of that muck on her than on me!\n\nJACOB. There now, you go and ask her!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. I believe it\'s humbug.\n\nJACOB. Of course it\'s bosh. The doctors must invent something, or else\nwhat are they paid for? There\'s one comes to us every day. Comes,--\ntalks a bit,--and pockets ten roubles!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Nonsense!\n\nJACOB. Why, there\'s one as takes a hundred!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. A hundred? Humbug!\n\nJACOB. A hundred. Humbug, you say? Why, if he has to go out of town,\nhe\'ll not do it for less than a thousand! "Give a thousand," he says,\n"or else you may kick the bucket for what I care!"\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh, Lord!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then does he know some charm?\n\nJACOB. I suppose he must. I served at a General\'s outside Moscow once:\na cross, terrible proud old fellow he was--just awful. Well, this\nGeneral\'s daughter fell ill. They send for that doctor at once. "A\nthousand roubles, then I\'ll come." Well, they agreed, and he came.\nThen they did something or other he didn\'t like, and he bawled out at\nthe General and says, "Is this the way you show your respect for me?\nThen I\'ll not attend her!" And, oh, my! The old General forgot all his\npride, and starts wheedling him in every way not to chuck up the job!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And he got the thousand?\n\nJACOB. Of course!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That\'s easy got money. What wouldn\'t a peasant do with\nsuch a sum!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. And I think it\'s all bosh. That time my foot was\nfestering I had it doctored ever so long. I spent nigh on five roubles\non it,--then I gave up doctoring, and it got all right!\n\n     [DISCHARGED COOK on the oven coughs.\n\nJACOB. Ah, the old crony is here again!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Who might that man be?\n\nJACOB. He used to be our master\'s cook. He comes to see Loukerya.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Kitchen-master, as one might say. Then, does he live\nhere?\n\nJACOB. No, they won\'t allow that. He\'s here one day, there another. If\nhe\'s got a copper he goes to a dosshouse; but when he has drunk all,\nhe comes here.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. How did he come to this?\n\nJACOB. Simply grew weak. And what a man he used to be--like a\ngentleman! Went about with a gold watch; got forty roubles a month\nwages. And now look at him! He\'d have starved to death long ago if it\nhadn\'t been for Loukerya.\n\n     [Enter SERVANTS\' COOK with the sour cabbage.\n\nJACOB (to SERVANTS\' COOK). I see you\'ve got Paul Petrovitch here\nagain?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. And where\'s he to go to? Is he to go and freeze?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What liquor does.... Liquor, let\'s say....\n\n     [Clicks his tongue sympathetically.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Of course. A firm man\'s firm as a rock; a weak man\'s\nweaker than water.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK (gets off the oven with trembling hands and legs).\nLoukerya, I say, give us a drop!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. What are you up to? I\'ll give you such a drop!...\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Have you no conscience? I\'m dying! Brothers, a\ncopper....\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Get back on the oven, I tell you!\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Half a glass only, cook, for Heaven\'s sake! I say, do\nyou understand? I ask you in the name of Heaven, now!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Come along, here\'s some tea for you.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Tea; what is tea? Weak, sloppy stuff. A little vodka\n--just one little drop.... Loukerya!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Poor old soul, what agony it is!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You\'d better give him some.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK (gets out a bottle and fills a wine-glass). Here you\nare; you\'ll get no more.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK (clutches hold of it and drinks, trembling all over).\nLoukerya, Cook! I am drinking, and you must understand....\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Now, then, stop your chatter! Get on to the oven, and\nlet not a breath of you be heard!\n\n     [The old COOK meekly begins to climb up, muttering something to\n      himself.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. What it is, when a man gives way to his weakness!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it--human weakness.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. That goes without saying.\n\n     [The DISCHARGED COOK settles down, muttering all the time.\n\n     [Silence.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. I want to ask you something: that girl of Aksinya\'s as\ncomes from our village and is living here. How is she? What is she\nlike? How is she living--I mean, does she live honest?\n\nJACOB. She\'s a nice girl; one can say nothing but good of her.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. I\'ll tell you straight, daddy; I know this here\nestablishment out and out, and if you mean to have Tanya for your\nson\'s wife--be quick about it, before she comes to grief, or else\nshe\'ll not escape!\n\nJACOB. Yes, that\'s true. A while ago we had a girl here, Nataly. She\nwas a good girl too. And she was lost without rhyme or reason. No\nbetter than that chap!\n\n     [Pointing to the old COOK.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. There\'s enough to dam a mill-pool, with the likes of\nus, as perish! \'Cos why, every one is tempted by the easy life and the\ngood food. And see there,--as soon as one has tasted the good food she\ngoes and slips. And once she\'s slipped, they don\'t want her, but get a\nfresh one in her place. So it was with dear little Nataly; she also\nslipped, and they turned her out. She had a child and fell ill, and\ndied in the hospital last spring. And what a girl she used to be!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh, Lord! People are weak; they ought to be pitied.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Those devils pity? No fear! (He hangs his legs down\nfrom the oven.) I have stood roasting myself by the kitchen range for\nthirty years, and now that I am not wanted, I may go and die like a\ndog.... Pity indeed!...\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. It\'s the old circumstances.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. While they drank and they fed, you were "curly head."\nWhen they\'d finished the prog, \'twas "Get out, mangy dog!"\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Much you know. What is "Sautey a la Bongmont"? What\nis "Bavassary"? Oh, the things I could make! Think of it! The Emperor\ntasted my work, and now the devils want me no longer. But I am not\ngoing to stand it!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Now, then, stop that noise, mind.... Get up right into\nthe corner, so that no one can see you, or else Theodore Ivanitch or\nsome one may come in, and both you and me\'ll be turned out!\n\n     [Silence.\n\nJACOB. And do you know my part of the country? I\'m from Voznesensky.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Not know it? Why, it\'s no more\'n ten miles from our\nvillage; not that across the ford! Do you cultivate any land there?\n\nJACOB. My brother does, and I send my wages. Though I live here, I am\ndying for a sight of home.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then Anisim is your brother?\n\nJACOB. Own brother. He lives at the farther end of the village.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Of course, I know; his is the third house.\n\n     [Enter TANYA, running.\n\nTANYA. Jacob, what are you doing, amusing yourself here? She is\ncalling you!\n\nJACOB. I\'m coming; but what\'s up?\n\nTANYA. Frisk is barking; it\'s hungry. And she\'s scolding you. "How\ncruel he is," she says. "He\'s no feeling," she says. "It\'s long past\nFrisk\'s dinner-time, and he has not brought her food!"\n\n     [Laughs.\n\nJACOB (rises to go). Oh, she\'s cross? What\'s going to happen now, I\nwonder?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Here, take the cabbage with you.\n\nJACOB. All right, give it here.\n\n     [Takes basin, and exit.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Who is going to dine now?\n\nTANYA. Why, the dog! It\'s her dog. (Sits down and takes up the\ntea-pot.) Is there any more tea? I\'ve brought some.\n\n     [Puts fresh tea into the tea-pot.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Dinner for a dog?\n\nTANYA. Yes, of course! They prepare a special cutlet for her; it must\nnot be too fat. And I do the washing--the dog\'s washing, I mean.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nTANYA. It\'s like that gentleman who had a funeral for his dog.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. What\'s that?\n\nTANYA. Why, some one told me he had a dog--I mean the gentleman had a\ndog. And it died. It was winter, and he went in his sledge to bury\nthat dog. Well, he buried it, and on the way home he sits and cries--\nthe gentleman does. Well, there was such a bitter frost that the\ncoachman\'s nose keeps running, and he has to keep wiping it. Let me\nfill your cup! (Fills it.) So he keeps wiping his nose, and the\ngentleman sees it, and says, "What are you crying about?" And the\ncoachman, he says, "Why, sir, how can I help it; is there another dog\nlike him?"\n\n     [Laughs.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And I daresay he thinks to himself, "If your own self\nwas to kick the bucket I\'d not cry."\n\n     [Laughs.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK (from up on the oven). That is true; that\'s right!\n\nTANYA. Well, the gentleman, he gets home and goes straight to his\nlady: "What a good-hearted man our coachman is; he was crying all the\nway home about poor Dash. Have him called.... Here, drink this glass\nof vodka," he says, "and here\'s a rouble as a reward for you." That\'s\njust like her saying Jacob has no feelings for her dog!\n\n     [The PEASANTS laugh.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s the style!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That was a go!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Aye, lassie, but you\'ve set us a-laughing!\n\nTANYA (pouring out more tea). Have some more! Yes, it only seems that\nour life is pleasant; but sometimes it is very disgusting,--clearing\nup all their messes! Faugh! It\'s better in the country. (PEASANTS turn\ntheir cups upside-down, as a polite sign that they have had enough.\nTANYA pours out more tea.) Have some more, Efim Antonitch. I\'ll fill\nyour cup, Mitry Vlasitch.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. All right, fill it, fill it.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, dear, and what progression is our business\nmaking?\n\nTANYA. It\'s getting on....\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Simon told us....\n\nTANYA. (quickly). Did he?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But he could not make us understand.\n\nTANYA. I can\'t tell you now, but I\'m doing my best--all I can! And\nI\'ve got your paper here! (Shows the paper hidden under the bib of her\napron.) If only one thing succeeds ... (Shrieks.) Oh, how nice it\nwould be!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Don\'t lose that paper, mind. It has cost money.\n\nTANYA. Never fear. You only want him to sign it? Is that all?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Why, what else? Let\'s say he\'s signed it, and it\'s\ndone! (Turns his cup upside-down.) I\'ve had enough.\n\nTANYA (aside). He\'ll sign it; you\'ll see he will.... Have some more.\n\n     [Pours out tea.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If only you get this business about the sale of the\nland settled, the Commune would pay your marriage expenses.\n\n     [Refuses the tea.\n\nTANYA (pouring out tea). Do have another cup.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. You get it done, and we\'ll arrange your marriage, and I\nmyself, let\'s say, will dance at the wedding. Though I\'ve never danced\nin all my born days, I\'ll dance then!\n\nTANYA (laughing). All right, I\'ll be in hopes of it.\n\n     [Silence.\n\nSECOND PEASANT (examines TANYA). That\'s all very well, but you\'re not\nfit for peasant work.\n\nTANYA. Who? I? Why, don\'t you think me strong enough? You should see\nme lacing up my mistress. There\'s many a peasant couldn\'t tug as hard.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Where do you tug her to?\n\nTANYA. Well, there\'s a thing made with bone, like--something like a\nstiff jacket, only up to here! Well, and I pull the strings just as\nwhen you saddle a horse--when you ... what d\'ye call it? You know,\nwhen you spit on your hands!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Tighten the girths, you mean.\n\nTANYA. Yes, yes, that\'s it. And you know I mustn\'t shove against her\nwith my knee.\n\n     [Laughs.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why do you pull her in?\n\nTANYA. For a reason!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why, is she doing penance?\n\nTANYA. No, it\'s for beauty\'s sake!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s to say, you pull in her paunch for appearance\'\nsake.\n\nTANYA. Sometimes I lace her up so that her eyes are ready to start\nfrom her head, and she says, "Tighter," till my hands tingle. And you\nsay I\'m not strong!\n\n     [PEASANTS laugh and shake their heads.\n\nTANYA. But here, I\'ve been jabbering.\n\n     [Runs away, laughing.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Ah, the lassie has made us laugh!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. She\'s a tidy one!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. She\'s not bad.\n\n     [Enter SAHATOF and VASILY LEONIDITCH. SAHATOF holds a teaspoon in\n      his hand.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Not exactly a dinner, but a dejeuner dinatoire. And\nfirst-rate it was, I tell you. Ham of sucking-pig, delicious! Roulier\nfeeds one splendidly! I\'ve only just returned. (Sees PEASANTS.) Ah,\nthe peasants are here again!\n\nSAHATOF. Yes, yes, that\'s all very well, but we came here to hide this\narticle. Where shall we hide it?\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Excuse me a moment. (To SERVANTS\' COOK.) Where are\nthe dogs?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. In the coachman\'s quarters. You can\'t keep dogs in the\nservants\' kitchen!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Ah, in the coachman\'s quarters? All right.\n\nSAHATOF. I am waiting.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Excuse me, please. Eh, what? Hide it? I\'ll tell you\nwhat. Let\'s put it into one of the peasants\' pockets. That one. I say,\nwhere\'s your pocket? Eh, what?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What for d\'ye want my pocket? You\'re a good \'un! My\npocket! There\'s money in my pocket!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Where\'s your bag, then?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What for?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. What d\'you mean? That\'s the young master!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (laughs. To SAHATOF). D\'you know why he\'s so\nfrightened? Shall I tell you? He\'s got a heap of money. Eh, what?\n\nSAHATOF. Yes, yes, I see. Well, you talk to them a bit, and I\'ll put\nit into that bag without being observed, so that they should not\nnotice and could not point it out to him. Talk to them.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. All right! (To PEASANTS.) Well then, old fellows,\nhow about the land? Are you buying it? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. We have made an offering, so to say, with our whole\nheart. But there,--the business don\'t come into action nohow.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. You should not be so stingy! Land is an important\nmatter! I told you about planting mint. Or else tobacco would also do.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. Every kind of producks.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. And you help us, master. Ask your father. Or else how\nare we to live? There\'s so little land. A fowl, let\'s say, there\'s not\nenough room for a fowl to run about.\n\nSAHATOF (having put the spoon into a bag belonging to the THIRD\nPEASANT). C\'est fait. Ready. Come along.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. So don\'t be stingy! Eh? Well, good-bye.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Didn\'t I say, come to some lodging-house? Well,\nsupposing we\'d had to give three-pence each, then at least we\'d have\nbeen in peace. As to here, the Lord be merciful! "Give us the money,"\nhe says. What\'s that for?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. He\'s drunk, I daresay.\n\n     [PEASANTS turn their cups upside-down, rise, and cross themselves.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And d\'you mind what a saying he threw out? Sowing mint!\nOne must know how to understand them, that one must!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Sow mint indeed! He\'d better bend his own back at that\nwork, and then it\'s not mint he\'ll hanker after, no fear! Well, many\nthanks!... And now, good woman, would you tell us where we could lie\ndown to sleep?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. One of you can lie on the oven, and the others on\nthese benches.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Christ save you!\n\n     [Prays, crossing himself.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If only by God\'s help we get our business settled!\n(Lies down.) Then to-morrow, after dinner, we\'d be off by the train,\nand on Tuesday we\'d be home again.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Are you going to put out the light?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Put it out? Oh, no! They\'ll keep running down here,\nfirst for one thing then another.... You lie down, I\'ll lower it.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. How is one to live, having so little land? Why, this\nyear, I have had to buy corn since Christmas. And the oat-straw is all\nused up. I\'d like to get hold of ten acres, and then I could take\nSimon back.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. You\'re a man with a family. You\'d get the land\ncultivated without trouble. If only the business comes off.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. We must pray to the Holy Virgin, maybe she\'ll help us\nout. (Silence, broken by sighs. Then footsteps and voices are heard\noutside. The door opens. Enter GROSSMAN hurriedly, with his eyes\nbandaged, holding SAHATOF\'S hand, and followed by the PROFESSOR and\nthe DOCTOR, the FAT LADY and LEONID FYODORITCH, BETSY and PETRISTCHEF,\nVASILY LEONIDITCH and MARYA KONSTANTINOVNA, ANNA PAVLOVNA and the\nBARONESS, THEODORE IVANITCH and TANYA.)\n\n     [PEASANTS jump up. GROSSMAN comes forward stepping quickly, then\n      stops.\n\nFAT LADY. You need not trouble yourselves; I have undertaken the task\nof observing, and am strictly fulfilling my duty! Mr. Sahatof, are you\nnot leading him?\n\nSAHATOF. Of course not!\n\nFAT LADY. You must not lead him, but neither must you resist! (To\nLEONID FYODORITCH.) I know these experiments. I have tried them\nmyself. Sometimes I used to feel a certain effluence, and as soon as I\nfelt it....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. May I beg of you to keep perfect silence?\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, I understand so well! I have experienced it myself. As\nsoon as my attention was diverted I could no longer....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Sh...!\n\n     [GROSSMAN goes about, searches near the FIRST and SECOND\n      PEASANTS, then approaches the THIRD, and stumbles over a bench.\n\nBARONESS. Mais dites-moi, on le paye?[6]\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Je ne saurais vous dire.\n\nBARONESS. Mais c\'est un monsieur?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Oh, oui!\n\nBARONESS. Ca tient du miraculeux. N\'est ce pas? Comment est-ce qu\'il\ntrouve?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Je ne saurais vous dire. Mon mari vous l\'expliquera.\n(Noticing PEASANTS, turns round, and sees the SERVANTS\' COOK.) Pardon\n... what is this?\n\n     [BARONESS goes up to the group.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. (to SERVANTS\' COOK). Who let the peasants in?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Jacob brought them in.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Who gave Jacob the order?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. I can\'t say. Theodore Ivanitch has seen them.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Leonid!\n\n     [LEONID FYODORITCH does not hear, being absorbed in the search,\n      and says, Sh....\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Theodore Ivanitch! What is the meaning of this? Did you\nnot see me disinfecting the whole hall, and now the whole kitchen is\ninfected, all the rye bread, the milk....\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. I thought there would not be any danger if they\ncame here. The men have come on business. They have far to go, and are\nfrom our village.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. That\'s the worst of it! They are from the Koursk\nvillage, where people are dying of diphtheria like flies! But the\nchief thing is, I ordered them out of the house!... Did I, or did I\nnot? (Approaches the others that have gathered round the PEASANTS.) Be\ncareful! Don\'t touch them--they are all infected with diphtheria!\n\n     [No one heeds her, and she steps aside in a dignified manner and\n      stands quietly waiting.\n\nPETRISTCHEF (sniffs loudly). I don\'t know if it is diphtheria, but\nthere is some kind of infection in the air. Don\'t you notice it?\n\nBETSY. Stop your nonsense! Vovo, which bag is it in?\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. That one, that one. He is getting near, very near!\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Is it spirits divine, or spirits of wine?\n\nBETSY. Now your cigarette comes in handy for once. Smoke closer,\ncloser to me.\n\n     [PETRISTCHEF leans over her and smokes at her.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. He\'s getting near, I tell you. Eh, what?\n\nGROSSMAN (searches excitedly round the THIRD PEASANT). It is here; I\nfeel it is!\n\nFAT LADY. Do you feel an effluence?\n\n     [GROSSMAN stoops and finds the spoon in the bag.\n\nALL. Bravo!\n\n     [General enthusiasm.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Ah! So that\'s where our spoon was. (To PEASANTS.)\nThen that\'s the sort you are!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What sort? I didn\'t take your spoon! What are you\nmaking out? I didn\'t take it, and my soul knows nothing about it. I\ndidn\'t take it--there! Let him do what he likes. I knew he came here\nfor no good. "Where\'s your bag?" says he. I didn\'t take it, the Lord\nis my witness! (Crosses himself.) I didn\'t take it!\n\n     [The young people group round the PEASANT, laughing.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (angrily to his son). Always playing the fool! (To\nthe THIRD PEASANT.) Never mind, friend! We know you did not take it;\nit was only an experiment.\n\nGROSSMAN (removes bandage from his eyes, and pretends to be coming\nto). Can I have a little water?\n\n     [All fuss round him.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Let\'s go straight from here into the coachman\'s\nroom. I\'ve got a bitch there--epatante![7]\n\nBETSY. What a horrid word! Couldn\'t you say dog?\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. No. I can\'t say--Betsy is a man, epatante. I should\nhave to say young woman; it\'s a parallel case. Eh, what? Marya\nKonstantinovna, isn\'t it true? Good, eh?\n\n     [Laughs loudly.\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. Well, let us go.\n\n     [Exeunt MARYA KONSTANTINOVNA, BETSY, PETRISTCHEF, and VASILY\n      LEONIDITCH.\n\nFAT LADY (to GROSSMAN). Well? how are you? Have you rested? (GROSSMAN\ndoes not answer. To SAHATOF.) And you, Mr. Sahatof, did you feel the\neffluence?\n\nSAHATOF. I felt nothing. Yes, it was very fine--very fine. Quite a\nsuccess!\n\nBARONESS.--Admirable! Ca ne le fait pas souffrir? [8]\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Pas le moins du monde.\n\nPROFESSOR (to GROSSMAN). May I trouble you? (Hands him a thermometer.)\nAt the beginning of the experiment it was 37 decimal 2 degrees. [9]\n(To DOCTOR.) That\'s right, I think? Would you mind feeling his pulse?\nSome loss is inevitable.\n\nDOCTOR (to GROSSMAN). Now then, sir, let\'s have your hand; we\'ll see,\nwe\'ll see.\n\n     [Takes out his watch and feels GROSSMAN\'S pulse.\n\nFAT LADY (to GROSSMAN). One moment! The condition you were in could\nnot be called sleep?\n\nGROSSMAN (wearily). It was hypnosis.\n\nSAHATOF. In that case, are we to understand that you hypnotised\nyourself?\n\nGROSSMAN. And why not? An hypnotic state may ensue not only in\nconsequence of association--the sound of the tom-tom, for instance, in\nCharcot\'s method--but by merely entering an hypnogenetic zone.\n\nSAHATOF. Granting that, it would still be desirable to define what\nhypnotism is, more exactly?\n\nPROFESSOR. Hypnotism is a phenomenon resulting from the transmutation\nof one energy into another.\n\nGROSSMAN. Charcot does not so define it.\n\nSAHATOF. A moment, just a moment! That is your definition, but\nLiebault told me himself....\n\nDOCTOR (lets go of GROSSMAN\'S pulse). Ah, that\'s all right; well, now,\nthe temperature?\n\nFAT LADY (interrupting). No, allow me! I agree with the Professor. And\nhere\'s the very best proof. After my illness, when I lay insensible, a\ndesire to speak came over me. In general I am of a silent disposition,\nbut then I was overcome by this desire to speak, and I spoke and\nspoke, and I was told that I spoke in such a way that every one was\nastonished! (To SAHATOF.) But I think I interrupted you?\n\nSAHATOF (with dignity). Not at all. Pray continue.\n\nDOCTOR. Pulse 82, and the temperature has risen three-tenths of a\ndegree.\n\nPROFESSOR. There you are! That\'s a proof! That\'s just as it should be.\n(Takes out pocket-book and writes.) 82, yes? And 37 and 5. When the\nhypnotic state is induced, it invariably produces a heightened action\nof the heart.\n\nDOCTOR. I can, as a medical man, bear witness that your prognosis was\njustified by the event.\n\nPROFESSOR (to SAHATOF). You were saying?...\n\nSAHATOF. I wished to say that Liebault told me himself that the\nhypnotic is only one particular psychical state, increasing\nsusceptibility to suggestion.\n\nPROFESSOR. That is so, but still the law of equivalents is the chief\nthing.\n\nGROSSMAN. Moreover, Liebault is far from being an authority, while\nCharcot has studied the subject from all sides, and has proved that\nhypnotism produced by a blow, a trauma....\n\n     [All talking together--\n\n     SAHATOF. Yes, but I don\'t reject Charcot\'s labor. I know him\n     also, I am only repeating what Liebault told me...\n\n     GROSSMAN (excitedly). There are 3000 patients together in the\n     Salpetriere, and I have gone through the whole course.\n\n     PROFESSOR. Excuse me, gentlemen, but that is not the point.\n\nFAT LADY (interrupting). One moment, I will explain it to you in two\nwords. When my husband was ill, all the doctors gave him up....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. However, we had better go upstairs again. Baroness,\nthis way!\n\n     [Exeunt GROSSMAN, SAHATOF, PROFESSOR, DOCTOR, the FAT LADY, and\n      BARONESS, talking loudly and interrupting each other.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (catching hold of LEONID FYODORITCH\'S arm). How often\nhave I asked you not to interfere in household matters! You think of\nnothing but your nonsense, and the whole house is on my shoulders. You\nwill infect us all!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. What? How? I don\'t understand what you mean.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. How? Why, people ill of diphtheria sleep in the\nkitchen, which is in constant communication with the whole house.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, but I....\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. What, I?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. I know nothing about it.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. It\'s your duty to know, if you are the head of the\nfamily. Such things must not be done.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. But I never thought.... I thought....\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. It is sickening to listen to you!\n\n     [LEONID FYODORITCH remains silent.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (to THEODORE IVANITCH). Turn them out at once! They are\nto leave my kitchen immediately! It is terrible! No one listens to me;\nthey do it out of spite.... I turn them out from there, and they bring\nthem in here! And with my illness.... (Gets more and more excited, and\nat last begins to cry.) Doctor! Doctor! Peter Petrovitch!... He\'s gone\ntoo!...\n\n     [Exit, sobbing, followed by LEONID FYODORITCH.\n\n     [All stand silent for a long time.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Botheration take them all! If one don\'t mind, the\npolice will be after one here. And I have never been to law in all my\nborn days. Let\'s go to some lodging-house, lads!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. (to TANYA). What are we to do?\n\nTANYA. Never mind, Theodore Ivanitch, let them sleep with the\ncoachman.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. How can we do that? The coachman was complaining as\nit is, that his place is full of dogs.\n\nTANYA. Well, then, the porter\'s lodge.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. And supposing it\'s found out?\n\nTANYA. It won\'t be found out! Don\'t trouble about that, Theodore\nIvanitch. How can one turn them out now, at night? They\'ll not find\nanywhere to go to.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Well, do as you please. Only they must go away from\nhere.\n\n     [Exit.\n\n     [PEASANTS take their bags.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Oh those damned fiends! It\'s all their fat! Fiends!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. You be quiet there. Thank goodness they didn\'t see\nyou!\n\nTANYA. Well then, daddy, come along to the porter\'s lodge.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, but how about our business? How, for example,\nabout the applience of his hand to the signature? May we be in hopes?\n\nTANYA. We\'ll see in an hour\'s time.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You\'ll do the trick?\n\nTANYA (laughs). Yes, God willing!\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\nEvening of the same day. The small drawing-room in LEONID FYODORITCH\'S\nhouse, where the seances are always held. LEONID FYODORITCH and the\nPROFESSOR.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well then, shall we risk a seance with our new\nmedium?\n\nPROFESSOR. Yes, certainly. He is a powerful medium, there is no doubt\nabout it. And it is especially desirable that the seance should take\nplace to-day with the same people. Grossman will certainly respond to\nthe influence of the mediumistic energy, and then the connection and\nidentity of the different phenomena will be still more evident. You\nwill see then that, if the medium is as strong as he was just now,\nGrossman will vibrate.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Then I will send for Simon and ask those who wish\nto attend to come in.\n\nPROFESSOR. Yes, all right! I will just jot down a few notes.\n\n     [Takes out his note-book and writes.\n\n     [Enter SAHATOF.\n\nSAHATOF. They have just settled down to whist in Anna Pavlovna\'s\ndrawing-room, and as I am not wanted there--and as I am interested in\nyour seance--I have put in an appearance here. But will there be a\nseance?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, certainly!\n\nSAHATOF. In spite of the absence of Mr. Kaptchitch\'s mediumistic\npowers?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Vous avez la main heureuse. [10] Fancy, that very\npeasant whom I mentioned to you this morning turns out to be an\nundoubted medium.\n\nSAHATOF. Dear me! Yes, that is peculiarly interesting!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, we tried a few preliminary experiments with\nhim just after dinner.\n\nSAHATOF. So you\'ve had time already to experiment, and to convince\nyourself....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, perfectly! And he turns out to be an\nexceptionally powerful medium.\n\nSAHATOF (incredulously). Dear me!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. It turns out that it has long been noticed in the\nservants\' hall. When he sits down to table, the spoon springs into his\nhand of its own accord! (To the PROFESSOR.) Had you heard about it?\n\nPROFESSOR. No, I had not heard that detail.\n\nSAHATOF (to the PROFESSOR). But still, you admit the possibility of\nsuch phenomena?\n\nPROFESSOR. What phenomena?\n\nSAHATOF. Well, spiritualistic, mediumistic, and supernatural phenomena\nin general.\n\nPROFESSOR. The question is, what do we consider supernatural? When,\nnot a living man but a piece of stone attracted a nail to itself, how\ndid the phenomena strike the first observers? As something natural? Or\nsupernatural?\n\nSAHATOF. Well, of course; but phenomena such as the magnet attracting\niron always repeat themselves.\n\nPROFESSOR. It is just the same in this case. The phenomenon repeats\nitself and we experiment with it. And not only that, but we apply to\nthe phenomena we are investigating the laws common to other phenomena.\nThese phenomena seem supernatural only because their causes are\nattributed to the medium himself. But that is where the mistake lies.\nThe phenomena are not caused by the medium, but by psychic energy\nacting through a medium, and that is a very different thing. The whole\nmatter lies in the law of equivalents.\n\nSAHATOF. Yes, certainly, but....\n\n     [Enter TANYA, who hides behind the hangings.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Only remember that we cannot reckon on any results\nwith certainty, with this medium any more than with Home or\nKaptchitch. We may not succeed, but on the other hand we may even have\nperfect materialisation.\n\nSAHATOF. Materialisation even? What do you mean by materialisation?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Why, I mean that some one who is dead--say, your\nfather or your grandfather--may appear, take you by the hand, or give\nyou something; or else some one may suddenly rise into the air, as\nhappened to Alexey Vladimiritch last time.\n\nPROFESSOR. Of course, of course. But the chief thing is the\nexplanation of the phenomena, and the application to them of general\nlaws.\n\n     [Enter the FAT LADY.\n\nFAT LADY. Anna Pavlovna has allowed me to join you.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Very pleased.\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, how tired Grossman seems! He could scarcely hold his\ncup. Did you notice (to the PROFESSOR) how pale he turned at the\nmoment he approached the hiding-place? I noticed it at once, and was\nthe first to mention it to Anna Pavlovna.\n\nPROFESSOR. Undoubtedly,--loss of vital energy.\n\nFAT LADY. Yes, it\'s just as I say, one should not abuse that sort of\nthing. You know, a hypnotist once suggested to a friend of mine, Vera\nKonshin (oh, you know her, of course)--well, he suggested that she\nshould leave off smoking,--and her back began to ache!\n\nPROFESSOR (trying to have his say). The temperature and the pulse\nclearly indicate....\n\nFAT LADY. One moment! Allow me! Well, I said to her: it\'s better to\nsmoke than to suffer so with one\'s nerves. Of course, smoking is\ninjurious; I should like to give it up myself, but, do what I will, I\ncan\'t! Once I managed not to smoke for a fortnight, but could hold out\nno longer.\n\nPROFESSOR (again trying to speak). Clearly proves....\n\nFAT LADY. Yes, no! Allow me, just one word! You say, "loss of\nstrength." And I was also going to say that, when I travelled with\npost-horses ... the roads used to be dreadful in those days--you\ndon\'t remember--but I have noticed that all our nervousness comes from\nrailways! I, for instance, can\'t sleep while travelling; I cannot fall\nasleep to save my life!\n\nPROFESSOR (makes another attempt, which the FAT LADY baffles). The\nloss of strength....\n\nSAHATOF (smiling). Yes; oh yes!\n\n     [LEONID FYODORITCH rings.\n\nFAT LADY. I am awake one night, and another, and a third, and still I\ncan\'t sleep!\n\n     [Enter GREGORY.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Please tell Theodore to get everything ready for\nthe seance, and send Simon here--Simon, the butler\'s assistant,--do\nyou hear?\n\nGREGORY. Yes, sir.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nPROFESSOR (to SAHATOF). The observation of the temperature and the\npulse have shown loss of vital energy. The same will happen in\nconsequence of the mediumistic phenomena. The law of the conservation\nof energy....\n\nFAT LADY. Oh yes, yes; I was just going to say that I am very glad\nthat a simple peasant turns out to be a medium. That\'s very good. I\nalways did say that the Slavophils....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Let\'s go into the drawing-room in the meantime.\n\nFAT LADY. Allow me, just one word! The Slavophils are right; but I\nalways told my husband that one ought never to exaggerate anything!\n"The golden mean," you know. What is the use of maintaining that the\ncommon people are all perfect, when I have myself seen....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Won\'t you come into the drawing-room?\n\nFAT LADY. A boy--that high--who drank! I gave him a scolding at once.\nAnd he was grateful to me afterwards. They are children, and, as I\nalways say, children need both love and severity!\n\n     [Exeunt all, all talking together.\n\n     [TANYA enters from behind the hangings.\n\nTANYA. Oh, if it would only succeed!\n\n     [Begins fastening some threads.\n\n     [Enter BETSY hurriedly.\n\nBETSY. Isn\'t papa here? (Looks inquiringly at TANYA.) What are you\ndoing here?\n\nTANYA. Oh, Miss Elizabeth, I have only just come; I only wished ...\nonly came in....\n\n     [Embarrassed.\n\nBETSY. But they are going to have a seance here directly (Notices\nTANYA drawing in the threads, looks at her, and suddenly bursts out\nlaughing.) Tanya! Why, it\'s you who do it all? Now don\'t deny it. And\nlast time it was you too? Yes, it was, it was!\n\nTANYA. Miss Elizabeth, dearest!\n\nBETSY (delighted). Oh, that is a joke! Well, I never. But why do you\ndo it?\n\nTANYA. Oh miss, dear miss, don\'t betray me!\n\nBETSY. Not for the world! I\'m awfully glad. Only tell me how you\nmanage it?\n\nTANYA. Well, I just hide, and then, when it\'s all dark, I come out and\ndo it. That\'s how.\n\nBETSY (pointing to threads). And what is this for? You needn\'t tell\nme. I see; you draw....\n\nTANYA. Miss Elizabeth, darling! I will confess it, but only to you. I\nused to do it just for fun, but now I mean business.\n\nBETSY. What? How? What business?\n\nTANYA. Well, you see, those peasants that came this morning, you saw\nthem. They want to buy some land, and your father won\'t sell it; well,\nand Theodore Ivanitch, he says it\'s the spirits as forbid him. So I\nhave had a thought as....\n\nBETSY. Oh, I see! Well, you are a clever girl! Do it, do it.... But\nhow will you manage it?\n\nTANYA. Well, I thought, when they put out the lights, I\'ll at once\nbegin knocking and shying things about, touching their heads with the\nthreads, and at last I\'ll take the paper about the land and throw it\non the table. I\'ve got it here.\n\nBETSY. Well, and then?\n\nTANYA. Why, don\'t you see? They will be astonished. The peasants had\nthe paper, and now it\'s here. I will teach....\n\nBETSY. Why, of course! Simon is the medium to-day!\n\nTANYA. Well, I\'ll teach him.... (Laughs so that she can\'t continue.)\nI\'ll tell him to squeeze with his hands any one he can get hold of! Of\ncourse, not your father--he\'d never dare do that--but any one else;\nhe\'ll squeeze till it\'s signed.\n\nBETSY (laughing). But that\'s not the way it is done. Mediums never do\nanything themselves.\n\nTANYA. Oh, never mind. It\'s all one; I daresay it\'ll turn out all\nright.\n\n     [Enter THEODORE IVANITCH.\n\n     [Exit BETSY, making signs to TANYA.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Why are you here?\n\nTANYA. It\'s you I want, Theodore Ivanitch, dear....\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Well, what is it?\n\nTANYA. About that affair of mine as I spoke of.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (laughs). I\'ve made the match; yes, I\'ve made the\nmatch. The matter is settled; we have shaken hands on it, only not had\na drink on it.\n\nTANYA (with a shriek). Never! So it\'s all right?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Don\'t I tell you so? He says, "I shall consult the\nmissus, and then, God willing...."\n\nTANYA. Is that what he said? (Shrieks.) Dear Theodore Ivanitch, I\'ll\npray for you all the days of my life!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. All right! All right! Now is not the time. I\'ve\nbeen ordered to arrange the room for the seance.\n\nTANYA. Let me help you. How\'s it to be arranged?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. How? Why, the table in the middle of the room--\nchairs--the guitar--the accordion. The lamp is not wanted, only\ncandles.\n\nTANYA (helps THEODORE IVANITCH to place the things). Is that right?\nThe guitar here, and here the inkstand. (Places it.) So?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Can it be true that they\'ll make Simon sit here?\n\nTANYA. I suppose so; they\'ve done it once.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Wonderful! (Puts on his pince-nez.) But is he\nclean?\n\nTANYA. How should I know?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Then, I\'ll tell you what....\n\nTANYA. Yes, Theodore Ivanitch?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Go and take a nail-brush and some Pears\' soap; you\nmay take mine ... and go and cut his claws and scrub his hands as\nclean as possible.\n\nTANYA. He can do it himself.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Well then, tell him to. And tell him to put on a\nclean shirt as well.\n\nTANYA. All right, Theodore Ivanitch.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (sits down in an easy-chair). They\'re educated and\nlearned--Alexey Vladimiritch now, he\'s a professor--and yet sometimes\none can\'t help doubting very much. The people\'s rude superstitions are\nbeing abolished: hobgoblins, sorcerers, witches.... But if one\nconsiders it, is not this equally superstitious? How is it possible\nthat the souls of the dead should come and talk, and play the guitar?\nNo! Some one is fooling them, or they are fooling themselves. And as\nto this business with Simon--it\'s simply incomprehensible. (Looks at\nan album.) Here\'s their spiritualistic album. How is it possible to\nphotograph a spirit? But here is the likeness of a Turk and Leonid\nFyodoritch sitting by.... Extraordinary human weakness!\n\n     [Enter LEONID FYODORITCH.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Is it all ready?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (rising leisurely). Quite ready. (Smiles.) Only I\ndon\'t know about your new medium. I hope he won\'t disgrace you, Leonid\nFyodoritch.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. No, I and Alexey Vladimiritch have tested him. He\nis a wonderfully powerful medium!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Well, I don\'t know. But is he clean enough? I don\'t\nsuppose you have thought of ordering him to wash his hands? It might\nbe rather inconvenient.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. His hands? Oh yes! They\'re not clean, you think?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. What can you expect? He\'s a peasant, and there will\nbe ladies present, and Marya Vasilevna.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. It will be all right.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. And then I have something to report to you.\nTimothy, the coachman, complains that he can\'t keep things clean\nbecause of the dogs.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (arranging the things on the table absentmindedly).\nWhat dogs?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. The three hounds that came for Vasily Leoniditch\nto-day.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (vexed). Tell Anna Pavlovna! She can do as she likes\nabout it. I have no time.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. But you know her weakness....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. \'Tis just as she likes, let her do as she pleases.\nAs for him,--one never gets anything but unpleasantness from him.\nBesides, I am busy.\n\n     [Enter SIMON, smiling; he has a sleeveless peasant\'s coat on.\n\nSIMON. I was ordered to come.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, it\'s all right. Let me see your hands. That\nwill do, that will do very well! Well, then, my good fellow, you must\ndo just as you did before,--sit down, and give way to your mood. But\ndon\'t think at all.\n\nSIMON. Why should I think? The more one thinks, the worse it is.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Just so, just so, exactly! The less conscious one\nis, the greater is the power. Don\'t think, but give in to your mood.\nIf you wish to sleep, sleep; if you wish to walk, walk. Do you\nunderstand?\n\nSIMON. How could one help understanding? It\'s simple enough.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. But above all, don\'t be frightened. Because you\nmight be surprised yourself. You must understand that just as we live\nhere, so a whole world of invisible spirits live here also.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (improving on what LEONID FYODORITCH has said).\nInvisible feelings, do you understand?\n\nSIMON (laughs). How can one help understanding! It\'s very plain as you\nput it.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. You may rise up in the air, or something of the\nkind, but don\'t be frightened.\n\nSIMON. Why should I be frightened? That won\'t matter at all.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well then, I\'ll go and call them all.... Is\neverything ready?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. I think so.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. But the slates?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. They are downstairs. I\'ll bring them.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. All right then. So don\'t be afraid, but be at your\nease.\n\nSIMON. Had I not better take off my coat? One would be more easy like.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Your coat? Oh no. Don\'t take that off.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nSIMON. She tells me to do the same again, and she will again shy\nthings about. How isn\'t she afraid?\n\n     [Enter TANYA in her stockings and in a dress of the color of the\n      wall-paper. SIMON laughs.\n\nTANYA. Shsh!... They\'ll hear! There, stick these matches on your\nfingers as before. (Sticks them on.) Well, do you remember everything?\n\nSIMON (bending his fingers in, one by one). First of all, wet the\nmatches and wave my hands about, that\'s one. Then make my teeth\nchatter, like this ... that\'s two. But I\'ve forgotten the third thing.\n\nTANYA. And it\'s the third as is the chief thing. Don\'t forget as soon\nas the paper falls on the table--I shall ring the little bell--then\nyou do like this.... Spread your arms out far and catch hold of some\none, whoever it is as sits nearest, and catch hold of him. And then\nsqueeze! (Laughs.) Whether it\'s a gentleman or a lady, it\'s all one,\nyou just squeeze \'em, and don\'t let \'em go,--as if it were in your\nsleep, and chatter with your teeth, or else howl like this. (Howls\nsotto-voce.) And when I begin to play on the guitar, then stretch\nyourself as if you were waking up, you know.... Will you remember\neverything?\n\nSIMON. Yes, I\'ll remember, but it is too funny.\n\nTANYA. But mind you don\'t laugh. Still, it won\'t matter much if you do\nlaugh; they\'d think it was in your sleep. Only take care you don\'t\nreally fall asleep when they put out the lights.\n\nSIMON. No fear, I\'ll pinch my ears.\n\nTANYA. Well, then, Sim, darling, only mind do as I tell you, and don\'t\nget frightened. He\'ll sign the paper, see if he don\'t! They\'re coming!\n\n     [Gets under the sofa.\n\n     [Enter GROSSMAN and the PROFESSOR, LEONID FYODORITCH and the FAT\n      LADY, the DOCTOR, SAHATOF and ANNA PAVLOVNA. SIMON stands near\n      the door.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Please come in, all you doubters! Though we have a\nnew and accidentally discovered medium, I expect very important\nphenomena to-night.\n\nSAHATOF. That\'s very, very interesting.\n\nFAT LADY (pointing to SIMON). Mais il est tres bien! [11]\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Yes, as a butler\'s assistant, but hardly....\n\nSAHATOF. Wives never have any faith in their husbands\' work. You don\'t\nbelieve in anything of this kind?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Of course not. Kaptchitch, it is true, has something\nexceptional about him, but Heaven knows what all this is about!\n\nFAT LADY. No, Anna Pavlovna, permit me, you can\'t decide it in such a\nway. Before I was married, I once had a remarkable dream. Dreams, you\nknow, are often such that you don\'t know where they begin and where\nthey end; it was just such a dream that I....\n\n     [Enter VASILY LEONIDITCH and PETRISTCHEF.\n\nFAT LADY. And much was revealed to me by that dream. Nowadays the\nyoung people (points to PETRISTCHEF and VASILY LEONIDITCH) deny\neverything.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. But look here, you know--now I, for instance, never\ndeny anything! Eh, what?\n\n     [BETSY and MARYA KONSTANTINOVNA enter, and begin talking to\n      PETRISTCHEF.\n\nFAT LADY. And how can one deny the supernatural? They say it is\nunreasonable. But what if one\'s reason is stupid; what then? There\nnow, on Garden Street, you know ... why, well, it appeared every\nevening! My husband\'s brother--what do you call him? Not beau-frere--\nwhat\'s the other name for it?--I never can remember the names of these\ndifferent relationships--well, he went there three nights running, and\nstill he saw nothing; so I said to him....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well, who is going to stay here?\n\nFAT LADY. I! I!\n\nSAHATOF. I.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (to DOCTOR). Do you mean to say you are going to stay?\n\nDOCTOR. Yes; I must see, if only once, what it is that Alexey\nVladimiritch has discovered in it. How can we deny anything without\nproof?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Then I am to take it to-night for certain?\n\nDOCTOR. Take what?... Oh, the powder. Yes, it would perhaps be better.\nYes, yes, take it.... However, I shall come upstairs again.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Yes, please do. (Loud.) When it is over, mesdames et\nmessieurs, I shall expect you to come to me upstairs to rest from your\nemotions, and then we will finish our rubber.\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, certainly.\n\nSAHATOF. Yes, thanks!\n\n     [Exit ANNA PAVLOVNA.\n\nBETSY (to PETRISTCHEF). You must stay, I tell you. I promise you\nsomething extraordinary. Will you bet?\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. But you don\'t believe in it?\n\nBETSY. To-day I do.\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA (to PETRISTCHEF). And do you believe?\n\nPETRISTCHEF. "I can\'t believe, I cannot trust a heart for falsehood\nframed." Still, if Elizabeth Leonidovna commands....\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Let us stay, Marya Konstantinovna. Eh, what? I\nshall invent something epatant.\n\nMARYA KONSTANTINOVNA. No, you mustn\'t make me laugh. You know I can\'t\nrestrain myself.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH (loud). I remain!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (severely). But I beg those who remain not to joke\nabout it. It is a serious matter.\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Do you hear? Well then, let\'s stay. Vovo, sit here, and\ndon\'t be too shy.\n\nBETSY. Yes, it\'s all very well for you to laugh; but just wait till\nyou see what will happen.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Oh, but supposing it\'s true? Won\'t it be a go! Eh,\nwhat?\n\nPETRISTCHEF (trembles). Oh, I\'m afraid, I\'m afraid! Marya\nKonstantinovna, I\'m afraid! My tootsies tremble.\n\nBETSY (laughing). Not so loud.\n\n     [All sit down.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Take your seats, take your seats. Simon, sit down!\n\nSIMON. Yes, sir.\n\n     [Sits down on the edge of the chair.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Sit properly.\n\nPROFESSOR. Sit straight in the middle of the chair, and quite at your\nease.\n\n     [Arranges SIMON on his chair.\n\n     [BETSY, MARYA KONSTANTINOVNA and VASILY LEONIDITCH laugh.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (raising his voice). I beg those who are going to\nremain here not to behave frivolously, but to regard this matter\nseriously, or bad results might follow. Do you hear, Vovo! If you\ncan\'t be quiet, go away!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Quiet, quiet!\n\n     [Hides behind FAT LADY.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Alexey Vladimiritch, will you mesmerise him?\n\nPROFESSOR. No; why should I do it when Anton Borisitch is here? He has\nhad far more practice and has more power in that department than I ...\nAnton Borisitch!\n\nGROSSMAN. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not, strictly speaking, a\nspiritualist. I have only studied hypnotism. It is true I have studied\nhypnotism in all its known manifestations; but what is called\nspiritualism, is entirely unknown to me. When a subject is thrown into\na trance, I may expect the hypnotic phenomena known to me: lethargy,\nabulia, anaesthesia, analgesia, catalepsy, and every kind of\nsusceptibility to suggestion. Here it is not these but other phenomena\nwe expect to observe. Therefore it would be well to know of what kind\nare the phenomena we expect to witness, and what is their scientific\nsignificance.\n\nSAHATOF. I thoroughly agree with Mr. Grossman. Such an explanation\nwould be very interesting.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. I think Alexey Vladimiritch will not refuse to give\nus a short explanation.\n\nPROFESSOR. Why not? I can give an explanation if it is desired. (To\nthe DOCTOR.) Will you kindly note his temperature and pulse? My\nexplanation must, of necessity, be cursory and brief.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, please; briefly, quite briefly.\n\nDOCTOR. All right. (Takes out thermometer.) Now then, my lad....\n\n     [Places the thermometer.\n\nSIMON. Yes, sir!\n\nPROFESSOR (rising and addressing the FAT LADY--then reseating\nhimself). Ladies and gentlemen! The phenomenon we are investigating\nto-night is regarded, on the one hand, as something new; and, on the\nother, as something transcending the limits of natural conditions.\nNeither view is correct. This phenomenon is not new but is as old as\nthe world; and it is not supernatural but is subject to the eternal\nlaws that govern all that exists. This phenomenon has been usually\ndefined as "intercourse with the spirit world." That definition is\ninexact. Under such a definition the spirit world is contrasted with\nthe material world. But this is erroneous; there is no such contrast!\nBoth worlds are so closely connected that it is impossible to draw a\nline of demarcation, separating the one from the other. We say matter\nis composed of molecules....\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Prosy matter!\n\n     [Whispering and laughter.\n\nPROFESSOR (pauses, then continues). Molecules are composed of atoms,\nbut the atoms, having no extension, are in reality nothing but the\npoints of application of forces. Strictly speaking, not of forces but\nof energy, that same energy which is as much a unity and just as\nindestructible as matter. But matter, though one, has many different\naspects, and the same is true of energy. Till recently only four forms\nof energy, convertible into one another, have been known to us:\nenergies known as the dynamic, the thermal, the electric, and the\nchemic. But these four aspects of energy are far from exhausting all\nthe varieties of its manifestation. The forms in which energy may\nmanifest itself are very diverse, and it is one of these new and as\nyet but little known phases of energy, that we are investigating\nto-night. I refer to mediumistic energy.\n\n     [Renewed whispering and laughter among the young people.\n\nPROFESSOR (stops and casts a severe look round). Mediumistic energy\nhas been known to mankind for ages: prophecy, presentiments, visions\nand so on, are nothing but manifestations of mediumistic energy. The\nmanifestations produced by it have, I say, been known to mankind for\nages. But the energy itself has not been recognised as such till quite\nrecently--not till that medium, the vibrations of which cause the\nmanifestations of mediumistic energy, was recognised. In the same way\nthat the phenomena of light were inexplicable until the existence of\nan imponderable substance--an ether--was recognised, so mediumistic\nphenomena seemed mysterious until the now fully established fact was\nrecognised, that between the particles of ether there exists another\nstill more rarefied imponderable substance not subject to the law of\nthe three dimensions....\n\n     [Renewed laughter, whispers, and giggling.\n\nPROFESSOR (again looks round severely). And just as mathematical\ncalculations have irrefutably proved the existence of imponderable\nether which gives rise to the phenomena of light and electricity, so\nthe successive investigations of the ingenious Hermann, of Schmidt,\nand of Joseph Schmatzhofen, have confirmed beyond a doubt the\nexistence of a substance which fills the universe and may be called\nspiritual ether.\n\nFAT LADY. Ah, now I understand. I am so grateful....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, but Alexey Vladimiritch, could you not ...\ncondense it a little?\n\nPROFESSOR (not heeding the remark). And so, as I have just had the\nhonor of mentioning to you, a succession of strictly scientific\nexperiments have made plain to us the laws of mediumistic phenomena.\nThese experiments have proved that, when certain individuals are\nplunged into a hypnotic state (a state differing from ordinary sleep\nonly by the fact that man\'s physiological activity is not lowered by\nthe hypnotic influence but, on the contrary, is always heightened--as\nwe have recently witnessed), when, I say, any individual is plunged\ninto such a state, this always produces certain perturbations in the\nspiritual ether--perturbations quite similar to those produced by\nplunging a solid body into liquid matter. These perturbations are what\nwe call mediumistic phenomena....\n\n     [Laughter and whispers.\n\nSAHATOF. That is quite comprehensible and correct; but if, as you are\nkind enough to inform us, the plunging of the medium into a trance\nproduces perturbations of the spiritual ether, allow me to ask why (as\nis usually supposed to be the case in spiritualistic seances) these\nperturbations result in an activity on the part of the souls of dead\npeople?\n\nPROFESSOR. It is because the molecules of this spiritual ether are\nnothing but the souls of the living, the dead, and the unborn, and any\nvibration of the spiritual ether must inevitably cause a certain\nvibration of its atoms. These atoms are nothing but human souls, which\nenter into communication with one another by means of these movements.\n\nFAT LADY (to SAHATOF). What is it that puzzles you? It is so\nsimple.... Thank you so, so much!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. I think everything has now been explained, and that\nwe may commence.\n\nDOCTOR. The fellow is in a perfectly normal condition: temperature 37\ndecimal 2, pulse 74.\n\nPROFESSOR (takes out his pocket-book and notes this down). What I have\njust had the honor of explaining will be confirmed by the fact, which\nwe shall presently have an opportunity of observing, that after the\nmedium has been thrown into a trance his temperature and pulse will\ninevitably rise, just as occurs in cases of hypnotism.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, yes. But excuse me a moment. I should like to\nreply to Sergey Ivanitch\'s question: How do we know we are in\ncommunication with the souls of the dead? We know it because the\nspirit that appears, plainly tells us--as simply as I am speaking to\nyou--who he is, and why he has come, and whether all is well with him!\nAt our last seance a Spaniard, Don Castillos, came to us, and he told\nus everything. He told us who he was, and when he died, and that he\nwas suffering for having taken part in the Inquisition. He even told\nus what was happening to him at the very time that he was speaking to\nus, namely, that at the very time he was talking to us he had to be\nborn again on earth, and, therefore, could not continue his\nconversation with us.... But you\'ll see for yourselves....\n\nFAT LADY (interrupting). Oh, how interesting! Perhaps the Spaniard was\nborn in one of our houses and is a baby now!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Quite possibly.\n\nPROFESSOR. I think it is time we began.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. I was only going to say....\n\nPROFESSOR. It is getting late.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Very well. Then we will commence. Anton Borisitch,\nbe so good as to hypnotize the medium.\n\nGROSSMAN. What method would you like me to use? There are several\nmethods. There is Braid\'s system, there is the Egyptian symbol, and\nthere is Charcot\'s system.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (to the PROFESSOR). I think it is quite immaterial.\n\nPROFESSOR. Quite.\n\nGROSSMAN. Then I will make use of my own method, which I showed in\nOdessa.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. If you please!\n\n     [GROSSMAN waves his arms above SIMON. SIMON closes his eyes and\n      stretches himself.\n\nGROSSMAN (looking closely at him). He is falling asleep! He is asleep!\nA remarkably rapid occurrence of hypnosis. The subject has evidently\nalready reached a state of anaesthesia. He is remarkable,--an\nunusually impressionable subject, and might be subjected to\ninteresting experiments!... (Sits down, rises, sits down again.) Now\none might run a needle into his arm. If you like....\n\nPROFESSOR (to LEONID FYODORITCH). Do you notice how the medium\'s\ntrance acts on Grossman? He is beginning to vibrate.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, yes ... can the lights be extinguished now?\n\nSAHATOF. But why is darkness necessary?\n\nPROFESSOR. Darkness? Because it is a condition of the manifestation of\nmediumistic energy, just as a given temperature is a condition\nnecessary for certain manifestations of chemical or dynamic energy.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. But not always. Manifestations have been observed\nby me, and by many others, both by candlelight and daylight.\n\nPROFESSOR (interrupting). May the lights be put out?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, certainly. (Puts out candles.) Ladies and\ngentlemen! attention, if you please.\n\n     [TANYA gets from under the sofa and takes hold of a thread tied\n      to a chandelier.\n\nPETRISTCHEF. I like that Spaniard! Just in the midst of a\nconversation--off he goes head downwards ... as the French say: piquer\nune tete. [12]\n\nBETSY. You just wait a bit, and see what will happen!\n\nPETRISTCHEF. I have only one fear, and that is that Vovo may be moved\nby the spirit to grunt like a pig!\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Would you like me to? I will....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Gentlemen! Silence, if you please!\n\n     [Silence. SIMON licks the matches on his fingers and rubs his\n      knuckles with them. Leonid Fyodoritch. A light! Do you see the\n      light?\n\nSAHATOF. A light? Yes, yes, I see; but allow me....\n\nFAT LADY. Where? Where? Oh, dear, I did not see it! Ah, there it is.\nOh!...\n\nPROFESSOR (whispers to LEONID FYODORITCH, and points to GROSSMAN, who\nis moving). Do you notice how he vibrates? It is the dual influence.\n\n     [The light appears again.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (to the PROFESSOR). It must be he--you know!\n\nSAHATOF. Who?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. A Greek, Nicholas. It is his light. Don\'t you think\nso, Alexey Vladimiritch?\n\nSAHATOF. Who is this Greek, Nicholas?\n\nPROFESSOR. A certain Greek, who was a monk at Constantinople under\nConstantine and who has been visiting us lately.\n\nFAT LADY. Where is he? Where is he? I don\'t see him.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. He is not yet visible ... Alexey Vladimiritch, he\nis particularly well disposed towards you. You question him.\n\nPROFESSOR (in a peculiar voice). Nicholas! Is that you?\n\n     [TANYA raps twice on the wall.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (joyfully). It is he! It is he!\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, dear! Oh! I shall go away!\n\nSAHATOF. Why do you suppose it is he?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Why, the two knocks. It is an affirmative answer;\nelse all would have been silence.\n\n     [Silence. Suppressed giggling in the young people\'s corner.\n      TANYA throws a lampshade, pencil and penwiper upon the table.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (whispers). Do you notice, gentlemen, here is a\nlamp-shade, and something else--a pencil!... Alexey Vladimiritch, it\nis a pencil!\n\nPROFESSOR. All right, all right! I am watching both him and Grossman!\n\n     [GROSSMAN rises and feels the things that have fallen on the table.\n\nSAHATOF. Excuse me, excuse me! I should like to see whether it is not\nthe medium who is doing it all himself?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Do you think so? Well, sit by him and hold his\nhands. But you may be sure he is asleep.\n\nSAHATOF (approaches, TANYA lets a thread touch his head. He is\nfrightened, and stoops). Ye ... ye ... yes! Strange, very strange!\n\n     [Takes hold of SIMON\'S elbow. SIMON howls.\n\nPROFESSOR (to LEONID FYODORITCH). Do you notice the effect of\nGrossman\'s presence? It is a new phenomenon--I must note it....\n\n     [Runs out to note it down, and returns again.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes.... But we cannot leave Nicholas without an\nanswer. We must begin....\n\nGROSSMAN (rises, approaches Simon and raises and lowers his arm). It\nwould be interesting to produce contraction! The subject is in\nprofound hypnosis.\n\nPROFESSOR (to LEONID FYODORITCH). Do you see? Do you see?\n\nGROSSMAN. If you like....\n\nDOCTOR. Now then, my dear sir, leave the management to Alexey\nVladimiritch; the affair is turning out serious.\n\nPROFESSOR. Leave him alone, he (referring to GROSSMAN) is talking in\nhis sleep!\n\nFAT LADY. How glad I now am that I resolved to be present! It is\nfrightening, but all the same I am glad, for I always said to my\nhusband....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Silence, if you please.\n\n     [TANYA draws a thread over the FAT LADY\'S head.\n\nFAT LADY. Aie!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. What? What is it?\n\nFAT LADY. He took hold of my hair!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (whispers). Never mind, don\'t be afraid, give him\nyour hand. His hand will be cold, but I like it.\n\nFAT LADY (hides her hands). Not for the world!\n\nSAHATOF. Yes, it is strange, very strange!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. He is here and is seeking for intercourse. Who\nwishes to put a question to him?\n\nSAHATOF. I should like to put a question, if I may.\n\nPROFESSOR. Please do.\n\nSAHATOF. Do I believe or not?\n\n     [TANYA knocks twice.\n\nPROFESSOR. The answer is affirmative.\n\nSAHATOF. Allow me to ask again. Have I a ten rouble note in my pocket?\n\n     [TANYA knocks several times and passes a thread over SAHATOF\'S head.\n\nSAHATOF. Ah!\n\n     [Seizes the thread and breaks it.\n\nPROFESSOR. I should ask those present not to ask indefinite or trivial\nquestions. It is unpleasant to him!\n\nSAHATOF. No, but allow me! Here I have a thread in my hand!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. A thread? Hold it fast; that happens often, and not\nonly threads but sometimes even silk cords--very ancient ones!\n\nSAHATOF. No--but where did this thread come from?\n\n     [TANYA throws a cushion at him.\n\nSAHATOF. Wait a bit; wait! Something soft has hit me on the head.\nLight a candle--there is something....\n\nPROFESSOR. We beg of you not to interrupt the manifestations.\n\nFAT LADY. For goodness\' sake, don\'t interrupt! I should also like to\nask something. May I?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, if you like.\n\nFAT LADY. I should like to ask about my digestion. May I? I want to\nknow what to take: aconite or belladonna?\n\n     [Silence, whispers among the young people; suddenly VASILY\n      LEONIDITCH begins to cry like a baby: "ou-a, ou-a!" (Laughter.)\n      Holding their mouths and noses, the girls and PETRISTCHEF run\n      away bursting with laughter.\n\nFAT LADY. Ah, that must be the monk who\'s been born again!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (beside himself with anger, whispers). One gets\nnothing but tomfoolery from you! If you don\'t know how to behave\ndecently, go away!\n\n     [Exit VASILY LEONIDITCH. Darkness and silence.\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, what a pity! Now one can\'t ask any more! He is born!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Not at all. It is only Vovo\'s nonsense. But he is\nhere. Ask him.\n\nPROFESSOR. That often happens. These jokes and ridicule are quite\nusual occurrences. I expect he is still here. But we may ask. Leonid\nFyodoritch, will you?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. No, you, if you please. This has upset me. So\nunpleasant! Such want of tact!...\n\nPROFESSOR. Very well.... Nicholas, are you here?\n\n     [TANYA raps twice and rings. SIMON roars, spreads his arms out,\n      seizes SAHATOF and the PROFESSOR--squeezing them.\n\nPROFESSOR. What an unexpected phenomenon! The medium himself reacted\nupon! This never happened before! Leonid Fyodoritch, will you watch?\nIt is difficult for me to do so. He squeezes me so! Mind you observe\nGROSSMAN! This needs the very greatest attention!\n\n     [TANYA throws the PEASANTS\' paper on the table.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Something has fallen upon the table.\n\nPROFESSOR. See what it is!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Paper! A folded paper!\n\n     [TANYA throws a travelling inkstand on the table.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. An inkstand!\n\n     [TANYA throws a pen.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. A pen!\n\n     [SIMON roars and squeezes.\n\nPROFESSOR (crushed). Wait a bit, wait: a totally new manifestation!\nThe action proceeding not from the mediumistic energy produced, but\nfrom the medium himself! However, open the inkstand, and put the pen\non the table, and he will write!\n\n     [TANYA goes behind LEONID FYODORITCH and strikes him on the head\n      with the guitar.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. He has struck me on the head! (Examining table.)\nThe pen is not writing yet and the paper remains folded.\n\nPROFESSOR. See what the paper is, and quickly; evidently the dual\ninfluence--his and Grossman\'s--has produced a perturbation!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (goes out and returns at once). Extraordinary! This\npaper is an agreement with some peasants that I refused to sign this\nmorning and returned to the peasants. Probably he wants me to sign it?\n\nPROFESSOR. Of course! Of course! But ask him.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Nicholas, do you wish....\n\n     [TANYA knocks twice.\n\nPROFESSOR. Do you hear? It is quite evident!\n\n     [LEONID FYODORITCH takes the paper and pen and goes out. TANYA\n      knocks, plays on the guitar and the accordion, and then creeps\n      under the sofa. LEONID FYODORITCH returns. SIMON stretches\n      himself and coughs.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. He is waking up. We can light the candles.\n\nPROFESSOR (hurriedly). Doctor, Doctor, please, his pulse and\ntemperature! You will see that a rise of both will be apparent.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (lights the candles). Well, what do you gentlemen\nwho were sceptical think of it now?\n\nDOCTOR (goes up to SIMON and places thermometer). Now then my lad.\nWell, have you had a nap? There, put that in there, and give me your\nhand.\n\n     [Looks at his watch.\n\nSAHATOF (shrugging his shoulders). I must admit that all that has\noccurred cannot have been done by the medium. But the thread?... I\nshould like the thread explained.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. A thread! A thread! We have been witnessing\nmanifestations more important than a thread.\n\nSAHATOF. I don\'t know. At all events, je reserve mon opinion.\n\nFAT LADY (to SAHATOF). Oh, no, how can you say: "je reserve mon\nopinion"? And the infant with the little wings? Didn\'t you see? At\nfirst I thought it was only an illusion, but afterwards it became\nclearer and clearer, like a live....\n\nSAHATOF. I can only speak of what I have seen. I did not see that--\nnothing of the kind.\n\nFAT LADY. You don\'t mean to say so? Why, it was quite plainly visible!\nAnd to the left there was a monk clothed in black bending over it....\n\nSAHATOF (moves away. Aside). What exaggeration!\n\nFAT LADY (addressing the DOCTOR). You must have seen it! It rose up\nfrom your side.\n\n     [DOCTOR goes on counting the pulse without heeding her.\n\nFAT LADY (to GROSSMAN). And that light, the light around it,\nespecially around its little face! And the expression so mild and\ntender, something so heavenly!\n\n     [Smiles tenderly herself.\n\nGROSSMAN. I saw phosphorescent light, and objects changed their\nplaces, but I saw nothing more than that.\n\nFAT LADY. Don\'t tell me! You don\'t mean it! It is simply that you\nscientists of Charcot\'s school do not believe in a life beyond the\ngrave! As for me, no one could now make me disbelieve in a future\nlife--no one in the world!\n\n     [GROSSMAN moves away from her.\n\nFAT LADY. No, no, whatever you may say, this is one of the happiest\nmoments of my life! When I heard Sarasate play, and now.... Yes! (No\none listens to her. She goes up to SIMON.) Now tell me, my friend,\nwhat did you feel? Was it very trying?\n\nSIMON (laughs). Yes, ma\'m, just so.\n\nFAT LADY. Still not unendurable?\n\nSIMON. Just so, ma\'m. (To LEONID FYODORITCH.) Am I to go?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, you may go.\n\nDOCTOR (to the PROFESSOR). The pulse is the same, but the temperature\nis lower.\n\nPROFESSOR. Lower! (Considers awhile, then suddenly divines the\nconclusion.) It had to be so--it had to descend! The dual influence\ncrossing had to produce some kind of reflex action. Yes, that\'s it!\n\n     [Exeunt, all talking at once--\n\n     LEONID FYODORITCH. I\'m only sorry we had no complete\n     materialisation. But still.... Come, gentlemen, let us go to the\n     drawing-room?\n\n     FAT LADY. What specially struck me was when he flapped his wings,\n     and one saw how he rose!\n\n     GROSSMAN (to SAHATOF). If we had kept to hypnotism, we might have\n     produced a thorough state of epilepsy. The success might have\n     been complete!\n\n     SAHATOF. It is very interesting, but not entirely convincing. That\n     is all I can say.\n\n     [Enter THEODORE IVANITCH.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH (with paper in his hand). Ah, Theodore, what a\nremarkable seance we have had! It turns out that the peasants must\nhave the land on their own terms.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Dear me!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Yes, indeed. (Showing paper.) Fancy, this paper\nthat I returned to them, suddenly appeared on the table! I have signed\nit.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. How did it get there?\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well, it did get there!\n\n     [Exit. THEODORE IVANITCH follows him out.\n\nTANYA (gets from under the sofa and laughs). Oh, dear, oh dear! Well,\nI did get a fright when he got hold of the thread! (Shrieks.) Well,\nanyhow, it\'s all right--he has signed it!\n\n     [Enter GREGORY.\n\nGREGORY. So it was you that was fooling them?\n\nTANYA. What business is it of yours?\n\nGREGORY. And do you think the missis will be pleased with you for it?\nNo, you bet; you\'re caught now! I\'ll tell them what tricks you\'re up\nto, if you don\'t let me have my way!\n\nTANYA. And you\'ll not get your way, and you\'ll not do me any harm!\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\nThe same scene as in Act I. The next day. Two liveried footmen,\nTHEODORE IVANITCH and GREGORY.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN (with grey whiskers). Yours is the third house to-day.\nThank goodness that all the at-homes are in this direction. Yours used\nto be on Thursdays.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Yes, we changed to Saturday so as to be on the same\nday as the Golovkins and Grade von Grabes....\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. The Stcherbakofs do the thing well. There\'s\nrefreshments for the footmen every time they\'ve a ball.\n\n     [The two PRINCESSES, mother and daughter, come down the stairs\n      accompanied by BETSY. The old PRINCESS looks in her note-book\n      and at her watch, and sits down on the settle. GREGORY puts on\n      her overshoes.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. Now, do come. Because, if you refuse, and Dodo\nrefuses, the whole thing will be spoilt.\n\nBETSY. I don\'t know. I must certainly go to the Shoubins. And then\nthere is the rehearsal.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. You\'ll have plenty of time. Do, please. Ne nous fais\npas faux bond.[13] Fedya and Koko will come.\n\nBETSY. J\'en ai par-dessus la tete de votre Koko.[14]\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. I thought I should see him here. Ordinairement il est\nd\'une exactitude....[15]\n\nBETSY. He is sure to come.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. When I see you together, it always seems to me that he\nhas either just proposed or is just going to propose.\n\nBETSY. Yes, I don\'t suppose it can be avoided. I shall have to go\nthrough with it. And it is so unpleasant!\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. Poor Koko! He is head over ears in love.\n\nBETSY. Cessez, les gens![16]\n\n     [YOUNG PRINCESS sits down, talking in whispers. GREGORY puts on\n      her overshoes.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. Well then, good-bye till this evening.\n\nBETSY. I\'ll try to come.\n\nOLD PRINCESS. Then tell your papa that I don\'t believe in anything of\nthe kind, but will come to see his new medium. Only he must let me\nknow when. Good afternoon, ma toute belle.\n\n     [Kisses BETSY, and exit, followed by her daughter. BETSY goes\n      upstairs.\n\nGREGORY. I don\'t like putting on an old woman\'s overshoes for her; she\ncan\'t stoop, can\'t see her shoe for her stomach, and keeps poking her\nfoot in the wrong place. It\'s different with a young one; it\'s\npleasant to take her foot in one\'s hand.\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. Hear him! Making distinctions!\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. It\'s not for us footmen to make such distinctions.\n\nGREGORY. Why shouldn\'t one make distinctions; are we not men? It\'s\nthey think we don\'t understand! Just now they were deep in their talk,\nthen they look at me, and at once it\'s "lay zhon!"\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. And what\'s that?\n\nGREGORY. Oh, that means, "Don\'t talk, they understand!" It\'s the same\nat table. But I understand! You say, there\'s a difference? I say there\nis none.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. There is a great difference for those who understand.\n\nGREGORY. There is none at all. To-day I am a footman, and to-morrow I\nmay be living no worse than they are. Has it never happened that\nthey\'ve married footmen? I\'ll go and have a smoke.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. That\'s a bold young man you\'ve got.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. A worthless fellow, not fit for service. He used to\nbe an office boy and has got spoilt. I advised them not to take him,\nbut the mistress liked him. He looks well on the carriage when they\ndrive out.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. I should like to send him to our Count; he\'d put him in\nhis place! Oh, he don\'t like those scatterbrains. "If you\'re a\nfootman, be a footman and fulfil your calling." Such pride is not\nbefitting.\n\n     [PETRISTCHEF comes running downstairs, and takes out a cigarette.\n\nPETRISTCHEF (deep in thought). Let\'s see, my second is the same as my\nfirst. Echo, a-co, co-coa. (Enter KOKO KLINGEN, wearing his\npince-nez.) Ko-ko, co-coa. Cocoa tin, where do you spring from?\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. From the Stcherbakofs. You are always playing the\nfool....\n\nPETRISTCHEF. No, listen to my charade. My first is the same as my\nsecond, my third may be cracked, my whole is like your pate.\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. I give it up. I\'ve no time.\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Where else are you going?\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. Where? Of course to the Ivins, to practice for the\nconcert. Then to the Shoubins, and then to the rehearsal. You\'ll be\nthere too, won\'t you?\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Most certainly. At the re-her-Sall and also at the\nre-her-Sarah. Why, at first I was a savage, and now I am both a savage\nand a general.\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. How did yesterday\'s seance go off?\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Screamingly funny! There was a peasant, and above all, it\nwas all in the dark. Vovo cried like an infant, the Professor defined,\nand Marya Vasilevna refined. Such a lark! You ought to have been\nthere.\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. I\'m afraid, mon cher. You have a way of getting off with\na jest, but I always feel that if I say a word they\'ll construe it\ninto a proposal. Et ca ne m\'arrange pas du tout, du tout. Mais du\ntout, du tout! [17]\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Instead of a proposal, make a proposition, and receive a\nsentence! Well, I shall go in to Vovo\'s. If you\'ll call for me, we can\ngo to the re-her-Sarah together.\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. I can\'t think how you can be friends with such a fool.\nHe is so stupid--a regular blockhead!\n\nPETRISTCHEF. And I am fond of him. I love Vovo, but ... "with a love\nso strange, ne\'er towards him the path untrod shall be"....\n\n     [Exit into Vovo\'s room.\n\n     [BETSY comes down with a LADY. KOKO bows significantly to BETSY.\n\nBETSY (shaking KOKO\'S hand without turning towards him. To LADY). You\nare acquainted?\n\nLADY. No.\n\nBETSY. Baron Klingen.... Why were you not here last night?\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. I could not come, I was engaged.\n\nBETSY. What a pity, it was so interesting! (Laughs.) You should have\nseen what manifestations we had! Well, how is our charade getting on?\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. Oh, the verses for mon second are ready. Nick composed\nthe verses, and I the music.\n\nBETSY. What are they? What are they? Do tell me!\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. Wait a minute; how does it go?... Oh, the knight sings:\n\n          "Oh, naught so beautiful as nature:\n           The Nautilus sails by.\n           Oh, naughty lass, oh, naughty lass!\n           Oh, nought, oh, nought! Oh, fie!"\n\nLADY. I see, my second is "nought," and what is my first?\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. My first is Aero, the name of a girl savage.\n\nBETSY. Aero, you see, is a savage who wished to devour the object of\nher love. (Laughs.) She goes about lamenting, and sings--\n\n          "My appetite,"\n\nKOKO KLINGEN (interrupts)--\n\n          "How can I fight,"....\n\nBETSY (chimes in)--\n\n          "Some one to chew I long.\n           I seeking go ...."\n\nKOKO KLINGEN--\n\n          "But even so...."\n\nBETSY--\n\n          "No one to chew can find."\n\nKOKO KLINGEN--\n\n          "A raft sails by,"\n\nBETSY--\n\n          "It cometh nigh;\n           Two generals upon it...."\n\nKOKO KLINGEN--\n\n          "Two generals are we:\n           By fate\'s hard decree,\n           To this island we flee."\n\nAnd then, the refrain--\n\n          "By fate\'s hard decree,\n           To this island we flee."\n\nLADY. Charmant!\n\nBETSY. But just think how silly!\n\nKOKO KLINGEN. Yes, that\'s the charm of it!\n\nLADY. And who is to be Aero?\n\nBETSY. I am. And I have had a costume made, but mamma says it\'s "not\ndecent." And it is not a bit less decent than a ball dress. (To\nTHEODORE IVANITCH.) Is Bourdier\'s man here?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Yes, he is waiting in the kitchen.\n\nLADY. Well, and how will you represent Aeronaut?\n\nBETSY. Oh, you\'ll see. I don\'t want to spoil the pleasure for you. Au\nrevoir.\n\nLADY. Good-bye!\n\n     [They bow. Exit LADY.\n\nBETSY (to KOKO KLINGEN). Come up to mamma.\n\n     [BETSY and KOKO go upstairs. JACOB enters from servants\'\n      quarters, carrying a tray with teacups, cakes, etc., and goes\n      panting across the stage.\n\nJACOB (to the FOOTMEN). How d\'you do? How d\'you do?\n\n     [FOOTMEN bow.\n\nJACOB (to THEODORE IVANITCH). Couldn\'t you tell Gregory to help a bit!\nI\'m ready to drop....\n\n     [Exit up the stairs.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. That is a hard-working chap you\'ve got there.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Yes, a good fellow. But there now--he doesn\'t\nsatisfy the mistress, she says his appearance is ungainly. And now\nthey\'ve gone and told tales about him for letting some peasants into\nthe kitchen yesterday. It is a bad look-out: they may dismiss him. And\nhe is a good fellow.\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. What peasants were they?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Peasants that had come from our Koursk village to\nbuy some land. It was night, and they were our fellow-countrymen, one\nof them the father of the butler\'s assistant. Well, so they were asked\ninto the kitchen. It so happened that there was thought-reading going\non. Something was hidden in the kitchen, and all the gentlefolk came\ndown, and the mistress saw the peasants. There was such a row! "How is\nthis," she says; "these people may be infected, and they are let into\nthe kitchen!".... She is terribly afraid of this infection.\n\n     [Enter GREGORY.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Gregory, you go and help Jacob. I\'ll stay here. He\ncan\'t manage alone.\n\nGREGORY. He\'s awkward, that\'s why he can\'t manage.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. And what is this new mania they have got? This\ninfection!... So yours also is afraid of it?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. She fears it worse than fire! Our chief business,\nnowadays, is fumigating, washing, and sprinkling.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. I see. That\'s why there is such a stuffy smell here.\n(With animation.) I don\'t know what we\'re coming to with these\ninfection notions. It\'s just detestable! They seem to have forgotten\nthe Lord. There\'s our master\'s sister, Princess Mosolova, her daughter\nwas dying, and, will you believe it, neither father nor mother would\ncome near her! So she died without their having taken leave of her.\nAnd the daughter cried, and called them to say good-bye--but they\ndidn\'t go! The doctor had discovered some infection or other! And yet\ntheir own maid and a trained nurse were with her, and nothing happened\nto them; they\'re still alive!\n\n     [Enter VASILY LEONIDITCH and PETRISTCHEF from VASILY LEONIDITCH\'S\n      room, smoking cigarettes.\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Come along then, only I must take Koko--Cocoanut, with\nme.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. Your Koko is a regular dolt; I can\'t bear him. A\nhare-brained fellow, a regular gad-about! Without any kind of\noccupation, eternally loafing around! Eh, what?\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Well, anyhow, wait a bit, I must say goodbye.\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. All right. And I will go and look at my dogs in the\ncoachman\'s room. I\'ve got a dog there that\'s so savage, the coachman\nsaid, he nearly ate him.\n\nPETRISTCHEF. Who ate whom? Did the coachman really eat the dog?\n\nVASILY LEONIDITCH. You are always at it!\n\n     [Puts on outdoor things and goes out.\n\nPETRISTCHEF (thoughtfully). Ma - kin - tosh, Co - co - tin.... Let\'s\nsee.\n\n     [Goes upstairs.\n\n     [JACOB runs across the stage.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. What\'s the matter?\n\nJACOB. There is no more thin bread and butter. I said....\n\n     [Exit.\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. And then our master\'s little son fell ill, and they\nsent him at once to an hotel with his nurse, and there he died without\nhis mother.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. They don\'t seem to fear sin! I think you cannot escape\nfrom God anywhere.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. That\'s what I think.\n\n     [JACOB runs upstairs with bread and butter.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. One should consider too, that if we are to be afraid of\neverybody like that, we\'d better shut ourselves up within four walls,\nas in a prison, and stick there!\n\n     [Enter TANYA; she bows to the FOOTMEN.\n\nTANYA. Good afternoon.\n\n     [FOOTMEN bow.\n\nTANYA. Theodore Ivanitch, I have a word to say to you.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Well, what?\n\nTANYA. The peasants have come again, Theodore Ivanitch....\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Well? I gave the paper to Simon.\n\nTANYA. I have given them the paper. They were that grateful! I can\'t\nsay how! Now they only ask you to take the money.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. But where are they?\n\nTANYA. Here, by the porch.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. All right, I\'ll tell the master.\n\nTANYA. I have another request to you, dear Theodore Ivanitch.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. What now?\n\nTANYA. Why, don\'t you see, Theodore Ivanitch, I can\'t remain here any\nlonger. Ask them to let me go.\n\n     [Enter JACOB, running.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (to JACOB). What d\'you want?\n\nJACOB. Another samovar, and oranges.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Ask the housekeeper.\n\n     [Exit JACOB.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (to TANYA). How is that?\n\nTANYA. Why, don\'t you see, my position is such....\n\nJACOB (runs in). There are not enough oranges.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Serve up as many as you\'ve got. (Exit JACOB.) Now\'s\nnot the time! Just see what a bustle we are in.\n\nTANYA. But you know yourself, Theodore Ivanitch, there is no end to\nthis bustle; one might wait for ever--you know yourself--and my affair\nis for life.... Dear Theodore Ivanitch, you have done me a good turn,\nbe a father to me now, choose the right moment and tell her, or else\nshe\'ll get angry and won\'t let me have my passport.[18]\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Where\'s the hurry?\n\nTANYA. Why, Theodore Ivanitch, it\'s all settled now.... And I could go\nto my godmother\'s and get ready, and then after Easter we\'d get\nmarried.[19] Do tell her, dear Theodore Ivanitch!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Go away--this is not the place.\n\n     [An elderly GENTLEMAN comes downstairs, puts on overcoat, and\n      goes out, followed by the SECOND FOOTMAN.\n\n     [Exit TANYA. Enter JACOB.\n\nJACOB. Just fancy, Theodore Ivanitch, it\'s too bad! She wants to\ndischarge me now! She says, "You break everything, and forget Frisk,\nand you let the peasants into the kitchen against my orders!" And you\nknow very well that I knew nothing about it. Tatyana told me, "Take\nthem into the kitchen"; how could I tell whose order it was?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Did the mistress speak to you?\n\nJACOB. She\'s just spoken. Do speak up for me, Theodore Ivanitch! You\nsee, my people in the country are only just getting on their feet, and\nsuppose I lose my place, when shall I get another? Theodore Ivanitch,\ndo, please!\n\n     [ANNA PAVLOVNA comes down with the old COUNTESS, whom she is\n      seeing off. The COUNTESS has false teeth and hair. The FIRST\n      FOOTMAN helps the COUNTESS into her outdoor things.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Oh, most certainly, of course! I am so deeply touched.\n\nCOUNTESS. If it were not for my illness, I should come oftener to see\nyou.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. You should really consult Peter Petrovitch. He is\nrough, but nobody can soothe one as he does. He is so clear, so\nsimple.\n\nCOUNTESS. Oh no, I shall keep to the one I am used to.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Pray, take care of yourself.\n\nCOUNTESS. Merci, mille fois merci.[20]\n\n     [GREGORY, dishevelled and excited, jumps out from the servants\'\n      quarters. SIMON appears behind him in the doorway.\n\nSIMON. You\'d better leave her alone!\n\nGREGORY. You rascal! I\'ll teach you how to fight, you scamp, you!\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. What do you mean? Do you think you are in a\npublic-house?\n\nGREGORY. This coarse peasant makes life impossible for me.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (provoked). You\'ve lost your senses. Don\'t you see? (To\nCOUNTESS.) Merci, mille fois merci. A mardi! [21]\n\n     [Exeunt COUNTESS and FIRST FOOTMAN.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (to GREGORY). What is the meaning of this?\n\nGREGORY. Though I do occupy the position of a footman, still I won\'t\nallow every peasant to hit me; I have my pride too.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Why, what has happened?\n\nGREGORY. Why, this Simon of yours has got so brave, sitting with the\ngentlemen, that he wants to fight!\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Why? What for?\n\nGREGORY. Heaven only knows!\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (to SIMON). What is the meaning of it?\n\nSIMON. Why does he bother her?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. What has happened?\n\nSIMON (smiles). Well, you see, he is always catching hold of Tanya,\nthe lady\'s-maid, and she won\'t have it. Well, so I just moved him\naside a bit, just so, with my hand.\n\nGREGORY. A nice little bit! He\'s almost caved my ribs in, and has torn\nmy dress-coat, and he says, "The same power as came over me yesterday\ncomes on me again," and he begins to squeeze me.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (to SIMON). How dare you fight in my house?\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. May I explain it to you, ma\'am? I must tell you\nSimon is not indifferent to Tanya, and is engaged to her. And Gregory\n--one must admit the truth--does not behave properly, nor honestly, to\nher. Well, so I suppose Simon got angry with him.\n\nGREGORY. Not at all! It is all his spite, because I have discovered\ntheir trickery.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. What trickery?\n\nGREGORY. Why, at the seance. All those things, last night,--it was not\nSimon but Tanya who did them! I saw her getting out from under the\nsofa with my own eyes.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. What is that? From under the sofa?\n\nGREGORY. I give you my word of honor. And it was she who threw the\npaper on the table. If it had not been for her the paper would not\nhave been signed, nor the land sold to the peasants.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. And you saw it yourself?\n\nGREGORY. With my own eyes. Shall I call her? She\'ll not deny it.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Yes, call her.\n\n     [Exit GREGORY.\n\n     [Noise behind the scenes. The voice of the DOORKEEPER, "No, no,\n      you cannot." DOORKEEPER is seen at the front door, the three\n      PEASANTS rush in past him, the SECOND PEASANT first; the THIRD\n      one stumbles, falls on his nose, and catches hold of it.\n\nDOORKEEPER. You must not go in!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Where\'s the harm? We are not doing anything wrong. We\nonly wish to pay the money!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it; as by laying on the signature the\naffair is come to a conclusion, we only wish to make payment with\nthanks.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Wait a bit with your thanks. It was all done by fraud!\nIt is not settled yet. Not sold yet.... Leonid.... Call Leonid\nFyodoritch.\n\n     [Exit DOORKEEPER.\n\n     [LEONID FYODORITCH enters, but, seeing his wife and the PEASANTS,\n      wishes to retreat.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. No, no, come here, please! I told you the land must not\nbe sold on credit, and everybody told you so, but you let yourself be\ndeceived like the veriest blockhead.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. How? I don\'t understand who is deceiving?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! You have grey\nhair, and you let yourself be deceived and laughed at like a silly\nboy. You grudge your son some three hundred roubles which his social\nposition demands, and let yourself be tricked of thousands--like a\nfool!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Now come, Annette, try to be calm.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. We are only come about the acceptation of the sum, for\nexample....\n\nTHIRD PEASANT (taking out the money). Let us finish the matter, for\nChrist\'s sake!\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Wait, wait!\n\n     [Enter TANYA and GREGORY.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (angrily). You were in the small drawing-room during the\nseance last night?\n\n     [TANYA looks around at THEODORE IVANITCH, LEONID FYODORITCH, and\n      SIMON, and sighs.\n\nGREGORY. It\'s no use beating about the bush; I saw you myself....\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Tell me, were you there? I know all about it, so you\'d\nbetter confess! I\'ll not do anything to you. I only want to expose him\n(pointing to LEONID FYODORITCH) your master.... Did you throw the\npaper on the table?\n\nTANYA. I don\'t know how to answer. Only one thing,--let me go home.\n\n     [Enter BETSY unobserved.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (to LEONID FYODORITCH). There, you see! You are being\nmade a fool of.\n\nTANYA. Let me go home, Anna Pavlovna!\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. No, my dear! You may have caused us a loss of thousands\nof roubles. Land has been sold that ought not to be sold!\n\nTANYA. Let me go, Anna Pavlovna!\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. No; you\'ll have to answer for it! Such tricks won\'t do.\nWe\'ll have you up before the Justice of the Peace!\n\nBETSY (comes forward). Let her go, mamma. Or, if you wish to have her\ntried, you must have me tried too! She and I did it together.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Well, of course, if you have a hand in anything, what\ncan one expect but the very worst results!\n\n     [Enter the PROFESSOR.\n\nPROFESSOR. How do you do, Anna Pavlovna? How do you do, Miss Betsy?\nLeonid Fyodoritch, I have brought you a report of the Thirteenth\nCongress of Spiritualists at Chicago. An amazing speech by Schmidt!\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Oh, that is interesting!\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. I will tell you something much more interesting! It\nturns out that both you and my husband were fooled by this girl! Betsy\ntakes it on herself, but that is only to annoy me. It was an\nilliterate peasant girl who fooled you, and you believed it all.\nThere were no mediumistic phenomena last night; it was she (pointing\nto TANYA) who did it!\n\nPROFESSOR (taking off his overcoat). What do you mean?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. I mean that it was she who, in the dark, played on the\nguitar and beat my husband on the head and performed all your idiotic\ntricks--and she has just confessed!\n\nPROFESSOR (smiling). What does that prove?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. It proves that your mediumism is--tomfoolery; that\'s\nwhat it proves!\n\nPROFESSOR. Because this young girl wished to deceive, we are to\nconclude that mediumism is "tomfoolery," as you are pleased to express\nit? (Smiles.) A curious conclusion! Very possibly this young girl may\nhave wished to deceive: that often occurs. She may even have done\nsomething; but then, what she did--she did. But the manifestations of\nmediumistic energy still remain manifestations of mediumistic energy!\nIt is even very probable that what this young girl did evoked (and so\nto say solicited) the manifestation of mediumistic energy,--giving it\na definite form.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Another lecture!\n\nPROFESSOR (sternly). You say, Anna Pavlovna, that this girl, and\nperhaps this dear young lady also, did something; but the light we all\nsaw, and, in the first case the fall, and in the second the rise of\ntemperature, and Grossman\'s excitement and vibration--were those\nthings also done by this girl? And these are facts, Anna Pavlovna,\nfacts! No! Anna Pavlovna, there are things which must be investigated\nand fully understood before they can be talked about, things too\nserious, too serious....\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. And the child that Marya Vasilevna distinctly saw?\nWhy, I saw it too.... That could not have been done by this girl.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. You think yourself wise, but you are--a fool.\n\nLEONID FYODORITCH. Well, I\'m going.... Alexey Vladimiritch, will you\ncome?\n\n     [Exit into his study.\n\nPROFESSOR (shrugging his shoulders, follows). Oh, how far, how far, we\nstill lag behind Western Europe!\n\n     [Enter JACOB.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (following LEONID FYODORITCH with her eyes). He has been\ntricked like a fool, and he sees nothing! (To JACOB.) What do you\nwant?\n\nJACOB. How many persons am I to lay the table for?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. For how many?... Theodore Ivanitch! Let him give up the\nsilver plate to you. Be off, at once! It is all his fault! This man\nwill bring me to my grave. Last night he nearly starved the dog that\nhad done him no harm! And, as if that were not enough, he lets the\ninfected peasants into the kitchen, and now they are here again! It is\nall his fault! Be off at once! Discharge him, discharge him! (To\nSIMON.) And you, horrid peasant, if you dare to have rows in my house\nagain, I\'ll teach you!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. All right, if he is a horrid peasant there\'s no good\nkeeping him; you\'d better discharge him too, and there\'s an end of it.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA (while listening to him looks at THIRD PEASANT). Only\nlook! Why, he has a rash on his nose--a rash! He is ill; he is a\nhotbed of infection!! Did I not give orders, yesterday, that they were\nnot to be allowed into the house, and here they are again? Drive them\nout!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Then are we not to accept their money?\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. Their money? Oh yes, take their money; but they must be\nturned out at once, especially this one! He is quite rotten!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. That\'s not just, lady. God\'s my witness, it\'s not just!\nYou\'d better ask my old woman, let\'s say, whether I am rotten! I\'m\nclear as crystal, let\'s say.\n\nANNA PAVLOVNA. He talks!... Off, off with him! It\'s all to spite\nme!... Oh, I can\'t bear it, I can\'t!... Send for the doctor!\n\n     [Runs away, sobbing. Exit also JACOB and GREGORY.\n\nTANYA (to BETSY). Miss Elizabeth, darling, what am I to do now?\n\nBETSY. Never mind, you go with them and I\'ll arrange it all.\n\n     [Exit.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, your reverence, how about the reception of the\nsum now?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Let us settle up, and go.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT (fumbling with the packet of banknotes). Had I known,\nI\'d not have come for the world. It\'s worse than a fever!\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH (to DOORKEEPER). Show them into my room. There\'s a\ncounting-board there. I\'ll receive their money. Now go.\n\nDOORKEEPER. Come along.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. And it\'s Tanya you have to thank for it. But for\nher you\'d not have had the land.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. As she made the proposal, so she put it\ninto effect.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. She\'s made men of us. Else what were we? We had so\nlittle land, no room to let a hen out, let\'s say, not to mention the\ncattle. Good-bye, dear! When you get to the village, come to us and\neat honey.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Let me get home and I\'ll start brewing the beer for\nthe wedding! You will come?\n\nTANYA. Yes, I\'ll come, I\'ll come! (Shrieks.) Simon, this is fine,\nisn\'t it?\n\n     [Exeunt PEASANTS.\n\nTHEODORE IVANITCH. Well, Tanya, when you have your house I\'ll come to\nvisit you. Will you welcome me?\n\nTANYA. Dear Theodore Ivanitch, just the same as we would our own\nfather!\n\n     [Embraces and kisses him.\n\nCURTAIN\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES FOR FRUITS OF CULTURE\n\n1.   Economical balls at which the ladies are bound to appear in\n     dresses made of cotton materials.\n\n2.   The present value of the rouble is rather over fifty cents.\n\n3.   The Gypsy choirs are very popular in Moscow.\n\n4.   BETSY. Cease! You are becoming quite unbearable!.\n\n5.   PETRISTCHEF. I have C said (ceased), B said, and D said.\n\n6.   BARONESS. But tell me, please, is he paid for this?\n\n     ANNA PAVLOVNA. I really do not know.\n\n     BARONESS. But he is a gentleman?\n\n     ANNA PAVLOVNA. Oh, yes!\n\n     BARONESS. It is almost miraculous. Isn\'t it? How does he manage\n     to find things?\n\n     ANNA PAVLOVNA. I really can\'t tell you. My husband will explain\n     it to you.... Excuse me....\n\n7.   Stunning!\n\n8.   BARONESS. Capital! Does it not cause him any pain?\n\n     LEONID FYODORITCH. Not the slightest.\n\n9.   He uses a Centigrade thermometer.\n\n10.  LEONID FYODORITCH. You bring good luck.\n\n11.  FAT LADY. But he looks quite nice.\n\n12.  To take a header.\n\n13.  Do not disappoint us.\n\n14.  BETSY. I have more than enough of your Koko.\n\n15.  YOUNG PRINCESS. He is usually so very punctual....\n\n16.  BETSY. Cease; mind the servants!\n\n17.  And that won\'t suit me at all, at all! Not at all, at all!\n\n18.  Employers have charge of the servants\' passports, and in this way\n     have a hold on them in case of misconduct.\n\n19.  It is customary for peasants to marry just after Easter, but when\n     spring has come and the field work begun, no marriages take place\n     among them till autumn. (See also THE POWER OF DARKNESS\n     footnote 2.)\n\n20.  COUNTESS. Thank you (for your hospitality), a thousand thanks\n\n21.  ANNA PAVLOVNA. Thank you (for coming to see us), a thousand\n     thanks. Till next Tuesday!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
