The children are playing croquet with their governess.\n    Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna Sar\xc3\xbdntsova, a handsome elegant woman of forty; her\n    sister, Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna K\xc3\xb3hovtseva, a stupid, determined woman of\n    forty-five; and her husband, Peter Semy\xc3\xb3novich K\xc3\xb3hovtsef, a fat\n    flabby man, dressed in a summer suit, with a pince-nez, are sitting\n    on the verandah at a table with a samov\xc3\xa1r and coffee-pot. Mary\n    Iv\xc3\xa1novna Sar\xc3\xbdntsova, Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna K\xc3\xb3hovtseva, and Peter\n    Semy\xc3\xb3novich K\xc3\xb3hovtsev are drinking coffee, and the latter is\n    smoking.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. If you were not my sister, but a stranger, and\nNicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich not your husband, but merely an acquaintance, I\nshould think all this very original, and perhaps I might even encourage\nhim, _J\'aurais trouv\xc3\xa9 tout \xc3\xa7a tr\xc3\xa8s gentil_;[1] but when I see that\n_your_ husband is playing the fool--yes, simply playing the fool--then I\ncan\'t help telling you what I think about it. And I shall tell your\nhusband, Nicholas, too. _Je lui dirai son fait, ma ch\xc3\xa8re._[2] I am not\nafraid of anyone.\n\n  [1] I should have considered it all very pretty.\n\n  [2] I will tell him the plain fact, my dear.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I don\'t feel the least bit hurt; don\'t I see it all\nmyself? but I don\'t think it so very important.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No. You don\'t think so, but I tell you that, if you\nlet it go on, you will be beggared. _Du train que cela va\xc2\xa0..._[3]\n\n  [3] At the rate things are going.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Come! Beggared indeed! Not with an income like\ntheirs.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, beggared! And please don\'t interrupt me, my\ndear! Anything a _man_ does always seems right to you!\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Oh! I don\'t know. I was saying----\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But you never do know what you are saying, because\nwhen you men begin playing the fool, _il n\'y a pas de raison que \xc3\xa7a\nfinisse_.[4] I am only saying that if I were in your place, I should not\nallow it. _J\'aurais mis bon ordre \xc3\xa0 toutes ces lubies._[5] What does it\nall mean? A husband, the head of a family, has no occupation, abandons\neverything, gives everything away, _et fait le g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9reux \xc3\xa0 droite et \xc3\xa0\ngauche_.[6] I know how it will end! _Nous en savons quelque chose._[7]\n\n  [4] There is no reason for it to stop.\n\n  [5] I should put an end to all these fads.\n\n  [6] And plays the bountiful left and right.\n\n  [7] We know something about it.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH [to Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna]. But do explain to me, Mary, what\nis this new movement? Of course I understand Liberalism, County\nCouncils, the Constitution, schools, reading-rooms, and _tout ce qui\ns\'en suit_;[8] as well as Socialism, strikes, and an eight-hour day; but\nwhat is this? Explain it to me.\n\n  [8] All the rest of it.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But he told you about it yesterday.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. I confess I did not understand. The Gospels, the\nSermon on the Mount--and that churches are unnecessary! But then how is\none to pray, and all that?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes. That is the worst of it. He would destroy\neverything, and give us nothing in its place.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. How did it begin?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. It began last year, after his sister died. He was very\nfond of her, and her death had a very great effect on him. He became\nquite morose, and was always talking about death; and then, you know, he\nfell ill himself with typhus. When he recovered, he was quite a changed\nman.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But, all the same, he came in spring to see us again\nin Moscow, and was very nice, and played bridge. _Il \xc3\xa9tait tr\xc3\xa8s gentil\net comme tout le monde._[9]\n\n  [9] He was very nice, and like everybody else.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But, all the same, he was then quite changed.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. In what way?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. He was completely indifferent to his family, and purely\nand simply had _l\'id\xc3\xa9e fixe_. He read the Gospels for days on end, and\ndid not sleep. He used to get up at night to read, made notes and\nextracts, and then began going to see bishops and hermits--consulting\nthem about religion.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And did he fast, or prepare for communion?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. From the time of our marriage--that\'s twenty years\nago--till then he had never fasted nor taken the sacrament, but at that\ntime he did once take the sacrament in a monastery, and then immediately\nafterwards decided that one should neither take communion nor go to\nchurch.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. That\'s what I say--thoroughly inconsistent!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, a month before, he would not miss a single service,\nand kept every fast-day; and then he suddenly decided that it was all\nunnecessary. What can one do with such a man?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I have spoken and will speak to him again.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Yes! But the matter is of no great importance.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No? Not to you! Because you men have no religion.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Do let me speak. I say that that is not the point.\nThe point is this: if he denies the Church, what does he want the\nGospels for?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, so that we should live according to the Gospels and\nthe Sermon on the Mount, and give everything away.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. But how is one to live if one gives everything away?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And where has he found in the Sermon on the Mount\nthat we must shake hands with footmen? It says "Blessed are the meek,"\nbut it says nothing about shaking hands!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, of course, he gets carried away, as he always used\nto. At one time it was music, then shooting, then the school. But that\ndoesn\'t make it any the easier for me!\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Why has he gone to town to-day?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. He did not tell me, but I know it is about some trees of\nours that have been felled. The peasants have been cutting trees in our\nwood.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. In the pine-tree plantation?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, they will probably be sent to prison and ordered to\npay for the trees. Their case was to be heard to-day, he told me of it,\nso I feel certain that is what he has gone about.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. He will pardon them, and to-morrow they will come to\ntake the trees in the park.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, that is what it leads to. As it is, they break our\napple-trees and tread down the green cornfields, and he forgives them\neverything.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Extraordinary!\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. That is just why I say that it must not be allowed\nto go on. Why, if it goes on like that, _tout y passera_.[10] I think it\nis your duty as a mother to _prendre tes mesures_.[11]\n\n  [10] Everything will be lost.\n\n  [11] To take measures.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What can I do?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What indeed! Stop him! Explain to him that this\ncannot go on. You have your children! What sort of an example is it for\nthem?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Of course, it is hard; but I go on bearing it, and hoping\nit will pass, like his former infatuations.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, but "_Aide toi et Dieu t\'aidera!_"[12] You must\nmake him feel that he has not only himself to think of, and that one\ncan\'t live like that.\n\n  [12] God helps those who help themselves.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. The worst of all is that he no longer troubles about the\nchildren, and I have to decide everything myself. I have an unweaned\nbaby, besides the older children: girls and boys, who have to be looked\nafter, and need guidance. And I have to do it all single-handed. He used\nto be such an affectionate and attentive father, but now he seems no\nlonger to care. Yesterday I told him that V\xc3\xa1nya is not studying\nproperly, and will not pass his exam., and he replied that it would be\nby far the best thing for him to leave school altogether.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. To go where?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Nowhere! That\'s the most terrible thing about it;\neverything we do is wrong, but he does not say what would be right.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. That\'s odd.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What is there odd about it? It is just _your_ usual\nway. Condemn everything, and do nothing yourself!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Sty\xc3\xb3pa has now finished at the University, and ought to\nchoose a career; but his father says nothing about it. He wanted to take\na post in the Civil Service, but Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich says he ought not to\ndo so. Then he thought of entering the Horse-Guards, but Nicholas\nIv\xc3\xa1novich quite disapproved. Then the lad asked his father: "What am I\nto do then--not go and plough after all?" and Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich said:\n"Why not plough? It is much better than being in a Government Office."\nSo what was he to do? He comes to me and asks, and I have to decide\neverything, and yet the authority is all in his hands.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, you should tell him so straight out.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. So I must! I shall have to talk to him.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And tell him straight out that you can\'t go on like\nthis. That you do your duty, and he must do his; or if not--let him hand\neverything over to you.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. It is all so unpleasant!\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I will tell him, if you like. _Je lui dirai son\nfait._[13]\n\n  [13] I\'ll tell him the truth.\n\n    Enter a young priest, confused and agitated. He carries a book, and\n    shakes hands all round.\n\nPRIEST. I have come to see Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich. I have, in fact, come to\nreturn a book.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. He has gone to town, but will be back soon.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What book are you returning?\n\nPRIEST. Oh, it\'s Mr. Renan\'s _Life of Jesus_.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Dear me! What books you read!\n\nPRIEST [much agitated, lights a cigarette] It was Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich\ngave it to me to read.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [contemptuously] Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich gave it you! And\ndo you agree with Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich and Mr. Renan?\n\nPRIEST. No, of course not. If I really did agree, I should not, in fact,\nbe what is called a servant of the Church.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But if you are, as it is called, a faithful servant\nof the Church, why don\'t you convert Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich?\n\nPRIEST. Everyone, in fact, has his own views on these matters, and\nNicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich really maintains much that is quite true, only he\ngoes astray, in fact, on the main point, the Church.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [contemptuously] And what are the many things that\nNicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich maintains that are quite true? Is it true that the\nSermon on the Mount bids us give our property away to strangers and let\nour own families go begging?\n\nPRIEST. The Church, in fact, sanctions the family, and the Holy Fathers\nof the Church, in fact, blessed the family; but the highest perfection\nreally demands the renunciation of worldly advantages.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Of course the Anchorites acted so, but ordinary\nmortals, I should imagine, should act in an ordinary way, as befits all\ngood Christians.\n\nPRIEST. No one can tell unto what he may be called.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And, of course, you are married?\n\nPRIEST. Oh yes.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And have you any children?\n\nPRIEST. Two.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Then why don\'t you renounce worldly advantages, and\nnot go about smoking a cigarette?\n\nPRIEST. Because of my weakness, in fact, my unworthiness.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Ah! I see that instead of bringing Nicholas\nIv\xc3\xa1novich to reason, you support him. That, I tell you straight out, is\nwrong!\n\n    Enter Nurse.\n\nNURSE. Don\'t you hear baby crying? Please come to nurse him.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I\'m coming, coming! [Rises and exit].\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I\'m dreadfully sorry for my sister. I see how she\nsuffers. Seven children, one of them unweaned, and then all these fads\nto put up with. It seems to me quite plain that he has something wrong\nhere [touching her forehead. To Priest] Now tell me, I ask you, what new\nreligion is this you have discovered?\n\nPRIEST. I don\'t understand, in fact\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Oh, please don\'t beat about the bush. You know very\nwell what I am asking you about.\n\nPRIEST. But allow me\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I ask you, what creed is it that bids us shake hands\nwith every peasant and let them cut down the trees, and give them money\nfor v\xc3\xb3dka, and abandon our own families?\n\nPRIEST. I don\'t know that\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. He says it is Christianity. You are a priest of the\nOrthodox Greek Church, and therefore you must know and must say whether\nChristianity bids us encourage robbery.\n\nPRIEST. But I\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Or else, why are you a priest, and why do you wear\nlong hair and a cassock?\n\nPRIEST. But we are not asked\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Not asked, indeed! Why, I am asking you! He told me\nyesterday that the Gospels say, "Give to him that asketh of thee." But\nthen in what sense is that meant?\n\nPRIEST. In its plain sense, I suppose.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And I think not in the plain sense; we have always\nbeen taught that everybody\'s position is appointed by God.\n\nPRIEST. Of course, but yet\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Oh, yes. It\'s just as I was told; you take his side,\nand that is wrong! I say so straight out. If some young school teacher,\nor some young lad, lickspittles to him, it\'s bad enough--but you, in\nyour position, should remember the responsibility that rests on you.\n\nPRIEST. I try to\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What sort of religion is it, when he does not go to\nchurch, and does not believe in the sacraments? And instead of bringing\nhim to his senses, you read Renan with him, and interpret the Gospels in\na way of your own.\n\nPRIEST [excitedly] I cannot answer. I am, in fact, upset, and will hold\nmy tongue.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Oh! If only I were your Bishop; I\'d teach you to\nread Renan and smoke cigarettes.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. _Mais cessez, au nom du ciel. De quel droit?_[14]\n\n  [14] But do stop, for heaven\'s sake. What right have you?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Please don\'t teach me. I am sure the Reverend Father\nis not angry with me. What if I have spoken plainly. It would have been\nworse had I bottled up my anger. Isn\'t that so?\n\nPRIEST. Forgive me if I have not expressed myself as I should.\n[Uncomfortable pause].\n\n    Enter Ly\xc3\xbaba and Lisa. Ly\xc3\xbaba, Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna\'s daughter, is a handsome\n    energetic girl of twenty. Lisa, Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna\'s daughter, is a\n    little older. Both have kerchiefs on their heads, and are carrying\n    baskets, to go gathering mushrooms. They greet Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna,\n    Peter Semy\xc3\xb3novich, and the priest.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Where is Mamma?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Just gone to the baby.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Now mind you bring back plenty of mushrooms. A little\nvillage girl brought some lovely white ones this morning. I\'d go with\nyou myself, but it\'s too hot.\n\nLISA. Do come, Papa!\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, go, for you are getting too fat.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Well, perhaps I will, but I must first fetch some\ncigarettes. [Exit].\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Where are all the young ones?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Sty\xc3\xb3pa is cycling to the station, the tutor has gone to town with\npapa. The little ones are playing croquet, and V\xc3\xa1nya is out there in the\nporch, playing with the dogs.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, has Sty\xc3\xb3pa decided on anything?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Yes. He has gone himself to hand in his application to enter the\nHorse-Guards. He was horribly rude to papa yesterday.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Of course, it\'s hard on him too.... _Il n\'y a pas de\npatience qui tienne._[15] The young man must begin to live, and he is\ntold to go and plough!\n\n  [15] There are limits to human endurance.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. That\'s not what papa told him; he said\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Never mind. Still Sty\xc3\xb3pa must begin life, and\nwhatever he proposes, it\'s all objected to. But here he is himself.\n\n    The Priest steps aside, opens a book, and begins to read. Enter\n    Sty\xc3\xb3pa cycling towards the verandah.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. _Quand on parle du soleil on en voit les\nrayons._[16] We were just talking about you. Ly\xc3\xbaba says you were rude to\nyour father.\n\n  [16] Speak of the sun and you see its rays.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Not at all. There was nothing particular. He gave me his\nopinion, and I gave him mine. It is not my fault that our views differ.\nLy\xc3\xbaba, you know, understands nothing, but must have her say about\neverything.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, and what have you decided on?\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. I don\'t know what Papa has decided. I\'m afraid he does not quite\nknow himself; but as for me, I have decided to volunteer for the\nHorse-Guards. In our house some special objection is made to every step\nthat is taken; but this is all quite simple. I have finished my studies,\nand must serve my time. To enter a line regiment and serve with tipsy\nlow-class officers would be unpleasant, and so I\'m entering the\nHorse-Guards, where I have friends.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes; but why won\'t your father agree to it?\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Papa! What is the good of talking about him? He is now possessed\nby his _id\xc3\xa9e fixe_.[17] He sees nothing but what he wants to see. He\nsays military service is the basest kind of employment, and that\ntherefore one should not serve, and so he won\'t give me any money.\n\n  [17] Fixed idea.\n\nLISA. No! Sty\xc3\xb3pa. He did not say that! You know I was present. He says\nthat if you cannot avoid serving, you should go when you are called; but\nthat to volunteer, is to choose that kind of service of your own free\nwill.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. But it\'s I, not he, who is going to serve. He himself was in the\narmy!\n\nLISA. Yes, but he does not exactly say that he will not give you the\nmoney; but that he cannot take part in an affair that is contrary to his\nconvictions.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Convictions have nothing to do with it. One must serve--and\nthat\'s all!\n\nLISA. I only say what I heard.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. I know you always agree with Papa. Do you know, Aunt, that Lisa\ntakes Papa\'s side entirely in everything?\n\nLISA. What is true\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Don\'t I know that Lisa always takes up with any kind\nof nonsense. She scents nonsense. _Elle flaire cela de loin._[18]\n\n  [18] She scents it from afar.\n\n    Enter V\xc3\xa1nya running in with a telegram in his hand, followed by the\n    dogs. He wears a red shirt.\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA [to Ly\xc3\xbaba]. Guess who is coming?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. What\'s the use of guessing? Give it here [stretching towards him.\nV\xc3\xa1nya does not let her have the telegram].\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. I\'ll not give it you, and I won\'t say who it is from. It\'s\nsomeone who makes you blush!\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Nonsense! Who is the telegram from?\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. There, you\'re blushing! Aunty, she is blushing, isn\'t she?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. What nonsense! Who is it from? Aunty, who is it from?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. The Cheremsh\xc3\xa1novs.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Ah!\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. There you are! Why are you blushing?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Let me see the telegram, Aunt. [Reads] "Arriving all three by the\nmail train. Cheremsh\xc3\xa1novs." That means the Princess, Bor\xc3\xads, and T\xc3\xb3nya.\nWell, I am glad!\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. There you are, you\'re glad! Sty\xc3\xb3pa, look how she is blushing.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. That\'s enough--teasing over and over again.\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. Of course, because you\'re sweet on T\xc3\xb3nya! You\'d better cast lots;\nfor two men must not marry one another\'s sisters.[19]\n\n  [19] In Russia the relationships that are set up by marriage debar a\n  marriage between a woman\'s brother-in-law and her sister.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Don\'t humbug! Shut up! How often have you been told to?\n\nLISA. If they are coming by the mail train, they will be here directly.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. That\'s true, so we can\'t go for mushrooms.\n\n    Enter Peter Semy\xc3\xb3novich with his cigarettes.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Uncle Peter, we are not going!\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Why not?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. The Cheremsh\xc3\xa1novs are coming directly. Better let\'s play tennis\ntill they come. Sty\xc3\xb3pa, will you play?\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. I may as well.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. V\xc3\xa1nya and I against you and Lisa. Agreed? Then I\'ll get the balls\nand call the boys. [Exit].\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. So I\'m to stay here after all!\n\nPRIEST [preparing to go]. My respects to you.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No, wait a bit, Father. I want to have a talk with\nyou. Besides, Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich will be here directly.\n\nPRIEST [sits down, and lights another cigarette]. He may be a long time.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. There, someone is coming. I expect it\'s he.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Which Cheremsh\xc3\xa1nova is it? Can it be Golitzin\'s\ndaughter?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, of course. It\'s the Cheremsh\xc3\xa1nova who lived in\nRome with her aunt.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Dear me, I shall be glad to see her. I have not met\nher since those days in Rome when she used to sing duets with me. She\nsang beautifully. She has two children, has she not?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, they are coming too.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. I did not know that they were so intimate with the\nSar\xc3\xbdntsovs.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Not intimate, but they lodged together abroad last\nyear, and I believe that _la princesse a des vues sur Ly\xc3\xbaba pour son\nfils. C\'est une fine mouche, elle flaire une jolie dot._[20]\n\n  [20] The princess has her eye on Ly\xc3\xbaba for her son. She is a knowing\n  one, and scents a nice dowry.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. But the Cheremsh\xc3\xa1novs themselves were rich.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. They _were_. The prince is still living, but he has\nsquandered everything, drinks, and has quite gone to the dogs. She\npetitioned the Emperor, left her husband, and so managed to save a few\nscraps. But she has given her children a splendid education. _Il faut\nlui rendre cette justice._[21] The daughter is an admirable musician;\nand the son has finished the University, and is charming. Only I don\'t\nthink Mary is quite pleased. Visitors are inconvenient just now. Ah!\nhere comes Nicholas.\n\n  [21] One must do her that much justice.\n\n    Enter Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. How d\'you do, Al\xc3\xadna;[22] and you, Peter Semy\xc3\xb3novich.\n[To the Priest] Ah! Vas\xc3\xadly Nikan\xc3\xb3rych. [Shakes hands with them].\n\n  [22] Al\xc3\xadna is an abbreviation, and a pet name, for Alex\xc3\xa1ndra.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. There is still some coffee left. Shall I give you a\ncup? It\'s rather cold, but can easily be warmed up. [Rings].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. No, thank you. I have had something. Where is Mary?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Feeding Baby.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Is she quite well?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Pretty well. Have you done your business?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I have. Yes. If there _is_ any tea or coffee left, I\nwill have some. [To Priest] Ah! you\'ve brought the book back. Have you\nread it? I\'ve been thinking about you all the way home.\n\n    Enter man-servant, who bows. Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich shakes hands with\n    him. Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna shrugs her shoulders, exchanging glances\n    with her husband.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Re-heat the samov\xc3\xa1r, please.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That\'s not necessary, Al\xc3\xadna. I don\'t really want\nany, and I\'ll drink it as it is.\n\n    Missy, on seeing her father, leaves her croquet, runs to him, and\n    hangs round his neck.\n\nMISSY. Papa! Come with me.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [caressing her]. Yes, I\'ll come directly. Just let me\neat something first. Go and play, and I\'ll soon come.\n\n    Exit Missy.\n\n    Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich sits down to the table, and eats and drinks\n    eagerly.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, were they sentenced?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Yes! They were. They themselves pleaded guilty. [To\nPriest] I thought you would not find Renan very convincing\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And you did not approve of the verdict?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [vexed]. Of course I don\'t approve of it. [To Priest]\nThe main question for you is not Christ\'s divinity, or the history of\nChristianity, but the Church\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Then how was it? _They_ confessed their guilt, _et\nvous leur avez donn\xc3\xa9 un d\xc3\xa9menti_?[23] They did not steal them--but only\ntook the wood?\n\n  [23] And you contradicted them.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [who had begun talking to the priest, turns\nresolutely to Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna]. Al\xc3\xadna, my dear, do not pursue me with\npinpricks and insinuations.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But not at all\xc2\xa0...\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. And if you really want to know why I can\'t prosecute\nthe peasants about the wood they needed and cut down\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I should think they also need this samov\xc3\xa1r.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, if you want me to tell you why I can\'t agree\nwith those people being shut up in prison, and being totally ruined,\nbecause they cut down ten trees in a forest which is considered to be\nmine\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Considered so by everybody.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Oh dear! Disputing again.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Even if I considered that forest mine, which I\ncannot do, we have 3000 acres of forest, with about 150 trees to the\nacre. In all, about 450,000 trees--is that correct? Well, they have cut\ndown ten trees--that is, one 45-thousandth part. Now is it worth while,\nand can one really decide, to tear a man away from his family and put\nhim in prison for that?\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Ah! but if you don\'t hold on to this one 45-thousandth, all the\nother 44,990 trees will very soon be cut down also.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. But I only said _that_ in answer to your aunt. In\nreality I have no right to this forest. Land belongs to everyone; or\nrather, it can\'t belong to anyone. We have never put any labour into\nthis land.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. No, but you saved money and preserved this forest.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. How did I get my savings? What enabled me to save\nup? And I didn\'t preserve the forest myself! However, this is a matter\nwhich can\'t be proved to anyone who does not himself feel ashamed when\nhe strikes at another man--\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. But no one is striking anybody!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Just as when a man feels no shame at taking toll\nfrom others\' labour without doing any work himself, you cannot prove to\nhim that he ought to be ashamed; and the object of all the Political\nEconomy you learnt at the University is merely to justify the false\nposition in which we live.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. On the contrary; science destroys all prejudices.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. However, all this is of no importance to me. What is\nimportant is that in Yef\xc3\xadm\'s[24] place I should have acted as he did,\nand I should have been desperate had I been imprisoned. And as I wish to\ndo to others as I wish them to do to me--I cannot condemn him, but do\nwhat I can to save him.\n\n  [24] Yef\xc3\xadm was the peasant who had cut down the tree.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. But, if one goes on that line, one cannot possess\nanything.\n\n    Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna and Sty\xc3\xb3pa--\n\n    Both speak together\n\n  { ALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Then it is much more profitable to steal than to\n  { work.\n  {\n  { STY\xc3\x93PA. You never reply to one\'s arguments. I say that a man who\n  { saves, has a right to enjoy his savings.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [smiling] I don\'t know which I am to reply to. [To\nPeter Semy\xc3\xb3novich] It\'s true. One should not possess anything.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But if one should not possess anything, one can\'t\nhave any clothes, nor even a crust of bread, but must give away\neverything, so that it\'s impossible to live.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. And it should be impossible to live as we do!\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. In other words, we must die! Therefore, that teaching is unfit\nfor life....\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. No. It is given just that men may live. Yes. One\nshould give everything away. Not only the forest we do not use and\nhardly ever see, but even our clothes and our bread.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What! And the children\'s too?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Yes, the children\'s too. And not only our bread, but\nourselves. Therein lies the whole teaching of Christ. One must strive\nwith one\'s whole strength to give oneself away.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. That means to die.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Yes, even if you gave your life for your friends,\nthat would be splendid both for you and for others. But the fact is that\nman is not solely a spirit, but a spirit within a body; and the flesh\ndraws him to live for itself, while the spirit of light draws him to\nlive for God and for others: and the life in each of us is not solely\nanimal, but is equipoised between the two. But the more it is a life for\nGod, the better; and the animal will not fail to take care of itself.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Why choose a middle course: an equipoise between the two? If it\nis right to do so--why not give away everything and die?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That would be splendid. Try to do it, and it will be\nwell both for you and for others.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No, that is not clear, not simple. _C\'est tir\xc3\xa9 par\nles cheveux._[25]\n\n  [25] It\'s too fine spun.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, I can\'t help it, and it can\'t be explained by\nargument. However, that is enough.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Yes, quite enough, and I also don\'t understand it. [Exit].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [turns to Priest] Well, what impression did the book\nmake on you?\n\nPRIEST [agitated] How shall I put it? Well, the historic part is\ninsufficiently worked out, and it is not fully convincing, or let us\nsay, quite reliable; because the materials are, as a matter of fact,\ninsufficient. Neither the Divinity of Christ, nor His lack of Divinity,\ncan be proved historically; there is but one irrefragable proof....\n\n    During this conversation first the ladies and then Peter Semy\xc3\xb3novich\n    go out.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. You mean the Church?\n\nPRIEST. Well, of course, the Church, and the evidence, let\'s say, of\nreliable men--the Saints for instance.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Of course, it would be excellent if there existed a\nset of infallible people to confide in. It would be very desirable; but\nits desirability does not prove that they exist!\n\nPRIEST. And I believe that just _that is_ the proof. The Lord could not\nin fact have exposed His law to the possibility of mutilation or\nmisinterpretation, but must in fact have left a guardian of His truth to\nprevent that truth being mutilated.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Very well; but we first tried to prove the truth\nitself, and now we are trying to prove the reliability of the guardian\nof the truth.\n\nPRIEST. Well here, as a matter of fact, we require faith.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Faith--yes, we need faith. We can\'t do without\nfaith. Not, however, faith in what other people tell us, but faith in\nwhat we arrive at ourselves, by our own thought, our own reason ...\nfaith in God, and in true and everlasting life.\n\nPRIEST. Reason may deceive. Each of us has a different mind.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [hotly] There, that is the most terrible blasphemy!\nGod has given us just one sacred tool for finding the truth--the only\nthing that can unite us all, and we do not trust it!\n\nPRIEST. How can we trust in it, when there are contradictions?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Where are the contradictions? That twice two are\nfour; and that one should not do to others what one would not like\noneself; and that everything has a cause? Truths of that kind we all\nacknowledge because they accord with all our reason. But that God\nappeared on Mount Sinai to Moses, or that Buddha flew up on a sunbeam,\nor that Mahomet went up into the sky, and that Christ flew there\nalso--on matters of that kind we are all at variance.\n\nPRIEST. No, we are not at variance, those of us who abide in the truth\nare all united in one faith in God, Christ.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. No, even there, you are not united, but have all\ngone asunder; so why should I believe you rather than I would believe a\nBuddhist Lama? Only because I happened to be born in your faith?\n\n[The tennis players dispute] "Out!" "Not out!"\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. I saw it\xc2\xa0...:\n\n    During the conversation, men-servants set the table again for tea\n    and coffee.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. You say the Church unites. But, on the contrary, the\nworst dissensions have always been caused by the Church. "How often\nwould I have gathered you as a hen gathers her chickens."\xc2\xa0...\n\nPRIEST. That was until Christ. But Christ did gather them all together.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Yes, Christ united; but we have divided: because we\nhave understood him the wrong way round. He destroyed all Churches.\n\nPRIEST. Did he not say: "Go, tell the Church."\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. It is not a question of words! Besides those words\ndon\'t refer to what we call "Church." It is the spirit of the teaching\nthat matters. Christ\'s teaching is universal, and includes all\nreligions, and does not admit of anything exclusive; neither of the\nResurrection nor the Divinity of Christ, nor the Sacraments--nor of\nanything that divides.\n\nPRIEST. That, as a matter of fact, if I may say so, is your own\ninterpretation of Christ\'s teaching. But Christ\'s teaching is all\nfounded on His Divinity and Resurrection.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That\'s what is so dreadful about the Churches. They\ndivide by declaring that they possess the full indubitable and\ninfallible truth. They say: "It has pleased us and the Holy Ghost." That\nbegan at the time of the first Council of the Apostles. They then began\nto maintain that they had the full and _exclusive_ truth. You see, if I\nsay there is a God: the first cause of the Universe, everyone can agree\nwith me; and _such_ an acknowledgment of God will unite us; but if I say\nthere is a God: Brahma, or Jehovah, or a Trinity, such a God divides us.\nMen wish to unite, and to that end devise all means of union, but\nneglect the one indubitable means of union--the search for truth! It is\nas if people in an enormous building, where the light from above shone\ndown into the centre, tried to unite in groups around lamps in different\ncorners, instead of going towards the central light, where they would\nnaturally all be united.\n\nPRIEST. And how are the people to be guided--without any really definite\ntruth?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That\'s what is terrible! Each _one_ of us has to\nsave _his own_ soul, and has to do God\'s work _himself_, but instead of\nthat we busy ourselves saving _other people_ and teaching _them_. And\nwhat do we teach them? We teach them now, at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury, that God created the world in six days, then caused a flood,\nand put all the animals in an ark, and all the rest of the horrors and\nnonsense of the Old Testament. And then that Christ ordered everyone to\nbe baptized with water; and we make them believe in all the absurdity\nand meanness of an Atonement essential to salvation; and then that he\nrose up into the heavens which do not really exist, and there sat down\nat the right hand of the Father. We have got used to all this, but\nreally it is dreadful! A child, fresh and ready to receive all that is\ngood and true, asks us what the world is, and what its laws are; and we,\ninstead of revealing to him the teaching of love and truth that has been\ngiven to us, carefully ram into his head all sorts of horrible\nabsurdities and meannesses, ascribing them all to God. Is that not\nterrible? It is as great a crime as man can commit. And we--you and your\nChurch--do this! Forgive me!\n\nPRIEST. Yes, if one looks at Christ\'s teaching from a rationalistic\npoint of view, it is so.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Whichever way one looks, it is so. [Pause].\n\n    Enter Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna. Priest bows to take his leave.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Good-bye, Father. He will lead you astray. Don\'t you\nlisten to him.\n\nPRIEST. No. Search the Scriptures! The matter is too important, as a\nmatter of fact, to be--let\'s say--neglected. [Exit].\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Really, Nicholas, you have no pity on him! Though he\nis a priest, he is still only a boy, and can have no firm convictions or\nsettled views....\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Give him time to settle down and petrify in\nfalsehood? No! Why should I? Besides, he is a good, sincere man.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But what will become of him if he believes you?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. He need not believe _me_. But if he saw the truth,\nit would be well for him and for everybody.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. If it were really so good, everyone would be ready\nto believe you. As it is, no one believes you, and your wife least of\nall. She _can\'t_ believe you.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Who told you that?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, just you try and explain it to her! She will\nnever understand, nor shall I, nor anyone else in the world, that one\nmust care for other people and abandon one\'s own children. Go and try to\nexplain that to Mary!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Yes, and Mary will certainly understand. Forgive me,\nAlex\xc3\xa1ndra, but if it were not for other people\'s influence, to which she\nis very susceptible, she would understand me and go with me.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. To beggar your children for the sake of drunken\nYef\xc3\xadm and his sort? Never! But if I have made you angry, please forgive\nme. I can\'t help speaking out.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I am not angry. On the contrary, I am even glad you\nhave spoken out and given me the opportunity--challenged me--to explain\nto Mary my whole outlook on life. On my way home to-day I was thinking\nof doing so, and I will speak to her at once; and you will see that she\nwill agree, because she is wise and good.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, as to that, allow me to have my doubts.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. But I have no doubts. For you know, this is not any\ninvention of my own; it is only what we all of us know, and what Christ\nrevealed to us.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, you think Christ revealed this, but I think he\nrevealed something else.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. It cannot be anything else.\n\n    Shouts from the tennis ground.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Out!\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. No, we saw it.\n\nLISA. I know. It fell just here!\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Out! Out! Out!\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s not true.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. For one thing, it\'s rude to say "It\'s not true."\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. And it\'s rude to say what is not true!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Just wait a bit, and don\'t argue, but listen. Isn\'t\nit true that at any moment we may die, and either cease to exist, or go\nto God who expects us to live according to His will?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, what can I do in this life other than what the\nsupreme judge in my soul, my conscience--God--requires of me? And my\nconscience--God--requires that I should regard everybody as equal, love\neverybody, serve everybody.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Your own children too?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Naturally, my own too, but obeying all that my\nconscience demands. Above all, that I should understand that my life\ndoes not belong to me--nor yours to you--but to God, who sent us into\nthe world and who requires that we should do His will. And His will\nis\xc2\xa0...\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And you think that you will persuade Mary of this?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Certainly.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And that she will give up educating the children\nproperly, and will abandon them? Never!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Not only will she understand, but you too will\nunderstand that it is the only thing to do.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Never!\n\n    Enter Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, Mary! I didn\'t wake you this morning, did I?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No, I was not asleep. And have you had a successful day?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Yes, very.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Why, your coffee is quite cold! Why do you drink it like\nthat? By the way, we must prepare for our visitors. You know the\nCheremsh\xc3\xa1novs are coming?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, if you\'re glad to have them, I shall be very\npleased.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I like her and her children, but they have chosen a\nrather inconvenient time for their visit.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [rising] Well, talk matters over with him, and I\'ll\ngo and watch the tennis.\n\n    A pause, then Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna and Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich begin both\n    talking at once.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. It\'s inconvenient, because we must have a talk.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I was just saying to Aline\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. No, you speak first.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, I wanted to have a talk with you about Sty\xc3\xb3pa.\nAfter all, something _must_ be decided. He, poor fellow, feels\ndepressed, and does not know what awaits him. He came to me, but how can\nI decide?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Why decide? He can decide for himself.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But, you know, he wants to enter the Horse-Guards as a\nvolunteer, and in order to do that he must get you to countersign his\npapers, and he must also be in a position to keep himself; and you don\'t\ngive him anything. [Gets excited].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Mary, for heaven\'s sake don\'t get excited, but\nlisten to me. I don\'t give or withhold anything. To enter military\nservice of one\'s own free will, I consider either a stupid, insensate\naction, suitable for a savage if the man does not understand the evil of\nhis action, or despicable if he does it from an interested motive....\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But nowadays everything seems savage and stupid to you.\nAfter all, he must live; you lived!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [getting irritable] I lived when I did not\nunderstand; and when nobody gave me good advice. However, it does not\ndepend on me but on him.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. How not on you? It\'s you who don\'t give him an allowance.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I can\'t give what is not mine!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Not yours? What do you mean?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. The labour of others does not belong to me. To give\nhim money, I must first take it from others. I have no right to do that,\nand I cannot do it! As long as I manage the estate I must manage it as\nmy conscience dictates; and I cannot give the fruits of the toil of the\noverworked peasants to be spent on the debaucheries of Life-Guardsmen.\nTake over my property, and then I shall not be responsible!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. You know very well that I don\'t want to take it, and\nmoreover I can\'t. I have to bring up the children, besides nursing them\nand bearing them. It is cruel!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Mary, dear one! That is not the main thing. When you\nbegan to speak I too began and wanted to talk to you quite frankly. We\nmust not go on like this. We are living together, but don\'t understand\none another. Sometimes we even seem to misunderstand one another on\npurpose.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I want to understand, but I don\'t. No, I don\'t understand\nyou. I do not know what has come to you.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well then, try and understand! This may not be a\nconvenient time, but heaven knows when we shall find a convenient time.\nUnderstand not me--but yourself: the meaning of your own life! We can\'t\ngo on living like this without knowing what we are living for.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. We have lived so, and lived very happily. [Noticing a\nlook of vexation on his face] All right, all right, I am listening.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Yes, I too lived so--that is to say, without\nthinking why I lived; but a time came when I was terror-struck. Well,\nhere we are, living on other people\'s labour--making others work for\nus--bringing children into the world and bringing them up to do the\nsame. Old age will come, and death, and I shall ask myself: "Why have I\nlived?" In order to breed more parasites like myself? And, above all, we\ndo not even enjoy this life. It is only endurable, you know, while, like\nV\xc3\xa1nya, you overflow with life\'s energy.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But everybody lives like that.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. And they are all unhappy.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Not at all.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Anyhow, I saw that I was terribly unhappy, and that\nI made you and the children unhappy, and I asked myself: "Is it\npossible that God created us for this end?" And as soon as I thought of\nit, I felt at once that he had not. I asked myself: "What, then, has God\ncreated us for?"\n\n    Enter Man-servant.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [Not listening to her husband, turns to Servant] Bring\nsome boiled cream.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. And in the Gospels I found the answer, that we\ncertainly should not live for our own sake. That revealed itself to me\nvery clearly once, when I was pondering over the parable of the\nlabourers in the vineyard. You know?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, the labourers.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That parable seemed to show me more clearly than\nanything else where my mistake had been. Like those labourers I had\nthought that the vineyard was my own, and that my life was my own, and\neverything seemed dreadful; but as soon as I had understood that my life\nis not my own, but that I am sent into the world to do the will of\nGod\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But what of it? We all know that!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, if we know it we cannot go on living as we are\ndoing, for our whole life--far from being a fulfilment of His will--is,\non the contrary, a continual transgression of it.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But how is it a transgression--when we live without doing\nharm to anyone?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. But are we doing no harm? Such an outlook on life is\njust like that of those labourers. Why we\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, I know the parable--and that he paid them all\nequally.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [after a pause] No, it\'s not that. But do, Mary,\nconsider one thing--that we have only one life, and can live it well, or\ncan waste it.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I can\'t think and argue! I don\'t sleep at night; I am\nnursing. I have to manage the whole house, and instead of helping me,\nyou say things to me that I don\'t understand.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Mary!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And now these visitors.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. No, let us come to an understanding. [Kisses her]\nShan\'t we?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, only be like you used to be.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I can\'t, but now listen.\n\n    The sound of bells and an approaching vehicle are heard.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I can\'t now--they have arrived! I must go to meet them.\n[Exit behind corner of house. Sty\xc3\xb3pa and Ly\xc3\xbaba follow her].\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. We shan\'t abandon it; we must finish the game later. Well, Ly\xc3\xbaba,\nwhat now?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA [seriously] No nonsense, please.\n\n    Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna, with her husband and Lisa, come out on to the\n    verandah. Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich paces up and down wrapt in thought.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, have you convinced her?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Al\xc3\xadna, what is going on between us is very\nimportant. Jokes are out of place. It is not I who am convincing her,\nbut life, truth, God: they are convincing her--therefore she cannot help\nbeing convinced, if not to-day then to-morrow, if not to-morrow ... It\nis awful that no one ever has time. Who is it that has just come?\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. It\'s the Cheremsh\xc3\xa1novs. Catiche Cheremsh\xc3\xa1nov, whom I\nhave not met for eighteen years. The last time I saw her we sang\ntogether: "La ci darem la mano." [Sings].\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Please don\'t interrupt us, and don\'t imagine that I\nshall quarrel with Nicholas. I am telling the truth. [To Nicholas\nIv\xc3\xa1novich] I am not joking at all, but it seemed to me strange that you\nwanted to convince Mary just when she had made up her mind to have it\nout with you!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Very well, very well. They are coming. Please tell\nMary I shall be in my room. [Exit].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    In the same country-house, a week later. The scene represents a\n    large dining-hall. The table is laid for tea and coffee, with a\n    samov\xc3\xa1r. A grand piano and a music-stand are by the wall. Mary\n    Iv\xc3\xa1novna, the Princess and Peter Semy\xc3\xb3novich are seated at the\n    table.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Ah, Princess, it does not seem so long ago since you\nwere singing Rosina\'s part, and I ... though nowadays I am not fit even\nfor a Don Basilio.\n\nPRINCESS. Our children might do the singing now, but times have changed.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. Yes, these are matter-of-fact times ... But your\ndaughter plays really seriously and well. Where are the young folk? Not\nasleep still, surely?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, they went out riding by moonlight last night, and\nreturned very late. I was nursing baby and heard them.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. And when will my better-half be back? Have you sent\nthe coachman for her?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, they went for her quite early; I expect she will be\nhere soon.\n\nPRINCESS. Did Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna really go on purpose to fetch Father\nGer\xc3\xa1sim?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, the idea occurred to her yesterday, and she was off\nat once.\n\nPRINCESS. _Quelle \xc3\xa9nergie! Je l\'admire._[26]\n\n  [26] What energy, I do admire her.\n\nPETER SEMY\xc3\x93NOVICH. _Oh, pour ceci, ce n\'est pas \xc3\xa7a qui nous manque._[27]\n[Takes out a cigar] But I will go and have a smoke and take a stroll\nthrough the park with the dogs till the young people are up. [Exit].\n\n  [27] Oh, as far as that goes, we are not lacking.\n\nPRINCESS. I don\'t know, dear Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna, whether I am right, but it\nseems to me that you take it all too much to heart. I understand him. He\nis in a very exalted state of mind. Well, even supposing he does give to\nthe poor? Don\'t we anyway think too much about ourselves?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, if that were all, but you don\'t know him; nor all he\nis after. It is not simply helping the poor, but a complete revolution,\nthe destruction of everything.\n\nPRINCESS. I do not wish to intrude into your family life, but if you\nwill allow me\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Not at all--I look upon you as one of the\nfamily--especially now.\n\nPRINCESS. I should advise you to put your demands to him openly and\nfrankly, and to come to an agreement as to the limits\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [excitedly] There are no limits! He wants to give away\neverything. He wishes me now, at my age, to become a cook and a\nwasherwoman.\n\nPRINCESS. No, is it possible! That is extraordinary.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [takes a letter out of her pocket] We are by ourselves and\nI am glad to tell you all about it. He wrote me this letter yesterday. I\nwill read it to you.\n\nPRINCESS. What? He lives in the same house with you, and writes you\nletters? How strange!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No, I understand him there. He gets so excited when he\nspeaks. I have for some time past felt anxious about his health.\n\nPRINCESS. What did he write?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. This [reading] "You reproach me for upsetting our former\nway of life, and for not giving you anything new in exchange, and not\nsaying how I should like to arrange our family affairs. When we begin to\ndiscuss it we both get excited, and that\'s why I am writing to you. I\nhave often told you already why I cannot continue to live as we have\nbeen doing; and I cannot, in a letter, show you why that is so, nor why\nwe must live in accord to Christ\'s teaching. You can do one of two\nthings: either believe in the truth and voluntarily go with me, or\nbelieve in me and trusting yourself entirely to me--follow me." [Stops\nreading] I can do neither the one nor the other. I do not consider it\nnecessary to live as he wishes us to. I have to consider the children,\nand I cannot rely on him. [Reads] "My plan is this: We shall give our\nland to the peasants, retaining only 135 acres besides the orchards and\nkitchen-garden and the meadow by the river. We will try to work\nourselves, but will not force one another, nor the children. What we\nkeep should still bring us in about \xc2\xa350 a year."\n\nPRINCESS. Live on \xc2\xa350 a year--with seven children! Is it possible!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, here follows his whole plan: to give up the house\nand have it turned into a school, and ourselves to live in the\ngardener\'s two-roomed cottage.\n\nPRINCESS. Yes, now I begin to see that there is something abnormal about\nit. What did you answer?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I told him I couldn\'t; that were I alone I would follow\nhim anywhere, but I have the children.... Only think! I am still nursing\nlittle Nicholas. I tell him we can\'t break up everything like that.\nAfter all, was that what I agreed to when I married? And now I am no\nlonger young or strong. Think what it has meant to bear and nurse nine\nchildren.\n\nPRINCESS. I never dreamed that things had gone so far.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. That is how things are and I don\'t know what will\nhappen. Yesterday he excused the Dm\xc3\xadtrovka peasants their rent; and he\nwants to give the land to them altogether.\n\nPRINCESS. I do not think you should allow it. It is your duty to protect\nyour children. If he cannot deal with the estate, let him hand it over\nto you.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But I don\'t want that.\n\nPRINCESS. You ought to take it for the children\'s sake. Let him transfer\nthe property to you.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. My sister Alex\xc3\xa1ndra told him so; but he says he has no\nright to do it; and that the land belongs to those who work it, and that\nit is his duty to give it to the peasants.\n\nPRINCESS. Yes, now I see that the matter is far more serious than I\nthought.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And the Priest! The Priest takes his side, too.\n\nPRINCESS. Yes, I noticed that yesterday.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. That\'s why my sister has gone to Moscow. She wanted to\ntalk things over with a lawyer, but chiefly she went to fetch Father\nGer\xc3\xa1sim that he may bring his influence to bear.\n\nPRINCESS. Yes, I do not think that Christianity calls upon us to ruin\nour families.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But he will not believe even Father Ger\xc3\xa1sim. He is so\nfirm; and when he talks, you know, I can\'t answer him. That\'s what is so\nterrible, that it seems to me he is right.\n\nPRINCESS. That is because you love him.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I don\'t know, but it\'s terrible, and everything remains\nunsettled--and that is Christianity!\n\n    Enter Nurse.\n\nNURSE. Will you please come. Little Nicholas has woke up and is crying\nfor you.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Directly! When I am excited he gets stomach ache. Coming,\ncoming!\n\n    Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich enters by another door, with a paper in his hand.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. No, this is impossible!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What has happened?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Why, Peter is to be imprisoned on account of some\nwretched pine-trees of ours.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. How\'s that?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Quite simply! He cut it down, and they informed the\nJustice of Peace, and he has sentenced him to three months\'\nimprisonment. His wife has come about it.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, and can\'t anything be done?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Not now. The only way is not to possess any forest.\nAnd I will not possess any. What is one to do? I shall, however, go and\nsee whether what we have done can be remedied. [Goes out on to the\nverandah and meets Bor\xc3\xads and Ly\xc3\xbaba].\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Good morning, papa [kisses him], where are you going?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I have just returned from the village and am going\nback again. They are just dragging a hungry man to prison because he\xc2\xa0...\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. I suppose it\'s Peter?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Yes, Peter. [Exit, followed by Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna].\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA [sits down in front of samov\xc3\xa1r] Will you have tea or coffee?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I don\'t mind.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. It\'s always the same, and I see no end to it!\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I don\'t understand him. I know the people are poor and ignorant\nand must be helped, but not by encouraging thieves.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. But how?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. By our whole activity. By using all our knowledge in their\nservice, but not by sacrificing one\'s own life.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. And papa says, that that is just what is wanted.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I don\'t understand. One can serve the people without ruining\none\'s own life. That is the way I want to arrange my life. If only\nyou\xc2\xa0...\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. I want what you want, and am not afraid of anything.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. How about those earrings--that dress\xc2\xa0...\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. The earrings can be sold and the dresses must be different, but\none need not make oneself quite a guy.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I should like to have another talk with him. Do you think I\nshould disturb him if I followed him to the village?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Not at all. I see he has grown fond of you, and he addressed\nhimself chiefly to you last night.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS [finishes his coffee] Well, I\'ll go then.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Yes, do, and I\'ll go and wake Lisa and T\xc3\xb3nya.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    Village street. Iv\xc3\xa1n Zy\xc3\xa1brev, covered with a sheepskin coat, is\n    lying near a hut.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV. Mal\xc3\xa1shka!\n\n    A tiny girl comes out of the hut with a baby in her arms. The baby\n    is crying.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV. Get me a drink of water.\n\n    Mal\xc3\xa1shka goes back into the hut, from where the baby can be heard\n    screaming. She brings a bowl of water.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV. Why do you always beat the youngster and make him howl?\nI\'ll tell mother.\n\nMAL\xc3\x81SHKA. Tell her then. It\'s hunger makes him howl!\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV [drinks] You should go and ask the D\xc3\xa9mkins for some milk.\n\nMAL\xc3\x81SHKA. I went, but there wasn\'t any. And there was no one at home.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV. Oh! if only I could die! Have they rung for dinner?\n\nMAL\xc3\x81SHKA. They have. Here\'s the master coming.\n\n    Enter Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Why have you come out here?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV. Too many flies in there, and it\'s too hot.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Then you\'re warm now?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV. Yes, now I\'m burning all over.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. And where is Peter? Is he at home?\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV. At home, at this time? Why, he\'s gone to the field to cart\nthe corn.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. And I hear that they want to put him in prison.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV. That\'s so, the Policeman has gone to the field for him.\n\n    Enter a pregnant Woman, carrying a sheaf of oats and a rake. She\n    immediately hits Mal\xc3\xa1shka on the back of the head.\n\nWOMAN. What d\'you mean by leaving the baby? Don\'t you hear him howling!\nRunning about the streets is all _you_ know.\n\nMAL\xc3\x81SHKA [howling] I\'ve only just come out. Daddy wanted a drink.\n\nWOMAN. I\'ll give it you. [She sees the land-owner, N. I. Sar\xc3\xbdntsov]\nGood-day, sir. Children are a trouble! I\'m quite done up, everything on\nmy shoulders, and now they\'re taking our only worker to prison, and this\nlout is sprawling about here.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. What are you saying? He\'s quite ill!\n\nWOMAN. He\'s ill, and what about me? Am I not ill? When it\'s work, he\'s\nill; but to merry-make or pull my hair out, he\'s not too ill. Let him\ndie like a hound! What do I care?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. How can you say such wicked things?\n\nWOMAN. I know it\'s a sin; but I can\'t subdue my heart. I\'m expecting\nanother child, and I have to work for two. Other people have their\nharvest in already, and we have not mowed a quarter of our oats yet. I\nought to finish binding the sheaves, but can\'t. I had to come and see\nwhat the children were about.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. The oats shall be cut--I\'ll hire someone, and to\nbind the sheaves too.\n\nWOMAN. Oh, binding\'s nothing. I can do that myself, if it\'s only mown\ndown quick. What d\'you think, Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich, will he die? He is\nvery ill!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I don\'t know. But he really is very ill. I think we\nmust send him to the hospital.\n\nWOMAN. Oh God! [Begins to cry] Don\'t take him away, let him die\nhere.[28] [To her husband, who utters something] What\'s the matter?\n\n  [28] The woman, for all her roughness, is sorry to part from her\n  husband.\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV. I want to go to the hospital. Here I\'m treated worse than\na dog.\n\nWOMAN. Well, I don\'t know. I\'ve lost my head. Mal\xc3\xa1shka, get dinner\nready.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. What have you for dinner?\n\nWOMAN. What? Why, potatoes and bread, and not enough of that. [Enters\nhut. A pig squeals, and children are crying inside].\n\nIV\xc3\x81N ZY\xc3\x81BREV [groans] Oh Lord, if I could but die!\n\n    Enter Bor\xc3\xads.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Can I be of any use?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Here no one can be of use to another. The evil is\ntoo deeply rooted. Here we can only be of use to ourselves, by seeing on\nwhat we build our happiness. Here is a family: five children, the wife\npregnant, the husband ill, nothing but potatoes to eat, and at this\nmoment the question is being decided whether they are to have enough to\neat next year or not. Help is not possible. How can one help? Suppose I\nhire a labourer; who will he be? Just such another man: one who has\ngiven up his farming, from drink or from want.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Excuse me, but if so, what are you doing here?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I am learning my own position. Finding out who weeds\nour gardens, builds our houses, makes our garments, and feeds and\nclothes us. [Peasants with scythes and women with rakes pass by and bow.\nNicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich, stopping one of the Peasants] Erm\xc3\xadl, won\'t you take\non the job of carting for these people?\n\nERM\xc3\x8dL [shakes his head] I would with all my heart, but I can\'t possibly\ndo it. I haven\'t carted my own yet. We are off now to do some carting.\nBut is Iv\xc3\xa1n dying?\n\nANOTHER PEASANT. Here\'s Sebastian, he may take on the job. I say, Daddy\nSebastian! They want a man to get the oats in.\n\nSEBASTIAN. Take the job on yourself. At this time of year one day\'s work\nbrings a year\'s food. [The Peasants pass on].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. They are all half-starved; they have only bread and\nwater, they are ill, and many of them are old. That old man, for\ninstance, is ruptured and is suffering, and yet he works from four in\nthe morning to ten at night, though he is only half alive. And we? Is it\npossible, realising all this, to live quietly and consider oneself a\nChristian? Or let alone a Christian--simply not a beast?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. But what can one do?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Not take part in this evil. Not own the land, nor\ndevour the fruits of their labour. How this can be arranged, I don\'t yet\nknow. The fact of the matter is--at any rate it was so with me--I lived\nand did not realise how I was living. I did not realise that I am a son\nof God and that we are all sons of God--and all brothers. But as soon as\nI realised it--realised that we have all an equal right to live--my\nwhole life was turned upside down. But I cannot explain it to you now. I\nwill only tell you this: I was blind, just as my people at home are, but\nnow my eyes are opened and I cannot help seeing; and seeing it all, I\ncan\'t continue to live in such a way. However, that will keep till\nlater. Now we must see what can be done.\n\n    Enter Policeman, Peter, his wife, and boy.\n\nPETER [falls at Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich\'s feet] Forgive me, for the Lord\'s\nsake, or I\'m ruined. How can the woman get in the harvest? If at least I\nmight be bailed out.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I will go and write a petition for you. [To\nPoliceman] Can\'t you let him remain here for the present?\n\nPOLICEMAN. Our orders are to take him to the police-station now.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [to Peter] Well then go, and I\'ll do what I can. This\nis evidently my doing. How can one go on living like this? [Exit].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 3\n\n    In the same country-house. It is raining outside. A drawing-room\n    with a grand piano. T\xc3\xb3nya has just finished playing a sonata of\n    Schumann\'s and is sitting at the piano. Sty\xc3\xb3pa is standing by the\n    piano. Bor\xc3\xads is sitting. Ly\xc3\xbaba, Lisa, Mitrof\xc3\xa1n Erm\xc3\xadlych and the\n    young Priest are all stirred by the music.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. That andante! Isn\'t it lovely!\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. No, the scherzo. Though really the whole of it is beautiful.\n\nLISA. Very fine.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. But I had no idea you were such an artist. It is real masterly\nplay. Evidently the difficulties no longer exist for you, and you think\nonly of the feeling, and express it with wonderful delicacy.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Yes, and with dignity.\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. While _I_ felt that it was not at all what I meant it to be. A\ngreat deal remained unexpressed.\n\nLISA. What could be better? It was wonderful.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Schumann is good, but all the same Chopin takes a stronger hold\nof one\'s heart.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. He is more lyrical.\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. There is no comparison.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Do you remember his prelude?\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. Oh, the one called the George Sand prelude? [Plays the\ncommencement].\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. No, not that one. That is very fine, but so hackneyed. Do play\nthis one. [T\xc3\xb3nya plays what she can of it, and then breaks off].\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. Oh, that is a lovely thing. There is something elemental about\nit--older than creation.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA [laughs] Yes, yes. Do play it. But no, you are too tired. As it\nis, we have had a delightful morning, thanks to you.\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA [rises and looks out of window] There are some more peasants\nwaiting outside.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. That is why music is so precious. I understand Saul. Though I\'m\nnot tormented by devils, I still understand him. No other art can make\none so forget everything else as music does. [Approaches the window. To\nPeasants] Whom do you want?\n\nPEASANTS. We have been sent to speak to Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. He is not in. You must wait.\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. And yet you are marrying Bor\xc3\xads who understands nothing about\nmusic.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Oh, surely not.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS [absently] Music? Oh no. I like music, or rather I don\'t dislike\nit. Only I prefer something simpler--I like songs.\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. But is not this sonata lovely?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. The chief thing is, that it is not important; and it rather hurts\nme, when I think of the lives men live, that so much importance is\nattached to music.\n\n    They all eat sweetmeats, which are standing on the table.\n\nLISA. How nice it is to have a fianc\xc3\xa9 here and sweetmeats provided!\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Oh that is not my doing. It\'s mamma\'s.\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. And quite right too.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Music is precious because it seizes us, takes possession of us,\nand carries us away from reality. Everything seemed gloomy till you\nsuddenly began to play, and really it has made everything brighter.\n\nLISA. And Chopin\'s valses. They are hackneyed, but all the same\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. This\xc2\xa0... [plays].\n\n    Enter Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich. He greets Bor\xc3\xads, T\xc3\xb3nya, Sty\xc3\xb3pa, Lisa,\n    Mitrof\xc3\xa1n Erm\xc3\xadlych and the Priest.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Where\'s mamma?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. I think she\'s in the nursery.\n\n    Sty\xc3\xb3pa calls the Man-servant.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Papa, how wonderfully T\xc3\xb3nya plays! And where have you been?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. In the village.\n\n    Enter servant, Afan\xc3\xa1sy.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Bring another samov\xc3\xa1r.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [greets the Man-servant, and shakes hands with\nhim[29]] Good-day. [Servant becomes confused. Exit Servant. Nicholas\nIv\xc3\xa1novich also goes off].\n\n  [29] People shake hands much more often in Russia than in England, but\n  it is quite unusual to shake hands with a servant, and Nicholas\n  Iv\xc3\xa1novich does it in consequence of his belief that all men are\n  brothers.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Poor Afan\xc3\xa1sy! He was terribly confused. I can\'t understand papa.\nIt is as if we were guilty of something.\n\n    Enter Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I was going back to my room without having told you\nwhat I feel. [To T\xc3\xb3nya] If what I say should offend you--who are our\nguest--forgive me, but I cannot help saying it. You, Lisa, say that\nT\xc3\xb3nya plays well. All you here, seven or eight healthy young men and\nwomen, have slept till ten o\'clock, have eaten and drunk and are still\neating; and you play and discuss music: while there, where I have just\nbeen, they were all up at three in the morning, and those who pastured\nthe horses at night have not slept at all; and old and young, the sick\nand the weak, children and nursing-mothers and pregnant women are\nworking to the utmost limits of their strength, so that we here may\nconsume the fruits of their labour. Nor is that all. At this very\nmoment, one of them, the only breadwinner of a family, is being dragged\nto prison because he has cut down one of a hundred thousand pine-trees\nthat grow in the forest that is called _mine_. And we here, washed and\nclothed, having left the slops in our bedrooms to be cleaned up by\nslaves, eat and drink and discuss Schumann and Chopin and which of them\nmoves us most or best cures our ennui? That is what I was thinking when\nI passed you, so I have spoken. Consider, is it possible to go on living\nin this way? [Stands greatly agitated].\n\nLISA. True, quite true!\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. If one lets oneself think about it, one can\'t live.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Why? I don\'t see why the fact that people are poor should\nprevent one talking about Schumann. The one does not exclude the other.\nIf one\xc2\xa0...\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [angrily] If one has no heart, if one is made of\nwood\xc2\xa0...\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Well, I\'ll hold my tongue.\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. It is a terrible problem; it is the problem of our day; and we\nshould not be afraid of it, but look it straight in the face, in order\nto solve it.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. We cannot wait for the problem to be solved by\npublic measures. Every one of us must die--if not to-day, then\nto-morrow. How can I live without suffering from this internal discord?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Of course there is only one way; that is, not to take part in it\nat all.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, forgive me if I have hurt you. I could not\nhelp saying what I felt. [Exit].\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Not take part in it? But our whole life is bound up with it.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. That is why he says that the first step is to possess no\nproperty; to change our whole way of life and live so as not to be\nserved by others but to serve others.\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. Well, I see _you_ have quite gone over to Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich\'s\nside.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Yes, I now understand it for the first time--after what I saw in\nthe village.... You need only take off the spectacles through which we\nare accustomed to look at the life of the people, to realise at once the\nconnection between their sufferings and our pleasures--that is enough!\n\nMITROF\xc3\x81N ERM\xc3\x8dLYCH. Yes, but the remedy does not consist in ruining one\'s\nown life.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. It is surprising how Mitrof\xc3\xa1n Erm\xc3\xadlych and I, though we usually\nstand poles asunder, come to the same conclusion: those are my very\nwords, "not ruin one\'s own life."\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Naturally! You both of you wish to lead a pleasant life, and\ntherefore want life arranged so as to ensure that pleasant life for you.\n[To Sty\xc3\xb3pa] You wish to maintain the present system, while Mitrof\xc3\xa1n\nErm\xc3\xadlych wants to establish a new one.\n\n    Ly\xc3\xbaba and T\xc3\xb3nya whisper together. T\xc3\xb3nya goes to the piano and plays\n    a nocturne by Chopin. General silence.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. That\'s splendid; that solves everything.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. It obscures and postpones everything!\n\n    While T\xc3\xb3nya is playing, Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna and the Princess enter quietly\n    and sit down to listen.\n\n    Before the end of the nocturne carriage bells are heard outside.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. It is Aunt. [Goes to meet her].\n\n    The music continues. Enter Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna, Father Ger\xc3\xa1sim (a\n    priest with a cross round his neck) and a Notary. All rise.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Please go on, it is very pleasant.\n\n    The Princess approaches to receive his blessing, and the young\n    Priest does the same.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I have done exactly what I said I would do. I found\nFather Ger\xc3\xa1sim, and you see I have persuaded him to come--he was on his\nway to Koursk--so I have done my part; and here is the Notary. He has\ngot the deed ready; it only needs signing.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Won\'t you have some lunch?\n\n    Notary puts down his papers on the table, and exit.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I am very grateful to Father Ger\xc3\xa1sim.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. What else could I do--though it was out of my way--yet\nas a Christian I considered it my duty to visit him.\n\n    Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna whispers to the young people. They consult\n    together and go out on to the verandah, all except Bor\xc3\xads. The young\n    Priest also wants to go.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM.[30] No. You as a pastor and spiritual father must remain\nhere! You may benefit by it yourself, and may be of use to others. Stay\nhere, if Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna has no objection.\n\n  [30] Father Ger\xc3\xa1sim is modelled on the lines of the celebrated Father\n  John of Cronstadt.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No, I am as fond of Father Vas\xc3\xadly as if he were one of\nthe family. I have even consulted him; but being so young he has not\nmuch authority.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Naturally, naturally.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [approaching] Well, you see now, Father Ger\xc3\xa1sim, that\nyou are the only person who can help and can bring him to reason. He is\na clever, well-read man, but learning, you know, can only do harm. He is\nsuffering from some sort of delusion. He maintains that the Christian\nlaw forbids a man to own any property; but how is that possible?\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Temptation, spiritual pride, self-will! The Fathers of\nthe Church have answered the question satisfactorily. But how did this\nbefall him?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, to tell you everything ... when we married he was\nquite indifferent to religion, and we lived so, and lived happily,\nduring our best years--the first twenty years. Then he began to reflect.\nPerhaps he was influenced by his sister, or by what he read. Anyhow, he\nbegan thinking and reading the Gospels, and then suddenly he grew\nextremely religious, began going to church and visiting the monks. Then\nall at once he gave all this up and changed his way of life completely.\nHe began doing manual labour, would not let the servants wait on him,\nand above all he is now giving away his property. He yesterday gave away\na forest--both the trees and land. It frightens me, for I have seven\nchildren. Do talk to him. I\'ll go and ask him whether he will see you.\n[Exit].\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Nowadays many are falling away. And is the estate his or\nhis wife\'s?\n\nPRINCESS. His! That\'s what is so unfortunate.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. And what is his official rank?\n\nPRINCESS. His rank is not high. Only that of a cavalry captain, I\nbelieve. He was once in the army.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. There are many who turn aside in that way. In Odessa\nthere was a lady who was carried away by Spiritualism and began to do\nmuch harm. But all the same, God enabled us to lead her back to the\nChurch.\n\nPRINCESS. The chief thing, please understand, is that my son is about to\nmarry his daughter. I have given my consent, but the girl is used to\nluxury and should therefore be provided for, and not have to depend\nentirely on my son. Though I admit he is a hard-working and an\nexceptional young man.\n\n    Enter Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna and Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. How d\'you do, Princess? How d\'you do? [To Father\nGer\xc3\xa1sim] I beg your pardon. I don\'t know your name.[31]\n\n  [31] He knows that the priest is Father Ger\xc3\xa1sim, but wishes to address\n  him not as a priest, but by his Christian name and patronymic, as one\n  gentleman would usually address another.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Do you not wish to receive my blessing?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. No, I don\'t.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. My name is Ger\xc3\xa1sim S\xc3\xa9dorovitch. Very pleased to meet\nyou.\n\n    Men-servants bring lunch and wine.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Pleasant weather, and good for the harvest.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I suppose you came, at Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna\'s\ninvitation, to divert me from my errors and direct me in the path of\ntruth. If that is so, don\'t let us beat about the bush, but let us get\nto business at once. I do not deny that I disagree with the teaching of\nthe Church. I used to agree with it, and then left off doing so. But\nwith my whole heart I wish to be in the truth and will at once accept it\nif you show it to me.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. How is it you say you don\'t believe the teaching of the\nChurch? What is there to believe in, if not the Church?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. God and His law, given to us in the Gospels.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. The Church teaches that very law.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. If it did so, I should believe in the Church, but\nunfortunately it teaches the contrary.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. The Church cannot teach the contrary, because it was\nestablished by the Lord himself. It is written, "I give you power," and,\n"Upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not\nprevail against it."\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That was not said in this connection at all, and\nproves nothing. But even if we were to admit that Christ established the\nChurch, how do I know that it was _your_ Church?\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Because it is said, "Where two or three are gathered\ntogether in my name, there am I in the midst of them."\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That, too, was not said in this connection, and\nproves nothing.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. How _can_ one deny the Church? It alone provides\nsalvation.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I did not deny the Church until I found it supported\neverything that is contrary to Christianity.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. It can make no mistakes, for it alone has the truth.\nThose who leave it go astray, but the Church is sacred.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I have already told you that I do not accept that. I\ndo not accept it because, as is said in the Gospels, "By their deeds\nshall ye know them, by their fruit shall ye know them." I have found out\nthat the Church blesses oaths, murders and executions.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. The Church acknowledges and sanctifies the Powers\nordained by God.\n\n    During the conversation, Sty\xc3\xb3pa, Ly\xc3\xbaba, Lisa and T\xc3\xb3nya at different\n    times enter the room and sit or stand listening.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I know that the Gospels say, not only "Do not kill,"\nbut "Do not be angry," yet the Church blesses the army. The Gospel\nsays, "Swear not at all," yet the Church administers oaths. The Gospel\nsays\xc2\xa0...\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Excuse me. When Pilate[32] said, "I adjure thee by the\nliving God," Christ accepted his oath by replying "I am."\n\n  [32] Father Ger\xc3\xa1sim attributes to Pilate what was said by Caiaphas the\n  high priest.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Dear me! What are you saying? That is really absurd.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. That is why the Church does not permit everyone to\ninterpret the Gospel, lest he should go astray, but like a mother caring\nfor her child gives him an interpretation suitable to his strength. No,\nlet me finish! The Church does not lay on its children burdens too heavy\nfor them to bear, but demands that they should keep the Commandments:\nlove, do no murder, do not steal, do not commit adultery.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Yes! Do not kill me, do not steal from me my stolen\ngoods. We have all robbed the people, we have stolen their land and have\nthen made a law forbidding them to steal it back; and the Church\nsanctions all these things.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Heresy and spiritual pride are speaking through you. You\nought to conquer your intellectual pride.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. It is not pride. I am only asking you what should I\ndo according to Christ\'s law, when I have become conscious of the sin of\nrobbing the people and enslaving them by means of the land. How am I to\nact? Continue to own land and to profit by the labour of starving men:\nputting them to this kind of work [points to Servant who is bringing in\nthe lunch and some wine], or am I to return the land to those from whom\nmy ancestors stole it?\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. You must act as behoves a son of the Church. You have a\nfamily and children, and you must keep and educate them in a way\nsuitable to their position.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Why?\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Because God has placed you in that position. If you wish\nto be charitable, be charitable by giving away part of your property and\nby visiting the poor.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. But how is it that the rich young man was told that\nthe rich cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven?\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. It is said, "If thou wouldest be perfect."\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. But I _do_ wish to be perfect. The Gospels say, "Be\nye perfect as your Father in Heaven\xc2\xa0..."\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. But we have to understand in what connection a thing is\nsaid.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I do try to understand, and all that is said in the\nSermon on the Mount is plain and comprehensible.\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Spiritual pride.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Where is the pride, since it is said that what is\nhidden from the wise is revealed to babes?\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. Revealed to the meek, but not to the proud.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. But who is proud? I, who consider myself a man like\nthe rest of mankind, and one who therefore must live like the rest by\nhis own labour and as poorly as his brother men, or those who consider\nthemselves to be specially selected sacred people, knowing the whole\ntruth and incapable of error; and who interpret Christ\'s words their own\nway?\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM [offended] Pardon me, Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich, I did not come\nhere to argue which of us is right, nor to receive an admonition, but I\ncalled, at Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna\'s request, to talk things over with you.\nBut since you know everything better than I do, we had better end our\nconversation. Only, once again, I must entreat you in God\'s name to come\nto your senses. You have gone cruelly astray and are ruining yourself.\n[Rises].\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Won\'t you have something to eat?\n\nFATHER GER\xc3\x81SIM. No, I thank you. [Exit with Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna].\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [to young Priest] And what now?\n\nPRIEST. Well, in my opinion, Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich spoke the truth, and\nFather Ger\xc3\xa1sim produced no argument on his side.\n\nPRINCESS. He was not allowed to speak, and he did not like having a kind\nof debate with everybody listening. It was his modesty that made him\nwithdraw.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. It wasn\'t modesty at all. All he said was so false. It was\nevident that he had nothing to say.\n\nPRINCESS. Yes, with your usual instability I see that you are beginning\nto agree with Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich about everything. If you believe such\nthings you ought not to marry.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I only say that truth is truth, and I can\'t help saying it.\n\nPRINCESS. You of all people should not talk like that.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Why not?\n\nPRINCESS. Because you are poor, and have nothing to give away. However,\nall this is not our business. [Exit, followed by all except Nicholas\nIv\xc3\xa1novich and Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [sits pondering, then smiles at his own thoughts]\nMary! What is all this for? Why did you invite that wretched, erring\nman? Why do those noisy women and that priest come into our most\nintimate life? Can we not settle our own affairs?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What am I to do, if you want to leave the children\npenniless? That is what I cannot quietly submit to. You know that I am\nnot grasping, and that I want nothing for myself.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I know, I know and believe it. But the misfortune is\nthat you do not trust the truth. I know you see it, but you can\'t make\nup your mind to rely on it. You rely neither on the truth nor on me. Yet\nyou trust the crowd--the Princess and the rest of them.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I believe in you, I always did; but when you want to let\nthe children go begging\xc2\xa0...\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That means that you do not rely on me. Do you think\nI have not struggled and have not feared! But afterwards I became\nconvinced that this course is not only possible but obligatory, and that\nit is the one thing necessary and good for the children themselves. You\nalways say that were it not for the children you would follow me, but I\nsay that if we had no children we might live as we are doing; we should\nthen only be injuring ourselves, but now we are injuring them too.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But what am I to do, if I don\'t understand?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. And what am I to do? Don\'t I know why that wretched\nman--dressed up in his cassock and wearing that cross--was sent for, and\nwhy Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna brought the Notary? You want me to hand the\nestate over to you, but I can\'t. You know that I have loved you all the\ntwenty years we have lived together. I love you and wish you well, and\ntherefore cannot sign away the estate to you. If I sign it away at all,\nit can only be to give it back to those from whom it has been taken--the\npeasants. And I can\'t let things remain as they are, but must give it to\nthem. I\'m glad the Notary has come; and I will do it.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No, that is dreadful! Why this cruelty? Though you think\nit a sin, still give it to me. [Weeps].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. You don\'t know what you are saying. If I give it to\nyou, I cannot go on living with you; I shall have to go away. I cannot\ncontinue to live under these conditions. I shall not be able to look on\nwhile the life-blood is squeezed out of the peasants and they are\nimprisoned, in your name if not in mine. So choose!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. How cruel you are! Is this Christianity? It is harshness!\nI cannot, after all, live as you want me to. I cannot rob my own\nchildren and give everything away to other people; and that is why you\nwant to desert me. Well--do so! I see you have ceased loving me, and I\neven know why.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Very well then--I will sign; but, Mary, you demand\nthe impossible of me. [Goes to writing-table and signs] You wished it,\nbut I shall not be able to go on living like this.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    The scene is laid in Moscow. A large room. In it a carpenter\'s\n    bench; a table with papers on it; a book-cupboard; a looking-glass\n    and pictures on the wall behind, with some planks leaning in front\n    of them. A Carpenter and Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich wearing a carpenter\'s\n    apron are working at the bench, planing.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [takes a board from the vice] Is that all right?\n\nCARPENTER [setting a plane] Not quite, you must do it more boldly--like\nthis.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. It is easy to say boldly, but I can\'t manage it.\n\nCARPENTER. But why should your honour trouble to learn to be a\ncarpenter? There are such a lot of us nowadays that we can hardly get a\nliving as it is.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [at work again] I\'m ashamed to lead an idle life.\n\nCARPENTER. Yours is that kind of position. God has given you property.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That\'s just where it is. I don\'t believe that God\ngave it, but that some of us have taken it, and taken it from our\nbrother men.\n\nCARPENTER [taken aback] That\'s so! But still you\'ve no need to do this.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I understand that it must seem strange to you that\nwhile living in this house where there is such superfluity, I should\nwish to earn something.\n\nCARPENTER [laughs] No. Everybody knows that gentlefolk want to master\neverything. Well, now go over it again with the smoothing plane.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. You won\'t believe me and will laugh, but still I\nmust tell you that formerly I was not ashamed to live in this way, but\nnow that I believe in Christ\'s law, which tells us we are all\nbrothers--I am ashamed to live so.\n\nCARPENTER. If you are ashamed of it, give away your property.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I wanted to, but failed, and gave it to my wife.\n\nCARPENTER. But after all it would not be possible for you to do it--you\nare too used to comforts.\n\n[Voice outside the door] Papa, may I come in?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. You may, you always may.\n\n    Enter Ly\xc3\xbaba.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Good-day, Jacob!\n\nCARPENTER. Good-day, Miss!\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Bor\xc3\xads has gone to his regiment. I am afraid of what he may do or\nsay there. What do you think?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. What can I think? He will do what is natural to him.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. It is awful. He has such a short time to serve[33] and may go and\nruin his whole life.\n\n  [33] The period of compulsory service for a University graduate would\n  be short in any case.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. He did well not to come to see me. He understands\nthat I can\'t say anything to him but what he knows himself. He told me\nthat he handed in his resignation because he sees that not only is there\nno more immoral, lawless, cruel and brutal occupation than this one, the\nobject of which is to kill, but also that there is nothing more\ndegrading and mean than to have to submit implicitly to any man of\nhigher rank who happens to come along. He knows all that.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. That\'s just why I am afraid. He knows that, and may want to take\nsome action.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. His conscience--the God that dwells within him--will\ndecide that. Had he come to me I should have given him only one piece of\nadvice: not to do anything in which he is guided by his reason\nalone--nothing is worse than that--but only to act when his whole being\ndemands it. Now I, for instance, wished to act according to Christ\'s\ninjunction: to leave father, wife and children and to follow Him, and I\nleft home, but how did it end? It ended by my coming back and living\nwith you in luxury in town. Because I was trying to do more than I had\nstrength for, I have landed myself in this degrading and senseless\nposition: I wish to live simply and to work with my hands, but in these\nsurroundings, with lackeys and porters, it seems a kind of affectation.\nI see that, even now, Jacob Nikon\xc3\xb3rych is laughing at me.\n\nCARPENTER. Why should I laugh? You pay me, and give me my tea. I am\ngrateful to you.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. I wonder if I had not better go to him.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. My dear, my darling, I know you find it hard and are\nfrightened, though you should not be so. After all, I am a man who\nunderstands life. Nothing evil can happen. All that appears evil really\nmakes one\'s heart more joyful; only understand that a man who has\nstarted on that path will have to choose, and it sometimes happens that\nGod\'s side and the Devil\'s weigh so equally that the scales oscillate,\nand it is then that the great choice has to be made. At that point any\ninterference from outside is terribly dangerous and tormenting. It is as\nthough a man were making such terrible efforts to draw a weight over a\nridge that the slightest touch would cause him to break his back.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Why should he suffer so?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That is as though a mother were to ask why she\nshould suffer. There can be no childbirth without suffering, and it is\nthe same in spiritual life. One thing I can tell you. Bor\xc3\xads is a true\nChristian, and consequently is free, and if you cannot as yet be like\nhim, or believe in God as he does, then believe in God through him.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [behind door] May I come in?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. You may always come in. What a reception I\'m having\nhere to-day.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Our priest, Vas\xc3\xadly Nikon\xc3\xb3rovich, has come. He is going to\nthe Bishop, and has resigned his living!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Impossible!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. He is here! Ly\xc3\xbaba, go and call him! He wants to see you.\n[Exit Ly\xc3\xbaba]. I had another reason for coming. I want to speak to you\nabout V\xc3\xa1nya. He behaves abominably, and does his lesson so badly that he\ncan\'t possibly pass; and when I speak to him he is rude.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Mary, you know I am out of sympathy with the whole\nmanner of life you are all leading, and with the education you are\ngiving to the children. It is a terrible question for me, whether I have\na right to see them perishing before my very eyes\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Then you should suggest something else, something\ndefinite. But what do you offer?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I cannot say what. But can only say that first we\nshould get rid of all this depraving luxury.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. So that they should become peasants! I cannot agree to\nthat.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Then don\'t consult me. The things that grieve you\nare natural and inevitable.\n\n    Enter Priest and Ly\xc3\xbaba. The Priest and Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich kiss[34]\n    one another.\n\n  [34] It is not unusual among Russians for men-friends to kiss one\n  another; but it is quite unusual for a man of position to kiss a\n  village priest who calls as a visitor--and it indicates great intimacy\n  or great emotion.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Is it possible that you have thrown it all up?\n\nPRIEST. I could stand it no longer.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I did not expect it so soon.\n\nPRIEST. But it was really impossible. In our calling we cannot be\nindifferent. We have to hear confessions, and to administer the\nSacrament, and when once one has become convinced that it is all not\ntrue\xc2\xa0...\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, and what now?\n\nPRIEST. Now I am going to the Bishop to be questioned. I am afraid he\nwill exile me to the Solov\xc3\xa9tsk Monastery. At one time I thought of\nasking you to help me to escape abroad, but then I considered that it\nwould seem cowardly. Only, there is my wife!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Where is she?\n\nPRIEST. She has gone to her father\'s. My mother-in-law came and took our\nboy away. That hurt me very much. I should much like ... [pauses,\nrestraining his tears].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, may God help you! Are you staying with us?\n\nPRINCESS [running into the room] There now, it has happened. He has\nrefused to serve, and has been put under arrest. I have just been there\nbut was not admitted. Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich, you must go.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Has he refused? How do you know?\n\nPRINCESS. I was there myself! Vas\xc3\xadly Andr\xc3\xa9evich, who is a Member of the\nCouncil, told me all about it. Bor\xc3\xads just walked in and told them he\nwould serve no longer, would take no oath, and in fact said everything\nNicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich has taught him.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Princess! Can such things be taught?\n\nPRINCESS. I don\'t know. Only this is not Christianity! What is your\nopinion, Father?\n\nPRIEST. I am no longer "Father."\n\nPRINCESS. Well, all the same. However, you are also one of them! No, I\ncannot leave things in this state. And what cursed Christianity it is\nthat makes people suffer and perish. I hate this Christianity of yours.\nIt\'s all right for you, who know you won\'t be touched; but I have only\none son, and you have ruined him!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Do be calm, Princess.\n\nPRINCESS. Yes you, you have ruined him! And having ruined him, you must\nsave him. Go and persuade him to abandon all this nonsense. It\'s all\nvery well for rich people, but not for us.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA [crying] Papa, what can be done?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I will go. Perhaps I can be of some use. [Takes off\nhis apron].\n\nPRINCESS [helping him on with his coat] They would not let me in, but\nnow we will go together and I shall get my way. [Exeunt].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    A Government office. A Clerk is seated at a table, and a Sentinel is\n    pacing up and down. Enter a General with his Adjutant. The Clerk\n    jumps up, the Sentinel presents arms.\n\nGENERAL. Where is the Colonel?\n\nCLERK. Gone to see that new conscript, Your Excellency.\n\nGENERAL. Ah, very well. Ask him to come here to me.\n\nCLERK. Yes, Your Excellency.\n\nGENERAL. And what are you copying out? Isn\'t it the conscript\'s\nevidence?\n\nCLERK. Yes, sir, it is.\n\nGENERAL. Give it here.\n\n    The Clerk hands General the paper and exit. The General hands it to\n    his Adjutant.\n\nGENERAL. Please read it.\n\nADJUTANT [reading] "These are my answers to the questions put to me,\nnamely: (1) Why I do not take my oath. (2) Why I refuse to fulfil the\ndemands of the Government. (3) What induced me to use words offensive\nnot only to the army but also to the Highest Authorities. In reply to\nthe first question: I cannot take the oath because I accept Christ\'s\nteaching, which directly and clearly forbids taking oaths, as in St.\nMatthew\'s Gospel, ch.\xc2\xa05 vv.\xc2\xa033-37, and in the Epistle of St. James,\nch.\xc2\xa05 v.\xc2\xa012."\n\nGENERAL. Of course he must be arguing! Putting his own interpretations!\n\nADJUTANT [goes on reading] "The Gospel says: \'Swear not at all, but let\nyour yea be yea, and your nay, nay; and what is more than these is of\nthe evil one!\' St. James\'s Epistle says: \'Before all things, brethren,\nswear not by the heavens nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but\nlet your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, that ye fall not into\ntemptation!\' But apart from the fact that the Bible gives us such clear\ninjunctions not to swear--or even if it contained no such injunctions--I\nshould still be unable to swear to obey the will of men, because as a\nChristian I must always obey the will of God, which does not always\ncoincide with the will of men."\n\nGENERAL. He must be arguing! If I had my way, there would be none of\nthis.\n\nADJUTANT [reading] "I refuse to fulfil the demands of men calling\nthemselves the Government, because\xc2\xa0..."\n\nGENERAL. What insolence!\n\nADJUTANT. "Because those demands are criminal and wicked. They demand of\nme that I should enter the army, and learn and prepare to commit murder,\nthough this is forbidden both in the Old and the New Testaments, and\nabove all by my conscience. To the third question\xc2\xa0..."\n\n    Enter Colonel followed by Clerk. The General shakes hands with\n    Colonel.\n\nCOLONEL. You are reading the evidence?\n\nGENERAL. Yes. Unpardonably insolent language. Well, go on.\n\nADJUTANT. "To the third question: What induced me to use offensive words\nbefore the Court, my answer is: that I was induced to do so by the wish\nto serve God, and in order to expose the fraud carried on in His name.\nThis desire, I hope to retain till I die, and therefore\xc2\xa0..."\n\nGENERAL. Come; that\'s enough; one can\'t listen to all this balderdash.\nThe fact is all this sort of thing must be eradicated, and action taken\nto prevent the people being perverted. [To Colonel] Have you spoken to\nhim?\n\nCOLONEL. I have been doing so all the time. I tried to shame him, and\nalso to convince him that it would only be worse for himself, and that\nhe would gain nothing by it. Besides that, I spoke of his relations. He\nwas very excited, but holds to his opinions.\n\nGENERAL. A pity you talked to him so much. We are in the army not to\nreason, but to act. Call him here!\n\n    Exit Adjutant with Clerk.\n\nGENERAL [sits down] No, Colonel, that\'s not the way. Fellows of this\nkind must be dealt with in a different manner. Decisive measures are\nneeded to cut off the diseased limb. One maggoty sheep infects the whole\nflock. In these cases one must not be too squeamish. His being a Prince,\nand having a mother and a fianc\xc3\xa9e, is none of our business. We have a\nsoldier before us and we must obey the Tsar\'s will.\n\nCOLONEL. I only thought that we could move him more easily by\npersuasion.\n\nGENERAL. Not at all--by firmness; only by firmness! I have dealt with\nmen of that sort before. He must be made to feel that he is a\nnonentity--a grain of dust beneath a chariot wheel, and that he cannot\nstop it.\n\nCOLONEL. Well, we can try!\n\nGENERAL [getting irritable] No need to try! I don\'t need to try! I have\nserved the Tsar for forty-four years, I have given and am giving my life\nto the service, and now this fellow wants to teach me and wants to read\nme theological lectures! Let him take that to the Priest, but to me--he\nis either a soldier or a prisoner. That\'s all!\n\n    Enter Bor\xc3\xads guarded by two Soldiers and followed by Adjutant and\n    Clerk.\n\nGENERAL [pointing with a finger] Place him there.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I need no placing. I shall stand or sit where I like, for I do\nnot recognise your authority.\n\nGENERAL. Silence! You don\'t recognise authority? I will make you\nrecognise it.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS [sits down on a stool] How wrong it is of you to shout so!\n\nGENERAL. Lift him, and make him stand!\n\n    Soldiers raise him.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. That you can do, and you can kill me; but you cannot make me\nsubmit\xc2\xa0...\n\nGENERAL. Silence, I tell you. Hear what I have to say to you.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I don\'t in the least want to hear what you have to say.\n\nGENERAL. He is mad! He must be taken to the hospital to be examined.\nThat is the only thing to do.\n\nCOLONEL. The order was to send him to be examined at the Gendarmes\'\noffice.\n\nGENERAL. Well, then, send him there. Only put him into uniform.\n\nCOLONEL. He resists.\n\nGENERAL. Bind him. [To Bor\xc3\xads] Please hear what I have to say to you. I\ndon\'t care what happens to you, but for your own sake I advise you,\nbethink yourself. You will rot in a fortress, and not do any good to\nanyone. Give it up. Well, you flared up a bit and I flared up. [Slaps\nhim on the shoulder] Go, take the oath and give up all that nonsense.\n[To Adjutant] Is the Priest here? [To Bor\xc3\xads] Well? [Bor\xc3\xads is silent] Why\ndon\'t you answer? Really you had better do as I say. You can\'t break a\nclub with a whip. You can keep your opinions, but serve your time! We\nwill not use force with you. Well?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I have nothing more to say, I have said all I had to.\n\nGENERAL. There, you see, you wrote that there are such and such texts in\nthe Gospels. Well, the Priest knows all about that. Have a talk with the\nPriest, and then think things over. That will be best. Good-bye, and I\nhope "au revoir," when I shall be able to congratulate you on having\nentered the Tsar\'s service. Send the Priest here. [Exit, followed by\nColonel and Adjutant].\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS [To Clerk and Convoy Soldiers] There you see how they deceive you.\nThey know that they are deceiving you. Don\'t submit to them. Lay down\nyour rifles and go away. Let them put you into the Disciplinary\nBattalions and flog you; it will not be as bad as it is to serve such\nimpostors.\n\nCLERK. But how could one get on without an army? It\'s impossible.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. That is not for us to consider. We have to consider what God\ndemands of us; and God wants us.\n\nONE OF THE SOLDIERS. But how is it that they speak of "the Christian\narmy"?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. That is not said anywhere in the Bible. It\'s these impostors who\ninvented it.\n\n    Enter a Gendarme Officer with Clerk.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. Is it here that the conscript, Prince Cheremsh\xc3\xa1nov, is\nbeing kept?\n\nCLERK. Yes, sir. Here he is.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. Come here, please. Are you Prince Bor\xc3\xads Sim\xc3\xa9novich\nCheremsh\xc3\xa1nov, who refuses to take the oath?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I am.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER [sits down and points to a seat opposite] Please sit\ndown.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I think our conversation will be quite useless.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. I don\'t think so. At any rate not useless to you. You\nsee it\'s like this. I am informed that you refuse military service and\nthe oath, and are therefore suspected of belonging to the Revolutionary\nParty, and that is what I have to investigate. If it is true, we shall\nhave to withdraw you from the service and imprison you or banish you\naccording to the share you have taken in the revolution. If it is not\ntrue, we shall leave you to the military authorities. You see I express\nmyself quite frankly to you, and I hope you will treat us in the same\nway.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. In the first place I cannot trust men who wear this sort of thing\n[pointing to the Gendarme Officer\'s uniform]. Secondly, your very\noccupation is one I cannot respect, and for which I have the greatest\naversion. But I do not refuse to answer your questions. What do you wish\nto know?\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. In the first place, tell me your name, your calling,\nand your religion?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. You know all that and I will not reply. Only one of the questions\nis of great importance to me. I am _not_ what is called an Orthodox\nChristian.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. What then is your religion?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I do not label it.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. But still?...\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Well then, the Christian religion, according to the Sermon on the\nMount.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. Write it down [Clerk writes. To Bor\xc3\xads] Still you\nrecognise yourself as belonging to some nationality or rank.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. No, I don\'t. I recognise myself as a man, and a servant of God.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. Why don\'t you consider yourself a member of the\nRussian Empire?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Because I do not recognise any empires.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. What do you mean by not recognising? Do you wish to\noverthrow them?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Certainly I wish it, and work for it.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER [To Clerk] Put that down. [To Bor\xc3\xads] How do you work\nfor it?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. By exposing fraud and lies, and by spreading the truth. When you\nentered I was telling these soldiers not to believe in the fraud into\nwhich they have been drawn.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. But beside this method of exposing and persuading, do\nyou approve of any others?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. No, I not only disapprove, but I consider all violence to be a\ngreat sin; and not only violence, but all concealment and craftiness\xc2\xa0...\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. Write that down. Very well. Now kindly let me know\nwhom you are acquainted with. Do you know Ivash\xc3\xa9nko?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. No.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. Klein?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I have heard of him, but never met him.\n\n    Enter Priest (an old man wearing a cross and carrying a Bible). The\n    Clerk goes up to him and receives his blessing.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER. Well, I think I may stop. I consider that you are not\ndangerous, and not within our jurisdiction. I wish you a speedy release.\nGood-day. [Presses Bor\xc3\xads\'s hand].\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. One thing I should like to say to you. Forgive me, but I can\'t\nhelp saying it. Why have you chosen this wicked, cruel profession? I\nshould advise you to give it up.\n\nGENDARME OFFICER [smiles] Thank you for your advice, but I have my\nreasons. My respects to you. [To Priest] Father, I relinquish my place\nto you [Exit with Clerk].\n\nPRIEST. How can you so grieve the authorities by refusing to fulfil the\nduty of a Christian, to serve the Tsar and your Fatherland?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS [smiling] Just because I want to fulfil my duty as a Christian, I\ndo not wish to be a soldier.\n\nPRIEST. Why don\'t you wish it? It is said that, "To lay down one\'s life\nfor a friend" is to be a true Christian....\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Yes, to "lay down one\'s life," but not to take another man\'s.\nThat is just what I want to do, to "lay down my life."\n\nPRIEST. You do not reason rightly, young man. John the Baptist said to\nthe soldiers\xc2\xa0...\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS [smiling] That only goes to prove that even in those days the\nsoldiers used to rob, and he told them not to!\n\nPRIEST. Well, but why don\'t you wish to take your oath?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. You know that the Gospels forbid it!\n\nPRIEST. Not at all. You know that when Pilate said: "I adjure thee by\nthe living God, art thou the Christ?" the Lord Jesus Christ answered "I\nam." That proves that oaths are not forbidden.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Are not you ashamed to talk so? You--an old man.\n\nPRIEST. Take my advice and don\'t be obstinate. You and I cannot change\nthe world. Just take your oath and you\'ll be at ease. Leave it to the\nChurch to know what is a sin and what is not.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Leave it to you? Are you not afraid to take so much sin upon\nyourself?\n\nPRIEST. What sin? Having been brought up firmly in the faith, and\nhaving worked as a priest for thirty years, I can have no sins on my\nshoulders.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Whose then is the sin, when you deceive such numbers of people?\nWhat have these poor fellows got in their heads? [Points to Sentinel].\n\nPRIEST. You and I, young man, will never settle that. It is for us to\nobey those placed above us.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Leave me alone! I am sorry for you and--I confess--it disgusts me\nto listen to you. Now if you were like that General--but you come here\nwith a cross and the Testament to persuade me in the name of Christ, to\ndeny Christ! Go [excitedly]. Leave me--Go. Let me be taken back to the\ncell that I may not see anyone. I am tired, dreadfully tired!\n\nPRIEST. Well, if that is so, good-bye.\n\n    Enter Adjutant.\n\nADJUTANT. Well?\n\nPRIEST. Great obstinacy, great insubordination.\n\nADJUTANT. So he has refused to take the oath and to serve?\n\nPRIEST. On no account will he.\n\nADJUTANT. Then he must be taken to the hospital.\n\nPRIEST. And reported as ill? That no doubt would be better, or his\nexample may lead others astray.\n\nADJUTANT. To be put under observation in the ward for the mentally\ndiseased. Those are my orders.\n\nPRIEST. Certainly. My respects to you. [Exit].\n\nADJUTANT [approaches Bor\xc3\xads] Come, please. My orders are to conduct\nyou----\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Where to?\n\nADJUTANT. First of all to the hospital, where it will be quieter for\nyou, and where you will have time to think things over.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I\'ve thought them over long ago. But let us go! [Exeunt].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 3\n\n    Room in Hospital. Head Doctor, Assistant Doctor, an Officer-Patient\n    in a dressing-gown, and two Warders wearing blouses.\n\nPATIENT. I tell you that you are only leading me to perdition. I have\nalready several times felt quite well.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. You must not get excited. I should be glad to sign an order\nfor you to leave the hospital, but you know yourself that liberty is\ndangerous for you. If I were sure that you would be looked after\xc2\xa0...\n\nPATIENT. You think I should take to drink again? No, I have had my\nlesson, but every extra day I spend here only does me harm. You are\ndoing [gets excited] the opposite of what you ought to do. You are\ncruel. It\'s all very well for _you_!\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Don\'t get excited. [Makes a sign to Warders; who come up\nfrom behind].\n\nPATIENT. It\'s easy for you to argue, being at liberty; but how about us\nwho are kept among madmen! [To Warders] What are you after? Be off!\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. I beg of you to be calm.\n\nPATIENT. But I beg and I demand that you set me free. [Yells, and rushes\nat the Doctor, but the Warders seize him. A struggle; after which he is\ntaken out].\n\nASSISTANT DOCTOR. There! Now it has begun again. He nearly got at you\nthat time.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Alcoholic ... nothing can be done. But there is some\nimprovement.\n\n    Enter Adjutant.\n\nADJUTANT. How d\'you do.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Good morning!\n\nADJUTANT. I have brought you an interesting fellow, a certain Prince\nCheremsh\xc3\xa1nov, who has been conscripted, but on religious grounds refuses\nto serve. He was sent to the Gendarmes, but they say he does not come\nwithin their jurisdiction, not being a political conspirator. The Priest\nexhorted him, but also without effect.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR [laughing] And then as usual you bring him to us, as the\nhighest Court of Appeal. Well, let\'s have him.\n\n    Exit Assistant Doctor.\n\nADJUTANT. He is said to be a highly educated young man, and he is\nengaged to a rich girl. It\'s extraordinary! I really consider this is\nthe right place for him!\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Yes, it\'s a mania.\n\n    Bor\xc3\xads is brought in.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Glad to see you. Please take a seat and let\'s have a chat.\n[To Adjutant] Please leave us. [Exit Adjutant].\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I should like to ask you, if possible, if you mean to lock me up\nsomewhere, to be so good as to do it quickly and let me rest.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Excuse me, we must keep the rules. Only a few questions.\nWhat do you feel? What are you suffering from?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Nothing. I am perfectly well.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Yes, but you are not behaving like other people.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I am behaving as my conscience demands.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Well, you see you have refused to perform your military\nservice. On what grounds do you do so?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I am a Christian, and therefore cannot commit murder.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. But one must defend one\'s country from her foes, and keep\nthose who want to destroy the social order from evil-doing.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. No one is attacking our country; and there are more among the\ngovernors who destroy social order, than there are among those whom they\noppress.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Yes? But what do you mean by that?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I mean this: the chief cause of evil--v\xc3\xb3dka--is sold by the\nGovernment; false and fraudulent religion is also fostered by the\nGovernment; and this military service which they demand of me--and which\nis the chief means of demoralising the people--is also demanded by the\nGovernment.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Then, in your opinion, Government and the State are\nunnecessary.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. That I don\'t know; but I know for certain that I must take no\npart in evil-doing.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. But what is to become of the world? Is not our reason given\nin order to enable us to look ahead.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. It is also given in order to enable us to see that social order\nshould not be maintained by violence, but by goodness; and that one\nman\'s refusal to participate in evil cannot be at all dangerous.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Well now, allow me to examine you a bit. Will you have the\ngoodness to lie down? [Begins touching him] You feel no pain here?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. No.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Nor here?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. No.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Take a deep breath, please. Now don\'t breathe. Now allow me\n[takes out a measure and measures forehead and nose]. Now be so good as\nto shut your eyes and walk.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Are you not ashamed to do all this?\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. What do you mean?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. All this nonsense? You know that I am quite well and that I am\nsent here because I refuse to take part in their evil deeds, and because\nthey have no answer to give to the truth I told them; and that is why\nthey pretend to think me mad. And you co-operate with them. It is\nhorrid and it is shameful. Don\'t do it!\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Then you don\'t wish to walk?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. No, I don\'t. You may torture me, but you must do it yourself; I\nwon\'t help you. [Hotly] Let me alone! [The Doctor presses button of\nbell. Enter two Warders].\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Don\'t get excited. I quite understand that your nerves are\nstrained. Will you please go to your ward?\n\n    Enter Assistant Doctor.\n\nASSISTANT DOCTOR. Some visitors have just come to see Cheremsh\xc3\xa1nov.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Who are they?\n\nASSISTANT DOCTOR. Sar\xc3\xbdntsov and his daughter.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I should like to see them.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. There is no reason why you shouldn\'t. Ask them in. You may\nsee them here. [Exit, followed by Assistant and Warders].\n\n    Enter Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich and Ly\xc3\xbaba. The Princess looks in at the\n    door and says, "_Go in, I\'ll come later._"\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA [goes straight to Bor\xc3\xads, takes his head in her hands and kisses\nhim] Poor Bor\xc3\xads.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. No, don\'t pity me. I feel so well, so joyful, so light. How d\'you\ndo. [Kisses Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I have come to say chiefly one thing to you. First\nof all, in such affairs it is worse to overdo it than not to do enough.\nAnd in this matter you should do as is said in the Gospels, and not\nthink beforehand, "I shall say this, or do that": "When they deliver you\nup, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it is not ye that\nspeak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaketh in you." That is to\nsay, do not act because you have reasoned out beforehand that you should\ndo so and so, but act only when your whole being feels that you cannot\nact otherwise.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I have done so. I did not think I should refuse to serve; but\nwhen I saw all this fraud, those Mirrors of Justice, those Documents,\nthe Police and Officers smoking, I could not help saying what I did. I\nwas frightened, but only till I had begun, after that it was all so\nsimple and joyful.\n\n    Ly\xc3\xbaba sits down and cries.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Above all, do nothing for the sake of being praised,\nor to gain the approval of those whose opinion you value. For myself I\ncan say definitely, that if you take the oath at once, and enter the\nservice, I shall love and esteem you not less but more than before;\nbecause not the things that take place in the external world are\nvaluable, but that which goes on within the soul.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Of course, for what happens within the soul must make a change in\nthe outside world.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, I have said my say. Your mother is here. She\nis terribly upset. If you can do what she asks, do it--that is what I\nwished to say to you.\n\n    From the corridor outside hysterical weeping is heard. A Lunatic\n    rushes in, followed by Warders who drag him out again.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. How terrible! And you will be kept here? [Weeps].\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. I am not afraid of it, I\'m afraid of nothing now! I feel so\nhappy, the only thing I fear is what you feel about it. Do help me; I am\nsure you will!\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Can I be glad about it?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Not glad, that is impossible. I myself am not glad.\nI suffer on his account and would gladly take his place, but though I\nsuffer I yet know that it is well.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. It may be well; but when will they set him free?\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. No one knows. I do not think of the future. The present is so\ngood, and you can make it still better.\n\n    Enter the Princess, his mother.\n\nPRINCESS. I can wait no longer! [To Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich] Well, have you\npersuaded him? Does he agree? B\xc3\xb3rya, my darling, you understand, don\'t\nyou, what I suffer? For thirty years I have lived but for you; rearing\nyou, rejoicing in you. And now when everything has been done and is\ncomplete--you suddenly renounce everything. Prison and disgrace! Oh no!\nB\xc3\xb3rya!\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Mamma! Listen to me.\n\nPRINCESS [to Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich] Why do you say nothing? You have ruined\nhim, it is for you to persuade him. It\'s all very well for you! Ly\xc3\xbaba,\ndo speak to him!\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. I cannot!\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Mamma, do understand that there are things that are as impossible\nas flying; and I cannot serve in the army.\n\nPRINCESS. You think that you can\'t! Nonsense. Everybody has served and\ndoes serve. You and Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich have invented some new sort of\nChristianity which is not Christianity, but a devilish doctrine to make\neverybody suffer!\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. As is said in the Gospels!\n\nPRINCESS. Nothing of the kind, or if it is, then all the same it is\nstupid. Darling, B\xc3\xb3rya, have pity on me. [Throws herself on his neck,\nweeps] My whole life has been nothing but sorrow. There was but one ray\nof joy, and you are turning it into torture. B\xc3\xb3rya--have pity on me!\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Mamma, this is terribly hard on me. But I cannot explain it to\nyou.\n\nPRINCESS. Come now, don\'t refuse--say you will serve!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Say you will think it over--and do think it over.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS. Very well then. But you too, Mamma, should have pity on me. It is\nhard on me too. [Cries are again heard from the corridor]. You know I\'m\nin a lunatic asylum, and might really go mad.\n\n    Enter Head Doctor.\n\nHEAD DOCTOR. Madam, this may have very bad consequences. Your son is in\na highly excited condition. I think we must put an end to this\ninterview. You may call on visiting days--Thursdays and Sundays. Please\ncome to see him before twelve o\'clock.\n\nPRINCESS. Very well, very well, I will go. B\xc3\xb3rya, good-bye! Think it\nover. Have pity on me and meet me next Thursday with good news!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [shaking hands with Bor\xc3\xads] Think it over with God\'s\nhelp, and as if you knew you were to die to-morrow. Only so will you\ndecide rightly. Good-bye.\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS [approaching Ly\xc3\xbaba] And what do you say to me?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. I cannot lie; and I do not understand why you should torment\nyourself and everybody. I do not understand--and can say nothing. [Goes\nout weeping. Exeunt all except Bor\xc3\xads].\n\nBOR\xc3\x8dS [alone] Oh how hard it is! Oh, how hard, Lord help me! [Prays].\n\n    Enter Warders with dressing-gown.\n\nWARDER. Please change.\n\n    Bor\xc3\xads puts on dressing-gown.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n\nSCENE 1\n\n    In Moscow a year later. A drawing-room in the Sar\xc3\xbdntsov\'s town house\n    is prepared for a dance. Footmen are arranging plants round the\n    grand piano. Enter Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna in an elegant silk dress, with\n    Alex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. A ball? No, Only a dance! A "Juvenile Party" as they once\nused to say. My children took part in the Theatricals at the M\xc3\xa1kofs, and\nhave been asked to dances everywhere, so I must return the invitations.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I am afraid Nicholas does not like it.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I can\'t help it. [To Footmen] Put it here! [To Alex\xc3\xa1ndra\nIv\xc3\xa1novna] God knows how glad I should be not to cause him\nunpleasantness. But I think he has become much less exacting.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No, no! Only he does not show it so much. I saw how\nupset he was when he went off to his own room after dinner.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What can I do? After all, people must live. We have seven\nchildren, and if they find no amusement at home, heaven knows what they\nmay be up to. Anyhow I am quite happy about Ly\xc3\xbaba now.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Has he proposed, then?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. As good as proposed. He has spoken to her, and she has\nsaid, Yes!\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. That again will be a terrible blow to Nicholas.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Oh, he knows. He can\'t help knowing.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. He does not like him.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [to the Footmen] Put the fruit on the side-board. Like\nwhom? Alexander Mik\xc3\xa1ylovich? Of course not; because he is a living\nnegation of all Nicholas\'s pet theories. A nice pleasant kindly man of\nthe world. But oh! That terrible night-mare--that affair of Bor\xc3\xads\nCheremsh\xc3\xa1nov\'s. What has happened to him?\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Lisa has been to see him. He is still there. She\nsays he has grown terribly thin, and the Doctors fear for his life or\nhis reason.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Yes, he is one of the terrible sacrifices caused by\nNicholas\'s ideas. Why need he have been ruined? I never wished it.\n\n    Enter Pianist.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [to Pianist] Have you come to play?\n\nPIANIST. Yes, I am the pianist.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Please take a seat and wait a little. Won\'t you have a\ncup of tea?\n\nPIANIST [goes to piano] No, thank you!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I never wished it. I liked B\xc3\xb3rya, but still he was not a\nsuitable match for Ly\xc3\xbaba--especially after he let himself be carried\naway by Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich\'s ideas.\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But still, the strength of his convictions is\nastonishing. See what he endures! They tell him that as long as he\npersists in refusing to serve, he will either remain where he is or be\nsent to the fortress; but his reply is always the same. And yet Lisa\nsays he is full of joy and even merry!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Fanatic! But here comes Alexander Mik\xc3\xa1ylovich!\n\n    Enter Alexander Mik\xc3\xa1ylovich Stark\xc3\xb3vsky,[35] an elegant man in\n    evening dress.\n\n  [35] Alexander in his Christian name, Mik\xc3\xa1ylovich (= son of Michael)\n  is his patronymic, and Stark\xc3\xb3vsky in his surname which is seldom used\n  in ordinary social life.\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. I am afraid I have come too soon. [Kisses the hands of both\nladies].\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. So much the better.\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. And Ly\xc3\xbabov Nikol\xc3\xa1yevna?[36] She proposed to dance a great\ndeal so as to make up for the time she has lost, and I have undertaken\nto help her.\n\n  [36] Ly\xc3\xbabov Nikol\xc3\xa1yevna (= Love daughter of Nicholas) is the courteous\n  way of naming Ly\xc3\xbaba. The latter is a pet name.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. She is sorting favours for the cotillion.\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. I will go and help her, if I may?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Certainly.\n\n    As Stark\xc3\xb3vsky is going out he meets Ly\xc3\xbaba in evening, but not\n    low-necked, dress carrying a cushion with stars and ribbons.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Ah! here you are. Good! Now you can help me. There are three more\ncushions in the drawing-room. Go and fetch them all.\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. I fly to do so!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Now, Ly\xc3\xbaba; friends are coming, and they will be sure to\nhint and ask questions. May we announce it?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. No, Mamma, no. Why? Let them ask! Papa will not like it.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But he knows or guesses; and he will have to be told\nsooner or later. I think it would be better to announce it to-day. Why,\n_C\'est le secret de la com\xc3\xa9die_.[37]\n\n  [37] It is only a comedy secret.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. No, no, Mamma, please don\'t. It would spoil our whole evening.\nNo, no, you must not.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, as you please.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. All right then: after the dance, just before supper.\n\n    Enter Stark\xc3\xb3vsky.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Well, have you got them?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I\'ll go and have a look at the little ones. [Exit with\nAlex\xc3\xa1ndra Iv\xc3\xa1novna].\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY [carrying three cushions, which he steadies with his chin,\nand dropping things on the way] Don\'t trouble, Ly\xc3\xbabov Nikol\xc3\xa1yevna, I\'ll\npick them up. Well, you have prepared a lot of favours. If only I can\nmanage to lead the dance properly! V\xc3\xa1nya, come along.\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA [bringing more favours] This is the whole lot. Ly\xc3\xbaba, Alexander\nMik\xc3\xa1ylovich and I have a bet on, which of us will win the most favours.\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. It will be easy for you, for you know everybody here, and\nwill gain them easily, while I shall have to charm the young ladies\nfirst before winning anything. It means that I am giving you a start of\nforty points.\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. But then you are a fianc\xc3\xa9, and I am a boy.\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. Well no, I am not a fianc\xc3\xa9 yet, and I am worse than a boy.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. V\xc3\xa1nya, please go to my room and fetch the gum and the pin-cushion\nfrom the what-not. Only for goodness\' sake don\'t break anything.\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. I\'ll break everything! [Runs off].\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY [takes Ly\xc3\xbaba\'s hand] Ly\xc3\xbaba, may I? I am so happy. [Kisses her\nhand] The mazurka is mine, but that is not enough. One can\'t say much in\na mazurka, and I must speak. May I wire to my people that I have been\naccepted and am happy?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Yes, to-night.\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. One word more: how will Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich take it? Have you\ntold him? Yes?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. No, I haven\'t; but I will. He will take it as he now takes\neverything that concerns the family. He will say, "Do as you think\nbest." But he will be grieved at heart.\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. Because I am not Cheremsh\xc3\xa1nov? Because I am a Mar\xc3\xa9chal de la\nNoblesse?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Yes. But I have struggled with myself and deceived myself for his\nsake; and it is not because I love him less that I am now doing not what\nhe wants, but it is because I can\'t lie. He himself says so. I do so\nwant to _live_!\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. And life is the only truth! Well, and what of Cheremsh\xc3\xa1nov?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA [excitedly] Don\'t speak of him to me! I wish to blame him, to\nblame him whilst he is suffering; and I know it is because I feel guilty\ntowards him. All I know is that I feel there is a kind of love--and I\nthink a more real love than I ever felt for him.\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. Ly\xc3\xbaba, is that true?\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. You wish me to say that I love you with that real love--but I\nwon\'t say it. I do love you with a different kind of love; but it is not\nthe real thing either! Neither the one nor the other is the real\nthing--if only they could be mixed together!\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. No, no, I am satisfied with mine. [Kisses her hand] Ly\xc3\xbaba!\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA [pushes him away] No, let us sort these things. They are beginning\nto arrive.\n\n    Enter Princess with T\xc3\xb3nya and a little girl.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA. Mamma will be here in a moment.\n\nPRINCESS. Are we the first?\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. Some one must be! I have suggested making a gutta-percha\ndummy to be the first arrival!\n\n    Enter Sty\xc3\xb3pa, also V\xc3\xa1nya carrying the gum and pin-cushion.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. I expected to see you at the Italian opera last night.\n\nT\xc3\x93NYA. We were at my Aunt\'s, sewing for the charity-bazaar.\n\n    Enter Students, Ladies, Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna and a Countess.\n\nCOUNTESS. Shan\'t we see Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No, he never leaves his study to come to our gathering.\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. Quadrille, please! [Claps his hands. The dancers take their\nplaces and dance].\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [approaches Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna] He is terribly agitated.\nHe has been to see Bor\xc3\xads, and he came back and saw there was a ball, and\nnow he wants to go away! I went up to his door and overheard him talking\nto Alexander Petr\xc3\xb3vich.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well?\n\nSTARK\xc3\x93VSKY. _Rond des dames. Les cavaliers en avant!_[38]\n\n  [38] Stark\xc3\xb3vsky, directing the dance, says: "Ladies form a circle.\n  Gentlemen advance!"\n\nALEX\xc3\x81NDRA IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. He has made up his mind that it is impossible for\nhim to live so, and he is going away.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. What a torment the man is! [Exit].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\n    Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich\'s room. The dance music is heard in the distance.\n    Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich has an overcoat on. He puts a letter on the\n    table. Alexander Petr\xc3\xb3vich, dressed in ragged clothes, is with him.\n\nALEXANDER PETR\xc3\x93VICH. Don\'t worry, we can reach the Caucasus without\nspending a penny, and there you can settle down.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. We will go by rail as far as T\xc3\xbala, and from thence\non foot. Well, I\'m ready. [Puts letter in the middle of the table, and\ngoes to the door, where he meets Mary Iv\xc3\xa1novna] Oh! Why have you come\nhere?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Why indeed? To prevent your doing a cruel thing. What\'s\nall this for? Why d\'you do it?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Why? Because I cannot continue living like this. I\ncannot endure this terrible, depraved life.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. It is awful. My life--which I give wholly to you and the\nchildren--has all of a sudden become "depraved." [Sees Alexander\nPetr\xc3\xb3vich] _Renvoyez au moins cet homme. Je ne veux pas qu\'il soit\nt\xc3\xa9moin de cette conversation._[39]\n\n  [39] At least send that man away. I don\'t wish him to be a witness of\n  our conversation.\n\nALEXANDER PETR\xc3\x93VICH. _Comprenez. Toujours moi partez._[40]\n\n  [40] Alexander Petr\xc3\xb3vich replies in very bad French: "I understand! I\n  am always to go away!"\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Wait for me out there, Alexander Petr\xc3\xb3vich, I\'ll\ncome in a minute.\n\n    Exit Alexander Petr\xc3\xb3vich.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. And what can you have in common with such a man as that?\nWhy is he nearer to you than your own wife? It is incomprehensible! And\nwhere are you going?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I have left a letter for you. I did not want to\nspeak; it is too hard; but if you wish it, I will try to say it quietly.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. No, I don\'t understand. Why do you hate and torture your\nwife, who has given up everything for you? Tell me, have I been going to\nballs, or gone in for dress, or flirted? My whole life has been devoted\nto the family. I nursed them all myself; I brought them up, and this\nlast year the whole weight of their education, and the managing our\naffairs, has fallen on me....\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [interrupting] But all this weight falls on you,\nbecause you do not wish to live as I proposed.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But that was impossible! Ask anyone! It was impossible to\nlet the children grow up illiterate, as you wished them to do, and for\nme to do the washing and cooking.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I never wanted that!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Well, anyhow it was something of that kind! No, you are a\nChristian, you wish to do good, and you say you love men; then why do\nyou torture the woman who has devoted her whole life to you?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. How do I torture you? I love you, but\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But is it not torturing me to leave me and to go away?\nWhat will everybody say? One of two things, either that I am a bad\nwoman, or that you are mad.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Well, let us say I am mad; but I can\'t live like\nthis.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But what is there so terrible in it, even if once in a\nwinter (and only once, because I feared you would not like it) I do give\na party--and even then a very simple one, only ask M\xc3\xa1nya and Barbara\nVas\xc3\xadlyevna! Everybody said I could not do less--and that it was\nabsolutely necessary. And now it seems even a crime, for which I shall\nhave to suffer disgrace. And not only disgrace. The worst of all is that\nyou no longer love me! You love everyone else--the whole world,\nincluding that drunken Alexander Petr\xc3\xb3vich--but I still love you and\ncannot live without you. Why do you do it? Why? [Weeps].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. But you don\'t even wish to understand my life; my\nspiritual life.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. I do wish to understand it, but I can\'t. I see that your\nChristianity has made you hate your family and hate me; but I don\'t\nunderstand why!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. You see the others do understand!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Who? Alexander Petr\xc3\xb3vich, who gets money out of you?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. He and others: T\xc3\xb3nya and Vas\xc3\xadly Nikon\xc3\xb3rovich. But\neven if nobody understood it, that would make no difference.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Vas\xc3\xadly Nikon\xc3\xb3rovich has repented, and has got his living\nback, and T\xc3\xb3nya is at this very moment dancing and flirting with Sty\xc3\xb3pa.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. I am sorry to hear it, but it does not turn black\ninto white, and it cannot change my life. Mary! You do not need me. Let\nme go! I have tried to share your life and to bring into it what for me\nconstitutes the whole of life; but it is impossible. It only results in\ntorturing myself and you. I not only torment myself, but spoil the work\nI try to accomplish. Everybody, including that very Alexander Petr\xc3\xb3vich,\nhas the right to tell me that I am a hypocrite; that I talk but do not\nact! That I preach the Gospel of poverty while I live in luxury,\npretending that I have given up everything to my wife!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. So you are ashamed of what people say? Really, can\'t you\nrise above that?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. It\'s not that I am ashamed (though I am ashamed),\nbut that I am spoiling God\'s work.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. You yourself often say that it fulfils itself despite\nman\'s opposition; but that\'s not the point. Tell me, what do you want of\nme?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Haven\'t I told you?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But, Nicholas, you know that that is impossible. Only\nthink, Ly\xc3\xbaba is now getting married; V\xc3\xa1nya is entering the university;\nMissy and K\xc3\xa1tya are studying. How can I break all that off?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Then what am I to do?\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Do as you say one should do: have patience, love. Is it\ntoo hard for you? Only bear with us and do not take yourself from us!\nCome, what is it that torments you?\n\n    Enter V\xc3\xa1nya running.\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. Mamma, they are calling you!\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Tell them I can\'t come. Go, go!\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA. Do come! [He runs off].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. You don\'t wish to see eye to eye--nor to understand\nme.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. It is not that I don\'t wish to, but that I can\'t.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. No, you don\'t wish to, and we drift further and\nfurther apart. Only enter into my feelings; put yourself for a moment in\nmy place, and you will understand. First, the whole life here is\nthoroughly depraved. You are vexed with the expression, but I can give\nno other name to a life built wholly on robbery; for the money you live\non is taken from the land you have stolen from the peasants. Moreover, I\nsee that this life is demoralising the children: "Whoso shall cause one\nof these little ones to stumble," and I see how they are perishing and\nbecoming depraved before my very eyes. I cannot bear it when grown-up\nmen dressed up in swallow-tail coats serve us as if they were slaves.\nEvery dinner we have is a torture to me.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. But all this was so before. Is it not done by\neveryone--both here and abroad?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. But _I_ can\'t do it. Since I realised that we are\nall brothers, I cannot see it without suffering.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. That is as you please. One can invent anything.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [hotly] It\'s just this want of understanding that is\nso terrible. Take for instance to-day! I spent this morning at Rzh\xc3\xa1nov\'s\nlodging-house, among the outcasts there; and I saw an infant literally\ndie of hunger; a boy suffering from alcoholism; and a consumptive\ncharwoman rinsing clothes outside in the cold. Then I returned home, and\na footman with a white tie opens the door for me. I see my son--a mere\nlad--ordering that footman to fetch him some water; and I see the army\nof servants who work for us. Then I go to visit Bor\xc3\xads--a man who is\nsacrificing his life for truth\'s sake. I see how he, a pure, strong,\nresolute man, is deliberately being goaded to lunacy and to\ndestruction, that the Government may be rid of him! I know, and they\nknow, that his heart is weak, and so they provoke him, and drag him to a\nward for raving lunatics. It is too dreadful, too dreadful. And when I\ncome home, I hear that the one member of our family who understood--not\nme but the truth--has thrown over both her betrothed to whom she had\npromised her love, and the truth, and is going to marry a lackey, a\nliar\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. How very Christian!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Yes, it is wrong of me, and I am to blame, but I\nonly want you to put yourself in my place. I mean to say that she has\nturned from the truth\xc2\xa0...\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. You say, "from the truth"; but other people--the\nmajority--say from "an error." You see Vas\xc3\xadly Nikon\xc3\xb3rovich once thought\nhe was in error, but now has come back to the Church.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. That\'s impossible\xc2\xa0----\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. He has written to Lisa! She will show you the letter.\nThat sort of conversion is very unstable. So also in T\xc3\xb3nya\'s case; I\nwon\'t even speak of that fellow Alexander Petr\xc3\xb3vich, who simply\nconsiders it profitable!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [getting angry] Well, no matter. I only ask _you_ to\nunderstand me. I still consider that truth is truth! All this hurts me\nvery much. And here at home I see a Christmas-tree, a ball, and hundreds\nof roubles being spent while men are dying of hunger. I cannot live so.\nHave pity on me, I am worried to death. Let me go! Good-bye.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. If you go, I will go with you. Or if not with you, I will\nthrow myself under the train you leave by; and let them all go to\nperdition--and Missy and K\xc3\xa1tya too. Oh my God, my God. What torture!\nWhy? What for? [Weeps].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [at the door] Alexander Petr\xc3\xb3vich, go home! I am not\ngoing. [To his wife] Very well, I will stay. [Takes off his overcoat].\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA [embracing him] We have not much longer to live. Don\'t let\nus spoil everything after twenty-eight years of life together. Well,\nI\'ll give no more parties; but do not punish me so.\n\n    Enter V\xc3\xa1nya and K\xc3\xa1tya running.\n\nV\xc3\x81NYA and KATYA. Mamma, be quick--come.\n\nMARY IV\xc3\x81NOVNA. Coming, coming. So let us forgive one another! [Exit with\nK\xc3\xa1tya and V\xc3\xa1nya].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. A child, a regular child; or a cunning woman? No, a\ncunning child. Yes, yes. It seems Thou dost not wish me to be Thy\nservant in this Thy work. Thou wishest me to be humiliated, so that\neveryone may point his finger at me and say, "He preaches, but he does\nnot perform." Well, let them! Thou knowest best what Thou requirest:\nsubmission, humility! Ah, if I could but rise to that height!\n\n    Enter Lisa.\n\nLISA. Excuse me. I have brought you a letter from Vas\xc3\xadly Nikon\xc3\xb3rovich.\nIt is addressed to me, but he asks me to tell you.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Can it be really true?\n\nLISA. Yes. Shall I read it?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Please do.\n\nLISA [reading] "I write to beg you to communicate this to Nicholas\nIv\xc3\xa1novich. I greatly regret the error which led me openly to stray from\nthe Holy Orthodox Church, to which I rejoice to have now returned. I\nhope you and Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich will follow the same path. Please\nforgive me!"\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. They have tortured him into this, poor fellow. But\nstill it is terrible.\n\nLISA. I also came to tell you that the Princess is here. She came\nupstairs to me in a dreadfully excited state and is determined to see\nyou. She has just been to see Bor\xc3\xads. I think you had better not see\nher. What good can it do for her to see you?\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. No. Call her in. Evidently this is fated to be a day\nof dreadful torture.\n\nLISA. Then I\'ll go and call her. [Exit].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [alone] Yes--could I but remember that life consists\nonly in serving Thee; and that if Thou sendest a trial, it is because\nThou holdest me capable of enduring it, and knowest that my strength is\nequal to it: else it would not be a trial.... Father, help me--help me\nto do Thy will.\n\n    Enter Princess.\n\nPRINCESS. You receive me? You do me that honour? My respects to you. I\ndon\'t give you my hand, for I hate you and despise you.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. What has happened?\n\nPRINCESS. Just this, that they are moving him to the Disciplinary\nBattalion; and it is you who are the cause of it.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Princess, if you want anything, tell me what it is;\nbut if you have come here merely to abuse me, you only injure yourself.\nYou cannot offend me, for with my whole heart I sympathise with you and\npity you!\n\nPRINCESS. What charity! What exalted Christianity! No, Mr. Sar\xc3\xbdntsov,\nyou cannot deceive me! We know you now. You have ruined my son, but you\ndon\'t care; and you go giving balls; and your daughter--my son\'s\nbetrothed--is to be married and make a good match, that you approve of;\nwhile you pretend to lead a simple life, and go carpentering. How\nrepulsive you are to me, with your new-fangled Pharisaism.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Don\'t excite yourself so, Princess. Tell me what you\nhave come for--surely it was not simply to scold me?\n\nPRINCESS. Yes, that too! I must find vent for all this accumulated\npain. But what I want is this: He is being removed to the Disciplinary\nBattalion, and I cannot bear it. It is you who have done it. You! You!\nYou!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Not I, but God. And God knows how sorry I am for\nyou. Do not resist this will. He wants to test you. Bear the trial\nmeekly.\n\nPRINCESS. I cannot bear it meekly. My whole life was wrapped up in my\nson; and you have taken him from me and ruined him. I cannot be calm. I\nhave come to you--it is my last attempt to tell you that you have ruined\nhim and that it is for you to save him. Go and prevail on them to set\nhim free. Go and see the Governor-General, the Emperor, or whom you\nplease. It is your duty to do it. If you don\'t do it, I know what I\nshall do. You will have to answer to me for it!\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Teach me what to do. I am ready to do anything.\n\nPRINCESS. I again repeat it--you must save him! If you do not--beware!\nGood-bye. [Exit].\n\n    Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich (alone). Lies down on sofa. Silence. The door\n    opens and the dance music sounds louder. Enter Sty\xc3\xb3pa.\n\nSTY\xc3\x93PA. Papa is not here, come in!\n\n    Enter the adults and the children, dancing in couples.\n\nLY\xc3\x9aBA [noticing Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich] Ah, you _are_ here. Excuse us.\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH [rising] Never mind. [Exit dancing couples].\n\nNICHOLAS IV\xc3\x81NOVICH. Vas\xc3\xadly Nikon\xc3\xb3rovich has recanted. I have ruined\nBor\xc3\xads. Ly\xc3\xbaba is getting married. Can it be that I have been mistaken?\nMistaken in believing in Thee? No! Father help me!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nTolstoy left the following notes for a fifth act which was never\nwritten.\n\n\n\n\nACT V\n\nDisciplinary Battalion. A cell. Prisoners sitting and lying. Bor\xc3\xads is\nreading the Gospel and explaining it. A man who has been flogged is\nbrought in. "Ah, if there were but a Pugachev[41] to revenge us on such\nas you." The Princess bursts in, but is turned out. Conflict with an\nofficer. Prisoners led to prayers. Bor\xc3\xads sent to the Penitentiary Cell:\n"He shall be flogged!"\n\n  [41] Pugachev was the leader of a formidable rebellion in Russia in\n  the eighteenth century.\n\n\nScene changes.\n\nThe Tsar\'s Cabinet. Cigarettes; jokes; caresses. The Princess is\nannounced. "Let her wait." Enter petitioners, flattery, then the\nPrincess. Her request is refused. Exit.\n\n\nScene changes.\n\nMary Iv\xc3\xa1novna talks about illness with the doctor. "He has changed, has\nbecome more gentle, but is dispirited." Enter Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich and\nspeaks to Doctor about the uselessness of treatment. But for his wife\'s\nsake he agrees to it. Enter T\xc3\xb3nya with Sty\xc3\xb3pa. Ly\xc3\xbaba with Stark\xc3\xb3vsky.\nConversation about land. Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich tries not to offend them.\nExeunt all. Nicholas Iv\xc3\xa1novich with Lisa. "I am always in doubt whether\nI have done right. I have accomplished nothing. Bor\xc3\xads has perished,\nVas\xc3\xadly Nikon\xc3\xb3rovich has recanted. I set an example of weakness.\nEvidently God does not wish me to be his servant. He has many other\nservants--and can accomplish his will without me, and he who realises\nthis is at peace." Exit Lisa. He prays. The Princess rushes in and\nshoots him. Everybody comes running into the room. He says he did it\nhimself by accident. He writes a petition to the Emperor. Enter Vas\xc3\xadly\nNikon\xc3\xb3rovich with Doukhobors.[42] Dies rejoicing that the fraud of the\nChurch is exposed, and that he has understood the meaning of his life.\n\n  [42] Tolstoy did not fully realise the facts (described in _A Peculiar\n  People_) of the Doukhobors\' submission to their leader, or of their\n  belief in him as an incarnation of the Deity. In fact, when he wrote\n  this play, Tolstoy regarded the Doukhobors as a type of what all\n  Christians should be.\n\n_This play was begun in the \'eighties, and continued in 1900 and 1902._\n\n\n                 END OF "THE LIGHT SHINES IN DARKNESS."\n\n\n\n[ Transcriber\'s Note:\n\n  The following is a list of corrections made to the original.
