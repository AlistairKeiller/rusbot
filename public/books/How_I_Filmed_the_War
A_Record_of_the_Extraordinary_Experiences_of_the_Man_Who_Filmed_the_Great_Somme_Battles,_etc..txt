THE BEGINNING OF OUR FRIENDSHIP\n\n\n\n\nI.\nA SLOW JOURNEY\n\n\nAgain two carriages stood at the front door of the house at Petrovskoe.\nIn one of them sat Mimi, the two girls, and their maid, with the\nbailiff, Jakoff, on the box, while in the other\xe2\x80\x94a _britchka_\xe2\x80\x94sat\nWoloda, myself, and our servant Vassili. Papa, who was to follow us to\nMoscow in a few days, was standing bareheaded on the entrance-steps. He\nmade the sign of the cross at the windows of the carriages, and said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrist go with you! Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJakoff and our coachman (for we had our own horses) lifted their caps\nin answer, and also made the sign of the cross.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen. God go with us!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe carriages began to roll away, and the birch-trees of the great\navenue filed out of sight.\n\nI was not in the least depressed on this occasion, for my mind was not\nso much turned upon what I had left as upon what was awaiting me. In\nproportion as the various objects connected with the sad recollections\nwhich had recently filled my imagination receded behind me, those\nrecollections lost their power, and gave place to a consolatory feeling\nof life, youthful vigour, freshness, and hope.\n\nSeldom have I spent four days more\xe2\x80\x94well, I will not say gaily, since I\nshould still have shrunk from appearing gay\xe2\x80\x94but more agreeably and\npleasantly than those occupied by our journey.\n\nNo longer were my eyes confronted with the closed door of Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s room\n(which I had never been able to pass without a pang), nor with the\ncovered piano (which nobody opened now, and at which I could never look\nwithout trembling), nor with mourning dresses (we had each of us on our\nordinary travelling clothes), nor with all those other objects which\nrecalled to me so vividly our irreparable loss, and forced me to\nabstain from any manifestation of merriment lest I should unwittingly\noffend against _her_ memory.\n\nOn the contrary, a continual succession of new and exciting objects and\nplaces now caught and held my attention, and the charms of spring\nawakened in my soul a soothing sense of satisfaction with the present\nand of blissful hope for the future.\n\nVery early next morning the merciless Vassili (who had only just\nentered our service, and was therefore, like most people in such a\nposition, zealous to a fault) came and stripped off my counterpane,\naffirming that it was time for me to get up, since everything was in\nreadiness for us to continue our journey. Though I felt inclined to\nstretch myself and rebel\xe2\x80\x94though I would gladly have spent another\nquarter of an hour in sweet enjoyment of my morning slumber\xe2\x80\x94Vassili\xe2\x80\x99s\ninexorable face showed that he would grant me no respite, but that he\nwas ready to tear away the counterpane twenty times more if necessary.\nAccordingly I submitted myself to the inevitable and ran down into the\ncourtyard to wash myself at the fountain.\n\nIn the coffee-room, a tea-kettle was already surmounting the fire which\nMilka the ostler, as red in the face as a crab, was blowing with a pair\nof bellows. All was grey and misty in the courtyard, like steam from a\nsmoking dunghill, but in the eastern sky the sun was diffusing a clear,\ncheerful radiance, and making the straw roofs of the sheds around the\ncourtyard sparkle with the night dew. Beneath them stood our horses,\ntied to mangers, and I could hear the ceaseless sound of their chewing.\nA curly-haired dog which had been spending the night on a dry dunghill\nnow rose in lazy fashion and, wagging its tail, walked slowly across\nthe courtyard.\n\nThe bustling landlady opened the creaking gates, turned her meditative\ncows into the street (whence came the lowing and bellowing of other\ncattle), and exchanged a word or two with a sleepy neighbour. Philip,\nwith his shirt-sleeves rolled up, was working the windlass of a\ndraw-well, and sending sparkling fresh water coursing into an oaken\ntrough, while in the pool beneath it some early-rising ducks were\ntaking a bath. It gave me pleasure to watch his strongly-marked,\nbearded face, and the veins and muscles as they stood out upon his\ngreat powerful hands whenever he made an extra effort. In the room\nbehind the partition-wall where Mimi and the girls had slept (yet so\nnear to ourselves that we had exchanged confidences overnight)\nmovements now became audible, their maid kept passing in and out with\nclothes, and, at last the door opened and we were summoned to\nbreakfast. Woloda, however, remained in a state of bustle throughout as\nhe ran to fetch first one article and then another and urged the maid\nto hasten her preparations.\n\nThe horses were put to, and showed their impatience by tinkling their\nbells. Parcels, trunks, dressing-cases, and boxes were replaced, and we\nset about taking our seats. Yet, every time that we got in, the\nmountain of luggage in the _britchka_ seemed to have grown larger than\nbefore, and we had much ado to understand how things had been arranged\nyesterday, and how we should sit now. A tea-chest, in particular,\ngreatly inconvenienced me, but Vassili declared that \xe2\x80\x9cthings will soon\nright themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d and I had no choice but to believe him.\n\nThe sun was just rising, covered with dense white clouds, and every\nobject around us was standing out in a cheerful, calm sort of radiance.\nThe whole was beautiful to look at, and I felt comfortable and light of\nheart.\n\nBefore us the road ran like a broad, sinuous ribbon through cornfields\nglittering with dew. Here and there a dark bush or young birch-tree\ncast a long shadow over the ruts and scattered grass-tufts of the\ntrack. Yet even the monotonous din of our carriage-wheels and\ncollar-bells could not drown the joyous song of soaring larks, nor the\ncombined odour of moth-eaten cloth, dust, and sourness peculiar to our\n_britchka_ overpower the fresh scents of the morning. I felt in my\nheart that delightful impulse to be up and doing which is a sign of\nsincere enjoyment.\n\nAs I had not been able to say my prayers in the courtyard of the inn,\nbut had nevertheless been assured once that on the very first day when\nI omitted to perform that ceremony some misfortune would overtake me, I\nnow hastened to rectify the omission. Taking off my cap, and stooping\ndown in a corner of the _britchka_, I duly recited my orisons, and\nunobtrusively signed the sign of the cross beneath my coat. Yet all the\nwhile a thousand different objects were distracting my attention, and\nmore than once I inadvertently repeated a prayer twice over.\n\nSoon on the little footpath beside the road became visible some slowly\nmoving figures. They were pilgrims. On their heads they had dirty\nhandkerchiefs, on their backs wallets of birch-bark, and on their feet\nbundles of soiled rags and heavy bast shoes. Moving their staffs in\nregular rhythm, and scarcely throwing us a glance, they pressed onwards\nwith heavy tread and in single file.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have they come from?\xe2\x80\x9d I wondered to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cand whither are\nthey bound? Is it a long pilgrimage they are making?\xe2\x80\x9d But soon the\nshadows they cast on the road became indistinguishable from the shadows\nof the bushes which they passed.\n\nNext a carriage-and-four could be seen approaching us. In two seconds\nthe faces which looked out at us from it with smiling curiosity had\nvanished. How strange it seemed that those faces should have nothing in\ncommon with me, and that in all probability they would never meet my\neyes again!\n\nNext came a pair of post-horses, with the traces looped up to their\ncollars. On one of them a young postillion\xe2\x80\x94his lamb\xe2\x80\x99s wool cap cocked\nto one side\xe2\x80\x94was negligently kicking his booted legs against the flanks\nof his steed as he sang a melancholy ditty. Yet his face and attitude\nseemed to me to express such perfect carelessness and indolent ease\nthat I imagined it to be the height of happiness to be a postillion and\nto sing melancholy songs.\n\nFar off, through a cutting in the road, there soon stood out against\nthe light-blue sky, the green roof of a village church. Presently the\nvillage itself became visible, together with the roof of the\nmanor-house and the garden attached to it. Who lived in that house?\nChildren, parents, teachers? Why should we not call there and make the\nacquaintance of its inmates?\n\nNext we overtook a file of loaded waggons\xe2\x80\x94a procession to which our\nvehicles had to yield the road.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got in there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Vassili of one waggoner who was\ndangling his legs lazily over the splashboard of his conveyance and\nflicking his whip about as he gazed at us with a stolid, vacant look;\nbut he only made answer when we were too far off to catch what he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what have _you_ got?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Vassili of a second waggoner who was\nlying at full length under a new rug on the driving-seat of his\nvehicle. The red poll and red face beneath it lifted themselves up for\na second from the folds of the rug, measured our _britchka_ with a\ncold, contemptuous look, and lay down again; whereupon I concluded that\nthe driver was wondering to himself who we were, whence we had come,\nand whither we were going.\n\nThese various objects of interest had absorbed so much of my time that,\nas yet, I had paid no attention to the crooked figures on the verst\nposts as we passed them in rapid succession; but in time the sun began\nto burn my head and back, the road to become increasingly dusty, the\nimpedimenta in the carriage to grow more and more uncomfortable, and\nmyself to feel more and more cramped. Consequently, I relapsed into\ndevoting my whole faculties to the distance-posts and their numerals,\nand to solving difficult mathematical problems for reckoning the time\nwhen we should arrive at the next posting-house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve versts are a third of thirty-six, and in all there are\nforty-one to Lipetz. We have done a third and how much, then?\xe2\x80\x9d, and so\nforth, and so forth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVassili,\xe2\x80\x9d was my next remark, on observing that he was beginning to\nnod on the box-seat, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose we change seats? Will you?\xe2\x80\x9d Vassili\nagreed, and had no sooner stretched himself out in the body of the\nvehicle than he began to snore. To me on my new perch, however, a most\ninteresting spectacle now became visible\xe2\x80\x94namely, our horses, all of\nwhich were familiar to me down to the smallest detail.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is Diashak on the right today, Philip, not on the left?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked\nknowingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Nerusinka is not doing her proper share of the\npulling.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne could not put Diashak on the left,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Philip, altogether\nignoring my last remark. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not the kind of horse to put there at\nall. A horse like the one on the left now is the right kind of one for\nthe job.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter this fragment of eloquence, Philip turned towards Diashak and\nbegan to do his best to worry the poor animal by jogging at the reins,\nin spite of the fact that Diashak was doing well and dragging the\nvehicle almost unaided. This Philip continued to do until he found it\nconvenient to breathe and rest himself awhile and to settle his cap\naskew, though it had looked well enough before.\n\nI profited by the opportunity to ask him to let me have the reins to\nhold, until, the whole six in my hand, as well as the whip, I had\nattained complete happiness. Several times I asked whether I was doing\nthings right, but, as usual, Philip was never satisfied, and soon\ndestroyed my felicity.\n\nThe heat increased until a hand showed itself at the carriage window,\nand waved a bottle and a parcel of eatables; whereupon Vassili leapt\nbriskly from the _britchka_, and ran forward to get us something to eat\nand drink.\n\nWhen we arrived at a steep descent, we all got out and ran down it to a\nlittle bridge, while Vassili and Jakoff followed, supporting the\ncarriage on either side, as though to hold it up in the event of its\nthreatening to upset.\n\nAfter that, Mimi gave permission for a change of seats, and sometimes\nWoloda or myself would ride in the carriage, and Lubotshka or Katenka\nin the _britchka_. This arrangement greatly pleased the girls, since\nmuch more fun went on in the _britchka_. Just when the day was at its\nhottest, we got out at a wood, and, breaking off a quantity of\nbranches, transformed our vehicle into a bower. This travelling arbour\nthen bustled on to catch the carriage up, and had the effect of\nexciting Lubotshka to one of those piercing shrieks of delight which\nshe was in the habit of occasionally emitting.\n\nAt last we drew near the village where we were to halt and dine.\nAlready we could perceive the smell of the place\xe2\x80\x94the smell of smoke and\ntar and sheep\xe2\x80\x94and distinguish the sound of voices, footsteps, and\ncarts. The bells on our horses began to ring less clearly than they had\ndone in the open country, and on both sides the road became lined with\nhuts\xe2\x80\x94dwellings with straw roofs, carved porches, and small red or green\npainted shutters to the windows, through which, here and there, was a\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s face looking inquisitively out. Peasant children clad in smocks\nonly stood staring open-eyed or, stretching out their arms to us, ran\nbarefooted through the dust to climb on to the luggage behind, despite\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s menacing gestures. Likewise, red-haired waiters came darting\naround the carriages to invite us, with words and signs, to select\ntheir several hostelries as our halting-place.\n\nPresently a gate creaked, and we entered a courtyard. Four hours of\nrest and liberty now awaited us.\n\n\n\n\nII.\nTHE THUNDERSTORM\n\n\nThe sun was sinking towards the west, and his long, hot rays were\nburning my neck and cheeks beyond endurance, while thick clouds of dust\nwere rising from the road and filling the whole air. Not the slightest\nwind was there to carry it away. I could not think what to do. Neither\nthe dust-blackened face of Woloda dozing in a corner, nor the motion of\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s back, nor the long shadow of our _britchka_ as it came bowling\nalong behind us brought me any relief. I concentrated my whole\nattention upon the distance-posts ahead and the clouds which, hitherto\ndispersed over the sky, were now assuming a menacing blackness, and\nbeginning to form themselves into a single solid mass.\n\nFrom time to time distant thunder could be heard\xe2\x80\x94a circumstance which\ngreatly increased my impatience to arrive at the inn where we were to\nspend the night. A thunderstorm always communicated to me an\ninexpressibly oppressive feeling of fear and gloom.\n\nYet we were still ten versts from the next village, and in the\nmeanwhile the large purple cloudbank\xe2\x80\x94arisen from no one knows where\xe2\x80\x94was\nadvancing steadily towards us. The sun, not yet obscured, was picking\nout its fuscous shape with dazzling light, and marking its front with\ngrey stripes running right down to the horizon. At intervals, vivid\nlightning could be seen in the distance, followed by low rumbles which\nincreased steadily in volume until they merged into a prolonged roll\nwhich seemed to embrace the entire heavens. At length, Vassili got up\nand covered over the _britchka_, the coachman wrapped himself up in his\ncloak and lifted his cap to make the sign of the cross at each\nsuccessive thunderclap, and the horses pricked up their ears and\nsnorted as though to drink in the fresh air which the flying clouds\nwere outdistancing. The _britchka_ began to roll more swiftly along the\ndusty road, and I felt uneasy, and as though the blood were coursing\nmore quickly through my veins. Soon the clouds had veiled the face of\nthe sun, and though he threw a last gleam of light to the dark and\nterrifying horizon, he had no choice but to disappear behind them.\n\nSuddenly everything around us seemed changed, and assumed a gloomy\naspect. A wood of aspen trees which we were passing seemed to be all in\na tremble, with its leaves showing white against the dark lilac\nbackground of the clouds, murmuring together in an agitated manner. The\ntops of the larger trees began to bend to and fro, and dried leaves and\ngrass to whirl about in eddies over the road. Swallows and\nwhite-breasted swifts came darting around the _britchka_ and even\npassing in front of the forelegs of the horses. While rooks, despite\ntheir outstretched wings, were laid, as it were, on their keels by the\nwind. Finally, the leather apron which covered us began to flutter\nabout and to beat against the sides of the conveyance.\n\nThe lightning flashed right into the _britchka_ as, cleaving the\nobscurity for a second, it lit up the grey cloth and silk galloon of\nthe lining and Woloda\xe2\x80\x99s figure pressed back into a corner.\n\nNext came a terrible sound which, rising higher and higher, and\nspreading further and further, increased until it reached its climax in\na deafening thunderclap which made us tremble and hold our breaths.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wrath of God\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94what poetry there is in that simple popular\nconception!\n\nThe pace of the vehicle was continually increasing, and from Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\nand Vassili\xe2\x80\x99s backs (the former was tugging furiously at the reins) I\ncould see that they too were alarmed.\n\nBowling rapidly down an incline, the _britchka_ cannoned violently\nagainst a wooden bridge at the bottom. I dared not stir and expected\ndestruction every moment.\n\nCrack! A trace had given way, and, in spite of the ceaseless, deafening\nthunderclaps, we had to pull up on the bridge.\n\nLeaning my head despairingly against the side of the _britchka_, I\nfollowed with a beating heart the movements of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s great black\nfingers as he tied up the broken trace and, with hands and the butt-end\nof the whip, pushed the harness vigorously back into its place.\n\nMy sense of terror was increasing with the violence of the thunder.\nIndeed, at the moment of supreme silence which generally precedes the\ngreatest intensity of a storm, it mounted to such a height that I felt\nas though another quarter of an hour of this emotion would kill me.\n\nJust then there appeared from beneath the bridge a human being who,\nclad in a torn, filthy smock, and supported on a pair of thin shanks\nbare of muscles, thrust an idiotic face, a tremulous, bare, shaven\nhead, and a pair of red, shining stumps in place of hands into the\n_britchka_.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cM-my lord! A copeck for\xe2\x80\x94for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned a feeble voice as at\neach word the wretched being made the sign of the cross and bowed\nhimself to the ground.\n\nI cannot describe the chill feeling of horror which penetrated my heart\nat that moment. A shudder crept through all my hair, and my eyes stared\nin vacant terror at the outcast.\n\nVassili, who was charged with the apportioning of alms during the\njourney, was busy helping Philip, and only when everything had been put\nstraight and Philip had resumed the reins again had he time to look for\nhis purse. Hardly had the _britchka_ begun to move when a blinding\nflash filled the welkin with a blaze of light which brought the horses\nto their haunches. Then, the flash was followed by such an\near-splitting roar that the very vault of heaven seemed to be\ndescending upon our heads. The wind blew harder than ever, and\nVassili\xe2\x80\x99s cloak, the manes and tails of the horses, and the\ncarriage-apron were all slanted in one direction as they waved\nfuriously in the violent blast.\n\nPresently, upon the _britchka\xe2\x80\x99s_ top there fell some large drops of\nrain\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cone, two, three:\xe2\x80\x9d then suddenly, and as though a roll of drums\nwere being beaten over our heads, the whole countryside resounded with\nthe clatter of the deluge.\n\nFrom Vassili\xe2\x80\x99s movements, I could see that he had now got his purse\nopen, and that the poor outcast was still bowing and making the sign of\nthe cross as he ran beside the wheels of the vehicle, at the imminent\nrisk of being run over, and reiterated from time to time his plea,\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor-for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d At last a copeck rolled upon the ground, and the\nmiserable creature\xe2\x80\x94his mutilated arms, with their sleeves wet through\nand through, held out before him\xe2\x80\x94stopped perplexed in the roadway and\nvanished from my sight.\n\nThe heavy rain, driven before the tempestuous wind, poured down in\npailfuls and, dripping from Vassili\xe2\x80\x99s thick cloak, formed a series of\npools on the apron. The dust became changed to a paste which clung to\nthe wheels, and the ruts became transformed into muddy rivulets.\n\nAt last, however, the lightning grew paler and more diffuse, and the\nthunderclaps lost some of their terror amid the monotonous rattling of\nthe downpour. Then the rain also abated, and the clouds began to\ndisperse. In the region of the sun, a lightness appeared, and between\nthe white-grey clouds could be caught glimpses of an azure sky.\n\nFinally, a dazzling ray shot across the pools on the road, shot through\nthe threads of rain\xe2\x80\x94now falling thin and straight, as from a sieve\xe2\x80\x94,\nand fell upon the fresh leaves and blades of grass. The great cloud was\nstill louring black and threatening on the far horizon, but I no longer\nfelt afraid of it\xe2\x80\x94I felt only an inexpressibly pleasant hopefulness in\nproportion, as trust in life replaced the late burden of fear. Indeed,\nmy heart was smiling like that of refreshed, revivified Nature herself.\n\nVassili took off his cloak and wrung the water from it. Woloda flung\nback the apron, and I stood up in the _britchka_ to drink in the new,\nfresh, balm-laden air. In front of us was the carriage, rolling along\nand looking as wet and resplendent in the sunlight as though it had\njust been polished. On one side of the road boundless oatfields,\nintersected in places by small ravines which now showed bright with\ntheir moist earth and greenery, stretched to the far horizon like a\ncheckered carpet, while on the other side of us an aspen wood,\nintermingled with hazel bushes, and parquetted with wild thyme in\njoyous profusion, no longer rustled and trembled, but slowly dropped\nrich, sparkling diamonds from its newly-bathed branches on to the\nwithered leaves of last year.\n\nFrom above us, from every side, came the happy songs of little birds\ncalling to one another among the dripping brushwood, while clear from\nthe inmost depths of the wood sounded the voice of the cuckoo. So\ndelicious was the wondrous scent of the wood, the scent which follows a\nthunderstorm in spring, the scent of birch-trees, violets, mushrooms,\nand thyme, that I could no longer remain in the _britchka_. Jumping\nout, I ran to some bushes, and, regardless of the showers of drops\ndischarged upon me, tore off a few sprigs of thyme, and buried my face\nin them to smell their glorious scent.\n\nThen, despite the mud which had got into my boots, as also the fact\nthat my stockings were soaked, I went skipping through the puddles to\nthe window of the carriage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLubotshka! Katenka!\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted as I handed them some of the thyme,\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look how delicious this is!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe girls smelt it and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cA-ah!\xe2\x80\x9d but Mimi shrieked to me to go\naway, for fear I should be run over by the wheels.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but smell how delicious it is!\xe2\x80\x9d I persisted.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\nA NEW POINT OF VIEW\n\n\nKatenka was with me in the _britchka;_ her lovely head inclined as she\ngazed pensively at the roadway. I looked at her in silence and wondered\nwhat had brought the unchildlike expression of sadness to her face\nwhich I now observed for the first time there.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall soon be in Moscow,\xe2\x80\x9d I said at last. \xe2\x80\x9cHow large do you suppose\nit is?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but how large do you _imagine?_ As large as Serpukhov?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYet the instinctive feeling which enables one person to guess the\nthoughts of another and serves as a guiding thread in conversation soon\nmade Katenka feel that her indifference was disagreeable to me;\nwherefore she raised her head presently, and, turning round, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your Papa tell you that we girls too were going to live at your\nGrandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he said that we should _all_ live there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_All_ live there?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course. We shall have one half of the upper floor, and you the\nother half, and Papa the wing; but we shall all of us dine together\nwith Grandmamma downstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mamma says that your Grandmamma is so very grave and so easily\nmade angry?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she only _seems_ like that at first. She is grave, but not\nbad-tempered. On the contrary, she is both kind and cheerful. If you\ncould only have seen the ball at her house!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, I am afraid of her. Besides, who knows whether we\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKatenka stopped short, and once again became thoughtful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked with some anxiety.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, I only said that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You said, \xe2\x80\x98Who knows whether we\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _you_ said, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you, that once there was ever such a ball at\nGrandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It is a pity you were not there. There were heaps of guests\xe2\x80\x94about\na thousand people, and all of them princes or generals, and there was\nmusic, and I danced\xe2\x80\x94But, Katenka\xe2\x80\x9d I broke off, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not listening\nto me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I am listening. You said that you danced\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, one cannot _always_ be gay.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have changed tremendously since Woloda and I first went to\nMoscow. Tell me the truth, now: why are you so odd?\xe2\x80\x9d My tone was\nresolute.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Am_ I so odd?\xe2\x80\x9d said Katenka with an animation which showed me that my\nquestion had interested her. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that I am so at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you are not the same as you were before,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce\nupon a time any one could see that you were our equal in everything,\nand that you loved us like relations, just as we did you; but now you\nare always serious, and keep yourself apart from us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let me finish, please,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted, already conscious of a\nslight tickling in my nose\xe2\x80\x94the precursor of the tears which usually\ncame to my eyes whenever I had to vent any long pent-up feeling. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\navoid us, and talk to no one but Mimi, as though you had no wish for\nour further acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut one cannot always remain the same\xe2\x80\x94one _must_ change a little\nsometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Katenka, who had an inveterate habit of pleading\nsome such fatalistic necessity whenever she did not know what else to\nsay.\n\nI recollect that once, when having a quarrel with Lubotshka, who had\ncalled her \xe2\x80\x9ca stupid girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she (Katenka) retorted that _everybody_\ncould not be wise, seeing that a certain number of stupid people was a\nnecessity in the world. However, on the present occasion, I was not\nsatisfied that any such inevitable necessity for \xe2\x80\x9cchanging sometimes\xe2\x80\x9d\nexisted, and asked further:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Why_ is it necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, we _may_ not always go on living together as we are\ndoing now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Katenka, colouring slightly, and regarding Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\nback with a grave expression on her face. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Mamma was able to live\nwith your mother because she was her friend; but will a similar\narrangement always suit the Countess, who, they say, is so easily\noffended? Besides, in any case, we shall have to separate _some_ day.\nYou are rich\xe2\x80\x94you have Petrovskoe, while we are poor\xe2\x80\x94Mamma has nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are rich,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwe are poor\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94both the words and the ideas which they\nconnoted seemed to me extremely strange. Hitherto, I had conceived that\nonly beggars and peasants were poor and could not reconcile in my mind\nthe idea of poverty and the graceful, charming Katenka. I felt that\nMimi and her daughter ought to live with us _always_ and to share\neverything that we possessed. Things ought never to be otherwise. Yet,\nat this moment, a thousand new thoughts with regard to their lonely\nposition came crowding into my head, and I felt so remorseful at the\nnotion that we were rich and they poor, that I coloured up and could\nnot look Katenka in the face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet what does it matter,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we are well off and they\nare not? Why should that necessitate a separation? Why should we not\nshare in common what we possess?\xe2\x80\x9d Yet, I had a feeling that I could not\ntalk to Katenka on the subject, since a certain practical instinct,\nopposed to all logical reasoning, warned me that, right though she\npossibly was, I should do wrong to tell her so.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible that you should leave us. How could we ever live\napart?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet what else is there to be done? Certainly I do not _want_ to do it;\nyet, if it _has_ to be done, I know what my plan in life will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to become an actress! How absurd!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed (for I knew that\nto enter that profession had always been her favourite dream).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. I only used to say that when I was a little girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then? What?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo go into a convent and live there. Then I could walk out in a black\ndress and velvet cap!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Katenka.\n\nHas it ever befallen you, my readers, to become suddenly aware that\nyour conception of things has altered\xe2\x80\x94as though every object in life\nhad unexpectedly turned a side towards you of which you had hitherto\nremained unaware? Such a species of moral change occurred, as regards\nmyself, during this journey, and therefore from it I date the beginning\nof my boyhood. For the first time in my life, I then envisaged the idea\nthat we\xe2\x80\x94_i.e._ our family\xe2\x80\x94were not the only persons in the world; that\nnot every conceivable interest was centred in ourselves; and that there\nexisted numbers of people who had nothing in common with us, cared\nnothing for us, and even knew nothing of our existence. No doubt I had\nknown all this before\xe2\x80\x94only I had not known it then as I knew it now; I\nhad never properly felt or understood it.\n\nThought merges into conviction through paths of its own, as well as,\nsometimes, with great suddenness and by methods wholly different from\nthose which have brought other intellects to the same conclusion. For\nme the conversation with Katenka\xe2\x80\x94striking deeply as it did, and forcing\nme to reflect on her future position\xe2\x80\x94constituted such a path. As I\ngazed at the towns and villages through which we passed, and in each\nhouse of which lived at least one family like our own, as well as at\nthe women and children who stared with curiosity at our carriages and\nthen became lost to sight for ever, and the peasants and workmen who\ndid not even look at us, much less make us any obeisance, the question\narose for the first time in my thoughts, \xe2\x80\x9cWhom else do they care for if\nnot for us?\xe2\x80\x9d And this question was followed by others, such as, \xe2\x80\x9cTo\nwhat end do they live?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow do they educate their children?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDo they\nteach their children and let them play? What are their names?\xe2\x80\x9d and so\nforth.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\nIN MOSCOW\n\n\nFrom the time of our arrival in Moscow, the change in my conception of\nobjects, of persons, and of my connection with them became increasingly\nperceptible. When at my first meeting with Grandmamma, I saw her thin,\nwrinkled face and faded eyes, the mingled respect and fear with which\nshe had hitherto inspired me gave place to compassion, and when, laying\nher cheek against Lubotshka\xe2\x80\x99s head, she sobbed as though she saw before\nher the corpse of her beloved daughter, my compassion grew to love.\n\nI felt deeply sorry to see her grief at our meeting, even though I knew\nthat in ourselves we represented nothing in her eyes, but were dear to\nher only as reminders of our mother\xe2\x80\x94that every kiss which she imprinted\nupon my cheeks expressed the one thought, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is no more\xe2\x80\x94she is dead,\nand I shall never see her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPapa, who took little notice of us here in Moscow, and whose face was\nperpetually preoccupied on the rare occasions when he came in his black\ndress-coat to take formal dinner with us, lost much in my eyes at this\nperiod, in spite of his turned-up ruffles, _robes de chambre_,\noverseers, bailiffs, expeditions to the estate, and hunting exploits.\n\nKarl Ivanitch\xe2\x80\x94whom Grandmamma always called \xe2\x80\x9cUncle,\xe2\x80\x9d and who (Heaven\nknows why!) had taken it into his head to adorn the bald pate of my\nchildhood\xe2\x80\x99s days with a red wig parted in the middle\xe2\x80\x94now looked to me\nso strange and ridiculous that I wondered how I could ever have failed\nto observe the fact before. Even between the girls and ourselves there\nseemed to have sprung up an invisible barrier. They, too, began to have\nsecrets among themselves, as well as to evince a desire to show off\ntheir ever-lengthening skirts even as we boys did our trousers and\nankle-straps. As for Mimi, she appeared at luncheon, the first Sunday,\nin such a gorgeous dress and with so many ribbons in her cap that it\nwas clear that we were no longer _en campagne_, and that everything was\nnow going to be different.\n\n\n\n\nV.\nMY ELDER BROTHER\n\n\nI was only a year and some odd months younger than Woloda, and from the\nfirst we had grown up and studied and played together. Hitherto, the\ndifference between elder and younger brother had never been felt\nbetween us, but at the period of which I am speaking, I began to have a\nnotion that I was not Woloda\xe2\x80\x99s equal either in years, in tastes, or in\ncapabilities. I even began to fancy that Woloda himself was aware of\nhis superiority and that he was proud of it, and, though, perhaps, I\nwas wrong, the idea wounded my conceit\xe2\x80\x94already suffering from frequent\ncomparison with him. He was my superior in everything\xe2\x80\x94in games, in\nstudies, in quarrels, and in deportment. All this brought about an\nestrangement between us and occasioned me moral sufferings which I had\nnever hitherto experienced.\n\nWhen for the first time Woloda wore Dutch pleated shirts, I at once\nsaid that I was greatly put out at not being given similar ones, and\neach time that he arranged his collar, I felt that he was doing so on\npurpose to offend me. But, what tormented me most of all was the idea\nthat Woloda could see through me, yet did not choose to show it.\n\nWho has not known those secret, wordless communications which spring\nfrom some barely perceptible smile or movement\xe2\x80\x94from a casual glance\nbetween two persons who live as constantly together as do brothers,\nfriends, man and wife, or master and servant\xe2\x80\x94particularly if those two\npersons do not in all things cultivate mutual frankness? How many\nhalf-expressed wishes, thoughts, and meanings which one shrinks from\nrevealing are made plain by a single accidental glance which timidly\nand irresolutely meets the eye!\n\nHowever, in my own case I may have been deceived by my excessive\ncapacity for, and love of, analysis. Possibly Woloda did not feel at\nall as I did. Passionate and frank, but unstable in his likings, he was\nattracted by the most diverse things, and always surrendered himself\nwholly to such attraction. For instance, he suddenly conceived a\npassion for pictures, spent all his money on their purchase, begged\nPapa, Grandmamma, and his drawing master to add to their number, and\napplied himself with enthusiasm to art. Next came a sudden rage for\ncurios, with which he covered his table, and for which he ransacked the\nwhole house. Following upon that, he took to violent\nnovel-reading\xe2\x80\x94procuring such works by stealth, and devouring them day\nand night. Involuntarily I was influenced by his whims, for, though too\nproud to imitate him, I was also too young and too lacking in\nindependence to choose my own way. Above all, I envied Woloda his\nhappy, nobly frank character, which showed itself most strikingly when\nwe quarrelled. I always felt that he was in the right, yet could not\nimitate him. For instance, on one occasion when his passion for curios\nwas at its height, I went to his table and accidentally broke an empty\nmany-coloured smelling-bottle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave you leave to touch my things?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Woloda, chancing to\nenter the room at that moment and at once perceiving the disorder which\nI had occasioned in the orderly arrangement of the treasures on his\ntable. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is that smelling bottle? Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI let it fall, and it smashed to pieces; but what does that matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, please do me the favour never to _dare_ to touch my things\nagain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he gathered up the broken fragments and looked at\nthem vexedly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will _you_ please do me the favour never to _order_ me to do\nanything whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a thing\xe2\x80\x99s broken, it\xe2\x80\x99s broken,\nand there is no more to be said.\xe2\x80\x9d Then I smiled, though I hardly felt\nlike smiling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it may mean nothing to you, but to me it means a good deal,\xe2\x80\x9d said\nWoloda, shrugging his shoulders (a habit he had caught from Papa).\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all you go and break my things, and then you laugh. What a\nnuisance a little boy can be!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Little_ boy, indeed? Then _you_, I suppose, are a man, and ever so\nwise?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not intend to quarrel with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Woloda, giving me a slight\npush. \xe2\x80\x9cGo away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you push me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say again\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you push me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWoloda took me by the hand and tried to drag me away from the table,\nbut I was excited to the last degree, and gave the table such a push\nwith my foot that I upset the whole concern, and brought china and\ncrystal ornaments and everything else with a crash to the floor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou disgusting little brute!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Woloda, trying to save some of\nhis falling treasures.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last all is over between us,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to myself as I strode from\nthe room. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are separated now for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was not until evening that we again exchanged a word. Yet I felt\nguilty, and was afraid to look at him, and remained at a loose end all\nday.\n\nWoloda, on the contrary, did his lessons as diligently as ever, and\npassed the time after luncheon in talking and laughing with the girls.\nAs soon, again, as afternoon lessons were over I left the room, for it\nwould have been terribly embarrassing for me to be alone with my\nbrother. When, too, the evening class in history was ended I took my\nnotebook and moved towards the door. Just as I passed Woloda, I pouted\nand pulled an angry face, though in reality I should have liked to have\nmade my peace with him. At the same moment he lifted his head, and with\na barely perceptible and good-humouredly satirical smile looked me full\nin the face. Our eyes met, and I saw that he understood me, while he,\nfor his part, saw that I knew that he understood me; yet a feeling\nstronger than myself obliged me to turn away from him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicolinka,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a perfectly simple and anything but\nmock-pathetic way, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been angry with me long enough. I am sorry\nif I offended you,\xe2\x80\x9d and he tendered me his hand.\n\nIt was as though something welled up from my heart and nearly choked\nme. Presently it passed away, the tears rushed to my eyes, and I felt\nimmensely relieved.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI too am so-rry, Wo-lo-da,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, taking his hand. Yet he only\nlooked at me with an expression as though he could not understand why\nthere should be tears in my eyes.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\nMASHA\n\n\nNone of the changes produced in my conception of things were so\nstriking as the one which led me to cease to see in one of our\nchambermaids a mere servant of the female sex, but, on the contrary, a\n_woman_ upon whom depended, to a certain extent, my peace of mind and\nhappiness. From the time of my earliest recollection I can remember\nMasha an inmate of our house, yet never until the occurrence of which I\nam going to speak\xe2\x80\x94an occurrence which entirely altered my impression of\nher\xe2\x80\x94had I bestowed the smallest attention upon her. She was twenty-five\nyears old, while I was but fourteen. Also, she was very beautiful. But\nI hesitate to give a further description of her lest my imagination\nshould once more picture the bewitching, though deceptive, conception\nof her which filled my mind during the period of my passion. To be\nfrank, I will only say that she was extraordinarily handsome,\nmagnificently developed, and a _woman_\xe2\x80\x94as also that I was but fourteen.\n\nAt one of those moments when, lesson-book in hand, I would pace the\nroom, and try to keep strictly to one particular crack in the floor as\nI hummed a fragment of some tune or repeated some vague formula\xe2\x80\x94in\nshort, at one of those moments when the mind leaves off thinking and\nthe imagination gains the upper hand and yearns for new impressions\xe2\x80\x94I\nleft the schoolroom, and turned, with no definite purpose in view,\ntowards the head of the staircase.\n\nSomebody in slippers was ascending the second flight of stairs. Of\ncourse I felt curious to see who it was, but the footsteps ceased\nabruptly, and then I heard Masha\xe2\x80\x99s voice say:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away! What nonsense! What would Maria Ivanovna think if she were to\ncome now?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but she will not come,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Woloda\xe2\x80\x99s voice in a whisper.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go away, you silly boy,\xe2\x80\x9d and Masha came running up, and fled\npast me.\n\nI cannot describe the way in which this discovery confounded me.\nNevertheless the feeling of amazement soon gave place to a kind of\nsympathy with Woloda\xe2\x80\x99s conduct. I found myself wondering less at the\nconduct itself than at his ability to behave so agreeably. Also, I\nfound myself involuntarily desiring to imitate him.\n\nSometimes I would pace the landing for an hour at a time, with no other\nthought in my head than to watch for movements from above. Yet,\nalthough I longed beyond all things to do as Woloda had done, I could\nnot bring myself to the point. At other times, filled with a sense of\nenvious jealousy, I would conceal myself behind a door and listen to\nthe sounds which came from the maidservants\xe2\x80\x99 room, until the thought\nwould occur to my mind, \xe2\x80\x9cHow if I were to go in now and, like Woloda,\nkiss Masha? What should I say when she asked me\xe2\x80\x94_me_ with the huge nose\nand the tuft on the top of my head\xe2\x80\x94what I wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes, too, I\ncould hear her saying to Woloda,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat serves you right! Go away! Nicolas Petrovitch never comes in here\nwith such nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d Alas! she did not know that Nicolas Petrovitch was\nsitting on the staircase just below and feeling that he would give all\nhe possessed to be in \xe2\x80\x9cthat bold fellow Woloda\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d place! I was shy by\nnature, and rendered worse in that respect by a consciousness of my own\nugliness. I am certain that nothing so much influences the development\nof a man as his exterior\xe2\x80\x94though the exterior itself less than his\nbelief in its plainness or beauty.\n\nYet I was too conceited altogether to resign myself to my fate. I tried\nto comfort myself much as the fox did when he declared that the grapes\nwere sour. That is to say, I tried to make light of the satisfaction to\nbe gained from making such use of a pleasing exterior as I believed\nWoloda to employ (satisfaction which I nevertheless envied him from my\nheart), and endeavoured with every faculty of my intellect and\nimagination to console myself with a pride in my isolation.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\nSMALL SHOT\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious! Powder!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mimi in a voice trembling with\nalarm. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever are you doing? You will set the house on fire in a\nmoment, and be the death of us all!\xe2\x80\x9d Upon that, with an indescribable\nexpression of firmness, Mimi ordered every one to stand aside, and,\nregardless of all possible danger from a premature explosion, strode\nwith long and resolute steps to where some small shot was scattered\nabout the floor, and began to trample upon it.\n\nWhen, in her opinion, the peril was at least lessened, she called for\nMichael and commanded him to throw the \xe2\x80\x9cpowder\xe2\x80\x9d away into some remote\nspot, or, better still, to immerse it in water; after which she\nadjusted her cap and returned proudly to the drawing-room, murmuring as\nshe went, \xe2\x80\x9cAt least I can say that they are well looked after.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Papa issued from his room and took us to see Grandmamma we found\nMimi sitting by the window and glancing with a grave, mysterious,\nofficial expression towards the door. In her hand she was holding\nsomething carefully wrapped in paper. I guessed that that something was\nthe small shot, and that Grandmamma had been informed of the\noccurrence. In the room also were the maidservant Gasha (who, to judge\nby her angry flushed face, was in a state of great irritation) and\nDoctor Blumenthal\xe2\x80\x94the latter a little man pitted with smallpox, who was\nendeavouring by tacit, pacificatory signs with his head and eyes to\nreassure the perturbed Gasha. Grandmamma was sitting a little askew and\nplaying that variety of \xe2\x80\x9cpatience\xe2\x80\x9d which is called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Traveller\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94two\nunmistakable signs of her displeasure.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you to-day, Mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d said Papa as he kissed her hand\nrespectfully. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you had a good night?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very good, my dear; you _know_ that I always enjoy sound health,\xe2\x80\x9d\nreplied Grandmamma in a tone implying that Papa\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries were out of\nplace and highly offensive. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease give me a clean\npocket-handkerchief,\xe2\x80\x9d she added to Gasha.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _have_ given you one, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gasha, pointing to the\nsnow-white cambric handkerchief which she had just laid on the arm of\nGrandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; it\xe2\x80\x99s a nasty, dirty thing. Take it away and bring me a _clean_\none, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGasha went to a cupboard and slammed the door of it back so violently\nthat every window rattled. Grandmamma glared angrily at each of us, and\nthen turned her attention to following the movements of the servant.\nAfter the latter had presented her with what I suspected to be the same\nhandkerchief as before, Grandmamma continued:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when do you mean to cut me some snuff, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to continue in my service you had better say so at\nonce. I would have sent you away long ago had I known that you wished\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have broken my heart if you had!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the woman in an\nundertone.\n\nHere the doctor winked at her again, but she returned his gaze so\nfirmly and wrathfully that he soon lowered it and went on playing with\nhis watch-key.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my dear, how people speak to me in my own house!\xe2\x80\x9d said\nGrandmamma to Papa when Gasha had left the room grumbling.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mamma, I will cut you some snuff myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Papa, though\nevidently at a loss how to proceed now that he had made this rash\npromise.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, I thank you. Probably she is cross because she knows that no\none except herself can cut the snuff just as I like it. Do you know, my\ndear,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your children very nearly set\nthe house on fire this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPapa gazed at Grandmamma with respectful astonishment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they were playing with something or another. Tell him the story,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe added to Mimi.\n\nPapa could not help smiling as he took the shot in his hand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is only small shot, Mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cand could never be\ndangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, my dear, for your instruction, but I am rather too old\nfor that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNerves, nerves!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the doctor.\n\nPapa turned to us and asked us where we had got the stuff, and how we\ncould dare to play with it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask _them_, ask that useless \xe2\x80\x98Uncle,\xe2\x80\x99 rather,\xe2\x80\x9d put in\nGrandmamma, laying a peculiar stress upon the word \xe2\x80\x9c_Uncle_.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\nelse is he for?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWoloda says that Karl Ivanitch gave him the powder himself,\xe2\x80\x9d declared\nMimi.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you can see for yourself what use he is,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Grandmamma.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where IS he\xe2\x80\x94this precious \xe2\x80\x98Uncle\xe2\x80\x99? How is one to get hold of him?\nSend him here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone an errand for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Papa.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not at all right,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Grandmamma. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ought _always_ to\nbe here. True, the children are yours, not mine, and I have nothing to\ndo with them, seeing that you are so much cleverer than I am; yet all\nthe same I think it is time we had a regular tutor for them, and not\nthis \xe2\x80\x98Uncle\xe2\x80\x99 of a German\xe2\x80\x94a stupid fellow who knows only how to teach\nthem rude manners and Tyrolean songs! Is it necessary, I ask you, that\nthey should learn Tyrolean songs? However, there is no one for me to\nconsult about it, and you must do just as you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe word \xe2\x80\x9c_now_\xe2\x80\x9d meant \xe2\x80\x9c_now that they have no mother_,\xe2\x80\x9d and suddenly\nawakened sad recollections in Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s heart. She threw a glance at\nthe snuff-box bearing Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s portrait and sighed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of all this long ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Papa eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cas well as taking\nyour advice on the subject. How would you like St. Jerome to\nsuperintend their lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I think he would do excellently, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Grandmamma in a\nmollified tone, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is at least a tutor _comme il faut_, and knows how\nto instruct _des enfants de bonne maison_. He is not a mere \xe2\x80\x98Uncle\xe2\x80\x99 who\nis good only for taking them out walking.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I will talk to him to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Papa. And, sure enough,\ntwo days later saw Karl Ivanitch forced to retire in favour of the\nyoung Frenchman referred to.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\nKARL IVANITCH\xe2\x80\x99S HISTORY\n\n\nThw evening before the day when Karl was to leave us for ever, he was\nstanding (clad, as usual, in his wadded dressing-gown and red cap) near\nthe bed in his room, and bending down over a trunk as he carefully\npacked his belongings.\n\nHis behaviour towards us had been very cool of late, and he had seemed\nto shrink from all contact with us. Consequently, when I entered his\nroom on the present occasion, he only glanced at me for a second and\nthen went on with his occupation. Even though I proceeded to jump on to\nhis bed (a thing hitherto always forbidden me to do), he said not a\nword; and the idea that he would soon be scolding or forgiving us no\nlonger\xe2\x80\x94no longer having anything to do with us\xe2\x80\x94reminded me vividly of\nthe impending separation. I felt grieved to think that he had ceased to\nlove us and wanted to show him my grief.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me help you?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, approaching him.\n\nHe looked at me for a moment and turned away again. Yet the expression\nof pain in his eyes showed that his coldness was not the result of\nindifference, but rather of sincere and concentrated sorrow.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod sees and knows everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length, raising himself to\nhis full height and drawing a deep sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Nicolinka,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\nobserving, the expression of sincere pity on my face, \xe2\x80\x9cmy fate has been\nan unhappy one from the cradle, and will continue so to the grave. The\ngood that I have done to people has always been repaid with evil; yet,\nthough I shall receive no reward here, I shall find one _there_\xe2\x80\x9d (he\npointed upwards). \xe2\x80\x9cAh, if only you knew my whole story, and all that I\nhave endured in this life!\xe2\x80\x94I who have been a bootmaker, a soldier, a\ndeserter, a factory hand, and a teacher! Yet now\xe2\x80\x94now I am nothing, and,\nlike the Son of Man, have nowhere to lay my head.\xe2\x80\x9d Sitting down upon a\nchair, he covered his eyes with his hand.\n\nSeeing that he was in the introspective mood in which a man pays no\nattention to his listener as he cons over his secret thoughts, I\nremained silent, and, seating myself upon the bed, continued to watch\nhis kind face.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are no longer a child. You can understand things now, and I will\ntell you my whole story and all that I have undergone. Some day, my\nchildren, you may remember the old friend who loved you so much\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe leant his elbow upon the table by his side, took a pinch of snuff,\nand, in the peculiarly measured, guttural tone in which he used to\ndictate us our lessons, began the story of his career.\n\nSince he many times in later years repeated the whole to me\nagain\xe2\x80\x94always in the same order, and with the same expressions and the\nsame unvarying intonation\xe2\x80\x94I will try to render it literally, and\nwithout omitting the innumerable grammatical errors into which he\nalways strayed when speaking in Russian. Whether it was really the\nhistory of his life, or whether it was the mere product of his\nimagination\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, some narrative which he had conceived\nduring his lonely residence in our house, and had at last, from endless\nrepetition, come to believe in himself\xe2\x80\x94or whether he was adorning with\nimaginary facts the true record of his career, I have never quite been\nable to make out. On the one hand, there was too much depth of feeling\nand practical consistency in its recital for it to be wholly\nincredible, while, on the other hand, the abundance of poetical beauty\nwhich it contained tended to raise doubts in the mind of the listener.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe vere very unhappy from ze time of my birth,\xe2\x80\x9d he began with a\nprofound sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cZe noble blot of ze Countess of Zomerblat flows in my\nveins. Me vere born six veek after ze vetting. Ze man of my _Mutter_ (I\ncalled him \xe2\x80\x98Papa\xe2\x80\x99) vere farmer to ze Count von Zomerblat. He coult not\nforget my _Mutter\xe2\x80\x99s_ shame, ant loaft me not. I had a youngster broser\nJohann ant two sister, pot me vere strange petween my own family. Ven\nJohann mate several silly trick Papa sayt, \xe2\x80\x98Wit sis chilt Karl I am\nnever to have one moment tranquil!\xe2\x80\x99 and zen he scoltet and ponishet me.\nVen ze sister quarrellet among zemselves Papa sayt, \xe2\x80\x98Karl vill never be\none opedient poy,\xe2\x80\x99 ant still scoltet ant ponishet me. My goot Mamma\nalone loaft ant tenteret me. Often she sayt to me, \xe2\x80\x98Karl, come in my\nroom,\xe2\x80\x99 ant zere she kisset me secretly. \xe2\x80\x98Poorly, poorly Karl!\xe2\x80\x99 she\nsayt. \xe2\x80\x98Nopoty loaf you, pot I will not exchange you for somepoty in ze\nworlt, One zing your _Mutter_ pegs you, to rememper,\xe2\x80\x99 sayt she to me,\n\xe2\x80\x98learn vell, ant be efer one honest man; zen Got will not forsake you.\xe2\x80\x99\nAnt I triet so to become. Ven my fourteen year hat expiret, ant me\ncoult partake of ze Holy Sopper, my _Mutter_ sayt to my _Vater_, \xe2\x80\x98Karl\nis one pig poy now, Kustaf. Vat shall we do wis him?\xe2\x80\x99 Ant Papa sayt,\n\xe2\x80\x98Me ton\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x99 Zen Mamma sayt, \xe2\x80\x98Let us give him to town at Mister\nSchultzen\xe2\x80\x99s, and he may pe a _Schumacher_,\xe2\x80\x99 ant my _Vater_ sayt,\n\xe2\x80\x98Goot!\xe2\x80\x99 Six year ant seven mons livet I in town wis ze Mister\nShoemaker, ant he loaft me. He sayt, \xe2\x80\x98Karl are one goot vorkman, ant\nshall soon become my _Geselle_.\xe2\x80\x99 Pot\xe2\x80\x94man makes ze proposition, ant Got\nze deposition. In ze year 1796 one conscription took place, ant each\nwhich vas serviceable, from ze eighteens to ze twenty-first year, hat\nto go to town.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy _Fater_ and my broser Johann come to town, ant ve go togezer to\nthrow ze lot for which shoult pe _Soldat_. Johann drew ze fatal nomper,\nand me vas not necessary to pe _Soldat_. Ant Papa sayt, \xe2\x80\x98I have only\nvun son, ant wis him I must now separate!\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDen I take his hant, ant says, \xe2\x80\x98Why say you so, Papa? Come wis me, ant\nI will say you somesing.\xe2\x80\x99 Ant Papa come, ant we seat togezer at ze\npublics-house, ant me sayt, \xe2\x80\x98Vaiter, give us one _Bierkrug_,\xe2\x80\x99 ant he\ngives us one.

Broser Johann must not\nserve; _me_ shall pe _Soldat_. Karl is for nopoty necessary, and Karl\nshall pe _Soldat_.\xe2\x80\x99\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You is one honest man, Karl,\xe2\x80\x99 sayt Papa, ant kiss me. Ant me was\n_Soldat_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nIX.\nCONTINUATION OF KARL\xe2\x80\x99S NARRATIVE\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cZat was a terrible time, Nicolinka,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Karl Ivanitch, \xe2\x80\x9cze time\nof Napoleon. He vanted to conquer Germany, ant we protected our\n_Vaterland_ to ze last trop of plot. Me vere at Ulm, me vere at\nAusterlitz, me vere at Wagram.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you really fight?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked with a gaze of astonishment \xe2\x80\x9cDid you\nreally kill anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nKarl instantly reassured me on this point,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVonce one French grenadier was left behint, ant fell to ze grount. I\nsprang forvarts wis my gon, ant vere about to kill him, _aber der\nFranzose warf sein Gewehr hin und rief_, \xe2\x80\x98Pardon\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94ant I let him loose.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Wagram, Napoleon cut us open, ant surrountet us in such a way as\nzere vas no helping. Sree days hat we no provisions, ant stoot in ze\nvater op to ze knees. Ze evil Napoleon neiser let us go loose nor\ncatchet us.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn ze fours day zey took us prisoners\xe2\x80\x94zank Got! ant sent us to one\nfortress. Upon me vas one blue trousers, uniforms of very goot clos,\nfifteen of _Thalers_, ant one silver clock which my _Vater_ hat given\nme, Ze Frans _Soldaten_ took from me everysing. For my happiness zere\nvas sree tucats on me which my Mamma hat sewn in my shirt of flannel.\nNopoty fount zem.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI liket not long to stay in ze fortresses, ant resoluted to ron away.\nVon day, von pig holitay, says I to the sergeant which hat to look\nafter us, \xe2\x80\x98Mister Sergeant, to-day is a pig holitay, ant me vants to\nceleprate it. Pring here, if you please, two pottle Mateira, ant we\nshall trink zem wis each oser.\xe2\x80\x99 Ant ze sergeant says, \xe2\x80\x98Goot!\xe2\x80\x99 Ven ze\nsergeant pring ze Mateira ant we trink it out to ze last trop, I taket\nhis hant ant says, \xe2\x80\x98Mister Sergeant, perhaps you have still one _Vater_\nand one _Mutter?_\xe2\x80\x99 He says, \xe2\x80\x98So I have, Mister Mayer.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98My _Vater_ ant\n_Mutter_ not seen me eight year,\xe2\x80\x99 I goes on to him, \xe2\x80\x98ant zey know not\nif I am yet alive or if my bones be reposing in ze grave.

Ven I go to sleep, puy one pail of pranty\nfor ze _Soldaten_, ant zey will sleep. Me will not look after you.\xe2\x80\x99 Sis\nwas one goot man.

Ven I\ncome to my own country and go to ze town I ask, \xe2\x80\x98Where live Kustaf\nMayer who was farmer to ze Count von Zomerblat?\xe2\x80\x99 ant zey answer me,\n\xe2\x80\x98_Graf_ Zomerblat is deat, ant Kustaf Mayer live now in ze pig street,\nant keep a public-house.\xe2\x80\x99 So I tress in my new waistcoat and one noble\ncoat which ze manufacturist presented me, arranged my hairs nice, ant\ngo to ze public-house of my Papa.

Only-only, I yearn\nfor you, my children!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and Karl drew me to him, and kissed me on the\nforehead.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\nONE MARK ONLY\n\n\nThe year of mourning over, Grandmamma recovered a little from her\ngrief, and once more took to receiving occasional guests, especially\nchildren of the same age as ourselves.\n\nOn the 13th of December\xe2\x80\x94Lubotshka\xe2\x80\x99s birthday\xe2\x80\x94the Princess Kornakoff and\nher daughters, with Madame Valakhin, Sonetchka, Ilinka Grap, and the\ntwo younger Iwins, arrived at our house before luncheon.\n\nThough we could hear the sounds of talking, laughter, and movements\ngoing on in the drawing-room, we could not join the party until our\nmorning lessons were finished. The table of studies in the schoolroom\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9c_Lundi, de_ 2 _\xc3\xa0_ 3, _ma\xc3\xaetre d\xe2\x80\x99Histoire et de Geographie_,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nthis infernal _ma\xc3\xaetre d\xe2\x80\x99Histoire_ we must await, listen to, and see the\nback of before we could gain our liberty. Already it was twenty minutes\npast two, and nothing was to be heard of the tutor, nor yet anything to\nbe seen of him in the street, although I kept looking up and down it\nwith the greatest impatience and with an emphatic longing never to see\nthe _ma\xc3\xaetre_ again.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe he is not coming to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Woloda, looking up for a\nmoment from his lesson-book.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he is not, please the Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, but in a despondent\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cYet there he _does_ come, I believe, all the same!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot he! Why, that is a _gentleman_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Woloda, likewise looking out\nof the window, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us wait till half-past two, and then ask St. Jerome\nif we may put away our books.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and wish them _au revoir_,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, stretching my arms, with the\nbook clasped in my hands, over my head. Having hitherto idled away my\ntime, I now opened the book at the place where the lesson was to begin,\nand started to learn it. It was long and difficult, and, moreover, I\nwas in the mood when one\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts refuse to be arrested by anything\nat all. Consequently I made no progress. After our last lesson in\nhistory (which always seemed to me a peculiarly arduous and wearisome\nsubject) the history master had complained to St. Jerome of me because\nonly two good marks stood to my credit in the register\xe2\x80\x94a very small\ntotal. St. Jerome had then told me that if I failed to gain less than\n_three_ marks at the next lesson I should be severely punished. The\nnext lesson was now imminent, and I confess that I felt a little\nnervous.\n\nSo absorbed, however, did I become in my reading that the sound of\ngoloshes being taken off in the ante-room came upon me almost as a\nshock. I had just time to look up when there appeared in the doorway\nthe servile and (to me) very disgusting face and form of the master,\nclad in a blue frockcoat with brass buttons.\n\nSlowly he set down his hat and books and adjusted the folds of his coat\n(as though such a thing were necessary!), and seated himself in his\nplace.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rubbing his hands, \xe2\x80\x9clet us first of all\nrepeat the general contents of the last lesson: after which I will\nproceed to narrate the succeeding events of the middle ages.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis meant \xe2\x80\x9cSay over the last lesson.\xe2\x80\x9d While Woloda was answering the\nmaster with the entire ease and confidence which come of knowing a\nsubject well, I went aimlessly out on to the landing, and, since I was\nnot allowed to go downstairs, what more natural than that I should\ninvoluntarily turn towards the alcove on the landing? Yet before I had\ntime to establish myself in my usual coign of vantage behind the door I\nfound myself pounced upon by Mimi\xe2\x80\x94always the cause of my misfortunes!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ here?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking severely, first at myself, and then at\nthe maidservants\xe2\x80\x99 door, and then at myself again.\n\nI felt thoroughly guilty, firstly, because I was not in the schoolroom,\nand secondly, because I was in a forbidden place. So I remained silent,\nand, dropping my head, assumed a touching expression of contrition.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, this is _too_ bad!\xe2\x80\x9d Mimi went on, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStill I said nothing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it shall not rest where it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, tapping the banister\nwith her yellow fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall inform the Countess.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt was five minutes to three when I re-entered the schoolroom. The\nmaster, as though oblivious of my presence or absence, was explaining\nthe new lesson to Woloda. When he had finished doing this, and had put\nhis books together (while Woloda went into the other room to fetch his\nticket), the comforting idea occurred to me that perhaps the whole\nthing was over now, and that the master had forgotten me.\n\nBut suddenly he turned in my direction with a malicious smile, and said\nas he rubbed his hands anew, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have learnt your lesson?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you be so kind, then, as to tell me something about St. Louis\xe2\x80\x99\nCrusade?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, balancing himself on his chair and looking\ngravely at his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cFirstly, tell me something about the reasons\nwhich induced the French king to assume the cross\xe2\x80\x9d (here he raised his\neyebrows and pointed to the inkstand); \xe2\x80\x9cthen explain to me the general\ncharacteristics of the Crusade\xe2\x80\x9d (here he made a sweeping gesture with\nhis hand, as though to seize hold of something with it); \xe2\x80\x9cand lastly,\nexpound to me the influence of this Crusade upon the European states in\ngeneral\xe2\x80\x9d (drawing the copy books to the left side of the table) \xe2\x80\x9cand\nupon the French state in particular\xe2\x80\x9d (drawing one of them to the right,\nand inclining his head in the same direction).\n\nI swallowed a few times, coughed, bent forward, and was silent. Then,\ntaking a pen from the table, I began to pick it to pieces, yet still\nsaid nothing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me the pen\xe2\x80\x94I shall want it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the master. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLouis the-er-Saint was-was-a very good and wise king.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKing, He took it into his head to go to Jerusalem, and handed over the\nreins of government to his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was her name?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cB-b-b-lanka.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Belanka?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI laughed in a rather forced manner.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, is that all you know?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked again, smiling.\n\nI had nothing to lose now, so I began chattering the first thing that\ncame into my head. The master remained silent as he gathered together\nthe remains of the pen which I had left strewn about the table, looked\ngravely past my ear at the wall, and repeated from time to time, \xe2\x80\x9cVery\nwell, very well.\xe2\x80\x9d Though I was conscious that I knew nothing whatever\nand was expressing myself all wrong, I felt much hurt at the fact that\nhe never either corrected or interrupted me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made him think of going to Jerusalem?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at last,\nrepeating some words of my own.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94because\xe2\x80\x94that is to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMy confusion was complete, and I relapsed into silence, I felt that,\neven if this disgusting history master were to go on putting questions\nto me, and gazing inquiringly into my face, for a year, I should never\nbe able to enunciate another syllable. After staring at me for some\nthree minutes, he suddenly assumed a mournful cast of countenance, and\nsaid in an agitated voice to Woloda (who was just re-entering the\nroom):\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me the register. I will write my remarks.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe opened the book thoughtfully, and in his fine caligraphy marked\n_five_ for Woloda for diligence, and the same for good behaviour. Then,\nresting his pen on the line where my report was to go, he looked at me\nand reflected. Suddenly his hand made a decisive movement and, behold,\nagainst my name stood a clearly-marked _one_, with a full stop after\nit! Another movement and in the behaviour column there stood another\n_one_ and another full stop! Quietly closing the book, the master then\nrose, and moved towards the door as though unconscious of my look of\nentreaty, despair, and reproach.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMichael Lavionitch!\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, as though knowing beforehand what I was about to say.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible for you to learn in that way. I am not going to earn\nmy money for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe put on his goloshes and cloak, and then slowly tied a scarf about\nhis neck. To think that he could care about such trifles after what had\njust happened to me! To him it was all a mere stroke of the pen, but to\nme it meant the direst misfortune.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the lesson over?\xe2\x80\x9d asked St. Jerome, entering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was the master pleased with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many marks did he give you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to Nicholas?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI was silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think four,\xe2\x80\x9d said Woloda. His idea was to save me for at least\ntoday. If punishment there must be, it need not be awarded while we had\nguests.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Voyons, Messieurs!_\xe2\x80\x9d (St. Jerome was forever saying \xe2\x80\x9c_Voyons!_\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Faites votre toilette, et descendons._\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nXII.\nTHE KEY\n\n\nWe had hardly descended and greeted our guests when luncheon was\nannounced. Papa was in the highest of spirits since for some time past\nhe had been winning. He had presented Lubotshka with a silver tea\nservice, and suddenly remembered, after luncheon, that he had forgotten\na box of bonbons which she was to have too.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy send a servant for it? _You_ had better go, Koko,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me\njestingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe keys are in the tray on the table, you know. Take them,\nand with the largest one open the second drawer on the right. There you\nwill find the box of bonbons. Bring it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I get you some cigars as well?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, knowing that he always\nsmoked after luncheon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, do; but don\xe2\x80\x99t touch anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI found the keys, and was about to carry out my orders, when I was\nseized with a desire to know what the smallest of the keys on the bunch\nbelonged to.\n\nOn the table I saw, among many other things, a padlocked portfolio, and\nat once felt curious to see if _that_ was what the key fitted. My\nexperiment was crowned with success. The portfolio opened and disclosed\na number of papers. Curiosity so strongly urged me also to ascertain\nwhat those papers contained that the voice of conscience was stilled,\nand I began to read their contents. . . .\n\nMy childish feeling of unlimited respect for my elders, especially for\nPapa, was so strong within me that my intellect involuntarily refused\nto draw any conclusions from what I had seen. I felt that Papa was\nliving in a sphere completely apart from, incomprehensible by, and\nunattainable for, me, as well as one that was in every way excellent,\nand that any attempt on my part to criticise the secrets of his life\nwould constitute something like sacrilege.\n\nFor this reason, the discovery which I made from Papa\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio left\nno clear impression upon my mind, but only a dim consciousness that I\nhad done wrong. I felt ashamed and confused.\n\nThe feeling made me eager to shut the portfolio again as quickly as\npossible, but it seemed as though on this unlucky day I was destined to\nexperience every possible kind of adversity. I put the key back into\nthe padlock and turned it round, but not in the right direction.\nThinking that the portfolio was now locked, I pulled at the key and, oh\nhorror! found my hand come away with only the top half of the key in\nit! In vain did I try to put the two halves together, and to extract\nthe portion that was sticking in the padlock. At last I had to resign\nmyself to the dreadful thought that I had committed a new crime\xe2\x80\x94one\nwhich would be discovered to-day as soon as ever Papa returned to his\nstudy! First of all, Mimi\xe2\x80\x99s accusation on the staircase, and then that\none mark, and then this key! Nothing worse could happen now. This very\nevening I should be assailed successively by Grandmamma (because of\nMimi\xe2\x80\x99s denunciation), by St. Jerome (because of the solitary mark), and\nby Papa (because of the matter of this key)\xe2\x80\x94yes, all in one evening!\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth is to become of me? What have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed as I\npaced the soft carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on with sudden determination,\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat _must_ come, _must_\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all;\xe2\x80\x9d and, taking up the bonbons and\nthe cigars, I ran back to the other part of the house.\n\nThe fatalistic formula with which I had concluded (and which was one\nthat I often heard Nicola utter during my childhood) always produced in\nme, at the more difficult crises of my life, a momentarily soothing,\nbeneficial effect. Consequently, when I re-entered the drawing-room, I\nwas in a rather excited, unnatural mood, yet one that was perfectly\ncheerful.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\nTHE TRAITRESS\n\n\nAfter luncheon we began to play at round games, in which I took a\nlively part. While indulging in \xe2\x80\x9ccat and mouse\xe2\x80\x9d, I happened to cannon\nrather awkwardly against the Kornakoffs\xe2\x80\x99 governess, who was playing\nwith us, and, stepping on her dress, tore a large hole in it. Seeing\nthat the girls\xe2\x80\x94particularly Sonetchka\xe2\x80\x94were anything but displeased at\nthe spectacle of the governess angrily departing to the maidservants\xe2\x80\x99\nroom to have her dress mended, I resolved to procure them the\nsatisfaction a second time. Accordingly, in pursuance of this amiable\nresolution, I waited until my victim returned, and then began to gallop\nmadly round her, until a favourable moment occurred for once more\nplanting my heel upon her dress and reopening the rent. Sonetchka and\nthe young princesses had much ado to restrain their laughter, which\nexcited my conceit the more, but St. Jerome, who had probably divined\nmy tricks, came up to me with the frown which I could never abide in\nhim, and said that, since I seemed disposed to mischief, he would have\nto send me away if I did not moderate my behaviour.\n\nHowever, I was in the desperate position of a person who, having staked\nmore than he has in his pocket, and feeling that he can never make up\nhis account, continues to plunge on unlucky cards\xe2\x80\x94not because he hopes\nto regain his losses, but because it will not do for him to stop and\nconsider. So, I merely laughed in an impudent fashion and flung away\nfrom my monitor.\n\nAfter \xe2\x80\x9ccat and mouse\xe2\x80\x9d, another game followed in which the gentlemen sit\non one row of chairs and the ladies on another, and choose each other\nfor partners. The youngest princess always chose the younger Iwin,\nKatenka either Woloda or Ilinka, and Sonetchka Seriosha\xe2\x80\x94nor, to my\nextreme astonishment, did Sonetchka seem at all embarrassed when her\ncavalier went and sat down beside her. On the contrary, she only\nlaughed her sweet, musical laugh, and made a sign with her head that he\nhad chosen right. Since nobody chose _me_, I always had the\nmortification of finding myself left over, and of hearing them say,\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has been left out? Oh, Nicolinka. Well, _do_ take him, somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\nConsequently, whenever it came to my turn to guess who had chosen me, I\nhad to go either to my sister or to one of the ugly elder princesses.\nSonetchka seemed so absorbed in Seriosha that in her eyes I clearly\nexisted no longer. I do not quite know why I called her \xe2\x80\x9cthe traitress\xe2\x80\x9d\nin my thoughts, since she had never promised to choose me instead of\nSeriosha, but, for all that, I felt convinced that she was treating me\nin a very abominable fashion. After the game was finished, I actually\nsaw \xe2\x80\x9cthe traitress\xe2\x80\x9d (from whom I nevertheless could not withdraw my\neyes) go with Seriosha and Katenka into a corner, and engage in secret\nconfabulation. Stealing softly round the piano which masked the\nconclave, I beheld the following:\n\nKatenka was holding up a pocket-handkerchief by two of its corners, so\nas to form a screen for the heads of her two companions. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, you have\nlost! You must pay the forfeit!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Seriosha at that moment, and\nSonetchka, who was standing in front of him, blushed like a criminal as\nshe replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have _not_ lost! _Have_ I, Mademoiselle Katherine?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must speak the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Katenka, \xe2\x80\x9cand say that you\n_have_ lost, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d Scarcely had she spoken the words when Seriosha\nembraced Sonetchka, and kissed her right on her rosy lips! And\nSonetchka smiled as though it were nothing, but merely something very\npleasant!\n\nHorrors! The artful \xe2\x80\x9ctraitress!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\nTHE RETRIBUTION\n\n\nInstantly, I began to feel a strong contempt for the female sex in\ngeneral and Sonetchka in particular. I began to think that there was\nnothing at all amusing in these games\xe2\x80\x94that they were only fit for\ngirls, and felt as though I should like to make a great noise, or to do\nsomething of such extraordinary boldness that every one would be forced\nto admire it. The opportunity soon arrived. St. Jerome said something\nto Mimi, and then left the room, I could hear his footsteps ascending\nthe staircase, and then passing across the schoolroom, and the idea\noccurred to me that Mimi must have told him her story about my being\nfound on the landing, and thereupon he had gone to look at the\nregister. (In those days, it must be remembered, I believed that St.\nJerome\xe2\x80\x99s whole aim in life was to annoy me.) Some where I have read\nthat, not infrequently, children of from twelve to fourteen years of\nage\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, children just passing from childhood to\nadolescence\xe2\x80\x94are addicted to incendiarism, or even to murder. As I look\nback upon my childhood, and particularly upon the mood in which I was\non that (for myself) most unlucky day, I can quite understand the\npossibility of such terrible crimes being committed by children without\nany real aim in view\xe2\x80\x94without any real wish to do wrong, but merely out\nof curiosity or under the influence of an unconscious necessity for\naction. There are moments when the human being sees the future in such\nlurid colours that he shrinks from fixing his mental eye upon it, puts\na check upon all his intellectual activity, and tries to feel convinced\nthat the future will never be, and that the past has never been. At\nsuch moments\xe2\x80\x94moments when thought does not shrink from manifestations\nof will, and the carnal instincts alone constitute the springs of\nlife\xe2\x80\x94I can understand that want of experience (which is a particularly\npredisposing factor in this connection) might very possibly lead a\nchild, aye, without fear or hesitation, but rather with a smile of\ncuriosity on its face, to set fire to the house in which its parents\nand brothers and sisters (beings whom it tenderly loves) are lying\nasleep. It would be under the same influence of momentary absence of\nthought\xe2\x80\x94almost absence of mind\xe2\x80\x94that a peasant boy of seventeen might\ncatch sight of the edge of a newly-sharpened axe reposing near the\nbench on which his aged father was lying asleep, face downwards, and\nsuddenly raise the implement in order to observe with unconscious\ncuriosity how the blood would come spurting out upon the floor if he\nmade a wound in the sleeper\xe2\x80\x99s neck. It is under the same influence\xe2\x80\x94the\nsame absence of thought, the same instinctive curiosity\xe2\x80\x94that a man\nfinds delight in standing on the brink of an abyss and thinking to\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x9cHow if I were to throw myself down?\xe2\x80\x9d or in holding to his\nbrow a loaded pistol and wondering, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if I were to pull the\ntrigger?\xe2\x80\x9d or in feeling, when he catches sight of some universally\nrespected personage, that he would like to go up to him, pull his nose\nhard, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, old boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnder the spell, then, of this instinctive agitation and lack of\nreflection I was moved to put out my tongue, and to say that I would\nnot move, when St. Jerome came down and told me that I had behaved so\nbadly that day, as well as done my lessons so ill, that I had no right\nto be where I was, and must go upstairs directly.\n\nAt first, from astonishment and anger, he could not utter a word.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_C\xe2\x80\x99est bien!_\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed eventually as he darted towards me.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral times have I promised to punish you, and you have been saved\nfrom it by your Grandmamma, but now I see that nothing but the cane\nwill teach you obedience, and you shall therefore taste it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis was said loud enough for every one to hear. The blood rushed to my\nheart with such vehemence that I could feel that organ beating\nviolently\xe2\x80\x94could feel the colour rising to my cheeks and my lips\ntrembling. Probably I looked horrible at that moment, for, avoiding my\neye, St. Jerome stepped forward and caught me by the hand. Hardly\nfeeling his touch, I pulled away my hand in blind fury, and with all my\nchildish might struck him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Woloda, who had seen my behaviour, and now\napproached me in alarm and astonishment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me alone!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, the tears flowing fast. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a single one\nof you loves me or understands how miserable I am! You are all of you\nodious and disgusting!\xe2\x80\x9d I added bluntly, turning to the company at\nlarge.\n\nAt this moment St. Jerome\xe2\x80\x94his face pale, but determined\xe2\x80\x94approached me\nagain, and, with a movement too quick to admit of any defence, seized\nmy hands as with a pair of tongs, and dragged me away. My head swam\nwith excitement, and I can only remember that, so long as I had\nstrength to do it, I fought with head and legs; that my nose several\ntimes collided with a pair of knees; that my teeth tore some one\xe2\x80\x99s\ncoat; that all around me I could hear the shuffling of feet; and that I\ncould smell dust and the scent of violets with which St. Jerome used to\nperfume himself.\n\nFive minutes later the door of the store-room closed behind me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBasil,\xe2\x80\x9d said a triumphant but detestable voice, \xe2\x80\x9cbring me the cane.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nXV.\nDREAMS\n\n\nCould I at that moment have supposed that I should ever live to survive\nthe misfortunes of that day, or that there would ever come a time when\nI should be able to look back upon those misfortunes composedly?\n\nAs I sat there thinking over what I had done, I could not imagine what\nthe matter had been with me. I only felt with despair that I was for\never lost.\n\nAt first the most profound stillness reigned around me\xe2\x80\x94at least, so it\nappeared to me as compared with the violent internal emotion which I\nhad been experiencing; but by and by I began to distinguish various\nsounds. Basil brought something downstairs which he laid upon a chest\noutside. It sounded like a broom-stick. Below me I could hear St.\nJerome\xe2\x80\x99s grumbling voice (probably he was speaking of me), and then\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s voices and laughter and footsteps; until in a few moments\neverything seemed to have regained its normal course in the house, as\nthough nobody knew or cared to know that here was I sitting alone in\nthe dark store-room!\n\nI did not cry, but something lay heavy, like a stone, upon my heart.\nIdeas and pictures passed with extraordinary rapidity before my\ntroubled imagination, yet through their fantastic sequence broke\ncontinually the remembrance of the misfortune which had befallen me as\nI once again plunged into an interminable labyrinth of conjectures as\nto the punishment, the fate, and the despair that were awaiting me. The\nthought occurred to me that there must be some reason for the general\ndislike\xe2\x80\x94even contempt\xe2\x80\x94which I fancied to be felt for me by others. I\nwas firmly convinced that every one, from Grandmamma down to the\ncoachman Philip, despised me, and found pleasure in my sufferings. Next\nan idea struck me that perhaps I was not the son of my father and\nmother at all, nor Woloda\xe2\x80\x99s brother, but only some unfortunate orphan\nwho had been adopted by them out of compassion, and this absurd notion\nnot only afforded me a certain melancholy consolation, but seemed to me\nquite probable. I found it comforting to think that I was unhappy, not\nthrough my own fault, but because I was fated to be so from my birth,\nand conceived that my destiny was very much like poor Karl Ivanitch\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy conceal the secret any longer, now that I have discovered it?\xe2\x80\x9d I\nreflected. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow I will go to Papa and say to him, \xe2\x80\x98It is in vain\nfor you to try and conceal from me the mystery of my birth. I know it\nalready.\xe2\x80\x99 And he will answer me, \xe2\x80\x98What else could I do, my good fellow?\nSooner or later you would have had to know that you are not my son, but\nwere adopted as such. Nevertheless, so long as you remain worthy of my\nlove, I will never cast you out.\xe2\x80\x99 Then I shall say, \xe2\x80\x98Papa, though I\nhave no right to call you by that name, and am now doing so for the\nlast time, I have always loved you, and shall always retain that love.\nAt the same time, while I can never forget that you have been my\nbenefactor, I cannot remain longer in your house. Nobody here loves me,\nand St. Jerome has wrought my ruin. Either he or I must go forth, since\nI cannot answer for myself. I hate the man so that I could do\nanything\xe2\x80\x94I could even kill him.\xe2\x80\x99 Papa will begin to entreat me, but I\nshall make a gesture, and say, \xe2\x80\x98No, no, my friend and benefactor! We\ncannot live together. Let me go\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and for the last time I shall embrace\nhim, and say in French, \xe2\x80\x98_O mon p\xc3\xa8re, O mon bienfaiteur, donne moi,\npour la derni\xc3\xa8re fois, ta b\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9diction, et que la volont\xc3\xa9 de Dieu soit\nfaite!_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI sobbed bitterly at these thoughts as I sat on a trunk in that dark\nstoreroom. Then, suddenly recollecting the shameful punishment which\nwas awaiting me, I would find myself back again in actuality, and the\ndreams had fled. Soon, again, I began to fancy myself far away from the\nhouse and alone in the world. I enter a hussar regiment and go to war.\nSurrounded by the foe on every side, I wave my sword, and kill one of\nthem and wound another\xe2\x80\x94then a third,\xe2\x80\x94then a fourth. At last, exhausted\nwith loss of blood and fatigue, I fall to the ground and cry,\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictory!\xe2\x80\x9d The general comes to look for me, asking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is our\nsaviour?\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon I am pointed out to him. He embraces me, and, in\nhis turn, exclaims with tears of joy, \xe2\x80\x9cVictory!\xe2\x80\x9d I recover and, with my\narm in a black sling, go to walk on the boulevards. I am a general now.\nI meet the Emperor, who asks, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is this young man who has been\nwounded?\xe2\x80\x9d He is told that it is the famous hero Nicolas; whereupon he\napproaches me and says, \xe2\x80\x9cMy thanks to you! Whatsoever you may ask for,\nI will grant it.\xe2\x80\x9d To this I bow respectfully, and, leaning on my sword,\nreply, \xe2\x80\x9cI am happy, most august Emperor, that I have been able to shed\nmy blood for my country. I would gladly have died for it. Yet, since\nyou are so generous as to grant any wish of mine, I venture to ask of\nyou permission to annihilate my enemy, the foreigner St. Jerome\xe2\x80\x9d And\nthen I step fiercely before St. Jerome and say, \xe2\x80\x9c_you_ were the cause\nof all my fortunes! Down now on your knees!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nUnfortunately this recalled to my mind the fact that at any moment the\n_real_ St. Jerome might be entering with the cane; so that once more I\nsaw myself, not a general and the saviour of my country, but an\nunhappy, pitiful creature.\n\nThen the idea of God occurred to me, and I asked Him boldly why He had\npunished me thus, seeing that I had never forgotten to say my prayers,\neither morning or evening. Indeed, I can positively declare that it was\nduring that hour in the store-room that I took the first step towards\nthe religious doubt which afterwards assailed me during my youth (not\nthat mere misfortune could arouse me to infidelity and murmuring, but\nthat, at moments of utter contrition and solitude, the idea of the\ninjustice of Providence took root in me as readily as bad seed takes\nroot in land well soaked with rain). Also, I imagined that I was going\nto die there and then, and drew vivid pictures of St. Jerome\xe2\x80\x99s\nastonishment when he entered the store-room and found a corpse there\ninstead of myself! Likewise, recollecting what Natalia Savishna had\ntold me of the forty days during which the souls of the departed must\nhover around their earthly home, I imagined myself flying through the\nrooms of Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s house, and seeing Lubotshka\xe2\x80\x99s bitter tears, and\nhearing Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s lamentations, and listening to Papa and St. Jerome\ntalking together. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a fine boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Papa would say with tears in his\neyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d St. Jerome would reply, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a sad scapegrace and\ngood-for-nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut you should respect the dead,\xe2\x80\x9d would expostulate\nPapa. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ were the cause of his death; _you_ frightened him until he\ncould no longer bear the thought of the humiliation which you were\nabout to inflict upon him. Away from me, criminal!\xe2\x80\x9d Upon that St.\nJerome would fall upon his knees and implore forgiveness, and when the\nforty days were ended my soul would fly to Heaven, and see there\nsomething wonderfully beautiful, white, and transparent, and know that\nit was Mamma.\n\nAnd that something would embrace and caress me. Yet, all at once, I\nshould feel troubled, and not know her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it be you,\xe2\x80\x9d I should say to\nher, \xe2\x80\x9cshow yourself more distinctly, so that I may embrace you in\nreturn.\xe2\x80\x9d And her voice would answer me, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you not feel happy thus?\xe2\x80\x9d\nand I should reply, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do, but you cannot _really_ caress me, and\nI cannot _really_ kiss your hand like this.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d\nshe would say. \xe2\x80\x9cThere can be happiness here without that,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and I should\nfeel that it was so, and we should ascend together, ever higher and\nhigher, until\xe2\x80\x94Suddenly I feel as though I am being thrown down again,\nand find myself sitting on the trunk in the dark store-room (my cheeks\nwet with tears and my thoughts in a mist), yet still repeating the\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us ascend together, higher and higher.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, it was a\nlong, long while before I could remember where I was, for at that\nmoment my mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye saw only a dark, dreadful, illimitable void. I\ntried to renew the happy, consoling dream which had been thus\ninterrupted by the return to reality, but, to my surprise, I found\nthat, as soon as ever I attempted to re-enter former dreams, their\ncontinuation became impossible, while\xe2\x80\x94which astonished me even\nmore\xe2\x80\x94they no longer gave me pleasure.\n\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\xe2\x80\x9cKEEP ON GRINDING, AND YOU\xe2\x80\x99LL HAVE FLOUR\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nI passed the night in the store-room, and nothing further happened,\nexcept that on the following morning\xe2\x80\x94a Sunday\xe2\x80\x94I was removed to a small\nchamber adjoining the schoolroom, and once more shut up. I began to\nhope that my punishment was going to be limited to confinement, and\nfound my thoughts growing calmer under the influence of a sound, soft\nsleep, the clear sunlight playing upon the frost crystals of the\nwindowpanes, and the familiar noises in the street.\n\nNevertheless, solitude gradually became intolerable. I wanted to move\nabout, and to communicate to some one all that was lying upon my heart,\nbut not a living creature was near me. The position was the more\nunpleasant because, willy-nilly, I could hear St. Jerome walking about\nin his room, and softly whistling some hackneyed tune. Somehow, I felt\nconvinced that he was whistling not because he wanted to, but because\nhe knew it annoyed me.\n\nAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, he and Woloda departed downstairs, and Nicola brought\nme up some luncheon. When I told him what I had done and what was\nawaiting me he said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw, sir! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed. \xe2\x80\x98Keep on grinding, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have\nflour.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlthough this expression (which also in later days has more than once\nhelped me to preserve my firmness of mind) brought me a little comfort,\nthe fact that I received, not bread and water only, but a whole\nluncheon, and even dessert, gave me much to think about. If they had\nsent me no dessert, it would have meant that my punishment was to be\nlimited to confinement; whereas it was now evident that I was looked\nupon as not yet punished\xe2\x80\x94that I was only being kept away from the\nothers, as an evil-doer, until the due time of punishment. While I was\nstill debating the question, the key of my prison turned, and St.\nJerome entered with a severe, official air.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down and see your Grandmamma,\xe2\x80\x9d he said without looking at me.\n\nI should have liked first to have brushed my jacket, since it was\ncovered with dust, but St. Jerome said that that was quite unnecessary,\nsince I was in such a deplorable moral condition that my exterior was\nnot worth considering. As he led me through the salon, Katenka,\nLubotshka, and Woloda looked at me with much the same expression as we\nwere wont to look at the convicts who on certain days filed past my\ngrandmother\xe2\x80\x99s house. Likewise, when I approached Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s arm-chair\nto kiss her hand, she withdrew it, and thrust it under her mantilla.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she began after a long pause, during which she\nregarded me from head to foot with the kind of expression which makes\none uncertain where to look or what to do, \xe2\x80\x9cI must say that you seem to\nvalue my love very highly, and afford me great consolation.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she\nwent on, with an emphasis on each word, \xe2\x80\x9cMonsieur St. Jerome, who, at\nmy request, undertook your education, says that he can no longer remain\nin the house. And why? Simply because of you.\xe2\x80\x9d Another pause ensued.\nPresently she continued in a tone which clearly showed that her speech\nhad been prepared beforehand, \xe2\x80\x9cI had hoped that you would be grateful\nfor all his care, and for all the trouble that he has taken with you,\nthat you would have appreciated his services; but you\xe2\x80\x94you baby, you\nsilly boy!\xe2\x80\x94you actually dare to raise your hand against him! Very well,\nvery good. I am beginning to think that you cannot understand kind\ntreatment, but require to be treated in a very different and\nhumiliating fashion. Go now directly and beg his pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d she added in\na stern and peremptory tone as she pointed to St. Jerome, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI followed the direction of her finger with my eye, but on that member\nalighting upon St. Jerome\xe2\x80\x99s coat, I turned my head away, and once more\nfelt my heart beating violently as I remained where I was.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Did you not hear me when I told you what to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI was trembling all over, but I would not stir.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cKoko,\xe2\x80\x9d went on my grandmother, probably divining my inward sufferings,\n\xe2\x80\x9cKoko,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated in a voice tender rather than harsh, \xe2\x80\x9cis this\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrandmamma, I cannot beg his pardon for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d and I stopped suddenly, for\nI felt the next word refuse to come for the tears that were choking me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I ordered you, I begged of you, to do so. What is the matter with\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI-I-I will not\xe2\x80\x94I cannot!\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped, and the tears, long pent up and\naccumulated in my breast, burst forth like a stream which breaks its\ndikes and goes flowing madly over the country.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_C\xe2\x80\x99est ainsi que vous ob\xc3\xa9issez \xc3\xa0 votre seconde m\xc3\xa8re, c\xe2\x80\x99est ainsi que\nvous reconnaissez ses bont\xc3\xa9s!_\xe2\x80\x9d remarked St. Jerome quietly, \xe2\x80\x9c_A\ngenoux!_\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! If _she_ had seen this!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Grandmamma, turning from\nme and wiping away her tears. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she had seen this! It may be all for\nthe best, yet she could never have survived such grief\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d and\nGrandmamma wept more and more. I too wept, but it never occurred to me\nto ask for pardon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Tranquillisez-vous au nom du ciel, Madame la Comtesse_,\xe2\x80\x9d said St.\nJerome, but Grandmamma heard him not. She covered her face with her\nhands, and her sobs soon passed to hiccups and hysteria. Mimi and Gasha\ncame running in with frightened faces, salts and spirits were applied,\nand the whole house was soon in a ferment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may feel pleased at your work,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Jerome to me as he led me\nfrom the room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! What have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a terribly bad\nboy I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs soon as St. Jerome, bidding me go into his room, had returned to\nGrandmamma, I, all unconscious of what I was doing, ran down the grand\nstaircase leading to the front door. Whether I intended to drown\nmyself, or whether merely to run away from home, I do not remember. I\nonly know that I went blindly on, my face covered with my hands that I\nmight see nothing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a well-known voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you, my\nboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI would have passed on, but Papa caught hold of me, and said sternly:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, you impudent rascal. How could you dare to do such a thing\nas to touch the portfolio in my study?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on as he dragged me\ninto his room. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! you are silent, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d and he pulled my ear.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I _was_ naughty,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know myself what came over me\nthen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what came over you\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe repeated as he pulled my ear harder and harder. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you go and put\nyour nose where you ought not to again\xe2\x80\x94will you, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlthough my ear was in great pain, I did not cry, but, on the contrary,\nfelt a sort of morally pleasing sensation. No sooner did he let go of\nmy ear than I seized his hand and covered it with tears and kisses.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease whip me!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, sobbing. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease hurt me the more and more,\nfor I am a wretched, bad, miserable boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what on earth is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, giving me a\nslight push from him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will not go away!\xe2\x80\x9d I continued, seizing his coat. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one\nelse hates me\xe2\x80\x94I know that, but do _you_ listen to me and protect me, or\nelse send me away altogether. I cannot live with _him_. He tries to\nhumiliate me\xe2\x80\x94he tells me to kneel before him, and wants to strike me. I\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a baby. I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it\xe2\x80\x94I shall die, I shall\nkill myself. _He_ told Grandmamma that I was naughty, and now she is\nill\xe2\x80\x94she will die through me. It is all his fault. Please let me\xe2\x80\x94W-why\nshould-he-tor-ment me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe tears choked my further speech. I sat down on the sofa, and, with\nmy head buried on Papa\xe2\x80\x99s knees, sobbed until I thought I should die of\ngrief.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come! Why are you such a water-pump?\xe2\x80\x9d said Papa compassionately,\nas he stooped over me.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is such a bully! He is murdering me! I shall die! Nobody loves me\nat all!\xe2\x80\x9d I gasped almost inaudibly, and went into convulsions.\n\nPapa lifted me up, and carried me to my bedroom, where I fell asleep.\n\nWhen I awoke it was late. Only a solitary candle burned in the room,\nwhile beside the bed there were seated Mimi, Lubotshka, and our doctor.\nIn their faces I could discern anxiety for my health, so, although I\nfelt so well after my twelve-hours\xe2\x80\x99 sleep that I could have got up\ndirectly, I thought it best to let them continue thinking that I was\nunwell.\n\n\n\n\nXVII.\nHATRED\n\n\nYes, it was the real feeling of hatred that was mine now\xe2\x80\x94not the hatred\nof which one reads in novels, and in the existence of which I do not\nbelieve\xe2\x80\x94the hatred which finds satisfaction in doing harm to a\nfellow-creature, but the hatred which consists of an unconquerable\naversion to a person who may be wholly deserving of your esteem, yet\nwhose very hair, neck, walk, voice, limbs, movements, and everything\nelse are disgusting to you, while all the while an incomprehensible\nforce attracts you towards him, and compels you to follow his slightest\nacts with anxious attention.\n\nThis was the feeling which I cherished for St. Jerome, who had lived\nwith us now for a year and a half.\n\nJudging coolly of the man at this time of day, I find that he was a\ntrue Frenchman, but a Frenchman in the better acceptation of the term.\nHe was fairly well educated, and fulfilled his duties to us\nconscientiously, but he had the peculiar features of fickle egotism,\nboastfulness, impertinence, and ignorant self-assurance which are\ncommon to all his countrymen, as well as entirely opposed to the\nRussian character.\n\nAll this set me against him, Grandmamma had signified to him her\ndislike for corporal punishment, and therefore he dared not beat us,\nbut he frequently _threatened_ us, particularly myself, with the cane,\nand would utter the word _fouetter_ as though it were _fouatter_ in an\nexpressive and detestable way which always gave me the idea that to\nwhip me would afford him the greatest possible satisfaction.\n\nI was not in the least afraid of the bodily pain, for I had never\nexperienced it. It was the mere idea that he could beat me that threw\nme into such paroxysms of wrath and despair.\n\nTrue, Karl Ivanitch sometimes (in moments of exasperation) had recourse\nto a ruler or to his braces, but that I can look back upon without\nanger. Even if he had struck me at the time of which I am now speaking\n(namely, when I was fourteen years old), I should have submitted\nquietly to the correction, for I loved him, and had known him all my\nlife, and looked upon him as a member of our family, but St. Jerome was\na conceited, opinionated fellow for whom I felt merely the unwilling\nrespect which I entertained for all persons older than myself. Karl\nIvanitch was a comical old \xe2\x80\x9cUncle\xe2\x80\x9d whom I loved with my whole heart,\nbut who, according to my childish conception of social distinctions,\nranked below us, whereas St. Jerome was a well-educated, handsome young\ndandy who was for showing himself the equal of any one.\n\nKarl Ivanitch had always scolded and punished us coolly, as though he\nthought it a necessary, but extremely disagreeable, duty. St. Jerome,\non the contrary, always liked to emphasise his part as _judge_ when\ncorrecting us, and clearly did it as much for his own satisfaction as\nfor our good. He loved authority. Nevertheless, I always found his\ngrandiloquent French phrases (which he pronounced with a strong\nemphasis on all the final syllables) inexpressibly disgusting, whereas\nKarl, when angry, had never said anything beyond, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a foolish\npuppet-comedy it is!\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cYou boys are as irritating as Spanish fly!\xe2\x80\x9d\n(which he always called \xe2\x80\x9c_Spaniard_\xe2\x80\x9d fly). St. Jerome, however, had\nnames for us like \xe2\x80\x9c_mauvais sujet_,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_villain_,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_garnement_,\xe2\x80\x9d and so\nforth\xe2\x80\x94epithets which greatly offended my self-respect. When Karl\nIvanitch ordered us to kneel in the corner with our faces to the wall,\nthe punishment consisted merely in the bodily discomfort of the\nposition, whereas St. Jerome, in such cases, always assumed a haughty\nair, made a grandiose gesture with his hand, and exclaiming in a\npseudo-tragic tone, \xe2\x80\x9c_A genoux, mauvais sujet!_\xe2\x80\x9d ordered us to kneel\nwith our faces towards him, and to crave his pardon. His punishment\nconsisted in humiliation.\n\nHowever, on the present occasion the punishment never came, nor was the\nmatter ever referred to again. Yet, I could not forget all that I had\ngone through\xe2\x80\x94the shame, the fear, and the hatred of those two days.\nFrom that time forth, St. Jerome appeared to give me up in despair, and\ntook no further trouble with me, yet I could not bring myself to treat\nhim with indifference. Every time that our eyes met I felt that my look\nexpressed only too plainly my dislike, and, though I tried hard to\nassume a careless air, he seemed to divine my hypocrisy, until I was\nforced to blush and turn away.\n\nIn short, it was a terrible trial to me to have anything to do with\nhim.\n\nXVIII.\nTHE MAIDSERVANTS\xe2\x80\x99 ROOM\n\nI began to feel more and more lonely, until my chief solace lay in\nsolitary reflection and observation. Of the favourite subject of my\nreflections I shall speak in the next chapter. The scene where I\nindulged in them was, for preference, the maidservants\xe2\x80\x99 room, where a\nplot suitable for a novel was in progress\xe2\x80\x94a plot which touched and\nengrossed me to the highest degree. The heroine of the romance was, of\ncourse, Masha. She was in love with Basil, who had known her before she\nhad become a servant in our house, and who had promised to marry her\nsome day. Unfortunately, fate, which had separated them five years ago,\nand afterwards reunited them in Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s abode, next proceeded to\ninterpose an obstacle between them in the shape of Masha\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, our\nman Nicola, who would not hear of his niece marrying that \xe2\x80\x9cuneducated\nand unbearable fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d as he called Basil. One effect of the obstacle\nhad been to make the otherwise slightly cool and indifferent Basil fall\nas passionately in love with Masha as it is possible for a man to be\nwho is only a servant and a tailor, wears a red shirt, and has his hair\npomaded. Although his methods of expressing his affection were odd (for\ninstance, whenever he met Masha he always endeavoured to inflict upon\nher some bodily pain, either by pinching her, giving her a slap with\nhis open hand, or squeezing her so hard that she could scarcely\nbreathe), that affection was sincere enough, and he proved it by the\nfact that, from the moment when Nicola refused him his niece\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\nhis grief led him to drinking, and to frequenting taverns, until he\nproved so unruly that more than once he had to be sent to undergo a\nhumiliating chastisement at the police-station.\n\nNevertheless, these faults of his and their consequences only served to\nelevate him in Masha\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and to increase her love for him. Whenever\nhe was in the hands of the police, she would sit crying the whole day,\nand complain to Gasha of her hard fate (Gasha played an active part in\nthe affairs of these unfortunate lovers). Then, regardless of her\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s anger and blows, she would stealthily make her way to the\npolice-station, there to visit and console her swain.\n\nExcuse me, reader, for introducing you to such company. Nevertheless,\nif the cords of love and compassion have not wholly snapped in your\nsoul, you will find, even in that maidservants\xe2\x80\x99 room, something which\nmay cause them to vibrate again.\n\nSo, whether you please to follow me or not, I will return to the alcove\non the staircase whence I was able to observe all that passed in that\nroom. From my post I could see the stove-couch, with, upon it, an iron,\nan old cap-stand with its peg bent crooked, a wash-tub, and a basin.\nThere, too, was the window, with, in fine disorder before it, a piece\nof black wax, some fragments of silk, a half-eaten cucumber, a box of\nsweets, and so on. There, too, was the large table at which _she_ used\nto sit in the pink cotton dress which I admired so much and the blue\nhandkerchief which always caught my attention so. She would be\nsewing-though interrupting her work at intervals to scratch her head a\nlittle, to bite the end of her thread, or to snuff the candle\xe2\x80\x94and I\nwould think to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy was she not born a lady\xe2\x80\x94she with her blue\neyes, beautiful fair hair, and magnificent bust? How splendid she would\nlook if she were sitting in a drawing-room and dressed in a cap with\npink ribbons and a silk gown\xe2\x80\x94not one like Mimi\xe2\x80\x99s, but one like the gown\nwhich I saw the other day on the Tverski Boulevard!\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, she would\nwork at the embroidery-frame, and I would sit and look at her in the\nmirror, and be ready to do whatsoever she wanted\xe2\x80\x94to help her on with\nher mantle or to hand her food. As for Basil\xe2\x80\x99s drunken face and horrid\nfigure in the scanty coat with the red shirt showing beneath it, well,\nin his every gesture, in his every movement of his back, I seemed\nalways to see signs of the humiliating chastisements which he had\nundergone.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Basil! _Again?_\xe2\x80\x9d cried Masha on one occasion as she stuck her\nneedle into the pincushion, but without looking up at the person who\nwas entering.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the good of a man like _him?_\xe2\x80\x9d was Basil\xe2\x80\x99s first remark.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. If only he would say something _decisive!_ But I am powerless in\nthe matter\xe2\x80\x94I am all at odds and ends, and through his fault, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you have some tea?\xe2\x80\x9d put in Madesha (another servant).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you.\xe2\x80\x94But why does he hate me so, that old thief of an uncle\nof yours? Why? Is it because of the clothes I wear, or of my height, or\nof my walk, or what? Well, damn and confound him!\xe2\x80\x9d finished Basil,\nsnapping his fingers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must be patient,\xe2\x80\x9d said Masha, threading her needle.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are so\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my nerves that won\xe2\x80\x99t stand it, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAt this moment the door of Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s room banged, and Gasha\xe2\x80\x99s angry\nvoice could be heard as she came up the stairs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered with a gesture of her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cTry to please\npeople when even they themselves do not know what they want, and it is\na cursed life\xe2\x80\x94sheer hard labour, and nothing else! If only a certain\nthing would happen!\xe2\x80\x94though God forgive me for thinking it!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Agatha Michaelovna,\xe2\x80\x9d said Basil, rising to greet her.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ here?\xe2\x80\x9d she answered brusquely as she stared at him, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not\nvery much to your credit. What do you come here for? Is the maids\xe2\x80\x99 room\na proper place for men?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see how you were,\xe2\x80\x9d said Basil soothingly.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon be breathing my last\xe2\x80\x94_that\xe2\x80\x99s_ how I am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gasha,\nstill greatly incensed.\n\nBasil laughed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to laugh at when I say that I shall soon be dead.\nBut that\xe2\x80\x99s how it will be, all the same. Just look at the drunkard!\nMarry her, would he? The fool! Come, get out of here!\xe2\x80\x9d and, with a\nstamp of her foot on the floor, Gasha retreated to her own room, and\nbanged the door behind her until the window rattled again. For a while\nshe could be heard scolding at everything, flinging dresses and other\nthings about, and pulling the ears of her favourite cat. Then the door\nopened again, and puss, mewing pitifully, was flung forth by the tail.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had better come another time for tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Basil in a whisper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cat\nsome better time for our meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d put in Madesha. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and fetch the urn at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to put an end to things soon,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Basil, seating himself\nbeside Masha as soon as ever Madesha had left the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI had much\nbetter go straight to the Countess, and say \xe2\x80\x98so-and-so\xe2\x80\x99 or I will throw\nup my situation and go off into the world. Oh dear, oh dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd am I to remain here?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s the difficulty\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I feel so badly about, You have\nbeen my sweetheart so long, you see. Ah, dear me!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you bring me your shirts to wash, Basil?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Masha after\na pause, during which she had been inspecting his wrist-bands.\n\nAt this moment Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s bell rang, and Gasha issued from her room\nagain.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want with her, you impudent fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried as she\npushed Basil (who had risen at her entrance) before her towards the\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst you lead a girl on, and then you want to lead her further\nstill. I suppose it amuses you to see her tears. There\xe2\x80\x99s the door, now.\nOff you go! We want your room, not your company. And what good can you\nsee in him?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, turning to Masha. \xe2\x80\x9cHas not your uncle been\nwalking into you to-day already? No; she must stick to her promise,\nforsooth! \xe2\x80\x98I will have no one but Basil,\xe2\x80\x99 Fool that you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I _will_ have no one but him! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never love any one else! I\ncould kill myself for him!\xe2\x80\x9d poor Masha burst out, the tears suddenly\ngushing forth.\n\nFor a while I stood watching her as she wiped away those tears. Then I\nfell to contemplating Basil attentively, in the hope of finding out\nwhat there was in him that she found so attractive; yet, though I\nsympathised with her sincerely in her grief, I could not for the life\nof me understand how such a charming creature as I considered her to be\ncould love a man like him.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen _I_ become a man,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to myself as I returned to my room,\n\xe2\x80\x9cPetrovskoe shall be mine, and Basil and Masha my servants. Some day,\nwhen I am sitting in my study and smoking a pipe, Masha will chance to\npass the door on her way to the kitchen with an iron, and I shall say,\n\xe2\x80\x98Masha, come here,\xe2\x80\x99 and she will enter, and there will be no one else\nin the room. Then suddenly Basil too will enter, and, on seeing her,\nwill cry, \xe2\x80\x98My sweetheart is lost to me!\xe2\x80\x99 and Masha will begin to weep,\nThen _I_ shall say, \xe2\x80\x98Basil, I know that you love her, and that she\nloves you. Here are a thousand roubles for you. Marry her, and may God\ngrant you both happiness!\xe2\x80\x99 Then I shall leave them together.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAmong the countless thoughts and fancies which pass, without logic or\nsequence, through the mind and the imagination, there are always some\nwhich leave behind them a mark so profound that, without remembering\ntheir exact subject, we can at least recall that something good has\npassed through our brain, and try to retain and reproduce its effect.\nSuch was the mark left upon my consciousness by the idea of sacrificing\nmy feelings to Masha\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, seeing that she believed that she\ncould attain it only through a union with Basil.\n\n\n\n\nXIX.\nBOYHOOD\n\n\nPerhaps people will scarcely believe me when I tell them what were the\ndearest, most constant, objects of my reflections during my boyhood, so\nlittle did those objects consort with my age and position. Yet, in my\nopinion, contrast between a man\xe2\x80\x99s actual position and his moral\nactivity constitutes the most reliable sign of his genuineness.\n\nDuring the period when I was leading a solitary and self-centred moral\nlife, I was much taken up with abstract thoughts on man\xe2\x80\x99s destiny, on a\nfuture life, and on the immortality of the soul, and, with all the\nardour of inexperience, strove to make my youthful intellect solve\nthose questions\xe2\x80\x94the questions which constitute the highest level of\nthought to which the human intellect can tend, but a final decision of\nwhich the human intellect can never succeed in attaining.\n\nI believe the intellect to take the same course of development in the\nindividual as in the mass, as also that the thoughts which serve as a\nbasis for philosophical theories are an inseparable part of that\nintellect, and that every man must be more or less conscious of those\nthoughts before he can know anything of the existence of philosophical\ntheories. To my own mind those thoughts presented themselves with such\nclarity and force that I tried to apply them to life, in the fond\nbelief that I was the first to have discovered such splendid and\ninvaluable truths.\n\nSometimes I would suppose that happiness depends, not upon external\ncauses themselves, but only upon our relation to them, and that,\nprovided a man can accustom himself to bearing suffering, he need never\nbe unhappy. To prove the latter hypothesis, I would (despite the\nhorrible pain) hold out a Tatistchev\xe2\x80\x99s dictionary at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length for\nfive minutes at a time, or else go into the store-room and scourge my\nback with cords until the tears involuntarily came to my eyes!\n\nAnother time, suddenly bethinking me that death might find me at any\nhour or any minute, I came to the conclusion that man could only be\nhappy by using the present to the full and taking no thought for the\nfuture. Indeed, I wondered how people had never found that out before.\nActing under the influence of the new idea, I laid my lesson-books\naside for two or three days, and, reposing on my bed, gave myself up to\nnovel-reading and the eating of gingerbread-and-honey which I had\nbought with my last remaining coins.\n\nAgain, standing one day before the blackboard and smearing figures on\nit with honey, I was struck with the thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is symmetry so\nagreeable to the eye? What is symmetry? Of course it is an innate\nsense,\xe2\x80\x9d I continued; \xe2\x80\x9cyet what is its basis? Perhaps everything in life\nis symmetry? But no. On the contrary, _this_ is life\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and I drew an\noblong figure on the board\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand after life the soul passes to\neternity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94here I drew a line from one end of the oblong figure to the\nedge of the board. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should there not be a corresponding line on the\nother side? If there be an eternity on one side, there must surely be a\ncorresponding one on the other? That means that we have existed in a\nprevious life, but have lost the recollection of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis conclusion\xe2\x80\x94which seemed to me at the time both clear and novel,\nbut the arguments for which it would be difficult for me, at this\ndistance of time, to piece together\xe2\x80\x94pleased me extremely, so I took a\npiece of paper and tried to write it down. But at the first attempt\nsuch a rush of other thoughts came whirling though my brain that I was\nobliged to jump up and pace the room. At the window, my attention was\narrested by a driver harnessing a horse to a water-cart, and at once my\nmind concentrated itself upon the decision of the question, \xe2\x80\x9cInto what\nanimal or human being will the spirit of that horse pass at death?\xe2\x80\x9d\nJust at that moment, Woloda passed through the room, and smiled to see\nme absorbed in speculative thoughts. His smile at once made me feel\nthat all that I had been thinking about was utter nonsense.\n\nI have related all this as I recollect it in order to show the reader\nthe nature of my cogitations. No philosophical theory attracted me so\nmuch as scepticism, which at one period brought me to a state of mind\nverging upon insanity. I took the fancy into my head that no one nor\nanything really existed in the world except myself\xe2\x80\x94that objects were\nnot objects at all, but that images of them became manifest only so\nsoon as I turned my attention upon them, and vanished again directly\nthat I ceased to think about them. In short, this idea of mine (that\nreal objects do not exist, but only one\xe2\x80\x99s conception of them) brought\nme to Schelling\xe2\x80\x99s well-known theory. There were moments when the\ninfluence of this idea led me to such vagaries as, for instance,\nturning sharply round, in the hope that by the suddenness of the\nmovement I should come in contact with the void which I believed to be\nexisting where I myself purported to be!\n\nWhat a pitiful spring of moral activity is the human intellect! My\nfaulty reason could not define the impenetrable. Consequently it\nshattered one fruitless conviction after another\xe2\x80\x94convictions which,\nhappily for my after life, I never lacked the courage to abandon as\nsoon as they proved inadequate. From all this weary mental struggle I\nderived only a certain pliancy of mind, a weakening of the will, a\nhabit of perpetual moral analysis, and a diminution both of freshness\nof sentiment and of clearness of thought. Usually abstract thinking\ndevelops man\xe2\x80\x99s capacity for apprehending the bent of his mind at\ncertain moments and laying it to heart, but my inclination for abstract\nthought developed my consciousness in such a way that often when I\nbegan to consider even the simplest matter, I would lose myself in a\nlabyrinthine analysis of my own thoughts concerning the matter in\nquestion. That is to say, I no longer thought of the matter itself, but\nonly of what I was thinking about it. If I had then asked myself, \xe2\x80\x9cOf\nwhat am I thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d the true answer would have been, \xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking of\nwhat I am thinking;\xe2\x80\x9d and if I had further asked myself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then,\nare the thoughts of which I am thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d I should have had to reply,\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are attempts to think of what I am thinking concerning my own\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and so on. Reason, with me, had to yield to excess of reason.\nEvery philosophical discovery which I made so flattered my conceit that\nI often imagined myself to be a great man discovering new truths for\nthe benefit of humanity. Consequently, I looked down with proud dignity\nupon my fellow-mortals. Yet, strange to state, no sooner did I come in\ncontact with those fellow-mortals than I became filled with a stupid\nshyness of them, and, the higher I happened to be standing in my own\nopinion, the less did I feel capable of making others perceive my\nconsciousness of my own dignity, since I could not rid myself of a\nsense of diffidence concerning even the simplest of my words and acts.\n\n\n\n\nXX.\nWOLODA\n\n\nThe further I advance in the recital of this period of my life, the\nmore difficult and onerous does the task become. Too rarely do I find\namong the reminiscences of that time any moments full of the ardent\nfeeling of sincerity which so often and so cheeringly illumined my\nchildhood. Gladly would I pass in haste over my lonely boyhood, the\nsooner to arrive at the happy time when once again a tender, sincere,\nand noble friendship marked with a gleam of light at once the\ntermination of that period and the beginning of a phase of my youth\nwhich was full of the charm of poetry. Therefore, I will not pursue my\nrecollections from hour to hour, but only throw a cursory glance at the\nmost prominent of them, from the time to which I have now carried my\ntale to the moment of my first contact with the exceptional personality\nthat was fated to exercise such a decisive influence upon my character\nand ideas.\n\nWoloda was about to enter the University. Tutors came to give him\nlessons independently of myself, and I listened with envy and\ninvoluntary respect as he drew boldly on the blackboard with white\nchalk and talked about \xe2\x80\x9cfunctions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csines,\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth\xe2\x80\x94all of which\nseemed to me terms pertaining to unattainable wisdom. At length, one\nSunday before luncheon all the tutors\xe2\x80\x94and among them two\nprofessors\xe2\x80\x94assembled in Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s room, and in the presence of Papa\nand some friends put Woloda through a rehearsal of his University\nexamination\xe2\x80\x94in which, to Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s delight, he gave evidence of no\nordinary amount of knowledge.\n\nQuestions on different subjects were also put to me, but on all of them\nI showed complete ignorance, while the fact that the professors\nmanifestly endeavoured to conceal that ignorance from Grandmamma only\nconfused me the more. Yet, after all, I was only fifteen, and so had a\nyear before me in which to prepare for the examinations. Woloda now\ncame downstairs for luncheon only, and spent whole days and evenings\nover his studies in his own room\xe2\x80\x94to which he kept, not from necessity,\nbut because he preferred its seclusion. He was very ambitious, and\nmeant to pass the examinations, not by halves, but with flying colours.\n\nThe first day arrived. Woloda was wearing a new blue frockcoat with\nbrass buttons, a gold watch, and shiny boots. At the door stood Papa\xe2\x80\x99s\nphaeton, which Nicola duly opened; and presently, when Woloda and St.\nJerome set out for the University, the girls\xe2\x80\x94particularly Katenka\xe2\x80\x94could\nbe seen gazing with beaming faces from the window at Woloda\xe2\x80\x99s pleasing\nfigure as it sat in the carriage. Papa said several times, \xe2\x80\x9cGod go with\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d and Grandmamma, who also had dragged herself to the window,\ncontinued to make the sign of the cross as long as the phaeton was\nvisible, as well as to murmur something to herself.\n\nWhen Woloda returned, every one eagerly crowded round him. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many\nmarks? Were they good ones?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d But his happy face was an answer in\nitself. He had received five marks\xe2\x80\x94the maximum! The next day, he sped\non his way with the same good wishes and the same anxiety for his\nsuccess, and was welcomed home with the same eagerness and joy.\n\nThis lasted for nine days. On the tenth day there was to be the last\nand most difficult examination of all\xe2\x80\x94the one in divinity.\n\nWe all stood at the window, and watched for him with greater impatience\nthan ever. Two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and yet no Woloda.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they come, Papa! Here they come!\xe2\x80\x9d suddenly screamed Lubotshka as\nshe peered through the window.\n\nSure enough the phaeton was driving up with St. Jerome and Woloda\xe2\x80\x94the\nlatter no longer in his grey cap and blue frockcoat, but in the uniform\nof a student of the University, with its embroidered blue collar,\nthree-cornered hat, and gilded sword.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! If only _she_ had been alive now!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Grandmamma on seeing\nWoloda in this dress, and swooned away.\n\nWoloda enters the anteroom with a beaming face, and embraces myself,\nLubotshka, Mimi, and Katenka\xe2\x80\x94the latter blushing to her ears. He hardly\nknows himself for joy. And how smart he looks in that uniform! How well\nthe blue collar suits his budding, dark moustache! What a tall, elegant\nfigure is his, and what a distinguished walk!\n\nOn that memorable day we all lunched together in Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s room.\nEvery face expressed delight, and with the dessert which followed the\nmeal the servants, with grave but gratified faces, brought in bottles\nof champagne.\n\nGrandmamma, for the first time since Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s death, drank a full glass\nof the wine to Woloda\xe2\x80\x99s health, and wept for joy as she looked at him.\n\nHenceforth Woloda drove his own turn-out, invited his own friends,\nsmoked, and went to balls. On one occasion, I even saw him sharing a\ncouple of bottles of champagne with some guests in his room, and the\nwhole company drinking a toast, with each glass, to some mysterious\nbeing, and then quarrelling as to who should have the bottom of the\nbottle!\n\nNevertheless he always lunched at home, and after the meal would\nstretch himself on a sofa and talk confidentially to Katenka: yet from\nwhat I overheard (while pretending, of course, to pay no attention) I\ngathered that they were only talking of the heroes and heroines of\nnovels which they had read, or else of jealousy and love, and so on.\nNever could I understand what they found so attractive in these\nconversations, nor why they smiled so happily and discussed things with\nsuch animation.\n\nAltogether I could see that, in addition to the friendship natural to\npersons who had been companions from childhood, there existed between\nWoloda and Katenka a relation which differentiated them from us, and\nunited them mysteriously to one another.\n\n\n\n\nXXI.\nKATENKA AND LUBOTSHKA\n\n\nKatenka was now sixteen years old\xe2\x80\x94quite a grown-up girl; and although\nat that age the angular figures, the bashfulness, and the _gaucherie_\npeculiar to girls passing from childhood to youth usually replace the\ncomely freshness and graceful, half-developed bloom of childhood, she\nhad in no way altered. Still the blue eyes with their merry glance were\nhers, the well-shaped nose with firm nostrils and almost forming a line\nwith the forehead, the little mouth with its charming smile, the\ndimples in the rosy cheeks, and the small white hands. To her, the\nepithet of \xe2\x80\x9cgirl,\xe2\x80\x9d pure and simple, was pre-eminently applicable, for\nin her the only new features were a new and \xe2\x80\x9cyoung-lady-like\xe2\x80\x9d\narrangement of her thick flaxen hair and a youthful bosom\xe2\x80\x94the latter an\naddition which at once caused her great joy and made her very bashful.\n\nAlthough Lubotshka and she had grown up together and received the same\neducation, they were totally unlike one another. Lubotshka was not\ntall, and the rickets from which she had suffered had shaped her feet\nin goose fashion and made her figure very bad. The only pretty feature\nin her face was her eyes, which were indeed wonderful, being large and\nblack, and instinct with such an extremely pleasing expression of\nmingled gravity and _na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9_ that she was bound to attract attention.\nIn everything she was simple and natural, so that, whereas Katenka\nalways looked as though she were trying to be like some one else,\nLubotshka looked people straight in the face, and sometimes fixed them\nso long with her splendid black eyes that she got blamed for doing what\nwas thought to be improper. Katenka, on the contrary, always cast her\neyelids down, blinked, and pretended that she was short-sighted, though\nI knew very well that her sight was excellent. Lubotshka hated being\nshown off before strangers, and when a visitor offered to kiss her she\ninvariably grew cross, and said that she hated \xe2\x80\x9caffection\xe2\x80\x9d; whereas,\nwhen strangers were present, Katenka was always particularly endearing\nto Mimi, and loved to walk about the room arm in arm with another girl.\nLikewise, though Lubotshka was a terrible giggler, and sometimes ran\nabout the room in convulsions of gesticulating laughter, Katenka always\ncovered her mouth with her hands or her pocket-handkerchief when she\nwanted to laugh. Lubotshka, again, loved to have grown-up men to talk\nto, and said that some day she meant to marry a hussar, but Katenka\nalways pretended that all men were horrid, and that she never meant to\nmarry any one of them, while as soon as a male visitor addressed her\nshe changed completely, as though she were nervous of something.\nLikewise, Lubotshka was continually at loggerheads with Mimi because\nthe latter wanted her to have her stays so tight that she could not\nbreathe or eat or drink in comfort, while Katenka, on the contrary,\nwould often insert her finger into her waistband to show how loose it\nwas, and always ate very little. Lubotshka liked to draw heads; Katenka\nonly flowers and butterflies. The former could play Field\xe2\x80\x99s concertos\nand Beethoven\xe2\x80\x99s sonatas excellently, whereas the latter indulged in\nvariations and waltzes, retarded the time, and used the pedals\ncontinuously\xe2\x80\x94not to mention the fact that, before she began, she\ninvariably struck three chords in _arpeggio_.\n\nNevertheless, in those days I thought Katenka much the grander person\nof the two, and liked her the best.\n\n\n\n\nXXII.\nPAPA\n\n\nPapa had been in a particularly good humour ever since Woloda had\npassed into the University, and came much oftener to dine with\nGrandmamma. However, I knew from Nicola that he had won a great deal\nlately. Occasionally, he would come and sit with us in the evening\nbefore going to the club. He used to sit down to the piano and bid us\ngroup ourselves around him, after which he would beat time with his\nthin boots (he detested heels, and never wore them), and make us sing\ngipsy songs. At such times you should have seen the quaint enthusiasm\nof his beloved Lubotshka, who adored him!\n\nSometimes, again, he would come to the schoolroom and listen with a\ngrave face as I said my lessons; yet by the few words which he would\nlet drop when correcting me, I could see that he knew even less about\nthe subject than I did. Not infrequently, too, he would wink at us and\nmake secret signs when Grandmamma was beginning to scold us and find\nfault with us all round. \xe2\x80\x9cSo much for us children!\xe2\x80\x9d he would say. On\nthe whole, however, the impossible pinnacle upon which my childish\nimagination had placed him had undergone a certain abasement. I still\nkissed his large white hand with a certain feeling of love and respect,\nbut I also allowed myself to think about him and to criticise his\nbehaviour until involuntarily thoughts occurred to me which alarmed me\nby their presence. Never shall I forget one incident in particular\nwhich awakened thoughts of this kind, and caused me intense\nastonishment. Late one evening, he entered the drawing-room in his\nblack dress-coat and white waistcoat, to take Woloda (who was still\ndressing in his bedroom) to a ball. Grandmamma was also in her bedroom,\nbut had given orders that, before setting out, Woloda was to come and\nsay goodbye to her (it was her invariable custom to inspect him before\nhe went to a ball, and to bless him and direct him as to his\nbehaviour). The room where we were was lighted by a solitary lamp. Mimi\nand Katenka were walking up and down, and Lubotshka was playing Field\xe2\x80\x99s\nSecond Concerto (Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s favourite piece) at the piano. Never was there\nsuch a family likeness as between Mamma and my sister\xe2\x80\x94not so much in\nthe face or the stature as in the hands, the walk, the voice, the\nfavourite expressions, and, above all, the way of playing the piano and\nthe whole demeanour at the instrument. Lubotshka always arranged her\ndress when sitting down just as Mamma had done, as well as turned the\nleaves like her, tapped her fingers angrily and said \xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhenever a difficult passage did not go smoothly, and, in particular,\nplayed with the delicacy and exquisite purity of touch which in those\ndays caused the execution of Field\xe2\x80\x99s music to be known\ncharacteristically as \xe2\x80\x9c_jeu perl\xc3\xa9_\xe2\x80\x9d and to lie beyond comparison with\nthe humbug of our modern _virtuosi_.\n\nPapa entered the room with short, soft steps, and approached Lubotshka.\nOn seeing him she stopped playing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, go on, Luba, go on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he forced her to sit down again.\nShe went on playing, while Papa, his head on his hand, sat near her for\na while. Then suddenly he gave his shoulders a shrug, and, rising,\nbegan to pace the room. Every time that he approached the piano he\nhalted for a moment and looked fixedly at Lubotshka. By his walk and\nhis every movement, I could see that he was greatly agitated. Once,\nwhen he stopped behind Lubotshka, he kissed her black hair, and then,\nwheeling quickly round, resumed his pacing. The piece finished,\nLubotshka went up to him and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWas it well played?\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon,\nwithout answering, he took her head in his two hands, and kissed her\nforehead and eyes with such tenderness as I had never before seen him\ndisplay.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are crying!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lubotshka suddenly as she ceased to toy\nwith his watch-chain and stared at him with her great black eyes.\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, darling Papa! I had quite forgotten that it was dear\nMamma\xe2\x80\x99s piece which I was playing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my love; play it often,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a voice trembling with\nemotion. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, if you only knew how much good it does me to share your\ntears!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe kissed her again, and then, mastering his feelings and shrugging his\nshoulders, went to the door leading to the corridor which ran past\nWoloda\xe2\x80\x99s room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaldemar, shall you be ready soon?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, halting in the middle of\nthe passage. Just then Masha came along.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you look prettier every day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her. She blushed and\npassed on.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaldemar, shall you be ready soon?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried again, with a cough and a\nshake of his shoulders, just as Masha slipped away and he first caught\nsight of me.\n\nI loved Papa, but the intellect is independent of the heart, and often\ngives birth to thoughts which offend and are harsh and incomprehensible\nto the feelings. And it was thoughts of this kind that, for all I\nstrove to put them away, arose at that moment in my mind.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII.\nGRANDMAMMA\n\n\nGrandmamma was growing weaker every day. Her bell, Gasha\xe2\x80\x99s grumbling\nvoice, and the slamming of doors in her room were sounds of constant\noccurrence, and she no longer received us sitting in the Voltairian\narm-chair in her boudoir, but lying on the bed in her bedroom,\nsupported on lace-trimmed cushions. One day when she greeted us, I\nnoticed a yellowish-white swelling on her hand, and smelt the same\noppressive odour which I had smelt five years ago in Mamma\xe2\x80\x99s room. The\ndoctor came three times a day, and there had been more than one\nconsultation. Yet the character of her haughty, ceremonious bearing\ntowards all who lived with her, and particularly towards Papa, never\nchanged in the least. She went on emphasising certain words, raising\nher eyebrows, and saying \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d just as she had always done.\n\nThen for a few days we did not see her at all, and one morning St.\nJerome proposed to me that Woloda and I should take Katenka and\nLubotshka for a drive during the hours generally allotted to study.\nAlthough I observed that the street was lined with straw under the\nwindows of Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s room, and that some men in blue stockings[1]\nwere standing at our gate, the reason never dawned upon me why we were\nbeing sent out at that unusual hour. Throughout the drive Lubotshka and\nI were in that particularly merry mood when the least trifle, the least\nword or movement, sets one off laughing.\n\n [1] Undertaker\xe2\x80\x99s men.\n\nA pedlar went trotting across the road with a tray, and we laughed.\nSome ragged cabmen, brandishing their reins and driving at full speed,\novertook our sledge, and we laughed again. Next, Philip\xe2\x80\x99s whip got\ncaught in the side of the vehicle, and the way in which he said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother the thing!\xe2\x80\x9d as he drove to disentangle it almost killed us with\nmirth. Mimi looked displeased, and said that only silly people laughed\nfor no reason at all, but Lubotshka\xe2\x80\x94her face purple with suppressed\nmerriment\xe2\x80\x94needed but to give me a sly glance, and we again burst out\ninto such Homeric laughter, when our eyes met, that the tears rushed\ninto them and we could not stop our paroxysms, although they nearly\nchoked us. Hardly, again, had we desisted a little when I looked at\nLubotshka once more, and gave vent to one of the slang words which we\nthen affected among ourselves\xe2\x80\x94words which always called forth hilarity;\nand in a moment we were laughing again.\n\nJust as we reached home, I was opening my mouth to make a splendid\ngrimace at Lubotshka when my eye fell upon a black coffin-cover which\nwas leaning against the gate\xe2\x80\x94and my mouth remained fixed in its gaping\nposition.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Grandmamma is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said St. Jerome as he met us. His face was\nvery pale.\n\nThroughout the whole time that Grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s body was in the house I was\noppressed with the fear of death, for the corpse served as a forcible\nand disagreeable reminder that I too must die some day\xe2\x80\x94a feeling which\npeople often mistake for grief. I had no sincere regret for Grandmamma,\nnor, I think, had any one else, since, although the house was full of\nsympathising callers, nobody seemed to mourn for her from their hearts\nexcept one mourner whose genuine grief made a great impression upon me,\nseeing that the mourner in question was\xe2\x80\x94Gasha! She shut herself up in\nthe garret, tore her hair and refused all consolation, saying that, now\nthat her mistress was dead, she only wished to die herself.\n\nI again assert that, in matters of feeling, it is the unexpected\neffects that constitute the most reliable signs of sincerity.\n\nThough Grandmamma was no longer with us, reminiscences and gossip about\nher long went on in the house. Such gossip referred mostly to her will,\nwhich she had made shortly before her death, and of which, as yet, no\none knew the contents except her bosom friend, Prince Ivan Ivanovitch.\nI could hear the servants talking excitedly together, and making\ninnumerable conjectures as to the amount left and the probable\nbeneficiaries: nor can I deny that the idea that we ourselves were\nprobably the latter greatly pleased me.\n\nSix weeks later, Nicola\xe2\x80\x94who acted as regular news-agent to the\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94informed me that Grandmamma had left the whole of her fortune to\nLubotshka, with, as her trustee until her majority, not Papa, but\nPrince Ivan Ivanovitch!\n\n\n\n\nXXIV.\nMYSELF\n\n\nOnly a few months remained before I was to matriculate for the\nUniversity, yet I was making such good progress that I felt no\napprehensions, and even took a pleasure in my studies. I kept in good\nheart, and learnt my lessons fluently and intelligently. The faculty I\nhad selected was the mathematical one\xe2\x80\x94probably, to tell the truth,\nbecause the terms \xe2\x80\x9ctangent,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdifferentials,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cintegrals,\xe2\x80\x9d and so\nforth, pleased my fancy.\n\nThough stout and broad-shouldered, I was shorter than Woloda, while my\nugliness of face still remained and tormented me as much as ever. By\nway of compensation, I tried to appear original. Yet one thing\ncomforted me, namely, that Papa had said that I had \xe2\x80\x9can _intelligent_\nface.\xe2\x80\x9d I quite believed him.\n\nSt. Jerome was not only satisfied with me, but actually had taken to\npraising me. Consequently, I had now ceased to hate him. In fact, when,\none day, he said that, with my \xe2\x80\x9ccapacities\xe2\x80\x9d and my \xe2\x80\x9cintellect,\xe2\x80\x9d it\nwould be shameful for me not to accomplish this, that, or the other\nthing, I believe I almost liked him.\n\nI had long ago given up keeping observation on the maidservants\xe2\x80\x99 room,\nfor I was now ashamed to hide behind doors. Likewise, I confess that\nthe knowledge of Masha\xe2\x80\x99s love for Basil had greatly cooled my ardour\nfor her, and that my passion underwent a final cure by their marriage\xe2\x80\x94a\nconsummation to which I myself contributed by, at Basil\xe2\x80\x99s request,\nasking Papa\xe2\x80\x99s consent to the union.\n\nWhen the newly-married couple brought trays of cakes and sweetmeats to\nPapa as a thank-offering, and Masha, in a cap with blue ribbons, kissed\neach of us on the shoulder in token of her gratitude, I merely noticed\nthe scent of the rose pomade on her hair, but felt no other sensation.\n\nIn general, I was beginning to get the better of my youthful defects,\nwith the exception of the principal one\xe2\x80\x94the one of which I shall often\nagain have to speak in relating my life\xe2\x80\x99s history\xe2\x80\x94namely, the tendency\nto abstract thought.\n\n\n\n\nXXV.\nWOLODA\xe2\x80\x99S FRIENDS\n\n\nAlthough, when in the society of Woloda\xe2\x80\x99s friends, I had to play a part\nthat hurt my pride, I liked sitting in his room when he had visitors,\nand silently watching all they did. The two who came most frequently to\nsee him were a military adjutant called Dubkoff and a student named\nPrince Nechludoff. Dubkoff was a little dark-haired, highly-strung man\nwho, though short of stature and no longer in his first youth, had a\npleasing and invariably cheerful air. His was one of those limited\nnatures which are agreeable through their very limitations; natures\nwhich cannot regard matters from every point of view, but which are\nnevertheless attracted by everything. Usually the reasoning of such\npersons is false and one-sided, yet always genuine and taking;\nwherefore their narrow egotism seems both amiable and excusable. There\nwere two other reasons why Dubkoff had charms for Woloda and\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94namely, the fact that he was of military appearance, and,\nsecondly (and principally), the fact that he was of a certain age\xe2\x80\x94an\nage with which young people are apt to associate that quality of\n\xe2\x80\x9cgentlemanliness\xe2\x80\x9d which is so highly esteemed at their time of life.\nHowever, he was in very truth _un homme comme il faut_. The only thing\nwhich I did not like about it all was that, in his presence, Woloda\nalways seemed ashamed of my innocent behaviour, and still more so of my\nyouthfulness. As for Prince Nechludoff, he was in no way handsome,\nsince neither his small grey eyes, his low, projecting forehead, nor\nhis disproportionately long hands and feet could be called good\nfeatures. The only good points about him were his unusually tall\nstature, his delicate colouring, and his splendid teeth. Nevertheless,\nhis face was of such an original, energetic character (owing to his\nnarrow, sparkling eyes and ever-changing expression\xe2\x80\x94now stern, now\nchildlike, now smiling indeterminately) that it was impossible to help\nnoticing it. As a rule he was very shy, and would blush to the ears at\nthe smallest trifle, but it was a shyness altogether different from\nmine, seeing that, the more he blushed, the more determined-looking he\ngrew, as though he were vexed at his own weakness.\n\nAlthough he was on very good terms with Woloda and Dubkoff, it was\nclearly chance which had united them thus, since their tastes were\nentirely dissimilar. Woloda and Dubkoff seemed to be afraid of anything\nlike serious consideration or emotion, whereas Nechludoff was beyond\nall things an enthusiast, and would often, despite their sarcastic\nremarks, plunge into dissertations on philosophical matters or matters\nof feeling. Again, the two former liked talking about the fair objects\nof their adoration (these were always numerous, and always shared by\nthe friends in common), whereas Nechludoff invariably grew annoyed when\ntaxed with his love for a certain red-haired lady.\n\nAgain, Woloda and Dubkoff often permitted themselves to criticise their\nrelatives, and to find amusement in so doing, but Nechludoff flew into\na tremendous rage when on one occasion they referred to some weak\npoints in the character of an aunt of his whom he adored. Finally,\nafter supper Woloda and Dubkoff would usually go off to some place\nwhither Nechludoff would not accompany them; wherefore they called him\n\xe2\x80\x9ca dainty girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe very first time that I ever saw Prince Nechludoff I was struck with\nhis exterior and conversation. Yet, though I could discern a great\nsimilarity between his disposition and my own (or perhaps it was\nbecause I _could_ so discern it), the impression which he produced upon\nme at first was anything but agreeable. I liked neither his quick\nglance, his hard voice, his proud bearing, nor (least of all) the utter\nindifference with which he treated me. Often, when conversing, I burned\nto contradict him, to punish his pride by confuting him, to show him\nthat I was clever in spite of his disdainful neglect of my presence.\nBut I was invariably prevented from doing so by my shyness.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI.\nDISCUSSIONS\n\n\nWoloda was lying reading a French novel on the sofa when I paid my\nusual visit to his room after my evening lessons. He looked up at me\nfor a moment from his book, and then went on reading. This perfectly\nsimple and natural movement, however, offended me. I conceived that the\nglance implied a question why I had come and a wish to hide his\nthoughts from me (I may say that at that period a tendency to attach a\nmeaning to the most insignificant of acts formed a prominent feature in\nmy character). So I went to the table and also took up a book to read.\nYet, even before I had actually begun reading, the idea struck me how\nridiculous it was that, although we had never seen one another all day,\nwe should have not a word to exchange.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to stay in to-night, Woloda?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, because\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Seeing that the conversation did not promise to be a\nsuccess, I took up my book again, and began to read. Yet it was a\nstrange thing that, though we sometimes passed whole hours together\nwithout speaking when we were alone, the mere presence of a\nthird\xe2\x80\x94sometimes of a taciturn and wholly uninteresting person\xe2\x80\x94sufficed\nto plunge us into the most varied and engrossing of discussions. The\ntruth was that we knew one another too well, and to know a person\neither too well or too little acts as a bar to intimacy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Woloda at home?\xe2\x80\x9d came in Dubkoff\xe2\x80\x99s voice from the ante-room.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Woloda, springing up and throwing aside his book.\n\nDubkoff and Nechludoff entered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you coming to the theatre, Woloda?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have no time,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied with a blush.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind that. Come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTickets, as many as you like, at the entrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then; I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Woloda evasively as\nhe left the room. I knew very well that he wanted to go, but that he\nhad declined because he had no money, and had now gone to borrow five\nroubles of one of the servants\xe2\x80\x94to be repaid when he got his next\nallowance.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, _diplomat?_\xe2\x80\x9d said Dubkoff to me as he shook me by the\nhand. Woloda\xe2\x80\x99s friends had called me by that nickname since the day\nwhen Grandmamma had said at luncheon that Woloda must go into the army,\nbut that she would like to see me in the diplomatic service, dressed in\na black frock-coat, and with my hair arranged _\xc3\xa0 la coq_ (the two\nessential requirements, in her opinion, of a _diplomat_).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere has Woloda gone to?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nechludoff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, blushing to think that nevertheless they had\nprobably guessed his errand.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he has no money? Yes, I can see I am right, O diplomatist,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe added, taking my smile as an answer in the affirmative. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\nhave none, either. Have you any, Dubkoff?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Dubkoff, feeling for his pocket, and rummaging\ngingerly about with his squat little fingers among his small change.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, here are five copecks-twenty, but that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded with\na comic gesture of his hand.\n\nAt this point Woloda re-entered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we going?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an odd fellow you are!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nechludoff. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you say that\nyou have no money? Here, take my ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are _you_ going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can go into his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s box,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dubkoff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nechludoff.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I hate sitting in a box.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for what reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Somehow I feel uncomfortable there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways the same! I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand a fellow feeling uncomfortable\nwhen he is sitting with people who are fond of him. It is unnatural,\n_mon cher_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what else is there to be done _si je suis tant timide? You_ never\nblushed in your life, but I do at the least trifle,\xe2\x80\x9d and he blushed at\nthat moment.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what that nervousness of yours proceeds from?\xe2\x80\x9d said\nDubkoff in a protecting sort of tone, \xe2\x80\x9c_D\xe2\x80\x99un exc\xc3\xa9s d\xe2\x80\x99amour propre, mon\ncher_.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98_exc\xc3\xa9s d\xe2\x80\x99amour propre_\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nechludoff,\nhighly offended. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I am shy just because I have _too\nlittle amour propre_. I always feel as though I were being tiresome and\ndisagreeable, and therefore\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, get ready, Woloda,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Dubkoff, tapping my brother on\nthe shoulder and handing him his cloak. \xe2\x80\x9cIgnaz, get your master ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Nechludoff, \xe2\x80\x9cit often happens with me that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut Dubkoff was not listening. \xe2\x80\x9cTra-la-la-la,\xe2\x80\x9d and he hummed a popular\nair.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to let you off,\xe2\x80\x9d went on Nechludoff. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to\nprove to you that my shyness is not the result of conceit.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can prove it as we go along.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have told you that I am _not_ going.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, stay here and prove it to the _diplomat_, and he can tell\nus all about it when we return.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I _will_ do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nechludoff with boyish obstinacy,\n\xe2\x80\x9cso hurry up with your return.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, _do_ you think I am egotistic?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, seating himself\nbeside me.\n\nTrue, I had a definite opinion on the subject, but I felt so taken\naback by this unexpected question that at first I could make no reply.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I _do_ think so,\xe2\x80\x9d I said at length in a faltering voice, and\ncolouring at the thought that at last the moment had come when I could\nshow him that I was clever. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that _everybody_ is egotistic, and\nthat everything we do is done out of egotism.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you call egotism?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nechludoff\xe2\x80\x94smiling, as I thought,\na little contemptuously.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEgotism is a conviction that we are better and cleverer than any one\nelse,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can we _all_ be filled with this conviction?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I am right or not\xe2\x80\x94certainly no one but myself\nseems to hold the opinion\xe2\x80\x94but I believe that I am wiser than any one\nelse in the world, and that all of you know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least I can say for myself,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Nechludoff, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have met\na _few_ people whom I believe to excel me in wisdom.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied with conviction.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think so?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking at me gravely.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, really,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, and an idea crossed my mind which I\nproceeded to expound further. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me prove it to you. Why do we love\nourselves better than any one else? Because we think ourselves _better_\nthan any one else\xe2\x80\x94more worthy of our own love. If we _thought_ others\nbetter than ourselves, we should _love_ them better than ourselves: but\nthat is never the case. And even if it were so, I should still be\nright,\xe2\x80\x9d I added with an involuntary smile of complacency.\n\nFor a few minutes Nechludoff was silent.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought you were so clever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with a smile so\ngoodhumoured and charming that I at once felt happy.\n\nPraise exercises an all-potent influence, not only upon the feelings,\nbut also upon the intellect; so that under the influence of that\nagreeable sensation I straightway felt much cleverer than before, and\nthoughts began to rush with extraordinary rapidity through my head.\nFrom egotism we passed insensibly to the theme of love, which seemed\ninexhaustible. Although our reasonings might have sounded nonsensical\nto a listener (so vague and one-sided were they), for ourselves they\nhad a profound significance. Our minds were so perfectly in harmony\nthat not a chord was struck in the one without awakening an echo in the\nother, and in this harmonious striking of different chords we found the\ngreatest delight. Indeed, we felt as though time and language were\ninsufficient to express the thoughts which seethed within us.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII.\nTHE BEGINNING OF OUR FRIENDSHIP\n\n\nFrom that time forth, a strange, but exceedingly pleasant, relation\nsubsisted between Dimitri Nechludoff and myself. Before other people he\npaid me scanty attention, but as soon as ever we were alone, we would\nsit down together in some comfortable corner and, forgetful both of\ntime and of everything around us, fall to reasoning.\n\nWe talked of a future life, of art, service, marriage, and education;\nnor did the idea ever occur to us that very possibly all we said was\nshocking nonsense. The reason why it never occurred to us was that the\nnonsense which we talked was good, sensible nonsense, and that, so long\nas one is young, one can appreciate good nonsense, and believe in it.\nIn youth the powers of the mind are directed wholly to the future, and\nthat future assumes such various, vivid, and alluring forms under the\ninfluence of hope\xe2\x80\x94hope based, not upon the experience of the past, but\nupon an assumed possibility of happiness to come\xe2\x80\x94that such dreams of\nexpected felicity constitute in themselves the true happiness of that\nperiod of our life. How I loved those moments in our metaphysical\ndiscussions (discussions which formed the major portion of our\nintercourse) when thoughts came thronging faster and faster, and,\nsucceeding one another at lightning speed, and growing more and more\nabstract, at length attained such a pitch of elevation that one felt\npowerless to express them, and said something quite different from what\none had intended at first to say! How I liked those moments, too, when,\ncarried higher and higher into the realms of thought, we suddenly felt\nthat we could grasp its substance no longer and go no further!\n\nAt carnival time Nechludoff was so much taken up with one festivity and\nanother that, though he came to see us several times a day, he never\naddressed a single word to me. This offended me so much that once again\nI found myself thinking him a haughty, disagreeable fellow, and only\nawaited an opportunity to show him that I no longer valued his company\nor felt any particular affection for him. Accordingly, the first time\nthat he spoke to me after the carnival, I said that I had lessons to\ndo, and went upstairs, but a quarter of an hour later some one opened\nthe schoolroom door, and Nechludoff entered.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I disturbing you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, although I had at first intended to say that I had a\ngreat deal to do.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why did you run away just now? It is a long while since we had a\ntalk together, and I have grown so accustomed to these discussions that\nI feel as though something were wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMy anger had quite gone now, and Dimitri stood before me the same good\nand lovable being as before.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, perhaps, why I ran away?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, taking a seat near me. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, though it\nis possible I know why, I cannot say it straight out, whereas _you_\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I will do so. I ran away because I was angry with you\xe2\x80\x94well, not\nangry, but grieved. I always have an idea that you despise me for being\nso young.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you know why _I_ always feel so attracted towards you?\xe2\x80\x9d he\nreplied, meeting my confession with a look of kind understanding, \xe2\x80\x9cand\nwhy I like you better than any of my other acquaintances or than any of\nthe people among whom I mostly have to live? It is because I found out\nat once that you have the rare and astonishing gift of sincerity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I always confess the things of which I am most ashamed\xe2\x80\x94but only\nto people in whom I trust,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but to trust a man you must be his friend _completely_, and we are\nnot friends yet, Nicolas. Remember how, when we were speaking of\nfriendship, we agreed that, to be real friends, we ought to trust one\nanother implicitly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust you in so far as that I feel convinced that you would never\nrepeat a word of what I might tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet perhaps the most interesting and important thoughts of all are\njust those which we never tell one another, while the mean thoughts\n(the thoughts which, if we only knew that we had to confess them to one\nanother, would probably never have the hardihood to enter our\nminds)\xe2\x80\x94Well, do you know what I am thinking of, Nicolas?\xe2\x80\x9d he broke off,\nrising and taking my hand with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI propose (and I feel sure\nthat it would benefit us mutually) that we should pledge our word to\none another to tell each other _everything_. We should then really know\neach other, and never have anything on our consciences. And, to guard\nagainst outsiders, let us also agree never to speak of one another to a\nthird person. Suppose we do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI agree,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. And we did it. What the result was shall be told\nhereafter.\n\nKerr has said that every attachment has two sides: one loves, and the\nother allows himself to be loved; one kisses, and the other surrenders\nhis cheek. That is perfectly true. In the case of our own attachment it\nwas I who kissed, and Dimitri who surrendered his cheek\xe2\x80\x94though he, in\nhis turn, was ready to pay me a similar salute. We loved equally\nbecause we knew and appreciated each other thoroughly, but this did not\nprevent him from exercising an influence over me, nor myself from\nrendering him adoration.\n\nIt will readily be understood that Nechludoff\xe2\x80\x99s influence caused me to\nadopt his bent of mind, the essence of which lay in an enthusiastic\nreverence for ideal virtue and a firm belief in man\xe2\x80\x99s vocation to\nperpetual perfection. To raise mankind, to abolish vice and misery,\nseemed at that time a task offering no difficulties. To educate oneself\nto every virtue, and so to achieve happiness, seemed a simple and easy\nmatter.\n\nOnly God Himself knows whether those blessed dreams of youth were\nridiculous, or whose the fault was that they never became realised.\n\n\n\n'
