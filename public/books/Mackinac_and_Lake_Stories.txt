Both there and elsewhere\nabroad it was highly successful on the stage, as was also the comedy,\n_Fruits of Culture_, which he wrote three years later, to be performed\nby his own family and their friends.\n\nThe only other play published during his lifetime, _The First Distiller_,\nis a very slight piece of no particular dramatic importance. It was\nwritten in the cause of temperance.\n\nBesides these, he left three other plays finished, or nearly finished,\nwhen he died.\n\n_The Live Corpse_ (which in English has also been called _The Man who\nwas Dead_) is the one best adapted for the stage. _The Cause of it All_\nis, like _The First Distiller_, a short and unimportant piece dealing\nwith the effects of drink. The most interesting, not dramatically but\npsychologically, of the three is _The Light Shines in Darkness_, which\nwas left in an unfinished state. In it Tolstoy presents his own case,\nand deals with the contradiction that existed and has so often been\ncommented on, between practice and theory in his own life and teaching.\n\nFor the purpose of the play he greatly simplified his own highly complex\npersonality, and, though many of the details and characters are drawn\nfrom life with extraordinary exactitude, the picture presented is not\none which all the people concerned are disposed to regard as quite fair\nto themselves.\n\nThe play presents the terrible clash which resulted from the calls\nTolstoy made on himself and on others to abandon all customary ways of\nlife and to start afresh in a new direction. In his own case he was\nnever allowed to test the effects of a life of extreme poverty and\nmanual labour, such as he advocated; nor did those of his followers who\nadopted such a life achieve much success therein. Tolstoy\'s artistic\nsincerity is indeed shown by the fact that, despite his spiritual\nfervour and his profound conviction that he had really found the road to\nsalvation for mankind, he has not, in this play, minimised the failure\nof his efforts to carry convictions to those about him, or to achieve\nany other success than that of obtaining an inward assurance that he was\nfulfilling the will of God. This assurance would, no doubt, have been\nmore fully indicated in the last act, had he lived to complete it.\n\nTolstoy was well aware of the advantages a play possesses over a novel\nas a means of propaganda, and but for the existence of the Censorship he\nwould have written more for the stage. When asked, in 1892, whether he\nwould write any more plays, he replied: "I would do so with great\npleasure, and I even feel a special need to express myself in that way;\nbut I feel certain the Censor would not pass my plays. You would not\nbelieve how, from the very commencement of my activity, that horrible\nCensor question has tormented me! I wanted to write what I felt; but at\nthe same time I felt that what I wrote would not be permitted; and\ninvoluntarily I abandoned the work. I abandoned, and went on abandoning,\nand meanwhile the years passed away."\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is one other matter of some importance on which I must here say a\nword.\n\nNo accepted standard of transliteration for Russian names into English\nhas hitherto existed. Each writer has been a law unto himself. Now, at\nlast, the Liverpool School of Russian Studies has prepared and privately\ncirculated a scheme, which deserves to be, and is likely to be, generally\nadopted. It differs in some particulars from the plan I have followed\nheretofore; but the advantage to Anglo-Russian literature of the general\nadoption of a uniform and authoritative rule will be so great that I\nhasten to put myself in accord with the Liverpool scheme, without even\nwaiting for it to be publicly promulgated.\n\nThe result of so doing however is that in the three earlier plays now\nreprinted from stereotype plates the transliteration does not quite\ncoincide with the plan adopted in the three freshly translated plays.\nFor this discrepancy I must ask the readers\' kind indulgence.\n\n                                                           AYLMER MAUDE.\n\n\n\n\n                      Printed in Great Britain by\n              T. and A.
