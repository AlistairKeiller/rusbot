I asked.\n\n"To N----. The troops have been ordered to muster at that place."\n\n"And probably some expedition will be made from there?"\n\n"Of course."\n\n"In what direction, think you?"\n\n"I don\'t think. I tell you all I know. Last night a Tatar from the\ngeneral came galloping up,--brought orders for the battalion to march,\ntaking two days\' rations. But whither, why, how long, isn\'t for them to\nask. Orders are to go--that\'s enough."\n\n"Still, if they are going to take only two days\' rations, it\'s likely\nthe army will not stay longer."\n\n"That\'s no argument at all."\n\n"And how is that?" I asked with astonishment.\n\n"This is the way of it: When they went against Dargi they took a week\'s\nrations, but they spent almost a month."\n\n"And can I go with you?" I asked, after a short silence.\n\n"Yes, you _can_ go; but my advice is--better not. Why run the risk?"\n\n"No, allow me to disregard your advice. I have been spending a\nwhole month here for this very purpose,--of having a chance to see\naction,--and you want me to let it have the go-by!"\n\n"All right, come with us; only isn\'t it true that it would be better\nfor you to stay behind? You could wait for us here, you could go\nhunting. But as to us,--God knows what will become of us!... And\nthat would be first-rate," he said in such a convincing tone that it\nseemed to me at the first moment that it would actually be first-rate.\nNevertheless, I said resolutely that I wouldn\'t stay behind for any\nthing.\n\n"And what have you to see there?" said the captain, still trying\nto dissuade me. "If you want to learn how battles are fought, read\nMikha\xc3\xaflovski Danilevski\'s \'Description of War,\' a charming book; there\nit\'s all admirably described,--where every corps stands, and how\nbattles are fought."\n\n"On the contrary, that does not interest me," I replied.\n\n"Well, now, how is this? It simply means that you want to see how men\nkill each other, doesn\'t it?... Here in 1832 there was a man like\nyourself, not in the regular service,--a Spaniard, I think he was. He\nwent on two expeditions with us,... in a blue mantle or something of\nthe sort, and so the young fellow was killed. Here, _b\xc3\xa1tiushka,_ one is\nnot surprised at any thing."\n\nAshamed as I was at the captain\'s manifest disapprobation of my\nproject, I did not attempt to argue him down.\n\n"Well, he was brave, wasn\'t he?"\n\n"God knows as to that. He always used to ride at the front. Wherever\nthere was firing, there he was."\n\n"So he must have been brave, then," said I.\n\n"No, that doesn\'t signify bravery,--his putting himself where he wasn\'t\ncalled."\n\n"What do you call bravery, then?"\n\n"Bravery, bravery?" repeated the captain with the expression of a man\nto whom such a question presents itself for the first time. "A brave\nman is one who conducts himself as he ought," said he after a brief\nconsideration.\n\nI remembered that Plato defined bravery as the knowledge of what one\nought and what one ought not to fear; and in spite of the triteness and\nobscurity in the terminology of the captain\'s definition, I thought\nthat the fundamental conception of both was not so unlike as might at\nfirst sight appear, and that the captain\'s definition was even more\ncorrect than the Greek philosopher\'s, for the reason, that, if he could\nhave expressed himself as Plato did, he would in all probability have\nsaid that that man is brave who fears only what he ought to fear and\nnot what there is no need of fearing.\n\nI was anxious to explain my thought to the captain.\n\n"Yes," I said, "it seems to me that in every peril there is an\nalternative, and the alternative adopted under the influence of,\nsay, the sentiment of duty, is bravery, but the alternative adopted\nunder the influence of a lower sentiment is cowardice; therefore it\nis impossible to call a man brave who risks his life out of vanity\nor curiosity or greediness, and, _vice versa,_ the man who under the\ninfluence of the virtuous sentiment of family obligation, or simply\nfrom conviction, avoids peril, cannot be called a coward."\n\nThe captain looked at me with a queer sort of expression while I was\ntalking.\n\n"Well, now, I don\'t know how to reason this out with you," said he,\nfilling his pipe, "but we have with us a junker, and he likes to\nphilosophize. You talk with him. He also writes poetry."\n\nI had only become intimate with the captain in the Caucasus, but I had\nknown him before in Russia. His mother, Marya Ivanovna Khlopova, the\nowner of a small landed estate, lives about two _versts_[2] from my\nhome. Before I went to the Caucasus I visited her. The old lady was\ngreatly delighted that I was going to see her P\xc3\xa1shenka[3] (thus she\ncalled the old gray-haired captain), and, like a living letter, could\ntell him about her circumstances and give him a little message. Having\nmade me eat my fill of a glorious pie and roast chicken, Marya Ivanovna\nwent to her sleeping-room and came back with a rather large black\nrelic-bag,[4] to which was attached some kind of silken ribbon.\n\n"Here is this image of our Mother-Intercessor from the September\nfestival," she said, kissing the picture of the divine Mother attached\nto the cross, and putting it into my hand. "Please give it to him,\n_b\xc3\xa1tiushka._ You see, when he went to the Kaikaz, I had a Te Deum\nsung, and made a vow, that if he should be safe and sound, I would\norder this image of the divine Mother. And here it is seventeen years\nthat the _M\xc3\xa1tushka_ and the saints have had him in their keeping;\nnot once has he been wounded, and what battles he has been in, as it\nseems!... When Mikhailo, who was with him, told me about it, my hair\nactually stood on end. You see, all that I know about him I have to\nhear from others; he never writes me any thing about his doings, my\ndove,[5]--he is afraid of frightening me."\n\n(I had already heard in the Caucasus, but not from the captain himself,\nthat he had been severely wounded four times; and, as was to be\nexpected, he had not written his mother about his wounds any more than\nabout his campaigns.)\n\n"Now let him wear this holy image," she continued. "I bless him with\nit. The most holy Intercessor protect him, especially in battle may she\nalways look after him! And so tell him, my dear, friend,[6] that thy\nmother gave thee this message."\n\nI promised faithfully to fulfil her commission.\n\n"I know you will be fond of him, of my P\xc3\xa1shenka," the old lady\ncontinued,--"he is such a splendid fellow! Would you believe me, not a\nyear goes by without his sending me money, and he also helps Annushka\nmy daughter, and all from his wages alone. Truly I shall always thank\nGod," she concluded with tears in her eyes, "that he has given me such\na child."\n\n"Does he write you often?" I asked.\n\n"Rarely, _b\xc3\xa1tiushka,_--not more than once a year; and sometimes when\nhe sends money he writes a little word, and sometimes he doesn\'t. \'If\nI don\'t write you, _m\xc3\xa1menka,_\' he says, \'it means that I\'m alive and\nwell; but if any thing should happen,--which God forbid,--then they\nwill write you for me.\'"\n\nWhen I gave the captain his mother\'s gift (it was in my room), he asked\nme for some wrapping-paper, carefully tied it up, and put it away. I\ngave him many details of his mother\'s life: the captain was silent.\nWhen I had finished, he went into a corner, and took a very long time\nin filling his pipe.\n\n"Yes, she\'s a fine old lady," said he from the corner, in a rather\nchoked voice: "God grant that we may meet again!"\n\nGreat love and grief were expressed in these simple words.\n\n"Why do you serve here?" I asked.\n\n"Have to serve," he replied with decision. "And double pay means a good\ndeal for our brother, who is a poor man."\n\nThe captain lived economically; he did not play cards, he rarely drank\nto excess, and he smoked ordinary tobacco, which from some inexplicable\nreason he did not call by its usual name,[7] but _sambrotalicheski\ntab\xc3\xa1k._ The captain had pleased me even before this. He had one of\nthose simple, calm Russian faces, and looked you straight in the eye\nagreeably and easily. But after this conversation I felt a genuine\nrespect for him.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: _Nab\xc3\xa9g_ (pronounced Na-be-ukh), the Invasion or Raid.]\n\n[Footnote 2: One and a third miles.]\n\n[Footnote 3: An affectionate diminished diminutive: Pavel (Paul),\nPasha, Pashenka.]\n\n[Footnote 4: _l\xc3\xa1danka,_ the bag containing sacred things worn by the\npious, together with the baptismal cross.]\n\n[Footnote 5: _golubchik._]\n\n[Footnote 6: _mo\xc3\xaf b\xc3\xa1tiushka._]\n\n[Footnote 7: _tiuti\xc3\xban._]\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nAt four o\'clock on the morning of the next day, the captain came riding\nup to my door. He had on an old well-worn coat without epaulets, wide\nLesghian trousers, a round white Circassian cap, with drooping lambskin\ndyed yellow, and an ugly-looking Asiatic sabre across his shoulder. The\nlittle white horse[8] on which he rode came with head down, and mincing\ngait, and kept switching his slender tail. In spite of the fact that\nthe good captain\'s figure was neither very warlike nor very handsome,\nyet there was in it such an expression of good-will toward every one\naround him, that it inspired involuntary respect.\n\nI did not keep him waiting a minute, but immediately mounted, and we\nrode off together from the gate of the fortress.\n\nThe battalion was already two hundred _sazhens_[9] ahead of us, and had\nthe appearance of some black, solid body in motion. It was possible to\nmake out that it was infantry, only from the circumstance that while\nthe bayonets appeared like long, dense needles, occasionally there came\nto the ear the sounds of a soldier\'s song, the drum, and a charming\ntenor, the leader of the sixth company,--a song which I had more than\nonce enjoyed at the fort.\n\nThe road ran through the midst of a deep, wide ravine, or _balka_ as it\nis called in the Caucasian dialect, along the banks of a small river,\nwhich at this time _was playing,_ that is, was having a freshet. Flocks\nof wild pigeons hovered around it, now settling on the rocky shore, now\nwheeling about in mid-air in swift circles and disappearing from sight.\n\nThe sun was not yet visible, but the summit of the balka on the\nright began to grow luminous. The gray and white colored crags, the\ngreenish-yellow moss wet with dew, the clumps of different kinds of\nwild thorn,[10] stood out extraordinarily distinct and rotund in the\npellucid golden light of the sunrise.\n\nOn the other hand, the ravine, hidden in thick mist which rolled\nup like smoke in varying volumes, was damp, and dark, and gave the\nimpression of an indistinguishable mixture of colors--pale lilac,\nalmost purple, dark green, and white.\n\nDirectly in front of us, against the dark blue of the horizon, with\nstartling distinctness appeared the dazzling white, silent masses of\nthe snow-capped mountains with their marvellous shadows and outlines\nexquisite even in the smallest details. Crickets, grasshoppers, and\na thousand other insects, were awake in the tall grass, and filled\nthe air with their sharp, incessant clatter: it seemed as though a\nnumberless multitude of tiny bells were jingling in our very ears. The\natmosphere was alive with waters, with foliage, with mist; in a word,\nhad all the life of a beautiful early summer morning.\n\nThe captain struck a light, and began to puff at his pipe; the\nfragrance of _sambrotalicheski tab\xc3\xa1k_ and of the punk struck me as\nextremely pleasant.\n\nWe rode along the side of the road so as to overtake the infantry as\nquickly as possible. The captain seemed more serious than usual; he\ndid not take his Daghestan pipe from his mouth, and at every step he\ndug his heels into his horse\'s legs as the little beast, capering\nfrom one side to the other, laid out a scarcely noticeable dark green\ntrack through the damp, tall grass. Up from under his very feet, with\nits shrill cry,[11] and that drumming of the wings that is so sure to\nstartle the huntsman in spite of himself, flew the pheasant, and slowly\nwinged its flight on high. The captain paid him not the slightest\nattention.\n\n"We had almost overtaken the battalion, when behind us was heard the\nsound of a galloping horse, and in an instant there rode by us a very\nhandsome young fellow in an officer\'s coat, and a tall white Circassian\ncap.[12] As he caught up with us he smiled, bowed to the captain, and\nwaved his whip.... I only had time to notice that he sat in the saddle\nand held the bridle with peculiar grace, and that he had beautiful dark\neyes, a finely cut nose, and a mustache just beginning to grow. I was\nparticularly attracted by the way in which he could not help smiling,\nas if to impress it upon us that we were friends of his. If by nothing\nelse than his smile, one would have known that he was still very young.\n\n"And now where is he going?" grumbled the captain with a look of\ndissatisfaction, not taking his pipe from his mouth.\n\n"Who is that?" I asked.\n\n"Ensign Al\xc3\xa1nin, a subaltern officer of my company.... Only last month\nhe came from the School of Cadets."\n\n"This is the first time that he is going into action, I suppose?" said\nI.\n\n"And so he is overjoyed," replied the captain thoughtfully, shaking his\nhead; "it\'s youth."\n\n"And why shouldn\'t he be glad? I can see that for a young officer this\nmust be very interesting."\n\nThe captain said nothing for two minutes.\n\n"And that\'s why I say \'it\'s youth,\'" he continued in a deep tone. "What\nis there to rejoice in, when there\'s nothing to see? Here when one goes\noften, one doesn\'t find any pleasure in it. Here, let us suppose there\nare twenty of us officers going: some of us will be either killed or\nwounded; that\'s likely. To-day my turn, to-morrow his, the next day\nsomebody else\'s. So what is there to rejoice in?"\n\n\n[Footnote 8: _mashtak_ in the Caucasian dialect.]\n\n[Footnote 9: Fourteen hundred feet.]\n\n[Footnote 10: Paliurus, box-thorn, and _karachag._]\n\n[Footnote 11: _tordoka\'y\xc3\xa9._]\n\n[Footnote 12: _pap\xc3\xa1kha._]\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nScarcely had the bright sun risen above the mountains, and begun\nto shine into the valley where we were riding, when the undulating\nclouds of mist scattered, and it grew warm. The soldiers with guns and\nknapsacks on their backs marched slowly along the dusty road. In the\nranks were frequently heard Malo-Russian dialogues and laughter. A few\nold soldiers in white linen coats--for the most part non-commissioned\nofficers--marched along the roadside with their pipes, engaged in\nearnest conversation. The triple rows of heavily laden wagons advanced\nstep by step, and raised a thick dust, which hung motionless.\n\nThe mounted officers rode in advance; a few _jiggited,_ as they say\nin the Caucasus;[13] that is, applying the whip to their horses, they\nspurred them on to make four or five leaps, and then reined them in\nsuddenly, pulling the head back. Others listened to the song-singers,\nwho notwithstanding the heat and the oppressive air indefatigably tuned\nup one song after another.\n\nA hundred _sazhens_ in advance of the infantry, on a great white horse,\nsurrounded by mounted Tatars, rode a tall, handsome officer in Asiatic\ncostume, known to the regiment as a man of reckless valor, one who cuts\n_any one straight in the eyes!_[14] He wore a black Tatar half-coat or\n_beshm\xc3\xa9t_ trimmed with silver braid, similar trousers, new leggings[15]\nclosely laced with _chirazui_ as they call galloons in the Caucasus,\nand a tall, yellow Cherkessian cap worn jauntily on the back of his\nhead. On his breast and back were silver lacings. His powder-flask and\npistol were hung at his back; another pistol, and a dagger in a silver\nsheath, depended from his belt. Besides all this was buckled on a sabre\nin a red morocco sheath adorned with silver; and over the shoulder hung\nhis musket in a black case.\n\nBy his garb, his carriage, his manner, and indeed by every motion,\nit was manifest that his ambition was to ape the Tatars. He was just\nsaying something, in a language that I did not understand, to the\nTatars who rode with him; but from the doubtful, mocking glances which\nthese latter gave each other, I came to the conclusion that they did\nnot understand him either.\n\nThis was one of our young officers of the dare-devil, _jigit_ order,\nwho get themselves up \xc3\xa0 la Marlinski and Lermontof. These men look\nupon the Caucasus, as it were, through the prism of the "Heroes of our\nTime," Mulla-Nurof[16] and others, and in all their activities are I\ndirected not by their own inclinations but by the example of these\nmodels.\n\nThis lieutenant, for instance, was very likely fond of the society\nof well-bred women and men of importance, generals, colonels,\nadjutants,--I may even go so far as to believe that he was very fond of\nthis society, because he was in the highest degree vainglorious,--but\nhe considered it his unfailing duty to show his rough side to all\nimportant people, although he offended them always more or less; and\nwhen any lady made her appearance at the fortress, then he considered\nit his duty to ride by her windows with his cronies, or _kunaki_ as\nthey are called in the dialect of the Caucasus, dressed in a red shirt\nand nothing but _chuviaki_ on his bare legs, and shouting and swearing\nat the top of his voice--but all this not only with the desire to\ninsult her, but also to show her what handsome white legs he had, and\nhow easy it would be to fall in love with him if only he himself were\nwilling. Or he often went by at night with two or three friendly Tatars\nto the mountains into ambush by the road so as to take by surprise and\nkill hostile Tatars coming along; and though more than once his heart\ntold him that there was nothing brave in such a deed, yet he felt\nhimself under obligations to inflict suffering upon people in whom he\nthought that he was disappointed, and whom he affected to hate and\ndespise. He always carried two things,--an immense holy image around\nhis neck, and a dagger above his shirt. He never took them off, but\neven went to bed with them. He firmly believed that enemies surrounded\nhim. It was his greatest delight to argue that he was under obligations\nto wreak vengeance on some one and wash out insults in blood. He was\npersuaded that spite, vengeance, and hatred of the human race were the\nhighest and most poetical of feelings. But his mistress,--a Circassian\ngirl course,--whom I happened afterwards to meet, said that he was\nthe mildest and gentlest of men, and that every evening he wrote in\nhis gloomy diary, cast up his accounts on ruled paper, and got on his\nknees to say his prayers. And how much suffering he endured, to seem\nto himself only what he desired to be, because his comrades and the\nsoldiers could not comprehend him as he desired!\n\nOnce, in one of his nocturnal expeditions with his Tatar friends, it\nhappened that he put a bullet into the leg of a hostile Tchetchenets,\nand took him prisoner. This Tchetchenets for seven weeks thereafter\nlived with the lieutenant; the lieutenant dressed his wound, waited\non him as though he were his nearest friend, and when he was cured\nsent him home with gifts. Afterwards, during an expedition when the\nlieutenant was retreating from the post, having been repulsed by the\nenemy, he heard some one call him by name, and his wounded _kun\xc3\xa1k_\nstrode out from among the hostile Tatars, and by signs asked him to do\nthe same. The lieutenant went to meet his _kun\xc3\xa1k,_ and shook hands with\nhim. The mountaineers stood at some little distance, and refrained from\nfiring; but, as soon as the lieutenant turned his horse to go back,\nseveral shot at him, and one bullet grazed the small of his back.\n\nAnother time I myself saw a fire break out by night in the fortress,\nand two companies of soldiers were detailed to put it out. Amid the\ncrowd, lighted up by the ruddy glare of the fire, suddenly appeared the\ntall form of the man on a coal-black horse. He forced his way through\nthe crowd, and rode straight to the fire. As soon as he came near, the\nlieutenant leaped from his horse, and hastened into the house, which\nwas all in flames on one side. At the end of five minutes he emerged\nwith singed hair and burned sleeves, carrying in his arms two doves\nwhich he had rescued from the flames.\n\nHis name was Rosenkranz; but he often spoke of his ancestry, traced it\nback to the Varangians, and clearly showed that he and his forefathers\nwere genuine Russians.\n\n\n[Footnote 13: _jigit_ or _djigit_ in the Kumuits dialect signifies\nvaliant. The Russians make from it the verb _jigitovat._]\n\n[Footnote 14: That is, known for telling the plain truth.]\n\n[Footnote 15: _chuviaki._]\n\n[Footnote 16: The name of a character In one of Marlinski\'s novels.]\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nThe sun had travelled half its course, and was pouring down through\nthe glowing atmosphere its fierce rays upon the parched earth. The\ndark blue sky was absolutely clear; only the bases of the snow-capped\nmountains began to clothe themselves in pale lilac clouds. The\nmotionless atmosphere seemed to be full of some impalpable dust; it\nbecame intolerably hot.\n\nWhen the army came to a small brook that had overflowed half the road,\na halt was called. The soldiers, stacking their arms, plunged into\nthe stream. The commander of the battalion sat down in the shade,\non a drum, and, showing by his broad countenance the degree of his\nrank, made ready, in company with a few officers, to take lunch. The\ncaptain lay on the grass under the company\'s transport-wagon; the\ngallant lieutenant Rosenkranz and some other young officers, spreading\nout their Caucasian mantles, or _burki,_ threw themselves down, and\nbegan to carouse as was manifest by the flasks and bottles scattered\naround them and by the extraordinary liveliness of their singers, who,\nstanding in a half-circle behind them, gave an accompaniment to the\nCaucasian dance-song sung by a Lesghian girl:--\n\n    Shamyl resolved to make a league\n    In the years gone by,\n    Tra\xc3\xaf-ra\xc3\xaf, rattat-ta\xc3\xaf,\n    In the years gone by.\n\nAmong these officers was also the young ensign who had passed us in the\nmorning. He was very entertaining: his eyes gleamed, his tongue never\ngrew weary. He wanted to greet every one, and show his good-will to\nthem all. Poor lad! he did not know that in acting this way he might be\nridiculous, that his frankness and the gentleness which he showed to\nevery one might win for him, not the love which he so much desired, but\nridicule; he did not know this either, that when at last, thoroughly\nheated, he threw himself down on his _burka,_ and leaned his head\non his hand, letting his thick black curls fall over, he was a very\npicture of beauty.\n\nTwo officers crouched under a wagon, and were playing cards on a hamper.\n\nI listened with curiosity to the talk of the soldiers and officers,\nand attentively watched the expression of their faces; but, to tell\nthe truth, in not one could I discover a shadow of that anxiety which\nI myself felt; jokes, laughter, anecdotes, expressed the universal\ncarelessness, and indifference to the coming peril. How impossible to\nsuppose that it was not fated for some never again to pass that road!\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nAt seven o\'clock in the evening, dusty and weary, we entered the wide,\nfortified gate of Fort N----. The sun was setting, and shed oblique\nrosy rays over the picturesque batteries and lofty-walled gardens\nthat surrounded the fortress, over the fields yellow for the harvest,\nand over the white clouds which, gathering around the snow-capped\nmountains, simulated their shapes, and formed a chain no less wonderful\nand beauteous. A young half moon, like a translucent cloud, shone above\nthe horizon. In the native village or _aul,_ situated near the gate,\na Tatar on the roof of a hut was calling the faithful to prayer. The\nsingers broke out with new zeal and energy.\n\nAfter resting and making my toilet I set out to call upon an adjutant\nwho was an acquaintance of mine, to ask him to make my intention known\nto the general. On the way from the suburb where I was quartered, I\nchanced to see a most unexpected spectacle in the fortress of N----.\nI was overtaken by a handsome two-seated vehicle in which I saw a\nstylish bonnet, and heard French spoken. From the open window of the\ncommandant\'s house came floating the sounds of some "L\xc3\xadzanka" or\n"K\xc3\xa1tenka" polka played upon a wretched piano, out of tune. In the\ntavern which I was passing were sitting a number of clerks over their\nglasses of wine, with cigarettes in their hands, and I overheard one\nsaying to another,--\n\n"Excuse me, but taking politics into consideration, M\xc3\xa1rya Grig\xc3\xb3r\'yevna\nis our first lady."\n\nA humpbacked Jew of sickly countenance, dressed in a dilapidated coat,\nwas creeping along with a shrill, broken-down hand-organ; and over the\nwhole suburb echoed the sounds of the finale of "Lucia."\n\nTwo women in rustling dresses, with silk kerchiefs around their necks\nand bright-colored sun-shades in their hands, hastened past me on the\nplank sidewalk. Two girls, one in pink, the other in a blue dress,\nwith uncovered heads, were standing on the terrace of a small house,\nand affectedly laughing with the obvious intention of attracting the\nnotice of some passing officers. Officers in new coats, white gloves,\nand glistening epaulets, were parading up and down the streets and\nboulevards.\n\nI found my acquaintance on the lower floor of the general\'s house.\nI had scarcely had time to explain to him my desire, and have his\nassurance that it could most likely be gratified, when the handsome\ncarriage, which I had before seen, rattled past the window where I was\nsitting. From the carriage descended a tall, slender man, in uniform of\nthe infantry service and major\'s epaulets, and came up to the general\'s\nrooms.\n\n"_Akh!_ pardon me, I beg of you," said the adjutant, rising from his\nplace: "it\'s absolutely necessary that I tell the general."\n\n"Who is it that just came?" I asked.\n\n"The countess," he replied, and donning his uniform coat hastened\nup-stairs.\n\nIn the course of a few minutes there appeared on the steps a short but\nvery handsome man in a coat without epaulets, and a white cross in his\nbutton-hole. Behind him came the major, the adjutant, and two other\nofficers.\n\nIn his carriage, his voice, in all his motions, the general showed that\nhe had a very keen appreciation of his high importance.\n\n_"Bon soir, Madame la Comtesse,"_ he said, extending his hand through\nthe carriage window.\n\nA dainty little hand in dog-skin glove took his hand, and a pretty,\nsmiling little visage under a yellow bonnet appeared in the window.\n\nFrom the conversation which lasted several minutes, I only heard, as I\nwent by, the general saying in French with a smile,--\n\n"You know that I have vowed to fight the infidels; beware of becoming\none!"\n\nA laugh rang from the carriage.\n\n"_Adieu donc, cher g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9ral._"\n\n"_Non, au revoir,_" said the general, returning to the steps of the\nstaircase; "don\'t forget that I have invited myself for to-morrow\nevening.".\n\nThe carriage drove away.\n\n"Here is a man," said I to myself as _I_ went home, "who has every\nthing that Russians strive after,--rank, wealth, society,--and this\nman, before a battle the outcome of which God only knows, jests with\na pretty little woman, and promises to drink tea with her on the next\nday, just as though he had met her at a ball!"\n\nThere at that adjutant\'s I became acquainted with a man who still more\nsurprised me; it was the young lieutenant of the K. regiment, who was\ndistinguished for his almost feminine mildness and cowardice. He came\nto the adjutant to pour out his peevishness and ill humor against those\nmen who, he thought, were intriguing against him to keep him from\ntaking part in the matter in hand.\n\nHe declared that it was hateful to be treated so, that it was not doing\nas comrades ought, that he would remember him, and so forth.\n\nAs soon as I saw the expression of his face, as soon as I heard the\nsound of his voice, I could not escape the conviction that he was not\nonly not putting it on, but was deeply stirred and hurt because he was\nnot allowed to go against the Cherkess, and expose himself to their\nfire: he was as much hurt as a child is hurt who is unjustly punished.\nI could not understand it at all.\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nAt ten o\'clock in the evening the troops were ordered to march. At\nhalf-past nine I mounted my horse, and started off to find the general;\nbut on reflecting that he and his adjutant must be busy, I remained in\nthe street, and, tying my horse to a fence, sat down on the terrace to\nwait until the general should come.\n\nThe heat and glare of the day had already vanished in the fresh night\nair; and the obscure light of the young moon, which, infolding around\nitself a pale gleaming halo against the dark blue of the starry sky,\nwas beginning to decline. Lights shone in the windows of the houses and\nin the chinks of the earth huts. The gracefully proportioned poplars\nin the gardens, standing out against the horizon from behind the earth\nhuts, whose reed-thatched roofs gleamed pale in the moonlight, seemed\nstill taller and blacker.\n\nThe long shadows of the houses, of the trees, of the fences, lay\nbeautifully across the white dusty road. In the river rang incessantly\nthe voice of the frogs;[17] in the streets were heard hurrying steps,\nand sounds of voices, and the galloping of horses. From the suburb came\nfloating, now and again, the strains of the hand-organ; now the popular\nRussian air, "The winds are blowing," now one of the Aurora waltzes.\n\nI will not tell what my thoughts were: in the first place, because\nI should be ashamed to confess to the melancholy ideas which without\ncessation arose in my mind, while all around me I perceived only gayety\nand mirth; and, in the second place, because they have nothing to do\nwith my story.\n\nI was so deeply engrossed in thought, that I did not notice that the\nbell was ringing for eleven o\'clock, and the general was riding past me\nwith his suite.\n\nThe rearguard was just at the fortress gate. I galloped at full speed\nacross the bridge, amid a crush of cannon, caissons, military wagons,\nand commanding officers shouting at the top of their voices. After\nreaching the gate, I rode at a brisk trot for almost a verst, past\nthe army stretched out and silently moving through the darkness, and\novertook the general. As I made my way past the mounted artillery\ndragging their ordnance, amid the cannon and officers, a German voice,\nlike a disagreeable dissonance interrupting soft and majestic harmony,\nstruck my ear. It screamed, "Agkhtingkhist,[18] bring a linstock."\n\nAnd a soldier\'s voice replied, quick as a flash, "Chevchenko! the\nlieutenant asks for a light!"\n\nThe greater part of the sky had become enveloped in long steel-gray\nclouds: here and there gleamed from between them the lustreless stars.\nThe moon was now sinking behind the near horizon of dark mountains\nwhich were on the right; and it shed on their summits a feeble, waning,\nhalf light, which contrasted sharply with the impenetrable darkness\nthat marked their bases.\n\nThe air was mild, and so still, that not a single grass-blade, not a\nsingle mist-wreath, moved. It became so dark, that it was impossible\nto distinguish objects, even though very near at hand. On the side of\nthe road, there seemed to me sometimes to be rocks, sometimes animals,\nsometimes strange men; and I knew that they were bushes only when I\nheard them rustle, and felt the coolness of the dew with which they\nwere covered. In front of me I saw a dense, waving black shadow, behind\nwhich followed a few moving spots; this was the van-guard of cavalry,\nand the general with his suite. Between us moved another similar black\nmass, but this was not as high as the first; this was the infantry.\n\nSuch silence reigned in the whole detachment, that there could be\nplainly distinguished all the harmonious voices of the night, full of\nmysterious charm. The distant melancholy howls of jackals, sometimes\nlike the wails of despair, sometimes like laughter; the monotonous\nringing song of the cricket, the frog, the quail; a gradually\napproaching murmur, the cause of which I could not make clear to my own\nmind; and all those nocturnal, almost audible motions of nature, which\nit is so impossible either to comprehend or define,--unite into one\ncomplete, beautiful harmony which we call silent night.\n\nThis silence was broken, or rather was unified, by the dull thud of the\nhoofs, and the rustling of the tall grass through which the division\nwas slowly moving.\n\nOccasionally, however, was heard in the ranks the ring of a heavy\ncannon, the sound of clashing bayonets, stifled conversation, and the\nsnorting of a horse.\n\nNature breathed peacefully in beauty and power.\n\nIs it possible that people find no room to live together in this\nbeautiful world, under this boundless starry heaven? Is it possible\nthat amid this bewitching nature, the soul of man can harbor the\nsentiments of hatred and revenge, or the passion for inflicting\ndestruction upon his kind? All ugly feelings in the heart of man ought,\nit would seem, to vanish away in this intercourse with nature,--with\nthis immediate expression of beauty and goodness!\n\n\n[Footnote 17: The frogs in the Caucasus make a sound entirely different\nfrom the _Kvakan\'y\xc3\xa9_ of the Russian frogs.]\n\n[Footnote 18: German mispronunciation for _Antichrist,_ the accent of\nwhich in Russian falls on the penult.]\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nWe had now been marching more than two hours. I began to feel chilly,\nand to be overcome with drowsiness. In the darkness the same indistinct\nobjects dimly appeared: at a little distance, the same black shadow,\nthe same moving spots. Beside me was the crupper of a white horse,\nwhich switched his tail and swung his hind-legs in wide curves. I could\nsee a back in a white Circassian shirt, against which was outlined a\ncarbine in its black case, and the handle of a pistol in an embroidered\nholster: the glow of a cigarette casting a gleam on a reddish mustache,\na fur collar, and a hand in a chamois-skin glove.\n\nI leaned over my horse\'s neck, closed my eyes, and lost myself for a\nfew minutes: then suddenly the regular hoof-beat[19] and rustling came\ninto my consciousness again. I looked around, and it seemed to me as\nthough I were standing still in one spot, and that the black shadow\nin front of me was moving down upon me; or else that the shadow stood\nstill, and I was rapidly riding down upon it.\n\nAt one such moment I was more strongly than ever impressed by that\nincessantly approaching sound, the cause of which I could not fathom:\nit was the roar of water. We were passing though a deep gulch, and\ncoming close to a mountain river, which at that season was in full\nflood.[20] The roaring became louder, the damp grass grew taller and\nthicker, bushes were encountered in denser clumps, and the horizon\nnarrowed itself down to closer limits. Now and then, in different\nplaces in the dark hollows of the mountains, bright fires flashed out\nand were immediately extinguished.\n\n"Tell me, please, what are those fires," I asked in a whisper of the\nTatar riding at my side.\n\n"Don\'t you really know?" was his reply.\n\n"No," said I.\n\n"That is mountain straw tied to a pole,[21] and the light is waved."\n\n"What for?"\n\n"So that every man may know the Russian is coming. Now in the Auls," he\nadded with a smile, "_a\xc3\xaf, a\xc3\xaf_ the _tom\xc3\xa1sha_[22] are flying about; every\nsort of _khurda-murda_[23] will be hurried into the ravines."\n\n"How do they know so soon in the mountains that the expedition is\ncoming?" I asked.\n\n"_E\xc3\xaf!_ How can they help knowing? It\'s known everywhere: that\'s the\nkind of people we are."\n\n"And so Shamyl is now getting ready to march out?" I asked.\n\n"_Yok_ (no)," he replied, shaking his head as a sign of negation,\n"Shamyl will not march out. Shamyl will send his _na\xc3\xafbs_[24] and he\nhimself will look down from up yonder through his glass."\n\n"But doesn\'t he live a long way off?"\n\n"Not a long way off. Here, at your left, about ten _versts_ he will be."\n\n"How do you know that?" I inquired. "Have you been there?"\n\n"I\'ve been there. All of us in the mountains have."\n\n"And you have seen Shamyl?"\n\n"_Pikh!_ Shamyl is not to be seen by us. A hundred, three hundred, a\nthousand _murids_[25] surround him. Shamyl will be in the midst of\nthem," he said with an expression of fawning servility.\n\nLooking up in the air, it was possible to make out that the sky which\nhad become clear again was lighter in the east, and the Pleiades were\nsinking down into the horizon. But in the gulch through which we were\npassing, it was humid and dark.\n\nSuddenly, a little in advance of us, from out the darkness flashed a\nnumber of lights; at the same instant, with a ping some bullets whizzed\nby, and from out the silence that surrounded us from afar arose the\nheavy, overmastering roar of the guns. This was the vanguard of the\nenemy\'s pickets. The Tatars, of which it was composed, set up their\nwar-cry, shot at random, and fled in all directions.\n\nEvery thing became silent again. The general summoned his interpreter.\nThe Tatar in a white Circassian dress hastened up to him, and the two\nheld a rather long conversation in a sort of whisper and with many\ngestures.\n\n"Colonel Khas\xc3\xa1nof! give orders to scatter the enemy," said the general\nin a low, deliberate, but distinct tone of voice.\n\nThe division went down to the river. The black mountains stood back\nfrom the pass; it was beginning to grow light. The arch of heaven,\nin which the pale, lustreless stars were barely visible, seemed to\ncome closer; the dawn began to glow brightly in the east; a cool,\npenetrating breeze sprang up from the west, and a bright mist like\nsteam arose from the foaming river.\n\n\n[Footnote 19: _topot._]\n\n[Footnote 20: In the Caucasus the freshets take place in the mouth of\nJuly.]\n\n[Footnote 21: _tayak_ in the Caucasian dialect.]\n\n[Footnote 22: _tom\xc3\xa1sha_ means slaves in the ordinary dialect invented\nfor intercourse between Russians and Tatars. There are many words in\nthis strange dialect, the roots of which are not to be found either in\nRussian or Tatar.--AUTHOR\'S NOTE.]\n\n[Footnote 23: Goods and chattels in the same dialect.]\n\n[Footnote 24: _na\xc3\xafb_ ordinarily means a Mohammedan judge or high\nreligious officer, in Turkey and the Caucasus; hero it means an officer\nwhom the great Circassian chieftain Shamyl endowed with special\nauthority.]\n\n[Footnote 25: The word _murid_ has many significations, but in\nthe sense here employed it means something between adjutant and\nbody-guard.--AUTHOR\'S NOTE.]\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nThe guide pointed out the ford; and the vanguard of cavalry, with\nthe general and his suite immediately in its rear, began to cross\nthe river. The water, which reached the horses\' breasts, rushed with\nextraordinary violence among the white bowlders which in some places\ncame to the top, and formed foaming, gurgling whirlpools around the\nhorses\' legs. The horses were frightened at the roar of the water,\nlifted their heads, pricked up their ears, but slowly and carefully\npicked their way against the stream along the uneven bottom. The\nriders held up their legs and fire-arms. The foot-soldiers, literally\nin their shirts alone, lifting above the water their muskets to which\nwere fastened their bundles of clothing, struggled against the force\nof the stream by clinging together, a score of men at a time, showing\nnoticeable determination on their excited faces. The artillery-men on\nhorseback, with a loud shout, put their horses into the water at full\ntrot. The cannon and green-painted caissons, over which now and then,\nthe water came pouring, plunged with a clang over the rocky bottom;\nbut the noble Cossack horses pulled with united effort, made the water\nfoam, and with dripping tails and manes emerged on the farther shore.\n\nAs soon as the crossing was effected, the general\'s face suddenly took\non an expression of deliberation and seriousness; he wheeled his horse\naround, and at full gallop rode across the wide forest-surrounded\nfield which spread before us. The Cossack horses were scattered along\nthe edge of the forest.\n\nIn the forest appeal\'s a man in Circassian dress and round cap; then\na second and a third ... one of the officers shouts, "Those are\nTatars!" At this instant a puff of smoke came from behind a tree ... a\nreport--another. The quick volleys of our men drown out those of the\nenemy. Only occasionally a bullet, with long-drawn ping like the hum of\na bee, flies by, and is the only proof that not all the shots are ours.\n\nHere the infantry at double quick, and with fixed bayonets, dash\nagainst the chain; one can hear the heavy reports of the guns, the\nmetallic clash of grape-shot, the whiz of rockets, the crackling of\nmusketry. The cavalry, the infantry, converge from all sides on the\nwide field. The smoke from the guns, rockets, and fire-arms, unites\nwith the early mist arising from the dew-covered grass.\n\nColonel Khas\xc3\xa1nof gallops up to the general, and reins in his horse\nwhile at full tilt.\n\n"Your Excellency," says he, lifting his hand to his cap, "give orders\nfor the cavalry to advance. The standards are coming,"[26] and he\npoints with his whip to mounted Tatars, at the head of whom rode two\nmen on white horses with red and blue streamers on their lances.\n\n"All right,[27] Iv\xc3\xa1n Mikh\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaflovitch," says the general. The colonel\nwheels his horse round on the spot, draws his sabre, and shouts\n"Hurrah!"\n\n"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" echoes from the ranks, and the cavalry dash\nafter him.\n\nAll look on with excitement: there is a standard;[28] another; a third;\na fourth!...\n\nThe enemy, not waiting the assault, fly into the forest, and open\na musket fire from behind the trees. The bullets fly more and more\nthickly.\n\n_"Quel charmant coup d\'oeil!"_ exclaimed the general as he easily rose\nin English fashion on his coal-black, slender-limbed little steed.\n\n"_Charmant,_" replies the major, who rolls his r\'s like a Frenchman,\nand whipping up his horse dashes after the general. "It\'s a genuine\npleasure to carry on war in such a fine country," says he.[29]\n\n"And above all in good company," adds the general still in French, with\na pleasant smile.\n\nThe major bowed.\n\nAt this time a cannon-ball from the enemy comes flying by with a swift,\ndisagreeable whiz, and strikes something; immediately is heard the\ngroan of a wounded man. This groan impresses me so painfully that the\nmartial picture instantly loses for me all its fascination: but no one\nbeside myself seems to be affected in the same way; the major smiles\napparently with the greatest satisfaction; another officer with perfect\nequanimity repeats the opening words of a speech; the general looks in\nthe opposite direction, and with the most tranquil smile says something\nin French.\n\n"Will you give orders to reply to their heavy guns?" asks the commander\nof the artillery, galloping up. "Yes, scare them a little," says the\ngeneral carelessly, lighting a cigar.\n\nThe battery is unlimbered, and the cannonade begins. The ground shakes\nunder the report; the firing continues without cessation; and the smoke\nin which it is scarcely possible to distinguish those attending the\nguns, blinds the eyes.\n\nThe aul is battered down. Again Colonel Khas\xc3\xa1nof dashes up, and at the\ngeneral\'s command darts off to the aul. The war-cry is heard again, and\nthe cavalry disappears in the cloud of its own dust.\n\nThe spectacle was truly grandiose. One thing only spoiled the general\nimpression for me as a man who had no part in the affair, and was\nwholly unwonted to it; and this was that there was too much of it,--the\nmotion and the animation and the shouts. Involuntarily the comparison\noccurred to me of a man who in his haste would cut the air with a\nhatchet.\n\n\n[Footnote 26: _znatchki._ This word among the mountaineers has almost\nthe signification of banner, with this single distinction, that each\njigit can make a standard for himself and carry it.--AUTHOR\'S NOTE.]\n\n[Footnote 27: _S B\xc3\xb3gom,_ literally "with God," but a mere phrase.]\n\n[Footnote 28: _znatch\xc3\xb3k._]\n\n[Footnote 29: _C\'est un vrai plaisir, que la guerre dans un aussi beau\npays._]\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nThe aul was already in the possession of our men, and not a soul of the\nenemy remained in it when the general with his suite, to which I had\njoined myself, entered it.\n\nThe long neat huts or _sakl\xc3\xad,_ with their flat earthen roofs and red\nchimneys, were situated on rough, rocky hills, between which ran a\nsmall river. On one side were seen the green gardens, shining in the\nclear sun-light, with monstrous pear-trees, and the plum-trees, called\n_luitcha._ The other side bristled with strange shadows, where stood\nthe high perpendicular stones of a cemetery, and the tall wooden poles\nadorned at the ends with balls and variegated banners. These were the\ntombs of jigits.\n\nThe army stood drawn up within the gates.\n\nAfter a moment the dragoons, the Cossacks, the infantry, with evident\njoy were let loose through the crooked streets, and the empty aul\nsuddenly teemed with life. Here a roof is crushed in; the axe rings on\nthe tough trees, and the plank door is broken down; there hay-ricks,\nfences, and huts are burning, and the dense smoke arises like a tower\nin the clear air. Here a Cossack is carrying off sacks of flour, and\ncarpets; a soldier with a gay face lugs from a hut a tin basin and a\ndish-clout; another with outstretched arms is trying to catch a couple\nof hens, which cackling furiously fly about the yard; a third is going\nsomewhere with a monstrous _kumgan_ or pitcher of milk, and drinking\nas he goes, and when he has had his fill smashes it on the ground with\na loud laugh.\n\nThe battalion which I had accompanied from Fort N---- was also in the\naul. The captain was sitting on the roof of a hut, and was puffing\nfrom his short little pipe clouds of smoke of _sambrotalicheski tab\xc3\xa1k_\nwith such an indifferent expression of countenance that when I saw him\nI forgot that I was in a hostile aul, and it seemed to me that I was\nactually at home with him.\n\n"Ah! and here you are?" he said as he caught sight of me.\n\nThe tall form of Lieutenant Rosenkranz flashed here and there through\nthe aul. Without a moment\'s pause he was engaged in carrying out\norders, and he had the appearance of a man who had all he could do.\nI saw him coming out of a hut, his face full of triumph; behind him\ntwo soldiers were dragging an old Tatar with his arms tied. The old\nman, whose garb consisted merely of a many-colored _beshm\xc3\xa9t_ torn in\ntatters, and ragged drawers, was so feeble that it seemed as if his\nbony arms, tightly tied behind his misshapen back, were almost falling\nfrom his shoulders; and his crooked bare legs moved with difficulty.\nHis face, and even a part of his shaven head, were covered with deep\nwrinkles; his distorted toothless mouth, encircled by gray clipped\nmustache and beard, incessantly mumbled as though whispering something;\nbut his handsome eyes, from which the lashes were gone, still gleamed\nwith fire, and clearly expressed an old man\'s indifference to life.\n\nRosenkranz through an interpreter asked him why he had not gone with\nthe others.\n\n"Where should I go?" he replied, calmly looking away.\n\n"Where the rest have gone," suggested some one.\n\n"The jigits have gone to fight with the Russians, and I am an old man."\n\n"Aren\'t you afraid of the Russians?"\n\n"What will the Russians do to me? I am an old man," he repeated,\ncarelessly glancing at the circle surrounding him.\n\nOn the way back, I saw this old man without a hat, with his hands still\ntied, jolting behind a mounted Cossack, and he was looking about him\nwith the same expression of unconcern. He was necessary in an exchange\nof prisoners.\n\nI went to the staircase, and crept up to where the captain was.\n\n"Not many of the enemy, it seems," I said to him, wishing to obtain his\nopinion about the affair.\n\n"The enemy," he repeated with surprise, "there weren\'t any at all. Do\nyou call these enemies?... Here when evening comes, you will see how we\nshall retreat; you will see how they will go with us! Won\'t they show\nthemselves there?" he added, pointing with his pipe to the forest which\nwe had passed in the morning.\n\n"What is that?" I asked anxiously, interrupting the captain, and\ndrawing his attention to some Don Cossacks who were grouped around some\none not far from us.\n\nAmong them was heard something like the weeping of a child, and the\nwords,--\n\n"Eh! don\'t cut--hold on--you will be seen--here\'s a knife--give him the\nknife."\n\n"They are up to some mischief, the brutes," said the captain\nindifferently.\n\nBut at this very instant, suddenly from around the corner came the\nhandsome ensign with burning, horror-stricken face, and waving his\nhands rushed among the Cossacks.\n\n"Don\'t you move! don\'t kill him!" he cried in his boyish treble.\n\nWhen the Cossacks saw the officer they started back, and allowed a\nlittle white goat to escape from their hands. The young ensign was\nwholly taken aback, began to mutter something, and stood before them\nfull of confusion. When he caught sight of the captain and me on the\nroof, he grew still redder in the face, and springing up the steps\njoined us.\n\n"I thought they were going to kill a child," he said with a timid\nsmile.\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nThe general had gone on ahead with the cavalry.\n\nThe battalion with which I had come from Fort N---- remained in\nthe rear-guard. The companies under command of Captain Khlopof and\nLieutenant Rosenkranz were retreating together.\n\nThe captain\'s prediction was fully justified: as soon as we had\nreached the narrow forest of which he had spoken, from both sides\nthe mountaineers, mounted and on foot, began to show themselves\nincessantly, and so near that I could very distinctly see many\ncrouching down, with muskets in their hands, and running from tree to\ntree.\n\nThe captain took off his hat, and piously made the sign of the cross;\na few old soldiers did the same. In the forest were heard shouts, the\nwords, "_i\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaf! Giaur! Ur\xc3\xbas! i\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaf!_"\n\nDry, short musket reports followed in quick succession, and bullets\nwhizzed from both sides. Our men silently replied with rapid fire;\nonly occasionally in the ranks were heard exclamations in the guise\nof directions: "_He_[30] has stopped shooting there;" "_He_ has a\ngood chance behind the trees;" "We ought to have cannon," and such\nexpressions.\n\nThe cannon were brought to bear on the range, and after a few\ndischarges of grape the enemy apparently gave way; but after a little\ntheir fire became more and more violent with each step that the army\ntook, and the shouts and war-cries increased.\n\nWe were scarcely three hundred _sazhens_[31] from the aul when the\nenemy\'s shot began to hail down upon us. I saw a ball with a thud\nstrike one soldier dead ... but why relate details of this terrible\nspectacle, when I myself would give much to forget it?\n\nLieutenant Rosenkranz was firing his musket without a moment\'s\ncessation; with animating voice he was shouting to the soldiers, and\ngalloping at full speed from one end of the line to the other. He\nwas slightly pale, and this was decidedly becoming to his martial\ncountenance.\n\nThe handsome ensign was in his element: his beautiful eyes gleamed\nwith resolution, his mouth was slightly parted with a smile; he\nwas constantly riding up to the captain, and asking permission to\ncharge.[32]\n\n"We\'ll drive them back," he said impulsively,--"we\'ll drive them back\nsurely."\n\n"No need of it," replied the captain gently: "we must get out of here."\n\nThe captain\'s company occupied the edge of the forest, and was fully\nexposed to the enemy\'s fire. The captain in his well-worn coat and\ntattered cap, slackening the reins for his white trotter and clinging\nby his short stirrups, silently staid in one place. (The soldiers were\nso well trained, and did their work so accurately, that there was no\nneed of giving commands to them.) Only now and then he raised his\nvoice, and shouted to those who exposed their heads. The captain\'s face\nwas very far from martial; but such truth and simplicity were manifest\nin it, that it impressed me profoundly.\n\n"There is some one who is truly brave," I said to myself involuntarily.\n\nHe was almost exactly the same as I had always seen him; the same\ntranquil motions, the same even voice, the same expression of frankness\non his homely but honest face; but by his more than ordinarily keen\nglance it was possible to recognize him as a man who infallibly knew\nhis business. It is easy to say _the same as always_; but how different\nwere the traits brought out in others! one tried to seem calmer,\nanother rougher, a third gayer, than usual; but by the captain\'s face\nit was manifest that he did not even understand _how to seem._\n\nThe Frenchman who at Waterloo said, _La garde meurt, mais ne se rend\npas,_ and other heroes, especially among the French, who have uttered\nnotable sayings, were brave, and really uttered notable sayings;\nbut between their bravery, and the bravery of the captain, is this\ndifference, that if a great saying in regard to any subject came into\nmy hero\'s mind, I believe that he would not have uttered it; in the\nfirst place, because he would have feared that in saying something\ngreat he might spoil a great deed, and, secondly, because when a man is\nconscious within himself of the power to do a great deed, there is no\nneed of saying any thing at all. This, in my opinion, is the especial\nand lofty character of Russian bravery; and how, henceforth, can it\nfail to wound the Russian heart when among our young warriors one hears\nFrench platitudes which have their vogue because they were the stock\nphrases of the old French nobility?...\n\nSuddenly, from the direction in which the handsome ensign with his\ndivision was stationed, was heard a faint hurrah from the enemy.\nTurning round at this shouting I saw thirty soldiers who with\nmuskets in their hands and knapsacks on their shoulders were going at\ndouble-quick across the ploughed field. They stumbled, but still pushed\nahead and shouted. Leading them galloped the young ensign, waving his\nsabre.\n\nAll were lost to sight in the forest.\n\nAt the end of a few moments of shouting and clash of arms, a frightened\nhorse came dashing out of the woods, and just at the edge soldiers were\nseen bearing the killed and wounded. Among the latter was the young\nensign. Two soldiers carried him in their arms. He was pale as a sheet,\nand his graceful head, where could be now detected only the shadow of\nthat martial enthusiasm which inspired him but a moment before, was\nstrangely drawn down between his shoulders and rested on his breast. On\nhis white shirt under his coat, which was torn open, could be seen a\nsmall blood-stain.\n\n"Akh! what a pity!" I said in spite of myself, as I turned away from\nthis heart-rending spectacle.\n\n"Indeed it\'s too bad," said an old soldier who with gloomy face stood\nbeside me leaning on his musket. "He wasn\'t afraid of any thing! How is\nthis possible?" he added, looking steadily at the wounded lad. "Always\nfoolish! and now he has to pay for it!"\n\n"And aren\'t you afraid?" I asked.\n\n"No, indeed!"\n\n\n[Footnote 30: _On--_he--the collective expression by which the soldiers\nin the Caucasus indicate the enemy.--AUTHOR\'S NOTE.]\n\n[Footnote 31: 2,100 feet.]\n\n[Footnote 32: _bros\xc3\xadtsa na ur\xc3\xa1--_ to rush with a hurrah!]\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nFour soldiers bore the ensign on a litter; behind them followed a\nsoldier from the suburb, leading a lean, foundered horse laden with\ntwo green chests in which were the surgeon\'s implements. They were\nexpecting the doctor. The officers hurried up to the litter, and tried\nto encourage and comfort the wounded lad.\n\n"Well, brother Al\xc3\xa1nin, it\'ll be some time before you dance and make\nmerry again," said Lieutenant Rosenkranz coming up with a smile.\n\nHe probably intended these words to sustain the handsome ensign\'s\ncourage; but as could be easily seen from the coldly mournful\nexpression in the eyes of the latter, these words did not produce the\nwished-for effect.\n\nThe captain also came up. He gazed earnestly at the wounded young\nfellow, and his always cold, calm face expressed heartfelt pity.\n\n"How is it, my dear Anatoli Iv\xc3\xa1nuitch?" said he in a tone which rang\nwith a deeper sympathy than I had expected from him: "we see it\'s as\nGod wills."\n\nThe wounded lad looked up; his pale face was lighted with a mournful\nsmile.\n\n"Yes, I disobeyed you."\n\n"Say rather, it was God\'s will," replied the captain.\n\nThe doctor, who had now arrived, took from his chest, bandages, probes,\nand other instruments, and, rolling up his sleeves with a re-assuring\nsmile, approached the sufferer.\n\n"So it seems they have been making a little hole through you," he said\nin a tone of jesting unconcern. "Let us have a look at the place."\n\nThe ensign listened, but in the gaze which he fixed on the jolly doctor\nwere expressed surprise and reproachfulness which the latter did not\nexpect. He began to probe the wound and examine it from all sides; but\nat last the sufferer, losing his patience, pushed away his hand with a\nheavy groan.\n\n"Let me be," he said in an almost inaudible voice: "it makes no\ndifference; I am dying." With these words he fell on his back; and five\nminutes later when I joined the group gathered about him, and asked a\nsoldier, "How is the ensign?" I was told, "_He has gone._"\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nIt was late when the expedition, deploying in a broad column, entered\nthe fortress with songs. The sun had set behind the snow-covered\nmountain crest, and was throwing its last rosy rays on the long\ndelicate clouds which stretched across the bright pellucid western sky.\nThe snow-capped mountains began to clothe themselves in purple mist;\nonly their upper outlines were marked with extraordinary distinctness\nagainst the violet light of the sunset. The clear moon, which had long\nbeen up, began to shed its light through the dark blue sky. The green\nof the grass and of the trees changed to black, and grew wet with\ndew. The dark masses of the army, with gradually increasing tumult,\nadvanced across the field; from different sides were heard the sounds\nof cymbals, drums, and merry songs. The leader of the sixth company\nsang out with full strength, and full of feeling and power the clear\nchest-notes of the tenor were borne afar through the translucent\nevening air.\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOOD-CUTTING EXPEDITION.\n\n(_R\xc3\xbabka L\'\xc3\xbdesa._)\n\n_THE STORY OF A YUNKER\'S[1] ADVENTURE._\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nIn midwinter, in the year 185-, a division of our batteries was engaged\nin an expedition on the Great Chetchen River. On the evening of Feb.\n26, having been informed that the platoon which I commanded in the\nabsence of its regular officer was detailed for the following day to\nhelp cut down the forest, and having that evening obtained and given\nthe necessary directions, I betook myself to my tent earlier than\nusual; and as I had not got into the bad habit of warming it with\nburning coals, I threw myself, without undressing, down on my bed made\nof sticks, and, drawing my Circassian cap over my eyes, I rolled myself\nup in my _shuba,_ and fell into that peculiarly deep and heavy sleep\nwhich one obtains at the moment of tumult and disquietude on the eve of\na great peril. The anticipation of the morrow\'s action brought me to\nsuch a state.\n\nAt three o\'clock in the morning, while it was still perfectly dark, my\nwarm sheep-skin was pulled off from me, and the red light of a candle\nwas unpleasantly flashed upon my sleepy eyes.\n\n"It\'s time to get up," said some one\'s voice. I shut my eyes\ninvoluntarily, wrapped my sheep-skin around me again, and dropped off\ninto slumber.\n\n"It\'s time to get up," repeated Dmitri relentlessly, shaking me by the\nshoulder. "The infantry are starting." I suddenly came to a sense of\nthe reality of things, started up, and sprang to my feet.\n\nHastily swallowing a glass of tea, and taking a bath in ice-water,\nI crept out from my tent, and went to the park (where the guns were\nplaced). It was dark, misty, and cold. The night fires, lighted here\nand there throughout the camp, lighted up the forms of drowsy soldiers\nscattered around them, and seemed to make the darkness deeper by their\nruddy flickering flames. Near at hand one could hear monotonous,\ntranquil snoring; in the distance, movement, the babble of voices,\nand the jangle of arms, as the foot-soldiers got in readiness for the\nexpedition. There was an odor of smoke, manure, wicks, and fog. The\nmorning frost crept down my back, and my teeth chattered in spite of\nall my efforts to prevent it.\n\nOnly by the snorting and occasional stamping of horses could one make\nout in the impenetrable darkness where the harnessed limbers and\ncaissons were drawn up, and, by the flashing points of the lintstocks,\nwhere the cannon were. With the words _s B\xc3\xb3gom,--_ God speed it,--the\nfirst gun moved off with a clang, followed by the rumbling caisson, and\nthe platoon got under way.\n\nWe all took off our caps, and made the sign of the cross. Taking its\nplace in the interval between the infantry, our platoon halted, and\nwaited from four o\'clock until the muster of the whole force was made,\nand the commander came.\n\n"There\'s one of our men missing, Nikola\xc3\xaf Petr\xc3\xb3vitch," said a black\nform coming to me. I recognized him by his voice only as the\nplatoon-artillerist Maks\xc3\xadmof.\n\n"Who?"\n\n"Velench\xc3\xbak is missing. When we hitched up he was here, I saw him; but\nnow he\'s gone."\n\nAs it was entirely unlikely that the column would move immediately,\nwe resolved to send Corporal Ant\xc3\xb3nof to find Velench\xc3\xbak. Shortly after\nthis, the sound of several horses riding by us in the darkness was\nheard; this was the commander and his suite. In a few moments the head\nof the column started and turned,--finally we also moved,--but Ant\xc3\xb3nof\nand Velench\xc3\xbak had not appeared. However, we had not gone a hundred\npaces when the two soldiers overtook us.\n\n"Where was he?" I asked of Ant\xc3\xb3nof.\n\n"He was asleep in the park."\n\n"What! he was drunk, wasn\'t he?"\n\n"No, not at all."\n\n"What made him go to sleep, then?"\n\n"I don\'t know."\n\nDuring three hours of darkness we slowly defiled in monotonous silence\nacross uncultivated, snowless fields and low bushes which crackled\nunder the wheels of the ordnance.\n\nAt last, after we had crossed a shallow but phenomenally rapid\nbrook, a halt was called, and from the vanguard were heard desultory\nmusket-shots. These sounds, as always, created the most extraordinary\nexcitement in us all. The division had been almost asleep; now the\nranks became alive with conversation, repartees, and laughter. Some of\nthe soldiers wrestled with their mates; others played hop, skip and\njump; others chewed on their hard-tack, or, to pass away the time,\nengaged in drumming the different roll-calls. Meantime the fog slowly\nbegan to lift in the east, the dampness became more palpable, and the\nsurrounding objects gradually made themselves manifest emerging from\nthe darkness.\n\nI already began to make out the green caissons and gun-carriages, the\nbrass cannon wet with mist, the familiar forms of my soldiers whom I\nknew even to the least details, the sorrel horses, and the files of\ninfantry, with their bright bayonets, their knapsacks, ramrods, and\ncanteens on their backs.\n\nWe were quickly in motion again, and, after going a few hundred paces\nwhere there was no road, were shown the appointed place. On the right\nwere seen the steep banks of a winding river and the high posts of a\nTatar burying-ground. At the left and in front of us, through the fog,\nappeared the black belt. The platoon got under way with the limbers.\nThe eighth company, which was protecting us, stacked their arms, and a\nbattalion of soldiers with muskets and axes started for the forest.\n\nNot five minutes had elapsed when on all sides piles of wood began to\ncrackle and smoke; the soldiers swarmed about, fanning the fires with\ntheir hands and feet, lugging brush-wood and logs; and in the forest\nwere heard the incessant strokes of a hundred axes and the crash of\nfalling trees.\n\nThe artillery, with not a little spirit of rivalry with the infantry,\nheaped up their piles; and soon the fire was already so well under way\nthat it was impossible to get within a couple of paces of it. The\ndense black smoke arose through the icy branches, from which the water\ndropped hissing into the flames, as the soldiers heaped them upon the\nfire; and the glowing coals dropped down upon the dead white grass\nexposed by the heat. It was all mere boy\'s play to the soldiers; they\ndragged great logs, threw on the tall steppe grass, and fanned the fire\nmore and more.\n\nAs I came near a bonfire to light a cigarette, Velench\xc3\xbak, always\nofficious, but, now that he had been found napping, showing himself\nmore actively engaged about the fire than any one else, in an excess\nof zeal seized a coal with his naked hand from the very middle of\nthe fire, tossed it from one palm to the other, two or three times,\nand flung it on the ground. "Light a match and give it to him," said\nanother. "Bring a lintstock, fellows," said still a third.\n\nWhen I at last lighted my cigarette without the aid of Velench\xc3\xbak, who\ntried to bring another coal from the fire, he rubbed his burnt fingers\non the back of his sheepskin coat, and, doubtless for the sake of\nexercising himself, seized a great plane-tree stump, and with a mighty\nswing flung it on the fire. When at last it seemed to him that he might\nrest, he went close to the fire, spread out his cloak, which he wore\nlike a mantle fastened at the back by a single button, stretched his\nlegs, folded his great black hands in his lap, and opening his mouth a\nlittle, closed his eyes.\n\n"Alas![2] I forgot my pipe! What a shame, fellows!" he said after a\nshort silence, and not addressing anybody in particular.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Yunker (German _Junker_) is a non-commissioned officer\nbelonging to the nobility. Count Tolstoi himself began his military\nservice in the Caucasus as a Yunker.]\n\n[Footnote 2: _Ekh-ma._]\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nIn Russia there are three predominating types of soldiers, which\nembrace the soldiers of all arms,--those of the Caucasus, of the line,\nthe guards, the infantry, the cavalry, the artillery, and the others.\n\nThese three types, with many subdivisions and combinations, are as\nfollows:--\n\n(1) The obedient,\n\n(2) The domineering or dictatorial, and\n\n(3) The desperate.\n\nThe obedient are subdivided into the apathetic obedient and the\nenergetic obedient.\n\nThe domineering are subdivided into the gruffly domineering and the\ndiplomatically domineering.\n\nThe desperate are subdivided into the desperate jesters and the simply\ndesperate.\n\nThe type more frequently encountered than the rest--the type most\ngentle, most sympathetic, and for the most part endowed with the\nChristian virtues of meekness, devotion, patience, and submission to\nthe will of God--is that of the obedient.\n\nThe distinctive character of the apathetic obedient is a certain\ninvincible indifference and disdain of all the turns of fortune which\nmay overtake him.\n\nThe characteristic trait of the drunken obedient is a mild poetical\ntendency and sensitiveness.\n\nThe characteristic trait of the energetic obedient is his limitation in\nintellectual faculties, united with an endless assiduity and fervor.\n\nThe type of the domineering is to be found more especially in the\nhigher spheres of the army: corporals, non-commissioned officers,\nsergeants and others. In the first division of the gruffly domineering\nare the high-born, the energetic, and especially the martial type, not\nexcepting those who are stern in a lofty poetic way (to this category\nbelonged Corporal Ant\xc3\xb3nof, with whom I intend to make the reader\nacquainted).\n\nThe second division is composed of the diplomatically domineering,\nand this class has for some time been making rapid advances. The\ndiplomatically domineering is always eloquent, knows how to read, goes\nabout in a pink shirt, does not eat from the common kettle, often\nsmokes cheap Muscat tobacco, considers himself immeasurably higher than\nthe simple soldier, and is himself rarely as good a soldier as the\ngruffly domineering of the first class.\n\nThe type of the desperate is almost the same as that of the\ndomineering, that is, it is good in the first division,--the desperate\njesters, the characteristic features of whom are invariably jollity,\na huge unconcern in regard to every thing, a wealth of nature and\nboldness.\n\nThe second division is in the same way detestable: the criminally\ndesperate, who, however, it must be said for the honor of the Russian\nsoldier, are very rarely met with, and, if they are met with, then they\nare quickly drummed out of comradeship with the true soldier. Atheism,\nand a certain audacity in crime, are the chief traits of this character.\n\nVelench\xc3\xbak came under the head of the energetically obedient. He was a\nLittle Russian by birth, had been fifteen years in the service; and\nwhile he was not a fine-looking nor a very skilful soldier, still he\nwas simple-hearted, kind, and extraordinarily full of zeal, though\nfor the most part misdirected zeal, and he was extraordinarily honest.\nI say extraordinarily honest, because the year before there had been\nan occurrence in which he had given a remarkable exhibition of this\ncharacteristic. You must know that almost every soldier has his own\ntrade. The greater number are tailors and shoemakers. Velench\xc3\xbak\nhimself practised the trade of tailoring; and, judging from the fact\nthat Sergeant Mikh\xc3\xa1il Dorof\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch gave him his custom, it is safe to\nsay that he had reached a famous degree of accomplishment. The year\nbefore, it happened that while in camp, Velench\xc3\xbak took a fine cloak\nto make for Mikh\xc3\xa1il Dorof\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch. But that very night, after he had cut\nthe cloth, and stitched on the trimmings, and put it under his pillow\nin his tent, a misfortune befell him: the cloth, which was worth seven\nrubles, disappeared during the night. Velench\xc3\xbak with tears in his eyes,\nwith pale quivering lips and with stifled lamentations, confessed the\ncircumstance to the sergeant.\n\nMikh\xc3\xa1il Dorof\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch fell into a passion. In the first moment of his\nindignation he threatened the tailor; but afterwards, like a kindly\nman with plenty of means, he waved his hand, and did not exact from\nVelench\xc3\xbak the value of the cloak. In spite of the fussy tailor\'s\nendeavors, and the tears that he shed while telling about his\nmisfortune, the thief was not detected. Although strong suspicions\nwere attached to a corruptly desperate soldier named Chernof, who\nslept in the same tent with him, still there was no decisive proof.\nThe diplomatically dictatorial Mikh\xc3\xa1il Dorof\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch, as a man of means,\nhaving various arrangements with the inspector of arms and steward of\nthe mess, the aristocrats of the battery, quickly forgot all about\nthe loss of this particular cloak. Velench\xc3\xbak, on the contrary, did not\nforget his unhappiness. The soldiers declared that at this time they\nwere apprehensive about him, lest he should make way with himself, or\nflee to the mountains, so heavily did his misfortune weigh upon him. He\ndid not eat, he did not drink, was not able to work, and wept all the\ntime. At the end of three days he appeared before Mikh\xc3\xa1il Dorof\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch,\nand without any color in his face, and with a trembling hand, drew out\nof his sleeve a piece of gold, and gave it to him.\n\n"Faith,[3] and here\'s all that I have, Mikh\xc3\xa1il Dorof\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch; and this I\ngot from Zhd\xc3\xa1nof," he said, beginning to sob again. "I will give _you_\ntwo more rubles, truly I will, when I have earned them. He (who the\n_he_ was, Velench\xc3\xbak himself did not know) made me seem like a rascal in\nyour eyes. He, the beastly viper, stole from a brother soldier his hard\nearnings; and here I have been in the service fifteen years." ...\n\nTo the honor of Mikh\xc3\xa1il Dorof\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaftch, it must be said that he did not\nrequire of Velench\xc3\xbak the last two rubles, though Velench\xc3\xbak brought them\nto him at the end of two months.\n\n\n[Footnote 3: _y\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf Bogu._]\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nFive other soldiers of my platoon besides Velench\xc3\xbak were warming\nthemselves around the bonfire.\n\nIn the best place, away from the wind, on a cask, sat the platoon\nartillerist[4] Maks\xc3\xadmof, smoking his pipe. In the posture, the gaze,\nand all the motions of this man it could be seen that he was accustomed\nto command, and was conscious of his own worth, even if nothing were\nsaid about the cask whereon he sat, which during the halt seemed to\nbecome the emblem of power, or the nankeen short-coat which he wore.\n\nWhen I approached, he turned his head round toward me; but his eyes\nremained fixed upon the fire, and only after some time did they follow\nthe direction of his face, and rest upon me. Maks\xc3\xadmof came from a\nsemi-noble family.[5] He had property, and in the school brigade he\nobtained rank, and acquired some learning. According to the reports of\nthe soldiers, he was fearfully rich and fearfully learned.\n\nI remember how one time, when they were making practical experiments\nwith the quadrant, he explained, to the soldiers gathered around him,\nthat the motions of the spirit level arise from the same causes as\nthose of the atmospheric quicksilver. At bottom Maks\xc3\xadmof was far from\nstupid, and knew his business admirably; but he had the bad habit of\nspeaking, sometimes on purpose, in such a way that it was impossible\nto understand him, and I think he did not understand his own words.\nHe had an especial fondness for the words "arises" and "to proceed;"\nand whenever he said "it arises," or "now let us proceed," then I\nknew in advance that I should not understand what would follow. The\nsoldiers, on the contrary, as I had a chance to observe, enjoyed\nhearing his "arises," and suspected it of containing deep meaning,\nthough, like myself, they could not understand his words. But this\nincomprehensibility they ascribed to his depth, and they worshipped\nFe\xc3\xb3dor Maks\xc3\xadmuitch accordingly. In a word, Maks\xc3\xadmof was diplomatically\ndictatorial.\n\nThe second soldier near the fire, engaged in drawing on his sinewy\nred legs a fresh pair of stockings, was Ant\xc3\xb3nof, the same bombardier\nAnt\xc3\xb3nof who as early as 1837, together with two others stationed by one\ngun without shelter, was returning the shot of the enemy, and with two\nbullets in his thigh continued still to serve his gun and load it.\n\n"He would have been artillerist long before, had it not been for his\ncharacter," said the soldiers; and it was true that his character was\nodd. When he was sober, there was no man more calm, more peaceful, more\ncorrect in his deportment; when he was drunk he became an entirely\ndifferent man. Not recognizing authority, he became quarrelsome and\nturbulent, and was wholly valueless as a soldier. Not more than a\nweek before this time he got drunk at Shrovetide; and in spite of all\nthreats and exhortations, and his attachment to his cannon, he got\ntipsy and quarrelsome on the first Monday in Lent. Throughout the fast,\nnotwithstanding the order for all in the division to eat meat, he lived\non hard-tack alone, and in the first week he did not even take the\nprescribed allowance of vodka. However, it was necessary to see this\nshort figure, tough as iron, with his stumpy, crooked legs, his shiny\nface with its mustache, when he, for example, under the influence of\nliquor, took the _balal\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafka,_ or three-stringed guitar of the Ukra\xc3\xafna,\ninto his strong hands, and, carelessly glancing to this side and that,\nplayed some love-song, or with his cloak thrown over his shoulders, and\nthe orders dangling from it, and his hands thrust into the pockets of\nhis blue nankeen trousers, he rolled along the street; it was necessary\nto see his expression of martial pride, and his scorn for all that did\nnot pertain to the military,--to comprehend how absolutely impossible\nit was for him to compare himself at such moments with the rude or\nthe simply insinuating servant, the Cossack, the foot-soldier, or the\nvolunteer, especially those who did not belong to the artillery. He\nquarrelled and was turbulent, not so much for his own pleasure as for\nthe sake of upholding the spirit of all soldierhood, of which he felt\nhimself to be the protector.\n\nThe third soldier, with ear-rings in his ears, with bristling\nmustaches, goose-flesh, and a porcelain pipe in his lips, crouching\non his heels in front of the bonfire, was the artillery-rider Chikin.\nThe dear man Chikin, as the soldiers called him, was a jester. In\nbitter cold, up to his knees in the mud, going without food two days\nat a time, on the march, on parade, undergoing instruction, the dear\nman always and everywhere screwed his face into grimaces, executed\nflourishes with his legs, and poured out such a flood of nonsense that\nthe whole platoon would go into fits of laughter. During a halt or in\ncamp Chikin had always around him a group of young soldiers, whom he\neither played cards with, or amused with tales about some sly soldier\nor English milord, or by imitating the Tatar and the German, or simply\nby making his jokes, at which everybody nearly died with laughter. It\nwas a fact, that his reputation as a joker was so widespread in the\nbattery, that he had only to open his mouth and wink, and he would be\nrewarded with a universal burst of guffaws; but he really had a great\ngift for the comic and unexpected. In every thing he had the wit to see\nsomething remarkable, such as never came into anybody else\'s head; and,\nwhat is more important, this talent for seeing something ridiculous\nnever failed under any trial.\n\nThe fourth soldier was an awkward young fellow, a recruit of the last\nyear\'s draft, and he was now serving in an expedition for the first\ntime. He was standing in the very smoke, and so close to the fire that\nit seemed as if his well-worn short-coat[6] would catch on fire; but,\nnotwithstanding this, by the way in which he had flung open his coat,\nby his calm, self-satisfied pose, with his calves arched out, it was\nevident that he was enjoying perfect happiness.\n\nAnd finally, the fifth soldier, sitting some little distance from the\nfire, and whittling a stick, was Uncle Zhd\xc3\xa1nof. Zhd\xc3\xa1nof had been in\nservice the longest of all the soldiers in the battery,--knew all the\nrecruits; and everybody, from force of habit, called him _dy\'\xc3\xa1-denka,_\nor little uncle. It was said that he never drank, never smoked, never\nplayed cards (not even the soldier\'s pet game of _noski_), and never\nindulged in bad talk. All the time when military duties did not engross\nhim he worked at his trade of shoemaking; on holidays he went to\nchurch wherever it was possible, or placed a farthing candle before\nthe image, and read the psalter, the only book in which he cared to\nread. He had little to do with the other soldiers,--with those higher\nin rank,--though to the younger officers he was coldly respectful. With\nhis equals, since he did not drink, he had little reason for social\nintercourse; but he was extremely fond of recruits and young soldiers:\nhe always protected them, read them their lessons, and often helped\nthem. All in the battery considered him a capitalist, because he had\ntwenty-five rubles, which he willingly loaned to any soldier who really\nneeded it. That same Maks\xc3\xadmof who was now artillerist used to tell me\nthat when, ten years before, he had come as a recruit, and the old\ndrunken soldiers helped him to drink up the money that he had, Zhd\xc3\xa1nof,\npitying his unhappy situation, took him home with him, severely\nupbraided him for his behavior, even administered a castigation, read\nhim the lesson about the duties of a soldier\'s life, and sent him away\nafter presenting him with a shirt (for Maks\xc3\xadmof hadn\'t one to his back)\nand a half-ruble piece.\n\n"He made a man of me," Maks\xc3\xadmof used to say, always with respect and\ngratitude in his tone. He had also taken Velench\xc3\xbak\'s part always,\never since he came as a recruit, and had helped him at the time of\nhis misfortune about the lost cloak, and had helped many, many others\nduring the course of his twenty-five years\' service.\n\nIn the service it was impossible to find a soldier who knew his\nbusiness better, who was braver or more obedient; but he was too meek\nand homely to be chosen as an artillerist,[7] though he had been\nbombardier fifteen years. Zhd\xc3\xa1nof\'s one pleasure, and even passion, was\nmusic. He was exceedingly fond of some songs, and he always gathered\nround him a circle of singers from among the young soldiers; and though\nhe himself could not sing, he stood with them, and putting his hands\ninto the pockets of his short-coat,[8] and shutting his eyes, expressed\nhis contentment by the motions of his head and cheeks. I know not why\nit was, that in that regular motion of the cheeks under the mustache,\na peculiarity which I never saw in any one else, I found unusual\nexpression. His head white as snow, his mustache dyed black, and his\nbrown, wrinkled face, gave him at first sight a stern and gloomy\nappearance; but as you looked more closely into his great round eyes,\nespecially when they smiled (he never smiled with his lips), something\nextraordinarily sweet and almost childlike suddenly struck you.\n\n\n[Footnote 4: _feierverker;_ German, _Feuerwerker._]\n\n[Footnote 5: _odnodvortsui,_ of one estate; freemen, who in the\nseventeenth century were settled in the Ukrafoa with special\nprivileges.]\n\n[Footnote 6: _polushubochek,_ little half _shuba._]\n\n[Footnote 7: _feierverker._]\n\n[Footnote 8: _polushubka._]\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n"Alas! I have forgotten my pipe; that\'s a misfortune, fellows,"\nrepeated Velench\xc3\xbak.\n\n"But you should smoke _cikarettes,_[9] dear man," urged Chikin,\nscrewing up his mouth, and winking. "I always smoke _cikarettes_ at\nhome: it\'s sweeter."\n\nOf course, all joined in the laugh.\n\n"So you forgot your pipe?" interrupted Maks\xc3\xadmof, proudly knocking out\nthe ashes from his pipe into the palm of his left hand, and not paying\nany attention to the universal laughter, in which even the officers\njoined. "You lost it somewhere here, didn\'t you, Velench\xc3\xbak?"\n\nVelench\xc3\xbak wheeled to right face at him, started to lift his hand to his\ncap, and then dropped it again.\n\n"You see, you haven\'t woke up from your last evening\'s spree, so that\nyou didn\'t get your sleep out. For such work you deserve a good raking."\n\n"May I drop dead on this very spot, Fe\xc3\xb3dor Maks\xc3\xadmovitch, if a single\ndrop passed my lips. I myself don\'t know what got into me," replied\nVelench\xc3\xbak. "How glad I should have been to get drunk!" he muttered to\nhimself.\n\n"All right. But one is responsible to the chief for his brother\'s\nconduct, and when you behave this way it\'s perfectly abominable," said\nthe eloquent Maks\xc3\xadmof savagely, but still in a more gentle tone.\n\n"Well, here is something strange, fellows," continued Velench\xc3\xbak after a\nmoment\'s silence, scratching the back of his head, and not addressing\nany one in particular; "fact, it\'s strange, fellows. I have been\nsixteen years in the service, and have not had such a thing happen to\nme. As we were told to get ready for a march, I got up, as my duty\nbehooved. There was nothing at all, when suddenly in the park _it_\ncame over me--came over me more and more; laid me out--laid me out on\nthe ground--and everything.... And when I got asleep, I did not hear\na sound, fellows. It must have been that I fainted away," he said in\nconclusion.\n\n"At all events, it took all my strength to wake you up," said Ant\xc3\xb3nof,\nas he pulled on his boot. "I pushed you, and pushed you. You slept like\na log."\n\n"See here," remarked Velench\xc3\xbak, "if I had been drunk" ...\n\n"Like a peasant-woman we had at home," interrupted Chikin. "For almost\ntwo years running she did not get down from the big oven. They tried\nto wake her up one time, for they thought she was asleep; but there\nshe was, lying just as though she was dead: the same kind of sleep you\nhad--isn\'t that so, clear man?"\n\n"Just tell us, Chikin, how you led the fashion the time when you had\nleave of absence," said Maks\xc3\xadmof, smiling, and winking at me as much as\nto say, "Don\'t you like to hear what the foolish fellow has to say?"\n\n"How led the fashion, Fe\xc3\xb3dor Maks\xc3\xadmuitch?" asked Chikin, casting a\nquick side glance at me. "Of course, I merely told what kind of people\nwe are here in the Kapkas."[10]\n\n"Well, then, that\'s so, that\'s so. You are not a fashion leader ... but\njust tell us how you made them think you were commander."\n\n"You know how I became commander for them. I was asked how we live,"\nbegan Chikin, speaking rapidly, like a man who has often told the\nsame story. "I said, \'We live well, dear man: we have plenty of\nvictuals. At morning and night, to our delight all we soldiers get\nour chocol_et_;[11] and then at dinner every sinner has his imperial\nsoup of barley groats, and instead of vodka, M_o_deira at each plate,\ngenuine old M_o_deira in the cask, forty-second degree!\'".\n\n"Fine M_o_deira!" replied Velench\xc3\xbak louder than the others, and with a\nburst of laughter. "Let\'s have some of it."\n\n"Well, then, what did you have to tell them about the _Esiatics?_"\nsaid Maks\xc3\xadmof, carrying his inquiries still further, as the general\nmerriment subsided.\n\nChikin bent down to the fire, picked up a coal with his stick, put it\non his pipe, and, as though not noticing the discreet curiosity aroused\nin his hearers, puffed for a long time in silence.\n\nWhen at last he had raised a sufficient cloud of smoke, he threw away\nthe coal, pushed his cap still farther on the back of his head, and\nmaking a grimace, and with an almost imperceptible smile, he continued:\n"They asked," said he, "\'What kind of a person is the little Cherk\xc3\xa9s\nyonder? or is it the Turk that you are fighting with in the Kapkas\ncountry?\' I tell \'em, \'The Cherk\xc3\xa9s here with us is not of one sort,\nbut of different sorts. Some are like the mountaineers who live on the\nrocky mountain-tops, and eat stones instead of bread. The biggest of\nthem,\' I say, \'are exactly like big logs, with one eye in the middle\nof the forehead, and they wear red caps;\' they glow like fire, just as\nyou do, my dear fellow," he added, addressing a young recruit, who, in\nfact, wore an odd little cap with a red crown.\n\nThe recruit, at this unexpected sally, suddenly sat down on the ground,\nslapped his knees, and burst out laughing and coughing so that he could\nhardly command his voice to say, "That\'s the kind of mountaineers we\nhave here."\n\n"\'And,\' says I, \'besides, there are the _mumri,_\'" continued Chikin,\njerking his head so that his hat fell forward on his forehead; "\'they\ngo out in pairs, like little twins,--these others. Every thing comes\ndouble with them,\' says I,\' and they cling hold of each other\'s hands,\nand run so _queek_ that I tell you you couldn\'t catch up with them on\nhorseback.\'--\'Well,\' says he, \'these _mumri_ who are so small as you\nsay, I suppose they are born hand in hand?\'" said Chikin, endeavoring\nto imitate the deep throaty voice of the peasant. "\'Yes,\' says I, \'my\ndear man, they are so by nature. You try to pull their hands apart,\nand it makes \'em bleed, just as with the Chinese: when you pull their\ncaps off, the blood comes.\'--\'But tell us,\' says he, \'how they kill any\none.\'--\'Well, this is the way,\' says I: \'they take you, and they rip\nyou all up, and they reel out your bowels in their hands. They reel \'em\nout, and you defy them and defy them--till your soul\'" ...\n\n"Well, now, did they believe any thing you said, Chikin?" asked\nMaks\xc3\xadmof with a slight smile, when those standing round had stopped\nlaughing.\n\n"And indeed it is a strange people, Fe\xc3\xb3dor Maks\xc3\xadmuitch: they believe\nevery one; before God, they do. But still, when I began to tell them\nabout Mount Kazbek, and how the snow does not melt all summer there,\nthey all burst out laughing at the absurdity of it. \'What a story!\'\nthey said. \'Could such a thing be possible,--a mountain so big that the\nsnow does not melt on it?\' And I say, \'With us, when the thaw comes,\nthere is such a heap; and even after it begins to melt, the snow lies\nin the hollows.\'--\'Go away,\'" said Chikin, with a concluding wink.\n\n\n[Footnote 9: _sikh\xc3\xa1rki._]\n\n[Footnote 10: _Kaphas_ for _Kavkas,_ Caucasus.]\n\n[Footnote 11: _shchikul\xc3\xa1ta id\'y\xc3\xb3t na sold\xc3\xa1t\xc3\xa1._]\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nThe bright disk of the sun, gleaming through the milk-white mist, had\nnow got well up; the purple-gray horizon gradually widened: but, though\nthe view became more extended, still it was sharply defined by the\ndelusive white wall of the fog.\n\nIn front of us, on the other side of the forest, could be seen a\ngood-sized field. Over the field there spread from all sides the smoke,\nhere black, here milk-white, here purple; and strange forms swept\nthrough the white folds of the mist. Far in the distance, from time to\ntime, groups of mounted Tatars showed themselves; and the occasional\nreports from our rifles, guns, and cannon were heard.\n\n"This isn\'t any thing at all of an action--mere boys\' play," said the\ngood Captain Khlopof.\n\nThe commander of the ninth company of cavalry,[12] who was with us as\nescort, rode up to our cannon, and pointing to three mounted Tatars who\nwere just then riding under cover of the forest, more than six hundred\n_sazhens_ from us, asked me to give them a shot or a shell. His request\nwas an illustration of the love universal among all infantry officers\nfor artillery practice.\n\n"You see," said he, with a kindly and convincing smile, laying his hand\non my shoulder, "where those two big trees are, right in front of us:\none is on a white horse, and dressed in a black Circassian coat; and\ndirectly behind him are two more. Do you see? If you please, we must"\n...\n\n"And there are three others riding along under the lee of the forest,"\ninterrupted Ant\xc3\xb3nof, who was distinguished for his sharp eyes, and had\nnow joined us with the pipe that he had been smoking concealed behind\nhis back. "The front one has just taken his carbine from its case. It\'s\neasy to see, your Excellency."\n\n"Ha! he fired then, fellows. See the white puff of smoke," said\nVelench\xc3\xbak to a group of soldiers a little back of us.\n\n"He must be aiming at us, the blackguard!" replied some one else.\n\n"See, those fellows only come out a little way from the forest. We see\nthe place: we want to aim a cannon at it," suggested a third. "If we\ncould only _blant_ a _krenade_ into the midst of \'em, it would scatter\n\'em." ...\n\n"And what makes you think you could shoot to such a _tistance,_ dear\nman?" asked Chikin.\n\n"Only five hundred or five hundred and twenty _sazhens--_--it can\'t\nbe less than that," said Maks\xc3\xadmof coolly, as though he were speaking\nto himself; but it was evident that he, like the others, was terribly\nanxious to bring the guns into play. "If the howitzer is aimed up at\nan angle of forty-five degrees, then it will be possible to reach that\nspot; that is perfectly possible."\n\n"You know, now, that if you aim at that group, it would infallibly hit\nsome one. There, there! as they are riding along now, please hurry\nup and order the gun to be fired," continued the cavalry commander,\nbeseeching me.\n\n"Will you give the order to limber the gun?" asked Ant\xc3\xb3nof suddenly, in\na jerky base voice, with a slight touch of surliness in his manner.\n\nI confess that I myself felt a strong desire for this, and I commanded\nthe second cannon to be unlimbered.\n\nThe words had hardly left _my_ mouth ere the bomb was powdered and\nrammed home; and Ant\xc3\xb3nof, clinging to the gun-cheek, and leaning his\ntwo fat fingers on the carriage, was already getting the gun into\nposition.\n\n"Little ... little more to the left--now a little to the right--now,\nnow the least bit more--there, that\'s right," said he with a proud\nface, turning from the gun.\n\nThe infantry officer, myself, and Maks\xc3\xadmof, in turn sighted along the\ngun, and all gave expression to various opinions.\n\n"By God! it will miss," said Velench\xc3\xbak, clicking with his tongue,\nalthough he could only see over Ant\xc3\xb3nof\'s shoulder, and therefore had\nno basis for such a surmise.\n\n"By-y-y God! it will miss: it will hit that tree right in front,\nfellows."\n\n"Two!" I commanded.\n\nThe men about the gun scattered. Ant\xc3\xb3nof ran to one side, so as to\nfollow the flight of the ball. There was a flash and a ring of brass.\nAt the same instant we were enveloped in gunpowder smoke; and after\nthe startling report, was heard the metallic, whizzing sound of the\nball rushing off quicker than lightning, amid the universal silence and\ndying away in the distance.\n\nJust a little behind the group of horsemen a white puff of smoke\nappeared; the Tatars scattered in all directions, and then the sound of\na crash came to us.\n\n"Capitally done!" "Ah! they take to their heels;" "See! the devils\ndon\'t like it," were types of the exclamations and jests heard among\nthe ranks of the artillery and infantry.\n\n"If you had aimed a trifle lower, you\'d have hit right in the midst of\nhim," remarked Velench\xc3\xbak. "I said it would strike the tree: it did; it\ntook the one at the right."\n\n\n[Footnote 12: _j\xc3\xa4gers._]\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nLeaving the soldiers to argue about the Tatars taking to flight when\nthey saw the shell, and why it was that they came there, and whether\nthere were many in the forest, I went with the cavalry commander a few\nsteps aside, and sat down under a tree, expecting to have some warmed\nchops which he had offered me. The cavalry commander, Bolkhof, was\none of the officers who are called in the regiment _bonjour-oli._ He\nhad property, had served before in the guards, and spoke French. But,\nin spite of this, his comrades liked him. He was rather intellectual,\nhad tact enough to wear his Petersburg overcoat, to eat a good dinner,\nand to speak French without too much offending the sensibilities of\nhis brother officers. As we talked about the weather, about the events\nof the war, about the officers known to us both, and as we became\nconvinced, by our questions and answers, by our views of things in\ngeneral, that we were mutually sympathetic, we involuntarily fell\ninto more intimate conversation. Moreover, in the Caucasus, among men\nwho meet in one circle, the question invariably arises, though it is\nnot always expressed, "Why are you here?" and it seemed to me that my\ncompanion was desirous of satisfying this inarticulate question.\n\n"When will this expedition end?" he asked lazily: "it\'s tiresome."\n\n"It isn\'t to me," I said: "it\'s much more so serving on the staff."\n\n"Oh, on the staff it\'s ten thousand times worse!" said he fiercely.\n"No, I mean when will this sort of thing end altogether?"\n\n"What! do you wish that it would end?" I asked.\n\n"Yes, all of it, altogether!... Well, are the chops ready, Nikol\xc3\xa1ief?"\nhe inquired of his servant.\n\n"Why do you serve in the Caucasus, then," I asked, "if the Caucasus\ndoes not please you?"\n\n"You know wiry," he replied with an outburst of frankness: "on account\nof tradition. In Russia, you see, there exists a strange tradition\nabout the Caucasus, as though it were the promised land for all sorts\nof unhappy people."\n\n"Well," said I, "it\'s almost true: the majority of us here "...\n\n"But what is better than all," said he, interrupting me, "is,\nthat all of us who come to the Kavkas are fearfully deceived in\nour calculations; and really, I don\'t see why, in consequence of\ndisappointment in love or disorder in one\'s affairs, one should come\nto serve in the Caucasus rather than in Kazan or Kaluga. You see, in\nRussia they imagine the Kavkas as something immense,--everlasting\nvirgin ice-fields, with impetuous streams, with daggers, cloaks,\nCircassian girls,--all that is strange and wonderful; but in reality\nthere is nothing gay in it at all. If they only knew, for example, that\nwe have never been on the virgin ice-fields, and that there was nothing\ngay in it at all, and that the Caucasus was divided into the districts\nof Stavropol, Tiflis, and so forth" ...\n\n"Yes," said I, laughing, "when we are in Russia we look upon the\nCaucasus in an absolutely different way from what we do here. Haven\'t\nyou ever noticed it: when you read poetry in a language that you don\'t\nknow very well, you imagine it much better than it really is, don\'t\nyou?"\n\n"I don\'t know how that is, but this Caucasus doesn\'t please me," he\nsaid, interrupting me.\n\n"It isn\'t so with me," I said: "the Caucasus is delightful to me now,\nbut only" ...\n\n"Maybe it is delightful," he continued with a touch of asperity, "but I\nknow that it is not delightful to me."\n\n"Why not?" I asked, with a view of saying something.\n\n"In the first place, it has deceived me--all that which I expected,\nfrom tradition, to be delivered of in the Caucasus, I find in me just\nthe same here, only with this distinction, that before, it was all on\na larger scale, but now on a small and nasty scale, at each round of\nwhich I find a million petty annoyances, worriments, and miseries; in\nthe second place, because I find that each day I am falling morally\nlower and lower; and principally because I feel myself incapable of\nservice here--I cannot endure to face the danger ... simply, I am a\ncoward." ...\n\nHe got up and looked at me earnestly.\n\nThough this unbecoming confession completely took, me by surprise, I\ndid not contradict him, as my messmate evidently expected me to do; but\nI awaited from the man himself the refutation of his words, which is\nalways ready in such circumstances.\n\n"You know to-day\'s expedition is the first time that I have taken part\nin action," he continued, "and you can imagine what my evening was.\nWhen the sergeant brought the order for my company to join the column,\nI became as pale as a sheet, and could not utter a word from emotion;\nand if you knew how I spent the night! If it is true that people turn\ngray from fright, then I ought to be perfectly white-headed to-day,\nbecause no man condemned to death ever suffered so much from terror\nin a single night as I did: even now, though I feel a little more at\nmy ease than I did last night, still it goes here in me," he added,\npressing his hand to his heart. "And what is absurd," he went on to\nsay, "while this fearful drama is playing here, I myself am eating\nchops and onions, and trying to persuade myself that I am very gay....\nIs there any wine, Nikol\xc3\xa1ief?" he added with a yawn.\n\n"There _he_ is, fellows!" shouted one of the soldiers at this moment in\na tone of alarm, and all eyes were fixed upon the edge of the far-off\nforest.\n\nIn the distance a puff of bluish smoke took shape, and, rising up,\ndrifted away on the wind. When I realized that the enemy were firing\nat us, every thing that was in the range of my eyes at that moment,\nevery thing suddenly assumed a new and majestic character. The stacked\nmuskets, and the smoke of the bonfires, and the blue sky, and the green\ngun-carriages, and Nikol\xc3\xa1ief\'s sunburned, mustachioed face,--all this\nseemed to tell me that the shot which at that instant emerged from the\nsmoke, and was flying through space, might be directed straight at my\nbreast.\n\n"Where did you get the wine?" I meanwhile asked Bolkhof carelessly,\nwhile in the depths of my soul two voices were speaking with equal\ndistinctness; one said, "Lord, take my soul in peace;" the other, "I\nhope I shall not duck my head, but smile while the ball is coming." And\nat that instant something horribly unpleasant whistled above our heads,\nand the shot came crashing to the ground not two paces away from us.\n\n"Now, if I were Napoleon or Frederick the Great," said Bolkhof at this\ntime, with perfect composure, turning to me, "I should certainly have\nsaid something graceful."\n\n"But that you have just done," I replied, hiding with some difficulty\nthe panic which I felt at being exposed to such a danger.\n\n"Why, what did I say? No one will put it on record."\n\n"I\'ll put it on record."\n\n"Yes: if you put it on record, it will be in the way of criticism, as\nMishchenkof says," he replied with a smile.\n\n"_Tfu!_ you devils!" exclaimed Ant\xc3\xb3nof in vexation just behind us, and\nspitting to one side; "it just missed my leg."\n\nAll my solicitude to appear cool, and all our refined phrases, suddenly\nseemed to me unendurably stupid after this artless exclamation.\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nThe enemy, in fact, had posted two cannon on the spot where the Tatars\nhad been scattered, and every twenty or thirty minutes sent a shot at\nour wood-choppers. My division was sent out into the field, and ordered\nto reply to him. At the skirt of the forest a puff of smoke would show\nitself, the report would be heard, then the whiz of the ball, and the\nshot would bury itself behind us or in front of us. The enemy\'s shots\nwere placed fortunately for us, and no loss was sustained.\n\nThe artillerists, as always, behaved admirably, loaded rapidly, aimed\ncarefully wherever the smoke appeared, and jested unconcernedly with\neach other. The infantry escort, in silent inactivity, were lying\naround us, awaiting their turn. The wood-cutters were busy at their\nwork; their axes resounded through the forest more and more rapidly,\nmore and more eagerly, save when the _svist_ of a cannon-shot was\nheard, then suddenly the sounds ceased, and amid the deathlike\nstillness a voice, not altogether calm, would exclaim, "Stand aside,\nboys!" and all eyes would be fastened upon the shot ricocheting upon\nthe wood-piles and the brush.\n\nThe fog was now completely lifted, and, taking the form of clouds, was\ndisappearing slowly in the dark-blue vault of heaven. The unclouded orb\nof the sun shone bright, and threw its cheerful rays on the steel of\nthe bayonets, the brass of the cannon, on the thawing ground, and the\nglittering points of the icicles. The atmosphere was brisk with the\nmorning frost and the warmth of the spring sun. Thousands of different\nshades and tints mingled in the dry leaves of the forest; and on the\nhard, shining level of the road could be seen the regular tracks of\nwheel-tires and horse-shoes.\n\nThe action between the armies grew more and more violent and more\nstriking. In all directions the bluish puffs of smoke from the firing\nbecame more and more frequent. The dragoons, with bannerets waving from\ntheir lances, kept riding to the front. In the infantry companies songs\nresounded, and the train loaded with wood began to form itself as the\nrearguard. The general rode up to our division, and ordered us to be\nready for the return. The enemy got into the bushes over against our\nleft flank, and began to pour a heavy musketry-fire into us. From the\nleft-hand side a ball came whizzing from the forest, and buried itself\nin a gun-carriage; then--a second, a third.... The infantry guard,\nscattered around us, jumped up with a shout, seized their muskets, and\ntook aim. The cracking of the musketry was redoubled, and the bullets\nbegan to fly thicker and faster. The retreat had begun, and the present\nattack was the result, as is always the case in the Caucasus.\n\nIt became perfectly manifest that the artillerists did not like the\nbullets as well as the infantry had liked the solid shot. Ant\xc3\xb3nof put\non a deep frown. Chikin imitated the sound of the bullets, and fired\nhis jokes at them; but it was evident that he did not like them. In\nregard to one he said, "What a hurry it\'s in!" another he called a\n"honey-bee;" a third, which flew over us with a sort of slow and\nlugubrious drone, he called an "orphan,"--a term which raised general\namusement.\n\nThe recruit, who had the habit of bending his head to one side, and\nstretching out his neck, every time he heard a bullet, was also a\nsource of amusement to the soldiers, who said, "Who is it? some\nacquaintance that you are bowing to?" And Velench\xc3\xbak, who always showed\nperfect equanimity in time of danger, was now in an alarming state of\nmind; he was manifestly vexed because we did not send some canister in\nthe direction from which the bullets came. He more than once exclaimed\nin a discontented tone, "What is _he_ allowed to shoot at us with\nimpunity for? If we could only answer with some grape, that would\nsilence him, take my word for it."\n\nIn fact, it was time to do this. I ordered the last shell to be fired,\nand to load with grape.\n\n"Grape!" shouted Ant\xc3\xb3nof bravely in the midst of the smoke, coming up\nto the gun with his sponge as soon as the discharge was made.\n\nAt this moment, not far-behind us, I heard the quick whiz of a bullet\nsuddenly striking something with a dry thud. My heart sank within me.\n"Some one of our men must have been struck," I said to myself; but at\nthe same time I did not dare to turn round, under the influence of this\npowerful presentiment. True enough, immediately after this sound the\nheavy fall of a body was heard, and the "o-o-o-o\xc3\xaf,"--the heart-rending\ngroan of the wounded man. "I\'m hit, fellows," remarked a voice which I\nknew. It was Velench\xc3\xbak. He was lying on his back between the limbers\nand the gun. The cartridge-box which he carried was flung to one side.\nHis forehead was all bloody, and over his right eye and his nose flowed\na thick red stream. The wound was in his body, but it bled very\nlittle; he had hit his forehead on something when he fell.\n\nAll this I perceived after some little time. At the first instant I saw\nonly a sort of obscure mass, and a terrible quantity of blood as it\nseemed to me.\n\nNone of the soldiers who were loading the gun said a word,--only the\nrecruit muttered between his teeth, "See, how bloody!" and Ant\xc3\xb3nof,\nfrowning still blacker, snorted angrily; but all the time it was\nevident that the thought of death presented itself to the mind of each.\nAll took hold of their work with great activity. The gun was discharged\nevery instant; and the gun-captain, in getting the canister, went\ntwo steps around the place where lay the wounded man, now groaning\nconstantly.\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nEvert one who has been in action has doubtless experienced the strange\nalthough illogical but still powerful feeling of repulsion for the\nplace in which any one has been killed or wounded. My soldiers were\nnoticeably affected by this feeling at the first moment when it became\nnecessary to lift Velench\xc3\xbak and carry him to the wagon which had driven\nup. Zhd\xc3\xa1nof angrily went to the sufferer, and, notwithstanding his\ncry of anguish, took him under his arms and lifted him. "What are you\nstanding there for? Help lug him!" he shouted; and instantly the men\nsprang to his assistance, some of whom could not do any good at all.\nBut they had scarcely started to move him from the place when Velench\xc3\xbak\nbegan to scream fearfully and to struggle.\n\n"What are you screeching for, like a rabbit?" said Ant\xc3\xb3nof, holding him\nroughly by the leg. "If you don\'t stop we\'ll drop you."\n\nAnd the sufferer really calmed down, and only occasionally cried out,\n"_Okh!_ I\'m dead! _o-okh,_ fellows![13] I\'m dead!"\n\nAs soon as they laid him in the wagon, he ceased to groan, and I\nheard that he said something to his comrades--it must have been a\nfarewell--in a weak but audible voice.\n\nIndeed, no one likes to look at a wounded man; and I, instinctively\nhastening to get away from this spectacle, ordered the men to take him\nas soon as possible to a suitable place, and then return to the guns.\nBut in a few minutes I was told that Velench\xc3\xbak was asking for me, and I\nreturned to the ambulance.\n\nThe wounded man lay on the wagon bottom, holding the sides with both\nhands. His healthy, broad face had in a few seconds entirely changed;\nhe had, as it were, grown gaunt, and older by several years. His lips\nwere pinched and white, and tightly compressed, with evident effort\nat self-control; his glance had a quick and feeble expression; but\nin his eyes was a peculiarly clear and tranquil gleam, and on his\nblood-stained forehead and nose already lay the seal of death.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the least motion caused him unendurable\nanguish, he was trying to take from his left leg his purse,[14] which\ncontained money.\n\nA fearfully burdensome thought came into my mind when I saw his bare,\nwhite, and healthy-looking leg as he was taking off his boot and\nuntying his purse.\n\n"There are three silver rubles and a fifty_-kopek_ piece," he said when\nI took the girdle-purse. "You keep them."\n\nThe ambulance had started to move, but he stopped it.\n\n"I was working on a cloak for Lieutenant Sulimovsky. He had paid me\ntwo-o-o silver rubles. I spent one and a half on buttons, but half a\nruble lies with the buttons in my bag. Give them to him."\n\n"Very good, I will," said I. "Keep up good hopes, brother."\n\nHe did not answer me; the wagon moved away, and he began once more\nto groan, and to exclaim "_Okh!"_ in the same terribly heart-rending\ntone. As though he had done with earthly things, he felt that he had\nno longer any pretext for self-restraint, and he now considered this\nalleviation permissible.\n\n\n[Footnote 13: _bratsu\xc3\xad mo\xc3\xaf._]\n\n[Footnote 14: _ch\xc3\xa9res;_ diminutive, _ch\xc3\xa9resok,--_a leather purse in the\nform of a girdle, which soldiers wear usually under the knee.--AUTHOR\'S\nNOTE.]\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\n"Where are you off to? Come back! Where are you going?" I shouted to\nthe recruit, who, carrying in his arms his reserve linstock, and a sort\nof cane in his hand, was calmly marching off toward the ambulance in\nwhich the wounded man was carried.\n\nBut the recruit lazily looked up at me, and kept on his way, and I was\nobliged to send a soldier to bring him back. He took off his red cap,\nand looked at me with a stupid smile.\n\n"Where were you going?" I asked.\n\n"To camp."\n\n"Why?"\n\n"Because--they have wounded Velench\xc3\xbak," he replied, still smiling.\n\n"What has that to do with you? It\'s your business to stay here."\n\nHe looked at me in amazement, then coolly turned round, put on his cap,\nand went to his place.\n\nThe result of the action had been fortunate. The Cossacks, it was\nreported, had made a brilliant attack, and had captured three bodies\nof the Tatars; the infantry had laid in a store of firewood, and had\nsuffered in all a loss of six men wounded. In the artillery, from the\nwhole array only Velench\xc3\xbak and two horses were put _hors du combat._\nMoreover, they had cut the forest for three _versts,_ and cleared a\nplace, so that it was impossible to recognize it; now, instead of a\nseemingly impenetrable forest girdle, a great field was opened up,\ncovered with heaps of smoking bonfires, and lines of infantry and\ncavalry on their way to camp. Notwithstanding the fact that the enemy\nincessantly harassed us with cannonade and musketry, and followed us\ndown to the very river where the cemetery was, that we had crossed in\nthe morning, the retreat was successfully managed.\n\nI was already beginning to dream of the cabbage-soup and rib of mutton\nwith _kasha_ gruel that were awaiting me at the camp, when the word\ncame, that the general had commanded a redoubt to be thrown up on\nthe river-bank, and that the third battalion of regiment K, and a\ndivision of the fourth battery, should stay behind till the next day\nfor that purpose. The wagons with the firewood and the wounded, the\nCossacks, the artillery, the infantry with muskets and fagots on their\nshoulders,--all with noise and songs passed by us. On the faces of all\nshone enthusiasm and content, caused by the return from peril, and hope\nof rest; only we and the men of the third battalion were obliged to\npostpone these joyful feelings till the morrow.\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nWhile we of the artillery were busy about the guns, disposing the\nlimbers and caissons, and picketing the horses, the foot-soldiers had\nstacked their arms, piled up bonfires, made shelters of boughs and\ncornstalks, and were cooking their grits.\n\nIt began to grow dark. Across the sky swept bluish-white clouds. The\nmist, changing into fine drizzling fog, began to wet the ground and\nthe soldiers\' cloaks. The horizon became contracted, and all our\nsurroundings took on gloomy shadows. The dampness which I felt through\nmy boots and on my neck, the incessant motion and chatter in which I\ntook no part, the sticky mud with which my legs were covered, and my\nempty stomach, all combined to arouse in me a most uncomfortable and\ndisagreeable frame of mind after a day of physical and moral fatigue.\nVelench\xc3\xbak did not go out of my mind. The whole simple story of his\nsoldier\'s life kept repeating itself before my imagination.\n\nHis last moments were as unclouded and peaceful as all the rest of his\nlife. He had lived too honestly and simply for his artless faith in the\nheavenly life to come, to be shaken at the decisive moment.\n\n"Your health," said Nikol\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafef, coming to me. "The captain begs you to\nbe so kind as to come and drink tea with him."\n\nSomehow making my way between stacks of arms and the camp-fires,\nI followed Nikol\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafef to where Captain Bolkhof was, and felt a glow\nof satisfaction in dreaming about the glass of hot tea and the gay\nconverse which should drive away my gloomy thoughts.\n\n"Well, has he come?" said Bolkhof\'s voice from his cornstalk wigwam, in\nwhich the light was gleaming.\n\n"He is here, your honor,"[15] replied Nikol\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafef in his deep bass.\n\nIn the hut, on a dry _burka,_ or Cossack mantle, sat the captain in\n_n\xc3\xa9glig\xc3\xa9,_ and without his cap. Near him the samovar was singing, and a\ndrum was standing, loaded with lunch. A bayonet stuck into the ground\nheld a candle.\n\n"How is this?" he said with some pride, glancing around his comfortable\nhabitation. In fact, it was so pleasant in his wigwam, that, while we\nwere at tea I absolutely forgot about the dampness, the gloom, and\nVelench\xc3\xbak\'s wound. We talked about Moscow and subjects that had no\nrelation to the war or the Caucasus.\n\nAfter one of the moments of silence which sometimes interrupt the most\nlively conversations, Bolkhof looked at me with a smile.\n\n"Well, I suppose our talk this morning must have seemed very strange to\nyou?" said he.\n\n"No. Why should it? It only seemed to me that you were very frank; but\nthere are things which we all know, but which it is not necessary to\nspeak about."\n\n"Oh, you are mistaken! If there were only some possibility of\nexchanging this life for any sort of life, no matter how tame and mean,\nbut free from danger and service, I would not hesitate a minute."\n\n"Why, then, don\'t you go back to Russia?" I asked.\n\n"Why?" he repeated. "Oh, I have been thinking about that for a long\ntime. I can\'t return to Russia until I have won the Anna and Vlad\xc3\xadmir,\nwear the Anna ribbon around my neck, and am major, as I expected when I\ncame here."\n\n"Why not, pray, if you feel that you are so unfitted as you say for\nservice here?"\n\n"Simply because I feel still more unfitted to return to Russia the same\nas I came. That also is one of the traditions existing in Russia which\nwere handed down by Passek, Sleptsof, and others,--that you must go to\nthe Caucasus, so as to come home loaded with rewards. And all of us are\nexpecting and working for this; but I have been here two years, have\ntaken part in two expeditions, and haven\'t won any thing. But still,\nI have so much vanity that I shall not go away from here until I am,\nmajor, and have the Vlad\xc3\xadmir and Anna around my neck. I am already\naccustomed to having every thing avoid me, when even Gnilokishkin gets\npromoted, and I don\'t. And so how could I show myself in Russia before\nthe eyes of my elder, the merchant Kotelnikof, to whom I sell wheat, or\nto my aunty in Moscow, and all those people, if I had served two years\nin the Caucasus without getting promoted? It is true that I don\'t wish\nto know these people, and, of course, they don\'t care very much about\nme; but a man is so constituted, that though I don\'t wish to know them,\nyet on account of them I am wasting my best years, and destroying all\nthe happiness of my life, and all my future."\n\n\n[Footnote 15: _v\xc3\xa1shie blagor\xc3\xb3di\xc3\xa9._]\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nAt this moment the voice of the battalion commander was heard on the\noutside, saying, "Who is it with you, Nikol\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaf Fe\xc3\xb3dorovitch?" Bolkhof\nmentioned my name, and in a moment three officers came into the\nwigwam,--Major Kirs\xc3\xa1nof, the adjutant of his battalion, and company\ncommander Trosenko.\n\nKirs\xc3\xa1nof was a short, thick-set fellow, with black mustaches, ruddy\ncheeks, and little oily eyes. His little eyes were the most noticeable\nfeatures of his physiognomy. When he laughed, there remained of them\nonly two moist little stars; and these little stars, together with his\npursed-up lips and long neck, sometimes gave him a peculiar expression\nof insipidity. Kirs\xc3\xa1nof considered himself better than any one else in\nthe regiment. The under officers did not dispute this; and the chiefs\nesteemed him, although the general impression about him was, that he\nwas very dull-witted. He knew his duties, was accurate and zealous,\nkept a carriage and a cook, and, naturally enough, managed to pass\nhimself off as arrogant.\n\n"What are you gossiping about, captain?" he asked as he came in.\n\n"Oh, about the delights of the service here."\n\nBut at this instant Kirs\xc3\xa1nof caught sight of me, a mere yunker; and\nin order to make me gather a high impression of his knowledge, as\nthough he had not heard Bolkhof\'s answer, and glancing at the drum, he\nasked,--\n\n"What, were you tired, captain?"\n\n"No. You see, we" ... began Bolkhof.\n\nBut once more, and it must have been the battalion commander\'s dignity\nthat caused him to interrupt the answer, he put a new question:--\n\n"Well, we had a splendid action to-day, didn\'t we?"\n\nThe adjutant of the battalion was a young fellow who belonged to the\nfourteenth army-rank, and had only lately been promoted from the yunker\nservice. He was a modest and gentle young fellow, with a sensitive and\ngood-natured face. I had met him before at Bolkhof\'s. The young man\nwould come to see him often, make him a bow, sit down in a corner,\nand for hours at a time say nothing, and only make cigarettes and\nsmoke them; and then he would get up, make another bow, and go away.\nHe was the type of the poor son of the Russian noble family, who has\nchosen the profession of arms as the only one open to him in his\ncircumstances, and who values above every thing else in the world his\nofficial calling,--an ingenuous and lovable type, notwithstanding\nhis absurd, indefeasible peculiarities: his tobacco-pouch, his\ndressing-gown, his guitar, and his mustache brush, with which we used\nto picture him to ourselves. In the regiment they used to say of him\nthat he boasted of being just but stern with his servant, and quoted\nhim as saying, "I rarely punish; but when I am driven to it, then\nlet \'em beware:" and once, when his servant got drunk, and plundered\nhim, and began to rail at his master, they say he took him to the\nguard-house, and commanded them to have every thing ready for the\nchastisement; but when he saw the preparations, he was so confused,\nthat he could only stammer a few meaningless words: "Well, now you\nsee--I might," ... and, thoroughly upset, he set off home, and from\nthat time never dared to look into the eyes of his man. His comrades\ngave him no peace, but were always nagging him about this; and I often\nheard how the ingenuous lad tried to defend himself, and, blushing to\nthe roots of his hair, avowed that it was not true, but absolutely\nfalse.\n\nThe third character, Captain Trosenko, was an old Caucasian[16] in\nthe full acceptation of the word: that is, he was a man for whom the\ncompany under his command stood for his family; the fortress where the\nstaff was, his home; and the song-singers his only pleasure in life,--a\nman for whom every thing that was not Kavkas was worthy of scorn, yes,\nwas almost unworthy of belief; every thing that was Kavkas was divided\ninto two halves, ours and not ours. He loved the first, the second he\nhated with all the strength of his soul. And, above all, he was a man\nof iron nerve, of serene bravery, of rare goodness and devotion to\nhis comrades and subordinates, and of desperate frankness, and even\ninsolence in his bearing, toward those who did not please him; that is,\nadjutants and _bon jourists._ As he came into the wigwam, he almost\nbumped his head on the roof, then suddenly sank down and sat on the\nground.\n\n"Well, how is it?"[17] said he; and suddenly becoming cognizant of my\npresence, and recognizing me, he got up, turning upon me a troubled,\nserious gaze.\n\n"Well, why were you talking about that?" asked the major, taking out\nhis watch and consulting it, though I verily believe there was not the\nslightest necessity of his doing so.\n\n"Well,[18] he asked me why I served here."\n\n"Of course, Nikol\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaf Fe\xc3\xb3dorovitch wants to win distinction here, and\nthen go home."\n\n"Well, now, you tell us, Abram Ilyitch, why you serve in the Caucasus."\n\n"I? Because, as you know, in the first place we are all in duty bound\nto serve. What?" he added, though no one spoke. "Yesterday evening I\nreceived a letter from Russia, Nikol\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaf Fe\xc3\xb3dorovitch," he continued,\neager to change the conversation. "They write me that ... what strange\nquestions are asked!"\n\n"What sort of questions?" asked Bolkhof.\n\nHe blushed.\n\n"Really, now, strange questions ... they write me, asking, \'Can there\nbe jealousy without love?\' ... What?" he asked, looking at us all.\n\n"How so?" said Bolkhof, smiling.\n\n"Well, you know, in Russia it\'s a good thing," he continued, as\nthough his phrases followed each other in perfectly logical sequence.\n"When I was at Tambof in \'52 I was invited everywhere, as though I\nwere on the emperor\'s suite. Would you believe me, at a ball at the\ngovernor\'s, when I got there ... well, don\'t you know, I was received\nvery cordially. The governor\'s wife[19] herself, you know, talked with\nme, and asked me about the Caucasus; and so did all the rest ... why,\nI don\'t know ... they looked at my gold cap as though it were some\nsort of curiosity, and they asked me how I had won it, and how about\nthe Anna and the Vlad\xc3\xadmir; and I told them all about it.... What?\nThat\'s why the Caucasus is good, Nikol\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaf Fe\xc3\xb3dorovitch," he continued,\nnot waiting for a response. "There they look on us Caucasians very\nkindly. A young man, you know, a staff-officer with the Anna and\nVlad\xc3\xadmir,--that means a great deal in Russia. What?"\n\n"You boasted a little, I imagine, Abram Ilyitch," said Bolkhof.\n\n"He-he," came his silly little laugh in reply. "You know, you have to.\nYes, and didn\'t I feed royally those two months!"\n\n"So it is fine in Russia, is it?" asked Trosenko, asking about Russia\nas though it were China or Japan.\n\n"Yes, indeed![20] We drank so much champagne there in those two months,\nthat it was a terror!"\n\n"The idea! you?[21] You drank lemonade probably. I should have died to\nshow them how the _Kavk\xc3\xa1zets_ drinks. The glory has not been won for\nnothing. I would show them how we drink.... Hey, Bolkhof?" he added.\n\n"Yes, you see, you have been already ten years in the Caucasus, uncle,"\nsaid Bolkhof, "and you remember what Yermolof said; but Abram Ilyitch\nhas been here only six." ...\n\n"Ten years, indeed! almost sixteen."\n\n"Let us have some _salvia,_ Bolkhof: it\'s raw, b-rr! What?" he added,\nsmiling, "shall we drink, major?"\n\nBut the major was out of sorts, on account of the old captain\'s\nbehavior to him at first; and now he evidently retired into himself,\nand took refuge in his own greatness. He began to hum some song, and\nagain looked at his watch.\n\n"Well, I shall never go there again," continued Trosenko, paying no\nheed to the peevish major. "I have got out of the habit of going about\nand speaking Russian. They\'d ask, \'What is this wonderful creature?\'\nand the answer\'d be, \'Asia.\' Isn\'t that so, Nikol\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaf Fe\xc3\xb3doruitch? And so\nwhat is there for me in Russia? It\'s all the same, you\'ll get shot here\nsooner or later. They ask, \'Where is Trosenko?\' And down you go! What\nwill you do then in the eighth company--heh?" he added, continuing to\naddress the major.\n\n"Send the officer of the day to the battalion," shouted Kirs\xc3\xa1nof, not\nanswering the captain, though I was again compelled to believe that\nthere was no necessity upon him of giving any orders.\n\n"But, young man, I think that you are glad now that you are having\ndouble pay?" said the major after a few moments\' silence, addressing\nthe adjutant of the battalion.\n\n"Why, yes, very."\n\n"I think that our salary is now very large, Nikol\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaf Fe\xc3\xb3doruitch," he\nwent on to say. "A young man can live very comfortably, and even allow\nhimself some little luxury."\n\n"No, truly, Abram Ilyitch," said the adjutant timidly: "even though we\nget double pay, it\'s only so much; and you see, one must keep a horse."\n...\n\n"What is that you say, young man? I myself have been an ensign, and\nI know. Believe me, with care, one can live very well. But you must\ncalculate," he added, tapping his left palm with his little finger.\n\n"We pledge all our salary before it\'s due: this is the way you\neconomize," said Trosenko, drinking down a glass of vodka.\n\n"Well, now, you see that\'s the very thing.... What?"\n\nAt this instant at the door of the wigwam appeared a white head with a\nflattened nose; and a sharp voice with a German accent said,--\n\n"You there, Abram Ilyitch? The officer of the day is hunting for you."\n\n"Come in, Kraft," said Bolkhof.\n\nA tall form in the coat of the general\'s staff entered the door, and\nwith remarkable zeal endeavored to shake hands with every one.\n\n"Ah, my dear captain, you here too?" said he, addressing Trosenko.\n\nThe new guest, notwithstanding the darkness, rushed up to the\ncaptain and kissed him on the lips, to his extreme astonishment, and\ndispleasure as it seemed to me.\n\n"This is a German who wishes to be a hail fellow well met," I said to\nmyself.\n\n\n[Footnote 16: _Kavk\xc3\xa1zets._]\n\n[Footnote 17: _nu chto?_]\n\n[Footnote 18: _da voi._]\n\n[Footnote 19: _gubern\xc3\xa1torsha._]\n\n[Footnote 20: _da s._]\n\n[Footnote 21: _da chto vui._]\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nMy presumption was immediately confirmed. Captain Kraft called for some\nvodka, which he called corn-brandy,[22] and threw back his head, and\nmade a terrible noise like a duck, in draining the glass.\n\n"Well, gentlemen, we rolled about well to-day on the plains of the\nChetchen," he began; but, catching sight of the officer of the day, he\nimmediately stopped, to allow the major to give his directions.\n\n"Well, you have made the tour of the lines?"\n\n"I have."\n\n"Are the pickets posted?"\n\n"They are."\n\n"Then you may order the captain of the guard to be as alert as\npossible."\n\n"I will."\n\nThe major blinked his eyes, and went into a brown study.\n\n"Well, tell the boys to get their supper."\n\n"That\'s what they\'re doing now."\n\n"Good! then you may go. Well,"[23] continued the major with a\nconciliating smile, and taking up the thread of the conversation that\nwe had dropped, "we were reckoning what an officer needed: let us\nfinish the calculation."\n\n"We need one uniform and trousers, don\'t we?"[24]\n\n"Yes. That, let us suppose would amount to fifty rubles every two\nyears; say, twenty-five rubles a year for dress. Then for eating we\nneed every day at least forty kopeks, don\'t we?[25]"\n\n"Yes, certainly as much as that."\n\n"Well, I\'ll call it so. Now, for a horse and saddle for remount,\nthirty rubles; that\'s all. Twenty-five and a hundred and twenty and\nthirty make a hundred and seventy-five rubles. All the rest stands for\nluxuries,--for tea and for sugar and for tobacco,--twenty rubles. Will\nyou look it over?... It\'s right, isn\'t it, Nikol\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaf Fe\xc3\xb3doruitch?"\n\n"Not quite. Excuse me, Abram Ilyitch," said the adjutant timidly,\n"nothing is left for tea and sugar. You reckon one suit for every two\nyears, but here in field-service you can\'t get along with one pair of\npantaloons and boots. Why, I wear out a new pair almost every month.\nAnd then linen, shirts, handkerchiefs, and leg-wrappers: all that sort\nof thing one has to buy. And when you have accounted for it, there\nisn\'t any thing left at all. That\'s true, by God![26] Abram Ilyitch."\n\n"Yes, it\'s splendid to wear leg-wrappers," said Kraft suddenly,\nafter a moment\'s silence, with a loving emphasis on the word\n"leg-wrappers;"[27] "you know it\'s simply Russian fashion."\n\n"I will tell you," remarked Trosenko, "it all amounts to this, that our\nbrother imagines that we have nothing to eat; but the fact is, that we\nall live, and have tea to drink, and tobacco to smoke, and our vodka\nto drink. If _you_ served with me," he added, turning to the ensign,\n"you would soon learn how to live. I suppose you gentlemen know how he\ntreated his _denshchik_."\n\nAnd Trosenko, dying with laughter, told us the whole story of the\nensign and his man, though we had all heard it a thousand times.\n\n"What makes you look so rosy, brother?" he continued, pointing to the\nensign, who turned red, broke into a perspiration, and smiled with such\nconstraint that it was painful to look at him.\n\n"It\'s all right, brother. I used to be just like you; but now, you\nsee, I have become hardened. Just let any young fellow come here from\nRussia,--we have seen \'em,--and here they would get all sorts of\nrheumatism and spasms; but look at me sitting here: it\'s my home, and\nbed, and all. You see" ... Here he drank still another glass of vodka.\n"Hah?" he continued, looking straight into Kraft\'s eyes.\n\n"That\'s what I like in you. He\'s a genuine old _Kavk\xc3\xa1zets._ Kive us\nyour hant."\n\nAnd Kraft pushed through our midst, rushed up to Trosenko, and,\ngrasping his hand, shook it with remarkable feeling.\n\n"Yes, we can say that we have had all sorts of experiences here," he\ncontinued. "In \'45 you must have been there, captain? Do you remember\nthe night of the 24th and 25th, when we camped in mud up to our knees,\nand the next day went against the intrenchments? I was then with the\ncommander-in-chief, and in one day we captured fifteen intrenchments.\nDo you remember, captain?"\n\nTrosenko nodded assent, and, pushing out his lower lip, closed his eyes.\n\n"You ought to have seen," Kraft began with extraordinary animation,\nmaking awkward gestures with his arms, and addressing the major.\n\nBut the major, who must have more than once heard this tale, suddenly\nthrew such an expression of muddy stupidity into his eyes, as he\nlooked at his comrade, that Kraft turned from him, and addressed\nBolkhof and me, alternately looking at each of us. But he did not once\nlook at Trosenko, from one end of his story to the other.\n\n"You ought to have seen how in the morning the commander-in-chief\ncame to me, and says, \'Kraft, take those intrenchments.\' You know\nour military duty,--no arguing, hand to visor. \'It shall be done,\nyour Excellency,\'[28] and I started. As soon as we came to the first\nintrenchment, I turn round, and shout to the soldiers, \'Poys, show your\nmettle! Pe on your guard. The one who stops I shall cut down with my\nown hand.\' With Russian soldiers you know you have to be plain-spoken.\nThen suddenly comes a shell--I look--one soldier, two soldiers, three\nsoldiers, then the bullets--vz-zhin! vz-zhin! vz-zhin! I shout,\n\'Forward, boys; follow me!\' As soon as we reach it, you know, I look\nand see--how it--you know: what do you call it?" and the narrator waved\nhis hands in his search for the word.\n\n"Rampart," suggested Bolkhof.\n\n"No.... _Ach!_ what is it? My God, now, what is it?... Yes, rampart,"\nsaid he quickly. "Then clubbing their guns!... hurrah! ta-ra-ta-ta-ta!\nThe enemy--not a soul was left. Do you know, they were amazed. All\nright. We rush on--the second intrenchment. This was quite a different\naffair. Our hearts poiled within us, you know. As soon as we got there,\nI look and I see the second intrenchment--impossible to mount it.\nThere--what was it--what was it we just called it? _Ach!_ what was it?"\n...\n\n"Rampart," again I suggested.\n\n"Not at all," said he with some heat. "Not rampart. Ah, now, what is\nit called?" and he made a sort of despairing gesture with his hand.\n"_Ach!_ my God! what is it?" ...\n\nHe was evidently so cut up, that one could not help offering\nsuggestions.\n\n"Moat, perhaps," said Bolkhof.\n\n"No; simply rampart. As soon as we reached it, if you will believe me,\nthere was a fire poured in upon us--it was hell." ...\n\nAt the crisis, some one behind the wigwam inquired for me. It was\nMaks\xc3\xadmof. As there still remained thirteen of the intrenchments to be\ntaken in the same monotonous detail, I was glad to have an excuse to go\nto my division. Trosenko went with me.\n\n"It\'s all a pack of lies," he said to me when we had gone a few steps\nfrom the wigwam. "He wasn\'t at the intrenchments at all;" and Trosenko\nlaughed so good-naturedly, that I could not help joining him.\n\n\n[Footnote 22: _gor\xc3\xadlka_ in the Malo-Russian dialect.]\n\n[Footnote 23: _nu-s._]\n\n[Footnote 24: _tak-s._]\n\n[Footnote 25: _tak-s._]\n\n[Footnote 26: _Y\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf Bogu._]\n\n[Footnote 27: _podviortki._]\n\n[Footnote 28: _slush\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafu, v\xc3\xa1she Siy\xc3\xa1telstvo._]\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nIt was already dark night, and the camp was lighted only by the\nflickering bonfires, when I rejoined my soldiers, after giving my\norders. A great smouldering log was lying on the coals. Around it\nwere sitting only three of the men,--Ant\xc3\xb3nof, who had set his kettle\non the fire to boil his _ry\xc3\xa1bko,_ or hard-tack and tallow; Zhd\xc3\xa1nof,\nthoughtfully poking the ashes with a stick; and Chikin, with his pipe,\nwhich was forever in his mouth. The rest had already turned in, some\nunder gun carriages, others in the hay, some around the fires. By the\nfaint light of the coals I recognized the backs, the legs, and the\nheads of those whom I knew. Among the latter was the recruit, who,\ncurling up close to the fire, was already fast asleep. Ant\xc3\xb3nof made\nroom for me. I sat down by him, and began to smoke a cigarette. The\nodor of the mist and of the smoke from the wet branches spreading\nthrough the air made one\'s eyes smart, and the same penetrating drizzle\nfell from the gloomy sky.\n\nBehind us could be heard regular snoring, the crackling of wood in\nthe fire, muffled conversation, and occasionally the clank of muskets\namong the infantry. Everywhere about us the watch-fires were glowing,\nthrowing their red reflections within narrow circles on the dark forms\nof the soldiers. Around the nearer fires I distinguished, in places\nwhere it was light, the figures of naked soldiers waving their shirts\nin the very flames. Many of the men had not yet gone to bed, but were\nwandering round, and talking over a space of fifteen square _sazhens;_\nbut the thick, gloomy night imparted a peculiarly mysterious tone to\nall this movement, as though each felt this gloomy silence, and feared\nto disturb its peaceful harmony. When I spoke, it seemed to me that my\nvoice sounded strange. On the faces of all the soldiers sitting by the\nfire I read the same mood. I thought, that, when I joined them, they\nwere talking about their wounded comrade; but it was nothing of the\nsort. Chikin was telling about the condition of things at Tiflis, and\nabout school-children there.\n\nAlways and everywhere, especially in the Caucasus, I have remarked\nin our soldiery at the time of danger peculiar tact in ignoring\nor avoiding those things that might have a depressing effect upon\ntheir comrades\' spirits. The spirit of the Russian soldier is not\nconstituted, like the courage of the Southern nations, for quickly\nkindled and quickly cooling enthusiasm; it is as hard to set him on\nfire as it is to cause him to lose courage. For him it is not necessary\nto have accessories, speeches, martial shouts, songs, and drums; on\nthe contrary, he wants calmness, order, and avoidance of every thing\nunnatural. In the Russian, the genuine Russian soldier, you never find\nbraggadocio, bravado, or the tendency to get demoralized or excited\nin time of danger; on the contrary, discretion, simplicity, and the\nfaculty of seeing in peril something quite distinct from the peril,\nconstitute the chief traits of his character. I have seen a soldier\nwounded in the leg, at the first moment mourning only over the hole in\nhis new jacket; a messenger thrown from his horse, which was killed\nunder him, unbuckling the girth so as to save the saddle. Who does\nnot recollect the incident at the siege of Hergebel when the fuse of a\nloaded bomb was on fire in the powder-room, and the artillerist ordered\ntwo soldiers to take the bomb and fling it over the wall, and how the\nsoldiers did not take it to the most convenient place, which was near\nthe colonel\'s tent on the rampart, but carried it farther, lest it\nshould wake the gentlemen who were asleep in the tent, and both of them\nwere blown to pieces?\n\nI remember, that, during this same expedition of 1852, one of the young\nsoldiers, during action, said to some one that it was not proper for\nthe division to go into danger, and how the whole division in scorn\nwent for him for saying such shameful words that they would not even\nrepeat them. And here now the thought of Velench\xc3\xbak must have been in\nthe mind of each; and when any second might bring upon us the broadside\nof the stealthy Tatars, all were listening to Chikin\'s lively story,\nand no one mentioned the events of the day, nor the present danger, nor\ntheir wounded friend, as though it had happened God knows how long ago,\nor had never been at all. But still, it seemed to me that their faces\nwere more serious than usual; they listened with too little attention\nto Chikin\'s tale, and even Chikin himself felt that they were not\nlistening to him, but let him talk to himself.\n\nMaks\xc3\xadmof came to the bonfire, and sat down by me. Chikin made room for\nhim, stopped talking, and again began to suck at his pipe.\n\n"The infantry have sent to camp for some vodka," said Maks\xc3\xadmof after a\nconsiderably long silence. "They\'ll be back with it very soon." He spat\ninto the fire. "A subaltern was saying that he had seen our comrade."\n\n"Was he still alive?" asked Ant\xc3\xb3nof, turning his kettle round.\n\n"No, he is dead."\n\nThe recruit suddenly raised above the fire his graceful head within his\nred cap, for an instant gazed intently at Maks\xc3\xadmof and me, then quickly\ndropped it, and rolled himself up in his cloak.\n\n"You see, it was death that was coming upon him this morning when I\nwoke him in the gun-park," said Ant\xc3\xb3nof.\n\n"Nonsense!" said Zhd\xc3\xa1nof, turning over the smouldering log; and all\nwere silent.\n\nAmid the general silence a shot was heard behind us in the camp. Our\ndrummers took it up immediately, and beat the tattoo. When the last\nroll had ceased, Zhd\xc3\xa1nof was already up, and the first to take off his\ncap. The rest of us followed his example.\n\nAmid the deep silence of the night a choir of harmonious male voices\nresounded:--\n\n"Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come;\nthy will be done, as on earth, so in heaven. Give us this day our daily\nbread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us\nnot into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one."\n\n"It was just so with us in \'45: one man was contused in this place,"\nsaid Ant\xc3\xb3nof when we had put on our hats and were sitting around the\nfire, "and so we carried him two days on the gun. Do you remember\nShevchenko, Zhd\xc3\xa1nof?... We left him there under a tree."\n\nAt this time a foot-soldier with tremendous whiskers and mustaches,\ncarrying a gun and a knapsack, came to our fire.\n\n"Please give a fellow-countryman a coal for his pipe," said he.\n\n"Of course,[29] smoke away; there is plenty of fire," remarked Chikin.\n\n"You were talking about Dargi, weren\'t you, friend?" asked the soldier,\naddressing Ant\xc3\xb3nof.\n\nThe soldier shook his head, frowned, and squatted down near us on his\nheels.\n\n"There were all sorts of things there," he remarked.\n\n"Why did you leave him?" I asked of Ant\xc3\xb3nof.\n\n"He had awful cramps in his belly. When we stood still, he did not feel\nit; but when we moved, he screeched and screeched. He besought us by\nall that was holy to leave him: it was pitiful. Well, and when _he_\nbegan to vex us solely, and had killed three of our men at the guns and\none officer, then our batteries opened on him, and did some execution\ntoo. We weren\'t able to drag out the guns, there was such mud."\n\n"It was muddier under the Indian mountains than anywhere else,"\nremarked the strange soldier.\n\n"Well, but indeed it kept growing worse and worse for him; and we\ndecided, An\xc3\xb3shenka--he was an old artillerist--and the rest of us,\nthat indeed there was no chance for him but to say a prayer, and so we\nleft him there. And so we decided. A tree grew there, welcome enough.\nWe left some hard-tack for him,--Zhd\xc3\xa1nof had some,--we put him against\nthe tree, put a clean shirt on him, said good-by to him, and so we left\nhim."\n\n"Was he a man of importance?"\n\n"Not at all: he was a soldier," remarked Zhd\xc3\xa1nof.\n\n"And what became of him, God knows," added Ant\xc3\xb3nof. "Many of our\nbrothers were left there."\n\n"At Dargi?" asked the infantry man, standing up and picking up his\npipe, and again frowning and shaking his head.... "There were all sorts\nof things there."\n\nAnd he left us.\n\n"Say, are there many of the soldiers in our battery who were at Dargi?"\nI asked.\n\n"Let us see;[30] here is Zhd\xc3\xa1nof, myself, Patsan,--who is now on\nfurlough,--and some six men more. There wouldn\'t be any others."\n\n"Why has our Patsan gone off on leave of absence?" asked Chikin,\nshaking out his legs, and laying his head on a log. "It\'s almost a year\nsince he went."\n\n"Well, are you going to take your furlough?" I asked of Zhd\xc3\xa1nof.\n\n"No, I\'m not," he replied reluctantly.\n\n"I tell you it\'s a good thing to go," said Ant\xc3\xb3nof, "when you come from\na rich home, or when you are able to work; and it\'s rather flattering\nto go and have the folks glad to see you."\n\n"But how about going when you have a brother,", asked Zhd\xc3\xa1nof, "and\nwould have to be supported by him? They have enough for themselves, but\nthere\'s nothing for a brother who\'s a soldier. Poor kind of help after\nserving twenty-five years. Besides, whether they are alive or no, who\nknows?"\n\n"But why haven\'t you written?" I asked.\n\n"Written? I did send two letters, but they don\'t reply. Either they are\ndead, or they don\'t reply because, of course, they are poor. It\'s so\neverywhere."\n\n"Have you written lately?"\n\n"When we left Dargi I wrote my last letter."\n\n"You had better sing that song about the birch," said Zhd\xc3\xa1nof to\nAnt\xc3\xb3nof, who at this moment was on his knees, and was purring some song.\n\nAnt\xc3\xb3nof sang his "Song of the White Birch."\n\n"That\'s Uncle Zhd\xc3\xa1nof\'s very most favorite song," said Chikin to me in\na whisper, as he helped me on with my cloak. "The other day, as Filipp\nAnt\xc3\xb3nuitch was singing it, he actually cried."\n\nZhd\xc3\xa1nof at first sat absolutely motionless, with his eyes fastened on\nthe smouldering embers, and his face, shining in the ruddy glow, seemed\nextraordinarily gloomy; then his cheek under his mustaches began to\nmove quicker and quicker; and at last he got up, and, spreading out\nhis cloak, he lay down in the shadow behind the fire. Either he tossed\nabout and groaned as he got ready for bed, or the death of Velench\xc3\xbak\nand this wretched weather had completely upset me; but it certainly\nseemed to me that he was weeping.\n\nThe bottom of the log which had been rolled on the fire, occasionally\nblazing up, threw its light on Ant\xc3\xb3nof\'s form, with his gray moustache,\nhis red face, and the ribbons on the cloak flung over his shoulders,\nand brought into relief the boots, heads, or backs of other sleeping\nsoldiers.\n\nFrom above the same wretched drizzle was falling; in the atmosphere\nwas the same odor of dampness and smoke; around us could be seen the\nsame bright dots of the dying fires, and amid the general silence the\nmelancholy notes of Ant\xc3\xb3nof\'s song rang out. And when this ceased for a\nmoment, the faint nocturnal sounds of the camp, the snoring, the clank\nof a sentinel\'s musket, and quiet conversation, chimed in with it.\n\n"Second watch! Makatiuk and Zhd\xc3\xa1nof," shouted Maks\xc3\xadmof.\n\nAnt\xc3\xb3nof ceased to sing; Zhd\xc3\xa1nof arose, drew a deep sigh, stepped across\nthe log, and went off quietly to the guns.\n\n\n[Footnote 29: _ch\xc3\xafo-sh._]\n\n[Footnote 30: _da ch\xc3\xafo._]\n\n\nJULY 27, 1855.\n\n\n\n\nAN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.\n\n\n_PRINCE NEKHILUDOF RELATES HOW, DURING AN EXPEDITION IN THE CAUCASUS,\nHE MET AN ACQUAINTANCE FROM MOSCOW. _\n\n\nOur division had been out in the field.\n\nThe work in hand was accomplished: we had cut a way through the forest,\nand each day we were expecting from headquarters orders for our return\nto the fort. Our division of field-pieces was stationed at the top of a\nsteep mountain-crest which was terminated by the swift mountain river\nMechik, and had to command the plain that stretched before us. Here\nand there on this picturesque plain, out of the reach of gunshot, now\nand then, especially at evening, groups of mounted mountaineers showed\nthemselves, attracted by curiosity to ride up and view the Russian camp.\n\nThe evening was clear, mild, and fresh, as it is apt to be in December\nin the Caucasus; the sun was setting behind the steep chain of the\nmountains at the left, and threw rosy rays upon the tents scattered\nover the slope, upon the soldiers moving about, and upon our two guns,\nwhich seemed to crane their necks as they rested motionless on the\nearthwork two paces from us. The infantry picket, stationed on the\nknoll at the left, stood in perfect silhouette against the light of\nthe sunset; no less distinct were the stacks of muskets, the form of\nthe sentry, the groups of soldiers, and the smoke of the smouldering\ncamp-fire.\n\nAt the right and left of the slope, on the black, sodden earth, the\ntents gleamed white; and behind the tents, black stood the bare trunks\nof the platane forest, which rang with the incessant sound of axes, the\ncrackling of the bonfires, and the crashing of the trees as they fell\nunder the axes. The bluish smoke arose from tobacco-pipes on all sides,\nand vanished in the transparent blue of the frosty sky. By the tents\nand on the lower ground around the arms rushed the Cossacks, dragoons,\nand artillerists, with great galloping and snorting of horses as they\nreturned from getting water. It began to freeze; all sounds were\nheard with extraordinary distinctness, and one could see an immense\ndistance across the plain through the clear, rare atmosphere. The\ngroups of the enemy, their curiosity at seeing the soldiers satisfied,\nquietly galloped off across the fields, still yellow with the golden\ncoru-stubble, toward their _auls_ or villages, which were visible,\nbeyond the forest, with the tall posts of the cemeteries and the smoke\nrising in the air.\n\nOur tent was pitched not far from the guns on a place high and dry,\nfrom which we had a remarkably extended view. Near the tent, on a\ncleared space, around the battery itself, we had our games of skittles,\nor _chushki._ The obliging soldiers had made for us rustic benches and\ntables. On account of all these amusements, the artillery officers, our\ncomrades, and a few infantry men liked to gather of an evening around\nour battery, and the place came to be called the club.\n\nAs the evening was fine, the best players had come, and we were\namusing ourselves with skittles.[1] Ensign D., Lieutenant O.,\nand myself had played two games in succession; and to the common\nsatisfaction and amusement of all the spectators, officers, soldiers,\nand servants[2] who were watching us from their tents, we had twice\ncarried the winning party on our backs from one end of the ground to\nthe other. Especially droll was the situation of the huge fat Captain\nS., who, puffing and smiling good-naturedly, with legs dragging on the\nground, rode pickapack on the feeble little Lieutenant O.\n\nWhen it grew somewhat later, the servants brought three glasses of tea\nfor the six men of us, and not a spoon; and we who had finished our\ngame came to the plaited settees.\n\nThere was standing near them a small bow-legged man, a stranger to\nus, in a sheepskin jacket, and a _pap\xc3\xa1kha,_ or Circassian cap, with\nlong overhanging white crown. As soon as we came near where he stood,\nhe took a few irresolute steps, and put on his cap; and several times\nhe seemed to make up his mind to come to meet us, and then stopped\nagain. But after deciding, probably, that it was impossible to remain\nirresolute, the stranger took off his cap, and, going in a circuit\naround us, approached Captain S.\n\n"Ah, Guskantini, how is it, old man?"[3] said S., still smiling\ngood-naturedly, under the influence of his ride.\n\nGuskantini, as S. called him, instantly replaced his cap, and made a\nmotion as though to thrust his hands into the pockets of his jacket;[4]\nbut on the side toward me there was no pocket in the jacket, and his\nsmall red hand fell into an awkward position. I felt a strong desire\nto make out who this man was (was he a yunker, or a degraded officer?)\nand, not realizing that my gaze (that is, the gaze of a strange\nofficer) disconcerted him, I continued to stare at his dress and\nappearance.\n\nI judged that he was about thirty. His small, round, gray eyes had a\nsleepy expression, and at the same time gazed calmly out from under the\ndirty white lambskin of his cap, which hung down over his face. His\nthick, irregular nose, standing out between his sunken cheeks, gave\nevidence of emaciation that was the result of illness, and not natural.\nHis restless lips, barely covered by a sparse, soft, whitish mustache,\nwere constantly changing their shape, as though they were trying to\nassume now one expression, now another. But all these expressions\nseemed to be endless, and his face retained one predominating\nexpression of timidity and fright. Around his thin neck, where, the\nveins stood out, was tied a green woollen scarf tucked into his jacket.\nHis fur jacket, or _polush\xc3\xbabok,_ was worn bare, short, and had dog-fur\nsewed on the collar and on the false pockets. The trousers were\ncheckered, of ash-gray color, and his _sapogi_ had short, unblacked\nmilitary bootlegs.\n\n"I beg of you, do not disturb yourself," said I when he for the second\ntime, timidly glancing at me, had taken off his cap.\n\nHe bowed to me with an expression of gratitude, replaced his hat, and,\ndrawing from his pocket a dirty chintz tobacco-pouch with lacings,\nbegan to roll a cigarette.\n\nI myself had not been long a yunker, an elderly yunker; and as I was\nincapable, as yet, of being good-naturedly serviceable to my younger\ncomrades, and without means, I well knew all the moral difficulties of\nthis situation for a proud man no longer young, and I sympathized with\nall men who found themselves in such a situation, and I endeavored to\nmake clear to myself their character and rank, and the tendencies of\ntheir intellectual peculiarities, in order to judge of the degree of\ntheir moral sufferings. This yunker or degraded officer, judging by his\nrestless eyes and that intentionally constant variation of expression\nwhich I noticed in him, was a man very far from stupid, and extremely\negotistical, and therefore much to be pitied.\n\nCaptain S. invited us to play another game of skittles, with the stakes\nto consist, not only of the usual pickapack ride of the winning party,\nbut also of a few bottles of red wine, rum, sugar, cinnamon, and cloves\nfor the mulled wine which that winter, on account of the cold, was\ngreatly popular in our division.\n\nGuskantini, as S. again called him, was also invited to take part;\nbut before the game began, the man, struggling between gratification\nbecause he had been invited and a certain timidity, drew Captain S.\naside, and began to say something in a whisper. The good-natured\ncaptain punched him in the ribs with his big, fat hand, and replied,\nloud enough to be heard,--\n\n"Not at all, old fellow,[5] I assure you."\n\nWhen the game was over, and that side in which the stranger whose rank\nwas so low had taken part, had come out winners, and it fell to his lot\nto ride on one of our officers, Ensign D., the ensign grew red in the\nface: he went to the little divan and offered the stranger a cigarette\nby way of a compromise.\n\nWhile they were ordering the mulled wine, and in the steward\'s tent\nwere heard assiduous preparations on the part of Nik\xc3\xadta, who had sent\nan orderly for cinnamon and cloves, and the shadow of his back was\nalternately lengthening and shortening on the dingy sides of the tent,\nwe men, seven in all, sat around on the benches; and while we took\nturns in drinking tea from the three glasses, and gazed out over the\nplain, which was now beginning to glow in the twilight, we talked and\nlaughed over the various incidents of the game.\n\nThe stranger in the fur jacket took no share in the conversation,\nobstinately refused to drink the tea which I several times offered him,\nand as he sat there on the ground in Tatar fashion, occupied himself\nin making cigarettes of fine-cut tobacco, and smoking them one after\nanother, evidently not so much for his own satisfaction as to give\nhimself the appearance of a man with something to do. When it was\nremarked that the summons to return was expected on the morrow, and\nthat there might be an engagement, he lifted himself on his knees, and,\naddressing Captain B. only, said that he had been at the adjutant\'s,\nand had himself written the order for the return on the next day. We\nall said nothing while he was speaking; and notwithstanding the fact\nthat he was so bashful, we begged him to repeat this most interesting\npiece of news. He repeated what he had said, adding only that he had\nbeen staying at the adjutant\'s (since he made it his home there) when\nthe order came.\n\n"Look here, old fellow, if you are not telling us false, I shall have\nto go to my company and give some orders for to-morrow," said Captain S.\n\n"No ... why ... it may be, I am sure" ... stammered the stranger, but\nsuddenly stopped, and, apparently feeling himself affronted, contracted\nIns brows, and, muttering something between his teeth, again began to\nroll a cigarette. But the fine-cut tobacco in his chintz pouch began\nto show signs of giving out, and he asked S. to lend him a little\ncigarette.[6]\n\nWe kept on for a considerable time with that monotonous military\nchatter which every one who has ever been on an expedition will\nappreciate; all of us, with one and the same expression, complaining of\nthe dulness and length of the expedition, in one and the same fashion\nsitting in judgment on our superiors, and all of us likewise, as we\nhad done many times before, praising one comrade, pitying another,\nwondering how much this one had gained, how much that one had lost, and\nso on, and so on.\n\n"Here, fellows, this adjutant of ours is completely broken up," said\nCaptain S. "At headquarters he was everlastingly on the winning side;\nno matter whom he sat down with, he\'d rake in every thing: but now for\ntwo months past he has been losing all the time. The present expedition\nhasn\'t been lucky for him. I think he has got away with two thousand\nsilver rubles and five hundred rubles\' worth of articles,--the carpet\nthat he won at Mukhin\'s, Nikitin\'s pistols, Sada\'s gold watch which\nVorontsof gave him. He has lost it all."\n\n"The truth of the matter in his case," said Lieutenant O., "was that he\nused to cheat everybody; it was impossible to play with him."\n\n"He cheated every one, but now it\'s all gone up in his pipe;" and\nhere Captain S. laughed good-naturedly. "Our friend Guskof here lives\nwith him. He hasn\'t quite lost _him_ yet: that\'s so, isn\'t it, old\nfellow?"[7] he asked, addressing Guskof.\n\nGuskof tried to laugh. It was a melancholy, sickly laugh, which\ncompletely changed the expression of his countenance. Till this moment\nit had seemed to me that I had seen and known this man before; and,\nbesides, the name Guskof, by which Captain S. called him, was familiar\nto me; but how and when I had seen and known him, I actually could not\nremember.\n\n"Yes," said Guskof, incessantly putting his hand to his mustaches,\nbut instantly dropping it again without touching them. "Pavel\nDmitri\xc3\xa9vitch\'s luck has been against him in this expedition, such\na _veine de malheur,_" he added in a careful but pure French\npronunciation, again giving me to think that I had seen him, and\nseen him often, somewhere. "I know Pavel Dmitri\xc3\xa9vitch very well. He\nhas great confidence in me," he proceeded to say; "he and I are old\nfriends; that is, he is fond of me," he explained, evidently fearing\nthat it might be taken as presumption for him to claim old friendship\nwith the adjutant. "Pavel Dmitri\xc3\xa9vitch plays admirably; but now,\nstrange as it may seem, it\'s all up with him, he is just, about\nperfectly ruined; _la chance a tourn\xc3\xa9,_" he added, addressing himself\nparticularly to me.\n\nAt first we had listened to Guskof with condescending attention; but as\nsoon as he made use of that second French phrase, we all involuntarily\nturned from him.\n\n"I have played with him a thousand times, and we agreed then that it\nwas strange," said Lieutenant O., with peculiar emphasis on the word\n_strange._[8] "I never once won a ruble from him. Why was it, when I\nused to win of others?"\n\n"Pavel Dmitri\xc3\xa9vitch plays admirably: I have known him for a long\ntime," said I. In fact, I had known the adjutant for several years;\nmore than once I had seen him in the full swing of a game, surrounded\nby officers, and I had remarked his handsome, rather gloomy and always\npassionless calm face, his deliberate Malo-Russian pronunciation, his\nhandsome belongings and horses, his bold, manly figure, and above all\nhis skill and self-restraint in carrying on the game accurately and\nagreeably. More than once, I am sorry to say, as I looked at his plump\nwhite hands with a diamond ring--on the index-finger, passing out one\ncard after another, I grew angry with that ring, with his white hands,\nwith the whole of the adjutant\'s person, and evil thoughts on his\naccount arose in my mind. But as I afterwards reconsidered the matter\ncoolly, I persuaded myself that he played more skilfully than all with\nwhom he happened to play: the more so, because as I heard his general\nobservations concerning the game,--how one ought not to back out when\none had laid the smallest stake, how one ought not to leave off in\ncertain cases as the first rule for honest men, and so forth, and so\nforth,--it was evident that he was always on the winning side merely\nfrom the fact that he played more sagaciously and coolly than the rest\nof us. And now it seemed that this self-reliant, careful player had\nbeen stripped not only of his money but of his effects, which marks the\nlowest depths of loss for an officer.\n\n"He always had devilish good luck with me," said Lieutenant O. "I made\na vow never to play with him again."\n\n"What a marvel you are, old fellow!" said S., nodding at me, and\naddressing O. "You lost three hundred silver rubles, that\'s what you\nlost to him."\n\n"More than that," said the lieutenant savagely. "And now you have come\nto your senses; it is rather late in the day, old man, for the rest of\nus have known for a long time that he was the cheat of the regiment,"\nsaid S., with difficulty restraining his laughter, and feeling very\nwell satisfied with his fabrication. \'Here is Guskof right here,--he\n_fixes_ his cards for him. That\'s the reason of the friendship between\nthem, old man"[9] ... and Captain S., shaking all over, burst out into\nsuch a hearty "ha, ha, ha!" that he spilt the glass of mulled wine\nwhich he was holding in his hand. On Guskof\'s pale emaciated face there\nshowed something like a color; he opened his mouth several times,\nraised his hands to his mustaches and once more dropped them to his\nside where the pockets should have been, stood up, and then sat down\nagain, and finally in an unnatural voice said to S.,--\n\n"It\'s no joke, Nikolai Iv\xc3\xa1novitch, for you to say such things before\npeople who don\'t know me and who see me in this unlined jacket\n... because"--His voice failed him, and again his small red hands\nwith their dirty nails went from his jacket to his face, touching\nhis mustache, his hair, his nose, rubbing his eyes, or needlessly\nscratching his cheek.\n\n"As to saying that, everybody knows it, old fellow," continued S.,\nthoroughly satisfied with his jest, and not heeding Guskof\'s complaint.\nGuskof was still trying to say something; and placing the palm of his\nright hand on his left knee in a most unnatural position, and gazing at\nS., he had an appearance of smiling contemptuously.\n\n"No," said I to myself, as I noticed that smile of his, "I have not\nonly seen him, but have spoken with him somewhere."\n\n"You and I have met somewhere," said I to him when, under the influence\nof the common silence, S.\'s laughter began to calm down. Guskof\'s\nmobile face suddenly lighted up, and his eyes, for the first time with\na truly joyous expression, rested upon me.\n\n"Why, I recognized you immediately," he replied in French. "In \'48\nI had the pleasure of meeting you quite frequently in Moscow at my\nsister\'s."\n\nI had to apologize for not recognizing him at first iii that costume\nand in that new garb. He arose, came to me, and with his moist hand\nirresolutely and weakly seized my hand, and sat down by me. Instead of\nlooking at me, though he apparently seemed so glad to see me, he gazed\nwith an expression of unfriendly bravado at the officers.\n\nEither because I recognized in him a man whom I had met a few years\nbefore in a dress-coat in a parlor, or because he was suddenly raised\nin his own opinion by the fact of being recognized,--at all events it\nseemed to me that his face and even his motions completely changed:\nthey now expressed lively intelligence, a childish self-satisfaction\nin the consciousness of such intelligence, and a certain contemptuous\nindifference; so that I confess, notwithstanding the pitiable position\nin which he found himself, my old acquaintance did not so much excite\nsympathy in me as it did a sort of unfavorable sentiment.\n\nI now vividly remembered our first meeting. In 1848, while I was\nstaying at Moscow, I frequently went to the house of Iv\xc3\xa1shin, who from\nchildhood had been an old friend of mine. His wife was an agreeable\nhostess, a charming woman, as everybody said; but she never pleased\nme.... The winter that I knew her, she often spoke with hardly\nconcealed pride of her brother, who had shortly before completed his\ncourse, and promised to be one of the most fashionable and popular\nyoung men in the best society of Petersburg. As I knew by reputation\nthe father of the Guskofs, who was very rich and had a distinguished\nposition, and as I knew also the sister\'s ways, I felt some prejudice\nagainst meeting the young man. One evening when I was at Iv\xc3\xa1shin\'s, I\nsaw a short, thoroughly pleasant-looking young man, in a black coat,\nwhite vest and necktie. My host hastened to make me acquainted with\nhim. The young man, evidently dressed for a bail, with his cap in his\nhand, was standing before Iv\xc3\xa1shin, and was eagerly but politely arguing\nwith him about a common friend of ours, who had distinguished himself\nat the time of the Hungarian campaign. He said that this acquaintance\nwas not at all a hero or a man born for war, as was said of him, but\nwas simply a clever and cultivated man. I recollect, I took part in the\nargument against Guskof, and went to the extreme of declaring also that\nintellect and cultivation always bore an inverse relation to bravery;\nand I recollect how Guskof pleasantly and cleverly pointed out to me\nthat bravery was necessarily the result of intellect and a decided\ndegree of development,--a statement which I, who considered myself an\nintellectual and cultivated man, could not in my heart of hearts agree\nwith.\n\nI recollect that towards the close of our conversation Madame\nIv\xc3\xa1shina introduced me to her brother; and he, with a condescending\nsmile, offered me his little hand on which he had not yet had time\nto draw his kid gloves, and weakly and irresolutely pressed my hand\nas he did now. Though I had been prejudiced against Guskof, I could\nnot help granting that he was in the right, and agreeing with his\nsister that he was really a clever and agreeable young man, who\nought to have great success in society. He was extraordinarily neat,\nbeautifully dressed, and fresh, and had affectedly modest manners,\nand a thoroughly youthful, almost childish appearance, on account of\nwhich, you could not help excusing his expression of self-sufficiency,\nthough it modified the impression of his high-mightiness caused by his\nintellectual face and especially his smile. It was said that he had\ngreat success that winter with the high-born ladies of Moscow. As I saw\nhim at his sister\'s I could only infer how far this was true by the\nfeeling of pleasure and contentment constantly excited in me by his\nyouthful appearance and by his sometimes indiscreet anecdotes. He and I\nmet half a dozen times, and talked a good deal; or, rather, he talked\na good deal, and I listened. He spoke for the most part in French,\nalways with a good accent, very fluently and ornately; and he had the\nskill of drawing others gently and politely into the conversation. As\na general thing, he behaved toward all, and toward me, in a somewhat\nsupercilious manner, and I felt that he was perfectly right in this way\nof treating people. I always feel that way in regard to men who are\nfirmly convinced that they ought to treat me superciliously, and who\nare comparative strangers to me.\n\nNow, as he sat with me, and gave me his hand, I keenly recalled in him\nthat same old haughtiness of expression; and it seemed to me that he\ndid not properly appreciate his position of official inferiority, as,\nin the presence of the officers, he asked me what I had been doing in\nall that time, and how I happened to be there. In spite of the fact\nthat I invariably made my replies in Russian, he kept putting his\nquestions in French, expressing himself as before in remarkably correct\nlanguage. About himself he said fluently that after his unhappy,\nwretched story (what the story was, I did not know, and he had not yet\ntold me), he had been three months under arrest, and then had been sent\nto the Caucasus to the N. regiment, and now had been serving three\nyears as a soldier in that regiment.\n\n"You would not believe," said he to me in French, "how much I have to\nsuffer in these regiments from the society of the officers. Still it is\na pleasure to me, that I used to know the adjutant of whom we were just\nspeaking: he is a good man--it\'s a fact," he remarked condescendingly.\n"I live with him, and that\'s something of a relief for me. Yes, my\ndear, the days fly by, but they aren\'t all alike,"[10] he added; and\nsuddenly hesitated, reddened, and stood up, as he caught sight of the\nadjutant himself coming toward us.\n\n"It is such a pleasure to meet such a man as you," said Guskof to me in\na whisper as he turned from me. "I should like very, very much, to have\na long talk with you.".\n\nI said that I should be very happy to talk with him, but in reality I\nconfess that Guskof excited in me a sort of dull pity that was not akin\nto sympathy.\n\nI had a presentiment that I should feel a constraint in a private\nconversation with him; but still I was anxious to learn from him\nseveral things, and, above all, why it was, when his father had been\nso rich, that he was in poverty, as was evident by his dress and\nappearance.\n\nThe adjutant greeted us all, including Guskof, and sat down by me\nin the seat which the cashiered officer had just vacated. Pavel\nDmitri\xc3\xa9vitch, who had always been calm and leisurely, a genuine\ngambler, and a man of means, was now very different from what he had\nbeen in the flowery days of his success; he seemed to be in haste to go\nsomewhere, kept constantly glancing at everybody, and it was not five\nminutes before he proposed to Lieutenant O., who had sworn off from\nplaying, to set up a small faro-bank. Lieutenant O. refused, under the\npretext of having to attend to his duties, but in reality because, as\nhe knew that the adjutant had few possessions and little money left,\nhe did not feel himself justified in risking his three hundred rubles\nagainst a hundred or even less which the adjutant might stake.\n\n"Well, Pavel Dmitri\xc3\xa9vitch," said the lieutenant, anxious to avoid a\nrepetition of the invitation, "is it true, what they tell us, that we\nreturn to-morrow?"\n\n"I don\'t know," replied the adjutant. "Orders came, to be in readiness;\nbut if it\'s true, then you\'d better play a game. I would wager my\nKabarda cloak."\n\n"No, to-day already" ...\n\n"It\'s a gray one, never been worn; but if you prefer, play for money.\nHow is that?"\n\n"Yes, but ... I should be willing--pray don\'t think that" ... said\nLieutenant O., answering the implied suspicion; "but as there may be a\nraid or some movement, I must go to bed early."\n\nThe adjutant stood up, and, thrusting his hands into his pockets,\nstarted to go across the grounds. His face assumed its ordinary\nexpression of coldness and pride, which I admired in him.\n\n"Won\'t you have a glass of mulled wine?" I asked him.\n\n"That might be acceptable," and he came back to me; but Guskof politely\ntook the glass from me, and handed it to the adjutant, striving at the\nsame time not to look at him. But as he did not notice the tent-rope,\nhe stumbled over it, and fell on his hand, dropping the glass.\n\n"What a bungler!" exclaimed the adjutant, still holding out his hand\nfor the glass. Everybody burst out laughing, not excepting Guskof, who\nwas rubbing his hand on his sore knee, which he had somehow struck as\nhe fell. "That\'s the way the bear waited on the hermit," continued the\nadjutant. "It\'s the way he waits on me every day. He has pulled up all\nthe tent-pins; he\'s always tripping up."\n\nGuskof, not hearing him, apologized to us, and glanced toward me with\na smile of almost noticeable melancholy as though saying that I alone\ncould understand him. He was pitiable to see; but the adjutant, his\nprotector, seemed, on that very account, to be severe on his messmate,\nand did not try to put him at his ease.\n\n"Well, you\'re a graceful lad! Where did you think you were going?"\n\n"Well, who can help tripping over these pins, Pavel Dmitri\xc3\xa9vitch?" said\nGuskof. "You tripped over them yourself the other day."\n\n"I, old man,[11]--I am not of the rank and file, and such gracefulness\nis not expected of me."\n\n"He can be lazy," said Captain S., keeping the ball rolling, "but\nlow-rank men have to make their legs fly."\n\n"Ill-timed jest," said Guskof almost in a whisper, and casting down his\neyes. The adjutant was evidently vexed with his messmate; he listened\nwith inquisitive attention to every word that he said.\n\n"He\'ll have to be sent out into ambuscade again," said he, addressing\nS., and pointing to the cashiered officer.\n\n"Well, there\'ll be some more tears," said S., laughing. Guskof no\nlonger looked at me, but acted as though he were going to take some\ntobacco from his pouch, though there had been none there for some time.\n\n"Get ready for the ambuscade, old man," said S., addressing him with\nshouts of laughter. "To-day the scouts have brought the news, there\'ll\nbe an attack on the camp to-night, so it\'s necessary to designate the\ntrusty lads." Guskof\'s face showed a fleeting smile as though he were\npreparing to make some reply, but several times he cast a supplicating\nlook at S.\n\n"Well, you know I have been, and I\'m ready to go again if I am sent,"\nhe said hastily.\n\n"Then you\'ll be sent."\n\n"Well, I\'ll go. Isn\'t that all right?"\n\n"Yes, as at Arguna, you deserted the ambuscade and threw away your\ngun," said the adjutant; and turning from him he began to tell us the\norders for the next day.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we expected from the enemy a Cannonade of the\ncamp that night, and the next day some sort of diversion. While we\nwere still chatting about various subjects of general interest, the\nadjutant, as though from a sudden and unexpected impulse, proposed to\nLieutenant O. to have a little game. The lieutenant most unexpectedly\nconsented; and, together with S. and the ensign, they went off to\nthe adjutant\'s tent, where there was a folding green table with cards\non it. The captain, the commander of our division, went to our tent\nto sleep; the other gentlemen also separated, and Guskof and I were\nleft alone. I was not mistaken, it was really very uncomfortable for\nme to have a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with him; I arose involuntarily, and began\nto promenade up and down on the battery. Guskof walked in silence by\nmy side, hastily and awkwardly wheeling around so as not to delay or\nincommode me.\n\n"I do not annoy you?" he asked in a soft, mournful voice. So far as I\ncould see his face in the dim light, it seemed to me deeply thoughtful\nand melancholy.\n\n"Not at all," I replied; but as he did not immediately begin to speak,\nand as I did not know what to say to him, we walked in silence a\nconsiderably long time.\n\nThe twilight had now absolutely changed into dark night; over the black\nprofile of the mountains gleamed the bright evening heat-lightning;\nover our heads in the light-blue frosty sky twinkled the little stars;\non all sides gleamed the ruddy flames of the smoking watch-fires; near\nus, the white tents stood out in contrast to the frowning blackness of\nour earth-works. The light from the nearest watch-fire, around which\nour servants, engaged in quiet conversation, were warming themselves,\noccasionally flashed on the brass of our heavy guns, and fell on the\nform of the sentry, who, wrapped in his cloak, paced with measured\ntread along the battery.\n\n"You cannot imagine what a delight it is for me to talk with such a man\nas you are," said Guskof, although as yet he had not spoken a word to\nme. "Only one who had been in my position could appreciate it."\n\nI did not know how to reply to him, and we again relapsed into silence,\nalthough it was evident that he was anxious to talk, and have me listen\nto him.\n\n"Why were you ... why did you suffer this?" I inquired at last, not\nbeing able to invent any better way of breaking the ice.\n\n"Why, didn\'t you hear about this wretched business from Metenin?"\n\n"Yes, a duel, I believe; I did not hear much about it," I replied. "You\nsee, I have been for some time in the Caucasus."\n\n"No, it wasn\'t a duel, but it was a stupid and horrid story. I will\ntell you all about it, if you don\'t know. It happened, that the same\nyear that I met you at my sister\'s, I was living at Petersburg. I must\ntell you I had then what they call _une position dans le monde,--_ a\nposition good enough if it was not brilliant. _Mon p\xc3\xa8re me donnait_\nten thousand _par an._ In \'49 I was promised a place in the embassy\nat Turin; my uncle on? my mother\'s side had influence, and was always\nready to do a great deal for me. That sort of thing is all past now.\n_J\'\xc3\xa9tais re\xc3\xa7u dans la meilleure soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 de Petersburg;_ I might have\naspired to any girl in the city. I was well educated, as we all are who\ncome from the school, but was not especially cultivated; to be sure,\nI read a good deal afterwards, _mais j\'avais surtout,_ you know, _ce\njargon du monde,_ and, however it came about, I was looked upon as a\nleading light among the young men of Petersburg. What raised me more\nthan all in common estimation, _c\'est cette liaison avec Madame D.,_\nabout which a great deal was said in Petersburg; but I was frightfully\nyoung at that time, and did not prize these advantages very highly.\nI was simply young and stupid. What more did I need? Just then that\nMetenin had some notoriety"--\n\nAnd Guskof went on in the same fashion to relate to me the history\nof his misfortunes, which I will omit, as it would not be at all\ninteresting.\n\n"Two months I remained under arrest," he continued, "absolutely alone;\nand what thoughts did I not have during that time? But, you know,\nwhen it was all over, as though every tie had been broken with the\npast, then it became easier for me. _Mon p\xc3\xa8re,--_you have heard tell\nof him, of course, a man of iron will and strong convictions,--_il\nm\'a d\xc3\xa9sherit\xc3\xa9,_ and broken off all intercourse with me. According\nto his convictions he had to do as he did, and I don\'t blame him\nat all. He was consistent. Consequently I have not taken a step to\ninduce him to change his mind. _My_ sister was abroad. Madame D. is\nthe only one who wrote to me when I was released, and she sent me\nassistance; but you understand that I could not accept it, so that I\nhad none of those little things which make one\'s position a little\neasier, you know,--books, linen, food, nothing at all. At this time I\nthought things over and over, and began to look at life with different\neyes. For instance, this noise, this society gossip about me in\nPetersburg, did not interest me, did not flatter me: it all seemed to\nme ridiculous. I felt that I myself had been to blame; I was young and\nindiscreet; I had spoiled my career, and I only thought how I might get\ninto the right track again. And I felt that I had strength and energy\nenough for it. After my arrest, as I told you, I was sent here to the\nCaucasus to the N. regiment.\n\n"I thought," he went on to say, all the time becoming more and more\nanimated,--"I thought that here in the Caucasus, _la vie de camp,_ the\nsimple, honest men with whom I should associate, and war and danger,\nwould all admirably agree with my mental state, so that I might begin a\nnew life. They will see me under fire.[12] I shall make myself liked;\nI shall be respected for my real self,--the cross--non-commissioned\nofficer; they will relieve me of my fine; and I shall get up again, _et\nvous savez avec ce prestige du malheur!_ But, _quel d\xc3\xa9senchantement!_\nYou can\'t imagine how I have been deceived! You know what sort of men\nthe officers of our regiment are."\n\nHe did not speak for some little time, waiting, as it appeared, for me\nto tell him that I knew the society of our officers here was bad; but\nI made him no reply. It went against my grain that he should expect\nme, because I knew French, forsooth, to be obliged to take issue with\nthe society of the officers, which, during my long residence in the\nCaucasus, I had had time enough to appreciate fully, and for which I\nhad far higher respect than for the society from which Mr. Guskof had\nsprung. I wanted to tell him so, but his position constrained me.\n\n"In the N. regiment the society of the officers is a thousand times\nworse than it is here," he continued. "I hope that it is saying a good\ndeal; _j\'esp\xc3\xa8re que c\'est beaucoup dire;_ that is, you cannot imagine\nwhat it is. I am not speaking of the yunkers and the soldiers, That is\nhorrible, it is so bad. At first they received me very kindly, that is\nabsolutely the truth; but when they saw that I could not help despising\nthem, you know, in these inconceivably small circumstances, they saw\nthat I was a man absolutely different, standing far above them, they\ngot angry with me, and began to put various little humiliations on\nme. You haven\'t an idea what I had to suffer.[13] Then this forced\nrelationship with the yunkers, and especially with the small means\nthat I had--I lacked every thing;[14] I had only what my sister used\nto send me. And here\'s a proof for you! As much as it made me suffer,\nI with my character, _avec ma fiert\xc3\xa9, j\'ai \xc3\xa9cris \xc3\xa0 mon p\xc3\xa8re,_ begged\nhim to send me something. I understand how living four years of such a\nlife may make a man like our cashiered Dromof who drinks with soldiers,\nand writes notes to all the officers asking them to _loan_ him three\nrubles, and signing it, _tout \xc3\xa0 vous, Dromof._ One must have such a\ncharacter as I have, not to be mired in the least by such a horrible\nposition."\n\nFor some time he walked in silence by my side.\n\n"Have you a cigarette?"[15] he asked me.\n\n"And so I staid right where I was? Yes. I could not endure it\nphysically, because, though we were wretched, cold, and ill-fed, I\nlived like a common soldier, but still the officers had some sort of\nconsideration for me. I had still some _prestige_ that they regarded.\nI wasn\'t sent out on guard nor for drill. I could not have stood that.\nBut morally my sufferings were frightful; and especially because I\ndidn\'t see any escape from my position. I wrote my uncle, begged him to\nget me transferred to my present regiment, which, at least, sees some\nservice; and I thought that here Pavel Dmitri\xc3\xa9vitch, _qui est le fils\nde l\'intendant de mon p\xc3\xa8re,_ might be of some use to me. My uncle did\nthis for me; I was transferred. After that regiment this one seemed to\nme a collection of chamberlains. Then Pavel Dmitri\xc3\xa9vitch was here; he\nknew who I was, and I was splendidly received. At my uncle\'s request--a\nGuskof, _vous savez;_ but I forgot that with these men without\ncultivation and undeveloped,--they can\'t appreciate a man, and show him\nmarks of esteem, unless he has that aureole of wealth, of friends; and\nI noticed how, little by little, when they saw that I was poor, their\nbehavior to me showed more and more indifference until they have come\nalmost to dispise me. It is horrible, but it is absolutely the truth.\n\n"Here I have been in action, I have fought, they have seen me under\nfire,"[16] he continued; "but when will it all end? I think, never.\nAnd my strength and energy have already begun to flag. Then I had\nimagined _la guerre, la vie de camp;_ but it isn\'t at all what I see,\nin a sheepskin jacket, dirty linen, soldier\'s boots, and you go out in\nambuscade, and the whole night long lie in the ditch with some Ant\xc3\xb3nof\nreduced to the ranks for drunkenness, and any minute from behind the\nbush may come a rifle-shot and hit you or Ant\xc3\xb3nof,--it\'s all the same\nwhich. That is not bravery: it\'s horrible, _c\'est affreux,_ it\'s\nkilling!"[17]\n\n"Well, you can be promoted a non-commissioned officer for this\ncampaign, and next year an ensign," said I.\n\n"Yes, it may be: they promised me that in two years, and it\'s not up\nyet. What would those two years amount to, if I knew any one! You can\nimagine this life with Pavel Dmitri\xc3\xa9vitch; cards, low jokes, drinking\nall the time; if you wish to tell any thing that is weighing on your\nmind, you would not be understood, or you would be laughed at; they\ntalk with you, not for the sake of sharing a thought, but to get\nsomething funny out of you. Yes, and so it has gone--in a brutal,\nbeastly way, and you are always conscious that you belong to the rank\nand file; they always make you feel that. Hence you can\'t realize what\nan enjoyment it is to talk _\xc3\xa0 coeur ouvert_ to such a man as you are."\n\nI had never imagined what kind of a man I was, and consequently I did\nnot know what answer to make him.\n\n"Will you have your lunch now?" asked Nik\xc3\xadta at this juncture,\napproaching me unseen in the darkness, and, as I could perceive, vexed\nat the presence of a guest. "Nothing but curd dumplings, there\'s none\nof the roast beef left."\n\n"Has the captain had his lunch yet?"\n\n"He went to bed long ago," replied Nik\xc3\xadta gruffly. "According to my\ndirections, I was to bring you lunch here and your brandy." He muttered\nsomething else discontentedly, and sauntered off to his tent. After\nloitering a while longer, he brought us, nevertheless, a lunch-case;\nhe placed a candle on the lunch-case, and shielded it from the wind\nwith a sheet of paper. He brought a saucepan, some mustard in a jar,\na tin dipper with a handle, and a bottle of absinthe. After arranging\nthese things, Nik\xc3\xadta lingered around us for some moments, and looked\non as Guskof and I were drinking the liquor, and it was evidently very\ndistasteful to him. By the feeble light shed by the candle through the\npaper, amid the encircling darkness, could be seen the seal-skin cover\nof the lunch-case, the supper arranged upon it, Guskof\'s sheepskin\njacket, his face, and his small red hands which he used in lifting the\npatties from the pan. Every thing around us was black; and only by\nstraining the sight could be seen the dark battery, the dark form of\nthe sentry moving along the breastwork, on all sides the watch-fires,\nand on high the ruddy stars.\n\nGuskof wore a melancholy, almost guilty smile, as though it were\nawkward for him to look into my face after his confession. He drank\nstill another glass of liquor, and ate ravenously, emptying the\nsaucepan.\n\n"Yes; for you it must be a relief all the same," said I, for the sake\nof saying something,--"your acquaintance with the adjutant. He is a\nvery good man, I have heard."\n\n"Yes," replied the cashiered officer, "he is a kind man; but he can\'t\nhelp being what he is, with his education, and it is useless to expect\nit."\n\nA flush seemed suddenly to cross his face. "You remarked his coarse\njest this evening about the ambuscade;" and Guskof, though I tried\nseveral times to interrupt him, began to justify himself before me, and\nto show that he had not run away from the ambuscade, and that he was\nnot a coward as the adjutant and Capt. S. tried to make him out.\n\n"As I was telling you," he went on to say, wiping his hands on his\njacket, "such people can\'t show any delicacy toward a man, a common\nsoldier, who hasn\'t much money either. That\'s beyond their strength.\nAnd here recently, while I haven\'t received any thing at all from my\nsister, I have been conscious that they have changed toward me. This\nsheepskin jacket, which I bought of a soldier, and which hasn\'t any\nwarmth in it, because it\'s all worn off" (and here he showed me where\nthe wool was gone from the inside), "it doesn\'t arouse in him any\nsympathy or consideration for my unhappiness, but scorn, which he does\nnot take pains to hide. Whatever my necessities may be, as now when I\nhave nothing to eat except soldiers\' gruel, and nothing to wear," he\ncontinued, casting down his eyes, and pouring out for himself still\nanother glass of liquor, "he does not even offer to lend me some money,\nthough he knows perfectly well that I would give it back to him; but\nhe waits till I am obliged to ask him for it. But you appreciate how\nit is for me to go to _him._ In your case I should say, square and\nfair, _Vous \xc3\xaates au dessus de cela, mon cher, je n\'ai pas le sou._ And\nyou know," said he, looking straight into my eyes with an expression\nof desperation, "I am going to tell you, square and fair, I am in a\nterrible situation: _pouvez-vous me pr\xc3\xaater dix rubles argent?_ My\nsister ought to send me some by the next mail, _et mon p\xc3\xa8re_"--\n\n"Why, most willingly," said I, although, on the contrary, it was trying\nand unpleasant, especially because the evening before, having lost\nat cards, I had left only about five rubles in Nik\xc3\xadta\'s care. "In a\nmoment," said I, arising, "I will go and get it at the tent."\n\n"No, by and by: _ne vous d\xc3\xa9rangez pas._"\n\nNevertheless, not heeding him, I hastened to the closed tent, where\nstood my bed, and where the captain was sleeping.\n\n"Aleks\xc3\xa9i Iv\xc3\xa1nuitch, let me have ten rubles, please, for rations," said\nI to the captain, shaking him.\n\n"What! have you been losing again? But this very evening, you were not\ngoing to play any more," murmured the captain, still half asleep.\n\n"No, I have not been playing; but I want the money; let me have it,\nplease."\n\n"Makatiuk!" shouted the captain to his servant,[18] "hand me my bag\nwith the money."\n\n"Hush, hush!" said I, hearing Guskof\'s measured steps near the tent.\n\n"What? Why hush?"\n\n"Because that cashiered fellow has asked to borrow it of me. He\'s right\nthere."\n\n"Well, if you knew him, you wouldn\'t let him have it," remarked the\ncaptain. "I have heard about him. He\'s a dirty, low-lived fellow."\n\nNevertheless, the captain gave me the money, ordered his man to put\naway the bag, pulled the flap of the tent neatly to, and, again saying,\n"If you only knew him, you wouldn\'t let him have it," drew his head\ndown under the coverlet. "Now you owe me thirty-two, remember," he\nshouted after me.\n\nWhen I came out of the tent, Guskof was walking near the settees; and\nhis slight figure, with his crooked legs, his shapeless cap, his long\nwhite hair, kept appearing and disappearing in the darkness, as he\npassed in and out of the light of the candles. He made believe not to\nsee me.\n\nI handed him the money. He said "_Merci_" and, crumpling the bank-bill,\nthrust it into his trousers pocket.\n\n"Now I suppose the game is in full swing at the adjutant\'s," he began\nimmediately after this.\n\n"Yes, I suppose so."\n\n"He\'s a wonderful player, always bold, and never backs out. When he\'s\nin luck, it\'s fine; but when it does not go well with him, he can lose\nfrightfully. He has given proof of that. During this expedition, if you\nreckon his valuables, he has lost more than fifteen hundred rubles.\nBut, as he played discreetly before, that officer of yours seemed to\nhave some doubts about his honor."\n\n"Well, that\'s because he ... Nik\xc3\xadta, haven\'t we any of that red Kavkas\nwine[19] left?" I asked, very much enlivened by Guskof\'s conversational\ntalent. Nik\xc3\xadta still kept muttering; but he brought us the red wine,\nand again looked on angrily as Guskof drained his glass. In Guskof\'s\nbehavior was noticeable his old freedom from constraint. I wished that\nhe would go as soon as possible; it seemed as if his only reason for\nnot going was because he did not wish to go immediately after receiving\nthe money. I said nothing.\n\n"How could you, who have means, and were under no necessity, simply _de\ngaiet\xc3\xa9 de coeur,_ make up your mind to come and serve in the Caucasus?\nThat\'s what I don\'t understand," said he to me.\n\nI endeavored to explain this act of renunciation, which seemed so\nstrange to him.\n\n"I can imagine how disagreeable the society of these officers--men\nwithout any comprehension of culture--must be for you. You could not\nunderstand each other. You see, you might live ten years, and not see\nany thing, and not hear about anything, except cards, wine, and gossip\nabout rewards and campaigns."\n\nIt was unpleasant for me, that he wished me to put myself on a par with\nhim in his position; and, with absolute honesty I assured him that I\nwas very fond of cards and wine, and gossip about campaigns, and that\nI did not care to have any better comrades than those with whom I was\nassociated. But he would not believe me.\n\n"Well, you may say so," he continued; "but the lack of women\'s\nsociety,--I mean, of course, _femmes comme il faut,--_is that not a\nterrible deprivation? I don\'t know what I would give now to go into a\nparlor, if only for a moment, and to have a look at a pretty woman,\neven though it were through a crack."\n\nHe said nothing for a little, and drank still another glass of the red\nwine.\n\n"Oh, my God, my God![20] If it only might be our fate to meet again,\nsomewhere in Petersburg, to live and move among men, among ladies!"\n\nHe drank up the dregs of the wine still left in the bottle, and when he\nhad finished it he said, _"Akh! pardon,_ maybe _you_ wanted some more.\nIt was horribly careless of me. However, I suppose I must have taken\ntoo much, and my head isn\'t very strong.[21] There was a time when I\nlived on Morskaia Street, _au rez-de-chauss\xc3\xa9e,_ and had marvellous\napartments, furniture, you know, and I was able to arrange it all\nbeautifully, not so very expensively though; my father, to be sure,\ngave me porcelains, flowers, and silver,--a wonderful lot. _Le matin\nje sortais,_ visits, _\xc3\xa0 5 heures r\xc3\xa9guli\xc3\xa8rement._ I used to go and dine\nwith _her;_ often she was alone. _Il faut avouer que c\'\xc3\xa9tait une femme\nravissante!_ You didn\'t know her at all, did you?"\n\n"No."\n\n"You see, there was such a high degree of womanliness in her, and such\ntenderness, and what love! Lord! I did not know how to appreciate my\nhappiness then. We would return after the theatre, and have a little\nsupper together. It was never dull where she was, _toujours gaie,\ntoujours aimante._ Yes, and I had never imagined what rare happiness it\nwas. _Et j\'ai beaucoup \xc3\xa0 me reprocher_ in regard to her. _Je l\'ai fait\nsouffrir et souvent._ I was outrageous. _Akh!_ What a marvellous time\nthat was! Do I bore you?"\n\n"No, not at all."\n\n"Then I will tell you about our evenings. I used to go--that stairway,\nevery flower-pot I knew,--the door-handle, all was so lovely, so\nfamiliar; then the vestibule, her room ... No, it will never, never\ncome back to me again! Even now she writes to me: if you will let me, I\nwill show you her letters. But I am not what I was; I am ruined; I am\nno longer worthy of her.... Yes, I am ruined forever. _Je suis cass\xc3\xa9._\nThere\'s no energy in me, no pride, nothing--nor even any rank.[22] ...\nYes, I am ruined; and no one will ever appreciate my sufferings. Every\none is indifferent. I am a lost man. Never any chance for me to rise,\nbecause I have fallen morally ... into the mire--I have fallen." ...\n\nAt this moment there was evident in his words a genuine, deep despair:\nhe did not look at me, but sat motionless.\n\n"Why are you in such despair?" I asked.\n\n"Because I am abominable. This life has degraded me, all that was in\nme, all is crushed out. It is not by pride that I hold out, but by\nabjectness: there\'s no _dignit\xc3\xa9 dans le malheur._ I am humiliated every\nmoment; I endure it all; I got myself into this abasement. This mire\nhas soiled me. I myself have become coarse; I have forgotten what I\nused to know; I can\'t speak French any more; I am conscious that I am\nbase and low. I cannot tear myself away from these surroundings, indeed\nI cannot. I might have been a hero: give me a regiment, gold epaulets,\na trumpeter, but to march in the ranks with some wild Anton Bondarenko\nor the like, and feel that between me and him there was no difference\nat all--that he might be killed or I might be killed--all the same,\nthat thought is maddening. You understand how horrible it is to think\nthat some ragamuffin may kill me, a man who has thoughts and feelings,\nand that it would make no difference if alongside of me some Ant\xc3\xb3nof\nwere killed,--a being not different from an animal--and that it might\neasily happen that I and not this Ant\xc3\xb3nof were killed, which is always\n_une fatalit\xc3\xa9_ for every lofty and good man. I know that they call me a\ncoward: grant that I am a coward, I certainly am a coward, and can\'t be\nany thing else. Not _only_ am I a coward, but I am in my way a low and\ndespicable man. Here I have just been borrowing money of you, and you\nhave the right to despise me. No, take back your money." And he held\nout to me the crumpled bank-bill. "I want you to have a good opinion of\nme." He covered his face with his hands, and burst into tears. I really\ndid not know what to say or do.\n\n"Calm yourself," I said to him. "You are too sensitive; don\'t take\nevery thing so to heart; don\'t indulge in self-analysis, look at\nthings more simply. You yourself say that you have character. Keep up\ngood heart, you won\'t have long to wait," I said to him, but not very\nconsistently, because I was much stirred both by a feeling of sympathy\nand a feeling of repentance, because I had allowed myself mentally to\nsin in my judgment of a man truly and deeply unhappy.\n\n"Yes," he began, "if I had heard even once, at the time when I was in\nthat hell, one single word of sympathy, of advice, of friendship--one\nhumane word such as you have just spoken, perhaps I might have calmly\nendured all; perhaps I might have struggled, and been a soldier. But\nnow this is horrible.... When I think soberly, I long for death. Why\nshould I love my despicable life and my own self, now that I am ruined\nfor all that is worth while in the world? And at the least danger, I\nsuddenly, in spite of myself, begin to pray for my miserable life, and\nto watch over it as though it were precious, and I cannot, _je ne puis\npas,_ control myself.--That is, I could," he continued again after a\nminute\'s silence, "but this is too hard work for me, a monstrous work,\nwhen I am alone. With others, under special circumstances, when you\nare going into action, I am brave, _j\'ai fait mes \xc3\xa9preuves,_ because I\nam vain and proud: that is my fading, and in presence of others.... Do\nyou know, let me spend the night with you: with us, they will play all\nnight long; it makes no difference, anywhere, on the ground."\n\nWhile Nik\xc3\xadta was making the bed, we got up, and once more began to walk\nup and down in the darkness on the battery. Certainly Guskof\'s head\nmust have been very weak, because two glasses of liquor and two of\nwine made him dizzy. As we got up and moved away from the candles, I\nnoticed that he again thrust the ten-ruble bill into his pocket, trying\nto do so without my seeing it. During all the foregoing conversation,\nhe had held it in his hand. He continued to reiterate how he felt that\nhe might regain his old station if he had a man such as I were to take\nsome interest in him.\n\nWe were just going into the tent to go to bed when suddenly a\ncannon-ball whistled over us, and buried itself in the ground not\nfar from us. So strange it was,--that peacefully sleeping camp, our\nconversation, and suddenly the hostile cannon-ball which flew from\nGod knows where, into the midst of our tents,--so strange that it was\nsome time before I could realize what it was. Our sentinel, Andr\xc3\xa9ief,\nwalking up and down on the battery, moved toward me.\n\n"Ha! he\'s crept up to us. It was the fire here that he aimed at," said\nhe.\n\n"We must rouse the captain," said I, and gazed at Guskof.\n\nHe stood cowering close to the ground, and stammered, trying to say,\n"Th-that\'s th-the ene-my\'s ... f-f-fire--th-that\'s--hidi--." Further he\ncould not say a word, and I did not see how and where he disappeared so\ninstantaneously.\n\nIn the captain\'s tent a candle gleamed; his cough, which always\ntroubled him when he was awake, was heard; and he himself soon\nappeared, asking for a linstock to light his little pipe.\n\n"What does this mean, old man?"[23] he asked with a smile. "Aren\'t they\nwilling to give me a little sleep to-night? First it\'s you with your\ncashiered friend, and then it\'s Shamyl. What shall we do, answer him or\nnot? There was nothing about this in the instructions, was there?"\n\n"Nothing at all. There he goes again," said I. "Two of them!"\n\nIndeed, in the darkness, directly in front of us, flashed two fires,\nlike two eyes; and quickly over our heads flew one cannon-ball and one\nheavy shell. It must have been meant for us, coming with a loud and\npenetrating hum. From the neighboring tents the soldiers hastened. You\ncould hear them hawking and talking and stretching themselves.\n\n"Hist! the fuse sings like a nightingale," was the remark of the\nartillerist.\n\n"Send for Nik\xc3\xadta," said the captain with his perpetually benevolent\nsmile. "Nik\xc3\xadta, don\'t hide yourself, but listen to the mountain\nnightingales."\n\n"Well, your honor,"[26] said Nik\xc3\xadta, who was standing near the captain,\n"I have seen them--these nightingales. I am not afraid of \'em; but here\nwas that stranger who was here, he was drinking up your red wine. When\nhe heard how that shot dashed by our tents, and the shell rolled by, he\ncowered down like some wild beast."\n\n"However, we must send to the commander of the artillery," said the\ncaptain to me in a serious tone of authority, "and ask whether we shall\nreply to the fire or not. It will probably be nothing at all, but still\nit may. Have the goodness to go and ask him. Have a horse saddled. Do\nit as quickly as possible, even if you take my Polkan."\n\nIn five minutes they brought me a horse, and I galloped off to the\ncommander of the artillery. "Look you, return on foot," whispered the\npunctilious captain, "else they won\'t let you through the lines."\n\nIt was half a verst to the artillery commander\'s, the whole road\nran between the tents. As soon as I rode away from our fire, it\nbecame so black that I could not see even the horse\'s ears, but only\nthe watch-fires, now seeming very near, now very far off, as they\ngleamed into my eyes. After I had ridden some distance, trusting to\nthe intelligence of the horse whom I allowed free rein, I began to\ndistinguish the white four-cornered tents and then the black tracks\nof the road. After a half-hour, having asked my way three times,\nand twice stumbled over the tent-stakes, causing each time a volley\nof curses from the tents, and twice been detained by the sentinels,\nI reached the artillery commander\'s. While I was on the way, I heard\ntwo more cannon shot in the direction of our camp; but the projectiles\ndid not reach to the place where the headquarters were. The artillery\ncommander ordered not to reply to the firing, the more as the enemy did\nnot remain in the same place; and I went back, leading the horse by the\nbridle, making my way on foot between the infantry tents. More than\nonce I delayed my steps, as I went by some soldier\'s tent where a light\nwas shining, and some merry-andrew was telling a story; or I listened\nto some educated soldier reading from some book while the whole\ndivision overflowed the tent, or hung around it, sometimes interrupting\nthe reading with various remarks; or I simply listened to the talk\nabout the expedition, about the fatherland, or about their chiefs.\n\nAs I came around one of the tents of the third battalion, I heard\nGuskof\'s rough voice: he was speaking hilariously and rapidly. Young\nvoices replied to him, not those of soldiers, but of gay gentlemen.\nIt was evidently the tent of some yunker or sergeant-major. I stopped\nshort.\n\n"I\'ve known him a long time," Guskof was saying. "When I lived in\nPetersburg, he used to come to my house often; and I went to his. He\nmoved in the best society."\n\n"Whom are you talking about?" asked a drunken voice.\n\n"About the prince," said Guskof. "We were relatives, you see, but, more\nthan all, we were old friends. It\'s a mighty good thing, you know,\ngentlemen, to have such an acquaintance. You see, he\'s fearfully rich.\nTo him a hundred silver rubles is a mere bagatelle. Here, I just got a\nlittle money out of him, enough to last me till my sister sends."\n\n"Let\'s have some."\n\n"Right away.--Savelitch, my dear," said Guskof, coming to the door\nof the tent, "here\'s ten rubles for you: go to the sutler, get two\nbottles of Kakhetinski. Any thing else, gentlemen? What do you say?"\nand Guskof, with unsteady gait, with dishevelled hair, without his hat,\ncame out of the tent. Throwing open his jacket, and thrusting his hands\ninto the pockets of his trousers, he stood at the door of the tent.\nThough he was in the light, and I in darkness, I trembled with fear\nlest he should see me, and I went on, trying to make no noise.\n\n"Who goes there?" shouted Guskof after me in a thoroughly drunken\nvoice. Apparently, the cold took hold of him. "Who the devil is going\noff with that horse?"\n\nI made no answer, and silently went on my way.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: _gorodki._]\n\n[Footnote 2: _denshchiki._]\n\n[Footnote 3: _nu chto, b\xc3\xa1tenka._]\n\n[Footnote 4: _polush\xc3\xbabok,_ little half _shuba,_ or fur cloak.]\n\n[Footnote 5: _b\xc3\xa1tenka,_ Malo-Russian diminutive, little father.]\n\n[Footnote 6: _pap\xc3\xadr\xc3\xb3sotchka,_ diminished diminutive of _papir\xc3\xb3ska,_\nfrom _papiros_.]\n\n[Footnote 7: _b\xc3\xa1tenka._]\n\n[Footnote 8: _stranno._]\n\n[Footnote 9: _b\xc3\xa1tenka mo\xc3\xaf._]\n\n[Footnote 10: _Oui, mon cher, lea jours se suivent, mais ne se\nressemblent pas:_ in French in the original.]\n\n[Footnote 11: _b\xc3\xa1tiushka._]\n\n[Footnote 12: _On me verra au feu._]\n\n[Footnote 13: _Ce que j\'ai eu \xc3\xa0 souffrir vous ne vous faites pas une\nid\xc3\xa9e._]\n\n[Footnote 14: _Avec les petits moyens que j\'avais, je manquais de\ntout._]\n\n[Footnote 15: "_Avez-vous un papiros?_"]\n\n[Footnote 16: _On m\'a vu au feu._]\n\n[Footnote 17: _\xc3\x87a tue._]\n\n[Footnote 18: _denshchik._]\n\n[Footnote 19: _chik\xc3\xadr._]\n\n[Footnote 20: _Akh, Bozhe mo\xc3\xaf, Bozhe mo\xc3\xaf!_]\n\n[Footnote 21: _Et je n\'ai pas la t\xc3\xaate forte._]\n\n[Footnote 22: _blagorodstva,_ noble birth, nobility.]\n\n[Footnote 23: _b\xc3\xa1tiushka._]\n\n[Footnote 24: _v\xc3\xa1she vuisokoblagorod\xc3\xafe._ German, _hochwohlgeborener,_\nhigh-well born; regulation title of officers from major to general.]\n\n\n\n\nLOST ON THE STEPPE; OR, THE SNOWSTORM.\n\n_A TALE._\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nAt seven o\'clock in the evening, having taken my tea, I started from a\nstation, the name of which I have quite forgotten, though I remember\nthat it was somewhere in the region of the Don Cossacks, not far from\nNovocherkask. It was already dark when I took my seat in the sledge\nnext to Alyoshka, and wrapped myself in my fur coat and the robes.\nBack of the station-house it seemed warm and calm. Though it was not\nsnowing, not a single star was to be seen overhead, and the sky it\nseemed remarkably low and black, in contrast with the clear snowy\nexpanse stretching out before us.\n\nWe had scarcely passed by the black forms of the windmills, one of\nwhich was awkwardly waving its huge wings, and had left the station\nbehind us, when I perceived that the road was growing rougher and more\ndrifted; the wind began to blow more fiercely on the left, and to toss\nthe horses\' manes and tails to one side, and obstinately to lift and\ncarry away the snow stirred up by the runners and hoofs. The little\nbell rang with a muffled sound; a draught of cold air forced its way\nthrough the opening in my sleeves, to my very back; and the inspector\'s\nadvice came into my head, that I had better not go farther, lest I\nwander all night, and freeze to death on the road.\n\n"Won\'t you get us lost?" said I to the driver,[1] but, as I got no\nanswer, I put the question more explicitly: "Say, shall we reach the\nstation, driver? We sha\'n\'t lose our way?"\n\n"God knows," was his reply; but he did not turn his head. "You see what\nkind of going we have. No road to be seen. Great heavens!"[2]\n\n"Be good enough to tell me, do you hope to reach the station, or not?"\nI insisted. "Shall we get there?"\n\n"Must get there," said the driver; and he muttered something else,\nwhich I could not hear for the wind.\n\nI did not wish to turn about, but the idea of wandering all night in\nthe cold and snow over the perfectly shelterless steppe, which made\nup this part of the Don Cossack land, was very unpleasant. Moreover,\nnotwithstanding the fact that I could not, by reason of the darkness,\nsee him very well, _my_ driver, somehow, did not please me, "nor\ninspire any confidence. He sat exactly in the middle, with his legs in,\nand not on one, side; his stature was too great; his voice expressed\nindolence; his cap, not like those usually worn by his class, was large\nand loose on all sides. Besides, he did not manage his horses in the\nproper way, but held the reins in both hands, just like the lackey who\nsat on the box behind the coachman; and, chiefly, I did not believe in\nhim, because he had his ears wrapped up in a handkerchief. In a word,\nhe did not please me; and it seemed as if that crooked, sinister back\nlooming before me boded nothing good.\n\n"In my opinion, it would be better to turn about," said Alyoshka to\nme: "fine thing it would be to be lost!"\n\n"Great heavens! see what a snowstorm\'s coming! No road in sight. It\nblinds one\'s eyes. Great heavens!" repeated the driver.\n\nWe had not been gone a quarter of an hour when the driver stopped the\nhorses, handed the reins to Alyoshka, awkwardly liberated his legs from\nthe seat, and went to search for the road, crunching over the snow in\nhis great boots.\n\n"What is it? Where are you going? Are we lost?" I asked, but the driver\nmade no reply, but, turning his face away from the wind, which cut his\neyes, marched off from the sledge.\n\n"Well, how is it?" I repeated, when he returned.\n\n"Nothing at all," said he to me impatiently and with vexation, as\nthough I were to blame for his missing the road; and again slowly\nwrapping up his big legs in the robe, he gathered the reins in his\nstiffened mittens.\n\n"What\'s to be done?" I asked as we started off again.\n\n"What\'s to be done? We shall go as God leads."\n\nAnd we drove along in the same dog-trot over what was evidently an\nuntrodden waste, sometimes sinking in deep, mealy snow, sometimes\ngliding over crisp, unbroken crust.\n\nAlthough it was cold, the snow kept melting quickly on my collar. The\nlow-flying snow-clouds increased, and occasionally the dry snowflakes\nbegan to fall.\n\nIt was clear that we were going out of our way, because, after keeping\non for a quarter of an hour more, we saw no sign of a verst-post.\n\n"Well, what do you think about it now?" I asked of the driver once\nmore. "Shall we get to the station?"\n\n"Which one? We should go back if we let the horses have their way: they\nwill take us. But, as for the next one, that\'s a problem.... Only we\nmight perish."\n\n"Well, then, let us go back," said I. "And indeed"--\n\n"How is it? Shall we turn about?" repeated the driver.\n\n"Yes, yes: turn back."\n\nThe driver shook the reins. The horses started off more rapidly; and,\nthough I did not notice that we had turned around, the wind changed,\nand soon through the snow appeared the windmills. The driver\'s good\nspirits returned, and he began to be communicative.\n\n"Lately," said he, "in just such a snowstorm some people coming from\nthat same station lost their way. Yes: they spent the night in the\nhayricks, and barely managed to get here in the morning. Thanks to the\nhayricks, they were rescued. If it had not been for them, they would\nhave frozen to death, it was so cold. And one froze his foot, and died\nthree weeks afterwards."\n\n"But now, you see, it\'s not cold; and it\'s growing less windy," I said.\n"Couldn\'t we go on?"\n\n"It\'s warm enough, but it\'s snowing. Now going back, it seems easier.\nBut it\'s snowing hard. Might go on, if you were a courier or something;\nbut this is for your own sake. What kind of a joke would that be if\na passenger froze to death? How, then, could I be answerable to your\ngrace?"\n\n\n[Footnote 1: _yamshch\xc3\xadk_.]\n\n[Footnote 2: _gospodi-b\xc3\xa1tiushka!_ Literally, Lord, little father.]\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nAt this moment we heard behind us the bells of a tro\xc3\xafka which was\nrapidly overtaking us.\n\n"A courier\'s bell," said my driver. "There\'s one such for every\nstation."\n\nAnd, in fact, the bell of the courier\'s tro\xc3\xafka, the sound of which\nnow came clearly to me on the wind, was peculiarly beautiful,--clear,\nsonorous, deep, and jangling a little. As I then knew, this was a\nhuntsman\'s team; three bells,--one large one in the centre, with the\n_crimson_ tone, as it is called, and two small ones tuned in thirds.\nThe sound of this triad and the tinkling fifth, ringing through the\nair, was extraordinarily effective and strangely pleasant in this dark\ndesert steppe.\n\n"The posht is coming," said my driver when the foremost of the three\ntroikas drew up in line with ours. "Well, how is the road? is it\npossible to go on?" he cried to the last of the drivers. But the\nyamshch\xc3\xadk only shouted to his horses, and made no reply.\n\nThe sound of the bells quickly died away on the wind, almost as soon as\nthe post-team passed us.\n\nOf course my driver felt ashamed.\n\n"Well, you shall go, b\xc3\xa1rin," he said to me. "People have made their way\nthrough, now their tracks will be fresh."\n\nI agreed; and once more we faced the wind, and began to crawl along\non the deep snow. I kept my eyes on one side on the road, so that we\nshould not get off the track that had been made by the other sledges.\nFor two versts the tracks were clearly visible, then there began to\nbe only a slight irregularity where the runners had gone; and soon\nI really could no longer distinguish whether it was the track, or\nmerely a layer of snow heaped up. My eyes grew weary of gazing at the\nmonotonous stretch of snow under the runners, and I began to look\nahead. The third verst-post we had already seen, but the fourth we\ncould not find at all. As before, we went in the teeth of the wind, and\nwith the wind, and to the right and to the left; and finally we reached\nsuch a state that the driver declared that we must have turned off to\nthe right. I declared that we must have turned off to the left, and\nAlyoshka was sure that we ought to go back. Again we stopped a number\nof times, the driver uncoiled his long legs, and crawled along trying\nto find the road. But all in vain. I also got out once to see whether\nit were the road or something else that attracted my attention. But\nI had scarcely taken six steps with difficulty against the wind, and\nconvinced myself that we were surrounded by the same monotonous white\nheaps of snow, and that the road existed only in my imagination, when\nI lost sight of the sledge. I shouted, "Yamshch\xc3\xadk! Alyoshka!" but my\nvoice,--I felt how the wind tore it right out of my mouth, and carried\nit in a twinkling far from me. I went in the direction where the sledge\nhad been--the sledge was not there. I went to the right--not there\neither. I am ashamed to recollect what a loud, penetrating, and even\nrather despairing voice, I summoned to shout once more, "Yamshch\xc3\xadk!"\nand there he was two steps away. His black figure, with his whip, and\nhis huge cap hanging down on one side, suddenly loomed up before me.\nHe led me to the sledge.\n\n"Thank the Lord, it\'s still warm!" said he. "To perish with the\ncold--awful! Great heavens!"[3]\n\n"Let the horses find their own way, let us turn back," said I, as I\ntook my place in the sledge. "Won\'t they take us back? hey, driver?"\n\n"They ought to."\n\nHe gave the horses the reins, cracked his whip three times over the\nsaddle of the shaft-horse, and again we started off at hap-hazard. We\nwent for half an hour. Suddenly before us again I heard the well-known\nbell of the hunting establishment, and the other two. But now they were\ncoming toward us. It was the same three troikas, which had already\ndeposited the mail, and, with a change of horses attached behind, were\nreturning to the station. The courier\'s tro\xc3\xafka, with powerful horses\nwith the hunting-bell, quickly dashed ahead. A single driver sat in it\non the driver\'s seat, and was shouting vigorously. Behind him, in the\nmiddle one of the empty troikas, were two other drivers; and their loud\nand hilarious talk could be heard. One of them was smoking a pipe; and\nthe spark, brightened by the wind, lighted up a part of his face.\n\nAs I looked at them, I felt ashamed that I was afraid to go on; and my\ndriver doubtless had the same feeling, because we both said with one\nvoice, "Let us follow them."\n\n\n[Footnote 3: _gospodi-b\xc3\xa1tiushka._]\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nMy driver, without waiting for the last tro\xc3\xafka to pass, began awkwardly\nto turn around; and the thills hit the horses attached behind. One of\nthe tro\xc3\xafka teams shied, tore away the reins, and galloped off.\n\n"Hey there, you squint-eyed devil! Don\'t you see where you are turning?\nRunning people down, you devil!" in a hoarse, discordant voice scolded\none of the drivers, a short, little old man, as I judged by his voice\nand expression. He sprang hastily out of the hindmost sledge where he\nhad been sitting, and started to run after the horses, still continuing\nroughly and violently to vilify my yamshch\xc3\xadk.\n\nBut the horses did not come back. The driver ran after them, and in one\ninstant both horses and driver were lost from sight in the white mist\nof the storm.\n\n"Vasi-i-i-li! bring the _bay_ horse here. Can\'t ketch him, so-o-o,"\nechoed his voice in the distance.\n\nOne of the drivers, a very tall fellow, got out of his sledge, silently\nunhitched his tro\xc3\xafka, mounted one of the horses by the breeching, and\ncrunching over the snow in a clumsy gallop, disappeared in the same\ndirection.\n\nOur own tro\xc3\xafka, with the two others, followed on over the steppe,\nbehind the courier\'s which dashed ahead in full trot, jingling its bell.\n\n"How is it? He\'ll get \'em?" said my driver, referring to the one who\nhad gone to catch the horses. "If that mare didn\'t find the horses she\nwouldn\'t be good for much, you know: she\'d wander off, so that--she\'d\nget lost."\n\nFrom the moment that my driver had the company of other teams he became\nmore hilarious and talkative; and, as I had no desire to sleep, I did\nnot fail, as a matter of course, to make the most of it. I took pains\nto ask him about his home and his family, and soon learned that he was\na fellow-countryman of mine from Tula,--a peasant, belonging to a noble\nfamily from the village of Kirpitchno\xc3\xa9; that they had very little land,\nand the grain had entirely ceased to grow, owing to the cholera; that\nhe and one of his brothers had staid at home, and a third had gone as\na soldier; that since Christmas they had lacked bread, and had been\nobliged to work out; that his younger brother had kept the farm because\nhe was married, but that he himself was a widower; that his villagers\nevery year came here to exercise the trade of yamshch\xc3\xadk, or driver;\nthat, though he had not come as a regular driver, yet he was in the\npostal-service, so as to help his brother; that he earned there, thanks\nto God, a hundred and twenty paper rubles a year, of which he sent\na hundred to his family; and that it would be good living, "but the\ncou_l_iers were very wild beasts, and the people here were impudent."\n\n"Now, what was that driver scolding about? Great heavens![4] did I mean\nto lose his horses for him? Did I treat him in a mean way? And why did\nhe go galloping off after \'em? They\'d have come in of their own accord.\nAnyway, \'twould be better for the horses to freeze to death than for\nhim to get lost," said the pious muzh\xc3\xadk.\n\n"What is that black thing I see coming?" I asked, pointing to some dark\nobject in front of us.\n\n"That\'s a baggage-train. Splendid wheeling!" he added, as he came up\nwith the huge mat-covered vans on wheels, following one after the\nother. "See, not a soul to be seen--all asleep. The wise horse knows:\nyou won\'t drive her from the road, never.... We\'ve driven in that same\nway--so we know," he added.\n\nIt was indeed strange to see the huge vans covered with snow from the\nmatted tops to the wheels, moving along, absolutely alone. Only the\nfront corner of the snow-covered mat would be lifted by two fingers;\nand, for a moment, a cap would peer out as our bells jingled past the\ntrain. A great piebald horse, stretching out his neck, and straining\nhis back, walked with measured pace over the drifted road, monotonously\nshaking his shaggy head under the whitened bell-bow,[5] and pricking up\none snow-covered ear as we went by.\n\nAfter we had gone still another, half-hour, the driver once more turned\nto me,--\n\n"Well, what do you think, b\xc3\xa1rin? Are we getting along well?"\n\n"I don\'t know," I said.\n\n"Before, the wind blew in our faces, but now we go right along with it.\nNo, we sha\'n\'t get there: we are off the track," he said in conclusion,\nwith perfect equanimity.\n\nIt was evident, that, though he was very timid, yet, as "death in\ncompany with others is pleasant," he was perfectly content to die now\nthat there were a number of us, and he was not obliged to take the\nlead, and be responsible. He coolly made observations on the mistakes\nof the head driver, as though it were not of the least consequence\nto himself. In fact, I had noticed that sometimes the front tro\xc3\xafka\nappeared on my right, and again on my left. It seemed to me, too, that\nwe were making a circle in very small space. However, it might be that\nit was an ocular deception, just as sometimes it seemed as if the front\ntro\xc3\xafka were climbing up a mountain or were going along a slope or down\na mountain, even when the steppe was everywhere perfectly level.\n\nAfter we had gone on a little while longer, I saw, as it seemed to me,\nat a distance, on the very horizon, a long black, moving line; but it\nquickly became plain to me that it was the same baggage-train which\nwe had passed. In exactly the same way, the snow covered the creaking\nwheels, several of which did not turn; in exactly the same way, the men\nwere sleeping under the matted tops; and likewise the piebald leader,\nswelling out his nostrils, snuffed out the road, and pricked back his\nears.\n\n"See, we\'ve gone round in a circle; we\'ve gone round in a circle!\nHere\'s the same baggage-train again!" exclaimed my driver in a\ndiscontented tone. "The cou_l_ier\'s horses are good ones, so it makes\nno difference to him, even if he does go on a wild-goose chase. But\nours will get tired out if we have to spend the whole night here."\n\nHe had an attack of coughing.\n\n"Should we go back, b\xc3\xa1rin, owing to the mistake?"\n\n"No! Why? We shall come out somewhere."\n\n"Come out where? We shall have to spend the night in the steppe. How\nit\'s snowing!... Great heavens!"[6]\n\nAlthough it was clear to me that the head driver had lost both the\nroad and the direction, and yet was not hunting for the road, but was\nsinging at the top of his voice, and letting his horses take their own\nspeed; and so I did not like to part company from them.\n\n"Follow them," said I.\n\nThe yamshch\xc3\xadk drove on, but followed them less willingly than before,\nand no longer had any thing to say to me.\n\n\n[Footnote 4: _gospodi-b\xc3\xa1tiushka._]\n\n[Footnote 5: _dug\xc3\xa1,_ the distinctive part of the Russian harness,\nrising high above the horse, and carrying the bells.]\n\n[Footnote 6: _gospodi-b\xc3\xa1tiushka._]\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nThe storm became more and more violent, and the snow fell dry and fine;\nit seemed as if we were in danger of freezing. My nose and cheeks began\nto tingle; more frequently the draught of cold air insinuated itself\nunder my furs, and it became necessary to bundle up warmer. Sometimes\nthe sledges bumped on the bare, icy crust from which the snow had been\nblown away. As I had already gone six hundred versts without sleeping\nunder roof, and though I felt great interest in the outcome of our\nwanderings, my eyes closed in spite of me, and I drowsed. Once when I\nopened my eyes, I was struck, as it seemed to me at the first moment,\nby a bright light, gleaming over the white plain: the horizon widened\nconsiderably, the lowering black sky suddenly lifted up on all sides,\nthe white slanting lines of the falling snow became visible, the shapes\nof the head troikas stood out clearly; and when I looked up, it seemed\nto me at the first moment that the clouds had scattered, and that only\nthe falling snow veiled the stars. At the moment that I awoke from\nmy drowse, the moon came out, and cast through the tenuous clouds\nand the falling snow her cold bright beams. I saw clearly my sledge,\nhorses, driver, and the three troikas, ploughing on in front: the\nfirst, the courier\'s, in which still sat on the box the one yamshch\xc3\xadk\ndriving at a hard trot; the second, in which rode the two drivers,\nwho let the horses go at their own pace, and had made a shelter out\nof a camel\'s-hair coat[7] behind which they still smoked their pipes\nas could be seen by the sparks glowing in their direction; and the\nthird, in which no one was visible, for the yamshch\xc3\xadk was comfortably\nsleeping in the middle. The leading driver, however, while I was\nnapping had several times halted his horses, and attempted to find\nthe road. Then while we stopped the howling of the wind became more\naudible, and the monstrous heaps of snow piling through the atmosphere\nseemed more tremendous. By the aid of the moonlight which made its\nway through the storm, I could see the driver\'s short figure, whip in\nhand, examining the snow before him, moving back and forth in the misty\nlight, again coming back to the sledge, and springing sidewise on the\nseat; and then again I heard above the monotonous whistling of the\nwind, the comfortable, clear jingling and melody of the bells. When the\nhead driver crept out to find the marks of the road or the hayricks,\neach time was heard the lively, self-confident voice of one of the\nyamshch\xc3\xadks in the second sledge shouting, "Hey, Ignashka![8] you turned\noff too much to the left. Strike off to the right into the storm." Or,\n"Why are you going round in a circle? keep straight ahead as the snow\nflies. Follow the snow, then you\'ll hit it." Or, "Take the right, take\nthe right, old man.[9] There\'s something black, it must be a post." Or,\n"What are you getting lost for? why are you getting lost? Unhitch the\npiebald horse, and let him find the road for you. He\'ll do it every\ntime. That would be the best way."\n\nThe man who was so free with his advice not only did not offer to\nunhitch his off-horse, or go himself across the snow to hunt for the\nroad, but did not even put his nose outside of his shelter-coat; and\nwhen Ignashka the leader, in reply to one of his proffers of advice,\nshouted to him to come and take the forward place since he knew the\nroad so well, the mentor replied that when he came to drive a courier\'s\nsledge, then he would take the lead, and never once miss the road. "But\nour horses wouldn\'t go straight through a snowdrift," he shouted: "they\nain\'t the right kind."\n\n"Then don\'t you worry yourselves," replied Ignashka, gayly whistling to\nhis horses.\n\nThe yamshch\xc3\xadk who sat in the same sledge with the mentor said nothing\nat all to Ignashka, and paid no attention to the difficulty, though he\nwas not yet asleep, as I concluded by his pipe which still glowed, and\nbecause, when we halted, I heard his measured voice in uninterrupted\nflow. He was telling a story. Once only, when Ignashka for the sixth or\nseventh time came to a stop, it seemed to vex him because his comfort\nin travelling was disturbed, and he shouted,--\n\n"Stopping again? He\'s missing the road on purpose. Call this a\nsnowstorm! The surveyor himself could not find the road! he would let\nthe horses find it. We shall freeze to death here; just let him go on\nregardless!"\n\n"What! Don\'t you know a poshtellion froze to death last winter?"\nshouted my driver.\n\nAll this time the driver of the third tro\xc3\xafka had not been heard from.\nBut once while we were stopping, the mentor shouted, "Filipp! ha!\nFilipp!" and not getting any response remarked,--\n\n"Can he have frozen to death? Ignashka, you go and look."\n\nIgnashka, who was responsible for all, went to his sledge, and began to\nshake the sleeper.\n\n"See what drink has done for him! Tell us if you are frozen to death!"\nsaid he, shaking him.\n\nThe sleeper grunted a little, and then began to scold.\n\n"Live enough, fellows!" said Ignashka, and again started ahead, and\nonce more we drove on; and with such rapidity that the little brown\noff-horse, in my three-span, which was constantly whipping himself with\nhis tail, did not once interrupt his awkward gallop.\n\n\n[Footnote 7: _army\xc3\xa1k._]\n\n[Footnote 8: diminished diminutive of Ignat.]\n\n[Footnote 9: _bratets tui mo\xc3\xaf_; literally, "thou brother mine."]\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nIt was already about midnight, I judge, when the little old man and\nVas\xc3\xadli, who had gone in search of the runaway horses, rejoined us. They\nhad caught the horses, and had now overtaken us; but how in the world\nthey had accomplished this in the thick, blinding snowstorm, in the\nmidst of the bare steppe, was more than I could comprehend. The little\nold man, with his elbows and legs flying, came trotting up on the\nshaft-horse (the two other horses he had caught by the collars; it was\nimpossible to lead them in the snowstorm). When they had caught up with\nme, he began to scold at my driver.\n\n"You see, you cross-eyed devil! you"--\n\n"O Uncle Mitritch,"[10] cried the talkative fellow in the second\nsledge, "you alive? Come along where we are!"\n\nThe old man did not answer him, but continued to scold. When he had\nsatisfied himself, he rejoined the second sledge.\n\n"Get em all?" was asked him.\n\n"Why, of course we did."\n\nAnd his small figure leaped up and down on the horse\'s back as he\nwent off at full trot; then he sprang down into the snow, and without\nstopping caught up with the sledge, and sat in it with his legs\nhanging over the side. The tall Vas\xc3\xadli, just as before, took his place\nin perfect silence in the front sledge with Ignashka; and then the two\nbegan to look for the road together.\n\n"What a spitfire! Great heavens!" muttered my driver.\n\nFor a long time after this we drove on without stopping, over the white\nwaste, in the cold, pellucid, and wavering light of the snowstorm. When\nI opened my eyes, there before me rose the same clumsy, snow-covered\ncap; the same low _dug\xc3\xa1_ or bell-bow, under which, between the leathern\nreins tightly stretched, there moved always at the same distance the\nhead of the shaft-horse with the black mane blown to one side by the\nwind. And I could see, above his back, the brown off-horse on the\nright, with his short braided tail, and the whiffletree sometimes\nknocking against the dasher of the sleigh. If I looked below, then I\nsaw the scurrying snow stirred up by the runners, and constantly tossed\nand borne by the wind to one side. In front of me, always at the same\ndistance, glided the other tro\xc3\xafkas. To left and right, all was white\nand bewildering. Vainly the eye sought for any new object: neither\nverst-post, nor hayrick, nor fence was to be seen; nothing at all.\nEverywhere, all was white, white and fluctuating. Now the horizon seems\nto be indistinguishably distant, then it comes down within two steps\non every side; now suddenly a high white wall grows up on the right,\nand accompanies the course of the sledges, then it suddenly vanishes,\nand grows up in front, only to glide on in advance, farther and farther\naway, and disappear again.\n\nAs I look up, it seems light. At the first moment, I imagine that\nthrough the mist I see the stars; but the stars, as I gaze, flee into\ndeeper and deeper depths, and I see only the snow falling into face\nand eyes, and the collar of my fur coat;[11] the sky has everywhere\none tone of light, one tone of white,--colorless, monotonous, and\nconstantly shifting. The wind seems to vary: at one moment it blows\ninto my face, and flings the snow into my eyes; the next it goes to one\nside, and peevishly tosses the collar of my shuba over my head, and\ninsultingly slaps me in the face with it; then it finds some crevice\nbehind, and plays a tune upon it. I hear the soft, unceasing crunching\nof the hoofs and the runners on the snow, and the muffled tinkling of\nthe bells, as we speed over the deep snow. Only occasionally when we\ndrive against the wind, and glide over the bare frozen crust, I can\nclearly distinguish Ignat\'s energetic whistling, and the full chords\nof the chime, with the resounding jarring fifth; and these sounds\nbreak suddenly and comfortingly upon the melancholy character of the\ndesert; and then again rings monotonously, with unendurable fidelity of\nexecution, the whole of that motive which involuntarily coincides with\nmy thoughts.\n\nOne of my feet began to feel cold, and when I turned round so as to\nprotect it better, the snow which covered my collar and my cap sifted\ndown my neck, and made me shiver; but still I was, for the most,\ncomfortable in my warm shuba, and drowsiness overcame me.\n\n\n[Footnote 10: Condensed form for Dmitriy\xc3\xa9vitch, "son of Dmitri." The\npeasants often call each other by the patronymic.]\n\n[Footnote 11: _shuba._]\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nThings remembered and things conceived mixed and mingled with wonderful\nquickness in my imagination.\n\n"The mentor who is always shouting from the second sledge, what kind of\na man must he be? Probably red-haired, thick-set, with short legs, a\nman somewhat like Fe\xc3\xb3dor Fil\xc3\xadppuitch our old butler," is what I say to\nmyself.\n\nAnd here I see the staircase of our great house, and five of the\nhouse-servants who with towels, with heavy steps, carry the pianoforte\nfrom the L; I see Fe\xc3\xb3dor Fil\xc3\xadppuitch with the sleeves of his nankeen\ncoat tucked up, carrying one of the pedals, and going in advance,\nunbolting the door, taking hold of the door-knob here, there pushing a\nlittle, now crawling under the legs; he is here, there, and everywhere,\ncrying with an anxious voice continually, "Look out, take more\nweight, you there in front! Be careful, you there at the tail-end!\nUp--up--up--don\'t hit the door. There, there!"\n\n"Excuse me, Fe\xc3\xb3dor Fil\xc3\xadppuitch! There ain\'t enough of us," says the\ngardener timidly, crushed up against the balustrade, and all red with\nexertion, lifting one end of the grand with all his remaining strength.\nBut Fe\xc3\xb3dor Fil\xc3\xadppuitch does not hold his peace.\n\n"And what does it mean?" I ask myself. "Does he think that he is of any\nuse, that he is indispensable for the work in hand? or is he simply\nglad that God has given him this self-confident persuasive eloquence,\nand takes enjoyment in squandering it?"\n\nAnd I somehow see the pond, the weary servants, who, up to their\nknees in the water, drag the heavy net; and again Fe\xc3\xb3dor Fil\xc3\xadppuitch,\nshouting to everybody, walking up and down on the bank, and only now\nand then venturing to the brink, taking with his hand the golden carp,\nand letting the dirty water run out from his watering-pot, so as to\nfill it up with fresh.\n\nBut here it is midday, in the month of July. Across the newly mown turf\nof the lawn, under the burning perpendicular rays of the sun, I seem to\nbe going somewhere. I am still very young; I am free from yearnings,\nfree from desires. I am going to the pond, to my own favorite spot\nbetween the rose-bushes and the birch-tree alley; and I shall lie down\nand nap. Keen is the sensation that I have, as I lie down, and look\nacross the red thorny stems of the rose-bushes upon the dark ground\nwith its dry grass and on the gleaming bright-blue mirror of the\npond. It is a sensation of a peculiarly simple self-contentment and\nmelancholy. All around me is so lovely, and this loveliness has such a\npowerful effect upon me, that it seems to me as if I myself were good;\nand the one thing that vexes me is, that no one is there to admire me.\n\nIt is hot. I try to go to sleep for comfort\'s sake; but the flies,\nthe unendurable flies, even here, give me no rest. They begin to\nswarm around me, and obstinately, insolently as it were, heavy as\ncherry-stones, jump from my forehead to my hands. A bee buzzes near me\nin the sunbeam. Yellow-winged butterflies fly wearily from flower to\nflower.\n\nI gaze up. It pains my eyes. The sun shines too bright through the\nlight foliage of the bushy birch-tree, gracefully waving its branches\nhigh above my head, and it grows hotter still. I cover my face with my\nhandkerchief. It becomes stifling; and the flies seem to stick to my\nhands, on which the perspiration stands. In the rose-bush the sparrows\ntwitter under the thick leaves. One hops to the ground almost within my\nreach, makes two or three feints to peck energetically at the ground,\nand after making the little twigs crackle, and chirping gayly, flies\naway from the bushes; another also hops to the ground, wags his little\ntail, looks around, and, like an arrow, flies off twittering after\nthe first. At the pond are heard the blows of the pounder on the wet\nclothes; and the noise re-echoes, and is carried far away, down along\nthe shore. I hear laughter and talking, and the splashing of bathers.\nThe breath of the wind sweeps the tops of the birches far above my\nhead, and bends them down again. I hear it moving the grass, and now\nthe leaves of the rose-bushes toss and rustle on their stems. And now,\nlifting the corner of my handkerchief, it tickles my sweaty face, and\npours in upon me in a cooling current. Through the opening where the\nhandkerchief is lifted a fly finds his way, and timidly buzzes around\nmy moist mouth. A dry twig begins to make itself felt under my back.\nNo: it becomes unendurable; I must get it out. But now, around the\nclump of bushes, I hear the sound of footsteps, and the frightened\nvoice of a woman:--\n\n"Mercy on me![12] what\'s to be done? And no man anywhere!"\n\n"What\'s the matter?" I ask, running out into the sun, as a\nserving-woman, screaming, hurries past me. She merely glances at\nme, wrings her hands, and hurries along faster. And here comes also\nthe seventy-year-old Matry\xc3\xb3na, holding her handkerchief to her head,\nwith her hair all in disorder, and hopping along with her lame leg\nin woollen stockings. Two girls come running, hand in hand; and a\nten-year-old boy in his father\'s jacket runs behind, clinging to the\nlinen petticoat of one of them.\n\n"What has happened?" I ask of them.\n\n"A muzh\xc3\xadk drowned!"\n\n"Where?"\n\n"In the pond."\n\n"Who is he? one of ours?"\n\n"No, a tramp."\n\nThe coachman Iv\xc3\xa1n, bustling about in his big boots over the mown grass,\nand the fat overseer[13] Yakof, all out of breath, come hurrying to the\npond; and I follow after them.\n\nI experience the feeling which says to me, "Now jump in, and pull the\nmuzh\xc3\xadk out, and save him; and all will admire you," which was exactly\nwhat I wanted.\n\n"Where is he? where?" I asked of the throng of domestics gathered on\nthe shore.\n\n"Over there in the deepest part, on the other shore, almost at the\nbaths," says the laundress, stowing away the wet linen on her yoke....\n"I see him dive; there he comes up again, then he sinks a second time,\nand comes up again, and then he cries, \'I\'m drowning, help!\' And then\nhe goes down again--and then a lot of bubbles. And while I am looking\non, the muzh\xc3\xadk gets drowned. And so I give the alarm: \'Help! a muzh\xc3\xadk\nis drowning!\'"\n\nAnd the laundress, lifting the yoke upon her shoulder, turning to one\nside, goes along the narrow footpath away from the pond.\n\n"See! what a shame," says Yakof Iv\xc3\xa1nof the overseer, in a despairing\nvoice; "now there\'ll be a rumpus with the police court[14]--we\'ll have\nenough of it."\n\nOne muzh\xc3\xadk with a scythe makes his way through the throng of peasant\nwomen, children, and old men gathered round the shore, and, hanging the\nscythe on the limb of a willow, leisurely takes off his clothes.\n\n"Where was it? where was he drowned?" I keep asking, having still the\ndesire to jump in, and do something extraordinary.\n\nThey point out to me the smooth surface of the pond, which is now and\nthen just ruffled by the puffs of the breeze. It is incomprehensible\nhow he came to drown; for the water lies so smooth, beautiful and calm\nabove him, shining golden in the midday sun, and it seems to me that\nI could not do any thing or surprise any one, the more as I am a very\npoor swimmer; but the muzh\xc3\xadk is now pulling his shirt over his head,\nand instantly throws himself into the water. All look at him with hope\nand anxiety. After going into the water up to his neck, the muzh\xc3\xadk\nturns back, and puts on his shirt again: he knows not how to swim.\n\nPeople keep coming down to the shore; the throng grows larger and\nlarger; the women cling to each other: but no one brings any help.\nThose who have just come, offer advice, and groan; fear and despair are\nstamped on all faces. Of those who had come first, some have sat down,\nor stand wearily on the grass, others have gone back to their work. The\nold Matry\xc3\xb3na asks her daughter whether she shut the oven-door. The\nsmall boy in his father\'s jacket industriously flings stones into the\nwater.\n\nAnd now from the house down the hill comes Trezorka, the butler\'s dog,\nbarking, and looking at the stupid people. And lo! there is Fe\xc3\xb3dor\'s\ntall figure hurrying from the hill-top, and shouting something as he\ncomes out from behind the rose-bushes.\n\n"What are you standing there for?" he shouts, taking off his coat as\nhe runs. "A man drowning, and there you are standing around! Give us a\nrope."\n\nAll look at Fe\xc3\xb3dor with hope and fear while he, leaning his hand on the\nshoulder of one of the men-servants, pries off his left boot with the\ntoe of the right.\n\n"There it was, where the people are standing, there at the right of the\nwillows, Fe\xc3\xb3dor Fil\xc3\xadppuitch, right there," says some one to him.\n\n"I know it," he replies; and knitting his brows; probably as a rebuke\nto the manifestations of modesty visible among the women, he takes off\nhis shirt and baptismal cross, handing them to the gardener-boy who\nstands officiously near him, and then stepping energetically across the\nmown grass comes to the pond.\n\nTrezorka, unable to explain the reason for his master\'s rapid motions,\nstands irresolute near the crowd, and noisily eats a few grass-blades\non the shore, then looks questioningly at his master, and suddenly with\na joyous bark plunges after him into the water. At first nothing can be\nseen except foam, and splashing water, which reached even to us. But\nsoon the butler, gracefully spreading his arms in long strokes, and\nwith regular motion lifting and sinking his back, swims across to the\nother shore. Trezorka, however, gurgling in the water, hastily returns,\nshakes himself near the crowd, and rolls over on his back upon the\nshore.\n\nWhile the butler is swimming to the other side, two coachmen hasten to\nthe willows with a net fastened to a stake. The butler for some reason\nlifts up his hands, dives once, twice, three times, each time spewing\nfrom his mouth a stream of water, gracefully shaking his long hair,\nand paying no heed to the questions which are showered upon him from\nall sides. At last he comes to the shore, and, so far as I can see,\narranges for the disposition of the net.\n\nThey haul out the net, but it contains nothing except slime and a few\nsmall carp flopping in it. They have just cast the net once more as I\nreach that side.\n\nThe voice of the butler giving directions, the water dripping from the\nwet rope, and the sighs of dismay, alone break the silence. The wet\nrope stretches to the right wing, covers up more and more of the grass,\nslowly emerges farther and farther out of the water.\n\n"Now pull all together, friends, once more!" cries the butler\'s voice.\nThe net appears, dripping with water.\n\n"There\'s something! it comes heavy, fellows," says some one\'s voice.\n\nAnd here the wings with two or three carp flapping in them, wetting and\ncrushing down the grass, are drawn to shore. And through the delicate\nstrata of the agitated depths of the waters, something white gleams in\nthe tightly stretched net. Not loud, but plainly audible amid the dead\nsilence, a sigh of horror passes over the throng.\n\n"Pull it up on the dry land! pull it up, friends!" says the butler\'s\nresolute voice; and the drowned man is pulled up across the mown\nburdocks and other weeds, to the shelter of the willows.\n\nAnd here I see my good old auntie in her silk dress. I see her lilac\nsunshade with its fringe,--which somehow is incongruous with this\npicture of death terrible in its very simplicity,--and her face ready\nthis moment to be convulsed with sobs. I realize the disappointment\nexpressed on her face, because it is impossible to use the arnica; and\nI recall the sickening melancholy feeling that I have when she says\nwith the simple egoism of love, "Come, my dear. Ah! how terrible this\nis! And here you always go in swimming by yourself."\n\nI remember how bright and hot the sun shines on the dry ground,\ncrumpling under the feet; how it gleams on the mirror of the pond;\nhow the plump carp flap on the bank; how the schools of fish stir\nthe smooth surface in the middle of the pond; how high in the air a\nhawk hangs, watching the ducklings which, quacking and spattering,\nswim through the reeds toward the centre; how the white tumulous\nthunder-clouds gather on the horizon; how the mud, brought up by the\nnet, is scattered over the bank; and how, as I come to the dike, I\nagain hear the blows of the clothes-pounders at work along the pond.\n\nBut the clothes-pounder has a ringing sound; two clothes-pounders, as\nit were, ring together, making a chord; and this sound torments, pains\nme, the more as I know that this clothes-pounder is a bell, and Fe\xc3\xb3dor\nFil\xc3\xadppuitch does not cease to ring it. And this clothes-pounder, like\nan instrument of torture, squeezes my leg, which is freezing.--I fall\ninto deep sleep.\n\nI was waked by what seemed to me our very rapid progress, and by two\nvoices speaking close to me.\n\n"Say, Ignat, Ignat," says the voice of my driver. "You take my\npassenger; you\'ve got to go anyway; it\'s only wasted labor for me: you\ntake him."\n\nIgnat\'s voice near me replies, "What fun would it be for me to answer\nfor a passenger?... Will you treat me to a half-pint of brandy?"\n\n"Now! a half-pint! Call it a glass."\n\n"The idea, a glass!" cries the other voice; "bother my horses for a\nglass of vodka!"\n\nI open my eyes. Still the same unendurable whirling snowflakes dazzling\nme, the same drivers and horses, but next me I see some sledge or\nother. My driver has caught up with Ignat, and for some time we have\nbeen going side by side.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the voice from the other sledge advises\nnot to take less than the half-pint, Ignat suddenly reins, up his\ntro\xc3\xafka.\n\n"Change the things; just your good luck! You\'ll give me the brandy when\nwe meet to-morrow. Have you got much luggage?"\n\nMy driver, with unwonted liveliness, leaps into the snow, makes me a\nbow, and begs me to change into Ignat\'s sledge. I am perfectly willing.\nBut evidently the pious little muzh\xc3\xadk is so delighted that he must\nneeds express to every one his gratefulness and pleasure. He bows to\nme, to Alyoshka, to Ignashka, and thanks us.\n\n"Well, now, thank the Lord! What a scheme this is! Heavens and\nearth![15] we have been going half the night. Don\'t know ourselves\nwhere we are. He will take you, sir;[16] but my horses are all beat\nout."\n\nAnd he transfers the luggage with vigorous activity.\n\nWhen it was moved, I got into the other sledge in spite of the wind\nwhich almost carried me away. The sledge, especially on that side\ntoward which was spread the coat as a protection against the wind, for\nthe two yamshch\xc3\xadks, was quarter buried in the snow; but behind the\ncoat, it was warm and cosey. The little old man was lying with his\nlegs hanging over, and the story-teller was still spinning his yarn:\n"At that very same time when the general in the king\'s name, you know,\ncomes to Marya, you know, in the darkness, at this same time, Marya\nsays to him, \'General, I do not need you, and I cannot love you; and,\nyou know, you are not my lover, but my lover is the prince himself\'--At\nthis very time," he was going on to say; but, catching sight of me, he\nkept silence for a time, and began to puff at his pipe.\n\n"Well, b\xc3\xa1rin, you missed the story, didn\'t you?" said the other, whom I\nhave called the mentor.\n\n"Yes; but you are finely provided for behind here," said I.\n\n"Out of sheer dulness,--have to keep ourselves from thinking."\'\n\n"But, say, don\'t you know where we are now?"\n\nThis question, as it seemed to me, did not please the yamshch\xc3\xadks.\n\n"Who can tell where we are? Maybe we are going to the Kalmucks,"\nreplied the mentor.\n\n"But what are we going to do?" I asked.\n\n"What are we going to do? Well, we are going, and will keep on going,"\nhe said in a fretful tone.\n\n"Well, what will keep us from getting lost? Besides, the horses will\nget tired in the snow. What then?"\n\n"Well, nothing."\n\n"But we may freeze to death."\n\n"Of course we may, because we don\'t see any hayricks just now; but we\nmay come, you know, to the Kalmucks. First thing, we must look at the\nsnow."\n\n"But you aren\'t afraid of freezing to death, are you, b\xc3\xa1rin?" asked the\nlittle old man with quavering voice.\n\nNotwithstanding that he was making sport of me, as it were, it was\nplain that he was trembling all over.\n\n"Yes: it is growing very cold," I replied.\n\n"Ekh! b\xc3\xa1rin! You ought to do like me. No, no: stamp up and down,--that\nwill warm you up."\n\n"Do it the first thing when you get to the sledge," said the mentor.\n\n\n[Footnote 12: _akh, b\xc3\xa1tiushki!_]\n\n[Footnote 13: _prik\xc3\xa1shchik._]\n\n[Footnote 14: _zemski s\xc5\xabt._]\n\n[Footnote 15: _gospodi-b\xc3\xa1tiushka.._]\n\n[Footnote 16: _b\xc3\xa1tiushka-b\xc3\xa1rin._]\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\n"If you please: all ready!" shouted Alyoshka from the front sledge.\n\nThe storm was so violent that only by violent exertion, leaning far\nforward and holding down the folds of my cloak with both hands, was I\nable to make my way through the whirling snow, drifting before the wind\nunder my very feet, over the short distance between me and the sledge.\n_My_ former driver was still on his knees in the middle of the empty\nsledge; but when he saw me going he took off his big cap, the wind\nangrily tossing up his hair, and asked me for a fee. Apparently he did\nnot expect me to give it to him, because my refusal did not affront him\nin the least. He even thanked me, waved his cap, and said, "Well, good\nluck to you, sir!"[17] and picking up the reins, and clucking to the\nhorses, turned from us.\n\nImmediately Ignashka straightened his back, and shouted to his horses.\nAgain the sound of crunching hoofs, voices, bells, took the place of\nthe howling wind which was chiefly audible when we stood still. For a\nquarter of an hour after my transfer I did not sleep, and I diverted my\nmind by contemplating the form of my new driver and horses. Ignashka\nwas youthful in appearance, was constantly jumping up, cracking his\nwhip over the horses, shouting out, changing from one leg to the other,\nand leaning forward to fix the breeching for the shaft-horse, which\nwas always slipping to one side. The man was not tall in stature, but\nwell built as it seemed. Over his unlined sheepskin coat[18] he wore\nan ungirdled cloak, the collar of which was turned back, leaving his\nneck perfectly bare; his boots were of leather, not felt; and he wore\na small cap which he constantly took off and straightened. In all his\nmotions was manifest not only energy, but much more, as it seemed to\nme, the desire to keep his energy alive. Moreover, the farther we\nwent, the more frequently he settled himself on his seat, changed\nthe position of his legs, and addressed himself to Alyoshka and me:\nit seemed to me that he was afraid of losing his spirits. And there\nwas good reason: though the horses were excellent, the road at each\nstep grew heavier and heavier, and it was noticeable that the horses\'\nstrength was flagging. It was already necessary to use the whip; and\nthe shaft-horse, a good big, shaggy animal, stumbled once or twice,\nthough immediately, as if frightened, it sprang forward and tossed\nup its shaggy head almost to the bell itself. The right off-horse,\nwhich I could not help watching, had a long leather breeching adorned\nwith tassels, slipping and sliding to the left, and kept dropping the\ntraces, and required the whip; but, being naturally a good and even\nzealous horse, seemed to be vexed at his own weakness, and angrily\ntossed his head, as if asking to be driven. Indeed, it was terrible to\nsee how, as the storm and cold increased, the horses grew weak, the\nroad became worse; and we really did not know where we were, or where\nwe were going, whether to a station or to any shelter whatsoever. And\nstrange and ridiculous it was to hear the bells jingling so merrily\nand carelessly, and Ignatka shouting so energetically and delightfully\nas though it were a sunny Christmas noon, and we were hurrying to a\nfestival along the village street; and stranger than all it was to\nthink that we were always riding and riding rapidly away from the place\nwhere we had been.\n\nIgnat began to sing some song in a horrible falsetto, but so loud and\nwith such stops, during which he whistled, that it was weird to listen\nto, and made one melancholy.\n\n"Hey-y-y! Why are you splitting your throat, Ignat? Hold on a bit!"\nsaid the voice of the mentor.\n\n"What?"\n\n"Hold o-o-o-o-n!"\n\nIgnat reined up. Again silence only broken by the wailing and whistling\nof the wind, while the snow began to pile up, rustling on the sledge.\nThe mentor drove up to us.\n\n"Well, what is it?"\n\n"Say![19] where are you going?"\n\n"Who knows?"\n\n"Are your feet frozen, that you stamp so?"\n\n"They\'re frozen off."\n\n"Well, you ought to go this way. The way you were going means\nstarvation,--not even a Kalmuck there. Get out, and it will warm your\nlegs."\n\n"All right. Hold the horses--there."\n\nAnd Ignat stumped off in the direction indicated.\n\n"Have to keep looking all the time, have to get out and hunt; then you\nfind the way. But this way\'s a crazy way to go," said the mentor. "See\nhow tired the horses are."\n\nAll the time that Ignat was gone, and it was so long that I actually\nbegan to be afraid that he had lost his way, the mentor kept talking\nto me in a self-confident, easy tone, telling me how it was necessary\nto behave in a snowstorm; how much better it was to unhitch one of the\nhorses, and let her go as God Almighty should direct; how sometimes\nyou can see the stars occasionally; and how, if he had taken the front\nplace, we should have been at the station long before.\n\n"Well, how is it?" he asked, as Ignat came back, ploughing with\ndifficulty knee-deep in snow.\n\n"Not so bad. I found a Kalmuck camp," replied the driver, out of\nbreath. "Still I don\'t know where we are. It must be that we have been\ngoing toward Prolgovsky forest. We must turn to the left."\n\n"Why worry? It must be the camp just behind our station," replied the\nmentor.\n\n"I tell you it isn\'t."\n\n"Well, I\'ve seen it, and so I know. If it isn\'t that, then it\'s\nTamuishevsko\xc3\xa9. You must turn to the right; and soon we\'ll be on the big\nbridge,--eight versts."\n\n"Say what you will, \'tain\'t so. I have seen it," said Ignat angrily.\n\n"Eh! what\'s that? I am a yamshch\xc3\xadk as much as you are."\n\n"Fine yamshch\xc3\xadk! you go ahead, then."\n\n"Why should I go ahead? But I know."\n\nIgnat was evidently angry. Without replying, he climbed to his seat,\nand drove on.\n\n"You see how cold one\'s feet get. No way to warm them," said he to\nAlyoshka, pounding his feet more and more frequently, and brushing and\nshaking off the snow which had got into his boot-legs.\n\nI felt an uncontrollable desire to sleep.\n\n\n[Footnote 17: _Nu, da\xc3\xaf Bog vam, b\xc3\xa1rin._]\n\n[Footnote 18: _polushubka;_ a garment of tanned sheepskin, the wool\ninwards, and reaching to the knees or even the ankles.]\n\n[Footnote 19: _da ch\xc3\xafo!_]\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\n"Can it be that I am going to freeze to death?" I asked myself, as I\ndropped off. "Death, they say, always begins with drowsiness. It\'s much\nbetter to drown than freeze to death, then they would pull me out of\nthe net. However, it makes no difference whether one drowns or freezes\nto death. If only this stake did not stick into my back so, I might\nforget myself."\n\nFor a second I lost consciousness.\n\n"How will all this end?" I suddenly ask myself in thought, for a moment\nopening my eyes, and gazing at the white expanse,--"how will it end?\nIf we don\'t find some hayricks, and the horses get winded, as it seems\nlikely they will be very soon, we shall all freeze to death."\n\nI confess, that, though I was afraid, I had a desire for something\nextraordinarily tragic to happen to us; and this was stronger than\nthe small fear. It seemed to me that it would not be unpleasant if at\nmorning the horses themselves should bring us, half-frozen, to some\nfar-off, unknown village, where some of us might even perish of the\ncold.\n\nAnd while I have this thought, my imagination works with extraordinary\nclearness and rapidity. The horses become weary, the snow grows deeper\nand deeper, and now only the ears and the bell-bow are visible; but\nsuddenly Ignashka appears on horseback, driving his tro\xc3\xafka past us. We\nbeseech him, we shout to him to take us: but the wind carries away our\nvoices; we have no voices left. Ignashka laughs at us, shouts to his\nhorses, whistles, and passes out of our sight in some deep snow-covered\nravine. A little old man climbs upon a horse, flaps his elbows, and\ntries to gallop after him; but he cannot stir from the place. My old\ndriver, with his great cap, throws himself upon him, drags him to the\nground, and tramples him into the snow. "You\'re a wizard!" he cries.\n"You\'re a spitfire. We are all lost on your account." But the little\nold man flings a snowball at his head. He is no longer a little old\nman, but only a hare, and bounds away from us. All the dogs bound after\nhim. The mentor, who is now the butler, tells us to sit around in a\ncircle, that nothing will happen to us if we protect ourselves with\nsnow: it will be warm.\n\nIn fact, it is warm and cosey: our only trouble is thirst. I get out my\ntravelling-case; I offer every one rum and sugar, and drink myself with\ngreat satisfaction. The story-teller spins some yarn about the rainbow,\nand over our heads is a roof of snow and a rainbow.\n\n"Now each of you," I say, "make a chamber in the snow, and go to\nsleep." The snow is soft and warm like wool. I make myself a room, and\nam just going into it; but Fe\xc3\xb3dor Fil\xc3\xadppuitch, who has caught a glimpse\nof my money in my travelling-case, says, "Hold! give me your money,\nyou won\'t need it when you\'re dead," and seizes me by the leg. I hand\nhim the money, asking him only to let me go; but they will not believe\nthat it is all my money, and they are going to kill me. I seize the old\nman\'s hand, and with indescribable pleasure kiss it: the old man\'s hand\nis tender and soft. At first he takes it away from me, but afterwards\nhe lets me have it, and even caresses me with his other hand.\nNevertheless, Fe\xc3\xb3dor Fil\xc3\xadppuitch comes near and threatens me. I hasten\nto my chamber; it is not a chamber, but a long white corridor, and some\none pulls back on my leg. I tear myself away. In the hand of the man\nwho holds me back, remain my trousers and a part of my skin; but I feel\nonly cold and ashamed,--all the more ashamed because my auntie with her\nsunshade, and hom\xc5\x93opathic pellets, comes arm in arm with the drowned\nman to meet me. They smile, but do not understand the signs that I\nmake to them. I fling myself after the sledge; my feet glide over the\nsnow, but the little old man follows after me, flapping his elbows. He\ncomes close to me. But I hear just in front of me two church-bells, and\nI know that I shall be safe when I reach them. The church-bells ring\nnearer and nearer; but the little old man has caught up with me, and\nfalls with his body across my face, so that I can scarcely hear the\nbells. Once more I seize his hand, and begin to kiss it; but the little\nold man is no longer the little old man, but the drowned man, and he\ncries,--\n\n"Ignashka, hold on! here are Akhmet\'s hayricks! just look!"\n\nThat is strange to hear! no, I would rather wake up.\n\nI open my eyes. The wind is flapping the tails of Alyoshka\'s cloak into\nmy face; my knees are uncovered. We are going over the bare crust,\nand the triad of the bells rings pleasantly through the air with its\ndominant fifth.\n\nI look, expecting to see the hayricks; but instead of hayricks, now\nthat my eyes are wide open, I see something like a house with a\nbalcony, and the crenellated walls of a fortress. I feel very little\ninterest in seeing this house and fortress; my desire is much stronger\nto see the white corridor where I had been walking, to hear the sound\nof the church-bells, and to kiss the little old man\'s hand. Again I\nclose my eyes and sleep.\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nI sleep sound. But all the time I can hear the chords of the bells,\nand in my dream I can see a dog barking and jumping after me; then the\norgan, one stop of which I seem to draw out; then the French poem which\nI am composing. Then it seems to me that this triad is some instrument\nof torture with which my right foot is constantly compressed. This was\nso severe that I woke up, and opening my eyes I rubbed my leg. It was\nbeginning to grow numb with cold.\n\nThe night was, as before, light, melancholy, white. The sledge and its\npassengers were still shaken by the same motion; there was Ignashka\nsitting on one side and stamping his feet. There was the off-horse as\nbefore, straining her neck, lifting her feet, as she trotted over the\ndeep snow; the tassel slipping along the reins, and whipping against\nthe horse\'s belly; the head of the shaft-horse, with the waving mane,\nalternately pulling and loosening the reins attached to the bell-bow\nas it nodded up and down. But all this was covered and hidden with\nsnow far more than before. The snow was whirled about in front of us,\nand covered up our runners, and reached above the horses\' knees, and\nfell thick and fast on our collars and caps. The wind blew now from\nthe right, now from the left, and played with the collar and tails of\nIgnashka\'s cloak, the mane of the horses, and howled above the bell-bow\nand the shafts.\n\nIt had become fearfully cold; and I had scarcely lifted my head out\nof my collar ere the frosty dry snow made its way, rustling, into my\neyelids, nose, and mouth, and ran down my neck. Looking around, all was\nwhite, light, and snowy; nothing anywhere except a melancholy light\nand the snow. I felt a sensation of real terror. Alyoshka was sitting\ncross-legged in the very depths of the sledge; his whole back was\ncovered with a thick deposit of snow.\n\nIgnashka still kept up his spirits; he kept constantly pulling at the\nreins, stamping and pounding his feet. The bell also sounded strange.\nThe horses sometimes snorted, but plunged along more quietly, though\nthey stumbled more and more often. Ignashka again sprang up, swung his\nmittens, and began to sing in his clear, strong voice. Not ceasing to\nsing, he stopped the tro\xc3\xafka, tossed the reins on the dasher, and got\nout. The wind howled madly; the snow, as though shovelled down, was\ndashed upon the folds of my furs.\n\nI looked around. The third tro\xc3\xafka was nowhere to be seen (it had\nstopped somewhere). Next the second tro\xc3\xafka, in a mist of snow, could be\nseen the little old man making his way with long strides. Ignashka went\nthree steps from the sledge, sat down in the snow, took off his girdle,\nand began to remove his boots.\n\n"What are you going to do?" I asked.\n\n"Must change my boots: this leg is frozen solid," he replied, and went\non with his work.\n\nIt was cold for me to keep my neck out of my collar to watch what he\nwas doing. I sat straight, looking at the off-horse, which, with legs\nspread, stood feebly switching its snow-covered tail. The thump which\nIgnat gave the sledge as he clambered to his place startled me.\n\n"Well, where are we now?" I asked. "Are we getting anywhere in the\nworld?"\n\n"Don\'t you worry. We shall get there," he replied. "Now my feet are\nthoroughly warm, since I changed them."\n\nAnd he drove on; the bells jingled, the sledge again began to rock, and\nthe wind whistled under the runners, and once more we struggled to swim\nthrough the limitless ocean of snow.\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nI sunk into a sound sleep. When Alyoshka awoke me by punching me in\nthe leg, and I opened my eyes, it was morning. It seemed even colder\nthan it had been during the night. There was nothing to be seen but\nsnow; but a strong dry wind still swept the powdery snow across the\nfield, and especially under the hoofs of the horses, and the runners of\nthe sledge. The sky on the right toward the east was of a deep purple\ncolor, but the bright reddish-orange rays of the sunrise kept growing\nmore and more clearly defined in it; above our heads, between the\nhurrying white clouds, scarcely tinged as yet, gleamed the sickly blue\nof the sky; in the west the clouds were bright, light, and fluctuating.\nEverywhere around, as far as the eye could see, lay the snow, white and\ndeep, in sharply defined strata. Everywhere could be seen gray hillocks\nwhere lay the fine, dry, powdery snow. Nothing was to be seen,--not\neven the shadow of a sledge, nor of a human being, nor of a beast.\nThe outline and color of the driver\'s back, and of the horses, began\nto stand out clear and sharp against the white background. The rim of\nIgnashka\'s dark-blue cap, his collar, his hair, and even his boots,\nwere white. The sledge was perfectly covered. The whole right side and\nthe mane of the brown shaft-horse were plastered with snow. The legs of\nmy off-horse were thick with it up to the knee, and the whole of the\nshaggy right flank had the same sticky covering. The tassel leaped up\nand down in some sort of rhythm, the structure of which it would not be\neasy to represent; and the off-horse also kept to it in her gait: only\nby the gaunt belly rising and sinking, and by the hanging ears, could\nit be seen how tired she was.\n\nOnly one new object attracted the attention: this was a verst-post,\nfrom which the snow had been blown away, leaving it clear to the\nground, and making a perfect mountain on one side; while the wind was\nstill sweeping it across, and drifting it from one side to the other.\n\nIt was odd to me to think that we had gone the whole night without\nchange of horses, not knowing for twelve hours where we were, and not\ncoming to our destination, and yet not really missing the road. Our\nbells seemed to sound more cheerful than ever. Ignat buttoned his coat\nup, and began to shout again. Behind us snorted the horses, and jingled\nthe bells, of the tro\xc3\xafka that carried the little old man and the\nmentor; but the one who was asleep had wandered away from us somewhere\non the steppe.\n\nAfter going half a verst farther, we came upon the fresh, and as yet\nunobliterated, traces of a sledge and tro\xc3\xafka; and occasionally drops of\nblood, caused by the whip on the horses\' side, could be seen.\n\n"That was Filipp. See, he\'s got in ahead of us," said Ignashka.\n\nAnd here appears a little house with a sign, alone by itself, near the\nroad, standing in the midst of the snow which covers it almost to the\nroof. Near the inn stands a tro\xc3\xafka of gray horses, their hair rough\nwith sweat, with wide-spread legs and drooping heads. At the door, the\nsnow is shovelled away, and the shovel is standing in it; but it still\nfalls from the roof, and the roaring wind whirls the snow around.\n\nOut from the door at the sound of our bells comes a big ruddy,\nred-headed driver, with a glass of wine in his hand, and shouts\nsomething. Ignashka turns to me, and asks permission to stop. Then for\nthe first time I fairly see his face.\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nHis features were not dark, dry, and regular, as I had reason to expect\nfrom his hair and build. His face was round, jolly, with a snub nose\nand a big mouth, and clear-shining eyes, blue and round. His cheeks and\nneck were like well-worn cloth. His eyebrows, his long eyelashes, and\nthe beard which evenly covered the lower part of his face, were crusted\nthick with snow, and perfectly white.\n\nThe distance to the station was all of a half-verst, and we stopped.\n\n"Only be quick about it," I said.\n\n"Just a minute," replied Ignashka, springing down from his seat, and\ngoing up to Filipp.\n\n"Let us have it, brother," said he, taking the glass in his right hand;\nand throwing his mitten and whip down on the snow, tipping back his\nhead, he drank down at a gulp the glass of vodka.\n\nThe inn-keeper, who must have been a discharged Cossack, came, with a\nbottle in his hand, out of the door.\n\n"Who have you got there?" he asked.\n\nThe tall Vas\xc3\xadli, a lean, blond muzh\xc3\xadk with a goatee, and the fat\nmentor, with white eyebrows, and a thick white beard framing his ruddy\nface, came up and also drank a glass. The little old man joined the\ngroup of drinkers; but no one offered him any thing, and he went off\nagain to his horses, fastened behind, and began to stroke one of them\non the back and side.\n\nThe little old man was pretty much what I had imagined him to be;\nsmall, ugly, with wrinkled, strongly marked features, a thin little\nbeard, a sharp nose, and worn yellow teeth. He wore a driver\'s cap,\nperfectly new; but his sheepskin jacket[20] was old, soiled with oil,\nand torn on the shoulders and flaps, and did not cover his knees or his\nhempen trousers tucked into his huge felt boots. He himself was bent,\nand frowned all the time, and, with trembling lips and limbs, tramped\naround his sledge in his efforts to keep warm.\n\n"Well, Mitritch, you ought to have a drink; it would warm you up," said\nthe mentor to him.\n\nMitritch gave a start. He arranged the horses\' harness, straightened\nthe bell-bow, and then came to me.\n\n"Say, b\xc3\xa1rin," said he, taking his cap off from his white hair and\nbowing very low, "all night long we have been wandering together; we\nhave found the road. We would seem to deserve a bit of a drink. Isn\'t\nthat so, sir, your eminence?[21] just enough to get warmed," he added\nwith an obsequious smile.\n\nI gave him a quarter-ruble. The inn-keeper brought out a glass of\nvodka, and handed it to the old man. He laid aside his mitten and whip,\nand took the glass in his small, dark hand, bony and somewhat bluish;\nbut strangely enough he could not control his thumb. Before he had\nlifted the glass to his lips, he dropped it in the snow, spilling the\nwine.\n\nAll the drivers burst out laughing.\n\n"See, Mitritch-to is half-frozen like; he can\'t hold his wine."\n\nBut Mitritch was greatly vexed because he had spilt the wine.\n\nThey brought him, however, another glass, and poured it into his mouth.\nHe immediately became jolly, went into the inn, lighted his pipe, began\nto show his yellow worn teeth, and to scold at every word. After they\nhad taken their last drinks, the drivers came back to their troikas,\nand we set off.\n\nThe snow kept growing whiter and brighter, till it made one\'s eyes ache\nto look at it. The orange-colored reddish streaks stretched brighter\nand brighter, higher and higher, across the heavens; now the red circle\nof the sun appeared on the horizon through the bluish clouds; the blue\nsky came out in constantly increasing brilliancy and depth. On the road\naround the station the tracks were clear, distinct, and yellow; in some\nplaces were cradle-holes. In the frosty, bracing atmosphere, there was\na pleasant exhilaration and freshness.\n\nMy tro\xc3\xafka glided along very swiftly. The head of the shaft-horse,\nand the neck with the mane tossing up to the bell-bow, constantly\nmade the same quick, swinging motions under the hunting-bell, the\ntongue of which no longer struck, but scraped around the rim. The\ngood side-horses, in friendly rivalry tugging at the frozen twisted\ntraces, energetically galloped on, the tassels striking against their\nribs and necks. Occasionally the off-horse would plunge into some\ndrift, and kick up the snow, filling the eyes with the fine powder.\nIgnashka kept shouting in his gay tenor. The runners creaked over the\ndry, frosty snow. Behind us, with a loud festival sound, rang the two\nsledge-chimes; and the voices of the drivers, made jolly by wine, could\nbe heard.\n\nI looked back: the gray shaggy side-horses arching their necks,\nregularly puffing out the breath, with their curved bits, galloped over\nthe snow. Filipp was flourishing his whip and adjusting his cap. The\nlittle old man, with his legs hanging out, was reclining as before in\nthe middle of his sledge.\n\nAt the end of two minutes the sledge scraped against the boards of the\nwell-cleared entrance of the station-house; and Ignashka turned to me,\nhis jolly face covered with snow, where his breath had turned to ice,\nand said,--\n\n"Here we are, b\xc3\xa1rin!"\n\n\n[Footnote 20: _polush\xc3\xbabchishka._]\n\n[Footnote 21: _b\xc3\xa1tiushka, v\xc3\xa1she si\xc3\xa1telstvo._]\n\n\n\n\nPOLIKUSHKA.\n\n\n_A STORY._\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\n"As you may please to order, madame. But it would be too bad to send\nany of the Dutlofs. They are all, without exception, good boys; but if\nyou don\'t take one of the house-servants[1] you will have to send one\nof them without fail," said the overseer; "and now all point to them.\nHowever, as you wish."\n\nAnd he placed his right hand on his left, holding them both over his\nstomach, tipped his head on one side, sucked in his thin lips, almost\nsmacking them, turned away his eyes, and held his peace, with the\nevident intention of holding it long, and of listening without reply\nto all the nonsense which the mistress might say to him in this regard.\n\nThe overseer had formerly been one of the household servants, and now,\nthis autumn evening, he was holding conference with his mistress, and\nwas standing before her, clean-shaven, in his long coat, the special\ndress of the overseer. The conference as the mistress understood it was\nto be devoted to reckoning the profits and losses of the past season,\nand in making arrangements for the one to come. As Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch\nthe overseer understood it, the conference consisted of the rite of\nstanding in a corner firmly on his two feet, set wide apart, with his\nface turned to the sofa, listening to all the good lady\'s unending and\naimless babble, and leading her by various expedients to the point of\nsaying hastily and impatiently, "Very good, very good," to all his\nsuggestions.\n\nThe point at issue just at present was the conscription. Three soldiers\nhad to be sent from Pokrovsko\xc3\xa9. Two were unquestionably named by\nProvidence itself, with a due regard for family, moral, and economical\nconditions. Concerning them there could be neither hesitation nor\nquarrel on the part of the Commune,[2] or the lady of the manor, or the\npeople in general.\n\nThe third was harder to decide upon. The overseer wanted to avoid\nsending any of the three Dutlofs, and proposed Polikushka, a servant\nwho had a family and a very bad reputation, having more than once\nbeen convicted of stealing corn, reins, and hay; but the mistress,\nwho had often caressed Polikushka\'s ragged children, and by means of\nevangelical teachings had improved his morals, did not wish to let him\ngo. At the same time she had no ill-will against the Dutlofs, whom\nshe did not know and had never seen. And so she could not come to any\ndecision at all, and the overseer hadn\'t the courage to explain to her\nexplicitly that if Polikushka did not go Dutlof would have to go.\n\n"Well, I don\'t wish to cause the Dutlofs any unhappiness," she said\nwith feeling.\n\n"If you don\'t want them to go, then pay three hundred rubles for a\nsubstitute," was the reply that he should have made her; but his\ndiplomacy was not equal to such an emergency.\n\nAnd so Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch straightened himself up calmly, even leaned\nslightly on the door-post, and with a certain obsequiousness in his\nface watched how his mistress moved her lips, and how the shadow of\nthe ruching on her head-dress moved up and down on the wall under the\npicture. But he did not find it necessary to penetrate the meaning\nof her words. She spoke long and rapidly. His ears were moved by the\nconvulsion of a yawn, but he adroitly changed it into a cough, which he\nhid with his hand, making a hypocritical noise.\n\nNot long ago I saw Lord Palmerston sitting with his hat on at the time\nwhen he was a member of the opposition, and destroyed the ministry,\nand, suddenly rising, replied in a three-hours\' speech to all the\npoints of his opponent. I saw that, and was not filled with amazement,\nbecause something not unlike it I had seen a thousand times in the\ndealings of Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch with his mistress. Either because he\nwas afraid of going to sleep, or because it seemed to him that she had\nalready gone to great lengths, he shifted the weight of his body from\nhis left leg to his right, and began with the sacramental introduction\nas he always began:--\n\n"As you please, my lady--only--only--the Commune is to meet at my\noffice, and it must be decided. In the requisition it says that\nPokrovsko\xc3\xa9 must send a recruit to the city. And out of all the serfs,\nthey point to the Dutlofs, and to no one else. But the Commune doesn\'t\ncare for your interests; it\'s all the same to them if we ruin the\nDutlofs.... You see, I know how they have been struggling to get along.\nSince I have had charge, they have been in the depths of poverty. Now\nthat the old man is just about to have his young nephew\'s help, we\'ve\ngot to ruin them. But I, you will please take notice, am working as\nmuch for your interest as my own. \'Tis too bad, my lady, that you\nshould set your mind on it so. They are no kith or kin of mine, and I\nhave had nothing from them." ...\n\n"Oh, I didn\'t think, Y\xc3\xa9gor," interrupted the lady, and immediately she\nfelt convinced that he had been bribed by the Dutlofs.\n\n"And they\'ve got the best farm in all Pokrovsko\xc3\xa9; God-fearing,\nwork-loving muzh\xc3\xadks. The old man has been an elder in the church[3] for\nthirty years. He doesn\'t drink wine, nor use bad language, and he\'s a\nchurch-goer. [The overseer knew how to be plausible.] And chief of all,\nI will tell you, he has only two sons, and the other one\'s a nephew.\nThe Commune make the decree; but, according to the existing rule, it\nwould be necessary for a man with two to have a special vote. Others\nwho have had three sons have given them farms of their own, and come to\nwretchedness; but these people are acting right, and this is the way\ntheir virtue is rewarded."\n\nThe lady did not understand this at all,--did not understand what he\nmeant by "special vote," and "virtue." She heard only sounds, and she\nlooked at the nankeen buttons on the overseer\'s coat: the upper button\nhe rarely fastened, so that it was on tight; but the strain had come\nupon the middle one, and it hung by a thread, so that it would soon\nneed to be sewed on again. But, as everybody knows, it is absolutely\nunnecessary in a business conversation for you to understand what is\nsaid, but it is necessary only to bear in mind what you yourself wish\nto say. And the lady acted on this principle.\n\n"Why aren\'t you willing to understand, Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikhailov\xc3\xaftch?" said she.\n"I am sure I don\'t wish any of the Dutlofs to go as a soldier. I should\nthink, that, as well as you know me, you might feel assured that I\nwould do every thing to help my people, and that I do not wish them to\nbe unhappy. You know that I am ready to sacrifice every thing to avoid\nthis wretched necessity, and keep both of the men from going. [I know\nnot whether it came into the overseer\'s head, that the avoidance of\nthe wretched necessity did not require the sacrifice of every thing,\nbut merely three hundred rubles; but this thought might have easily\noccurred to him.] One thing I assure you, and that is, we will not let\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf go. When, after that affair of the clock, he confessed to me,\nand wept, and vowed that he would reform, I had a long talk with him;\nand I saw that he was touched, and that he really repented. ["Well,\nshe\'s in for it," thought Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch, and began to gaze at\nthe jam which stood in a glass of water by her side. "Is it orange, or\nlemon? I think it must taste bitter," he said to himself.] Since that\ntime seven months have passed, and he has not been once drunk, and he\nhas behaved admirably. His wife told me that he had become another man.\nAnd now, why do you wish me to punish him, when he has reformed? Yes;\nand wouldn\'t it be inhumane, to send a man who has five children, and\nno one to help him? No, you had better not speak about that, Y\xc3\xa9gor."...\nAnd the lady took a sip from the glass.\n\nY\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch watched the water disappearing down her throat, and\nconsequently his answer was short and dry:--\n\n"Then you order one of the Dutlofs to be sent?"\n\nThe lady clasped her hands.\n\n"Why can\'t you understand me? Do I wish to make Dutlof unhappy? Have\nI any thing against him? God is my witness how ready I am to do\nevery thing for them. [She glanced at the picture in the corner, but\nremembered that it was not a holy picture. "Well, it\'s all the same,\nthat\'s not the point at all," she thought. Again it was strange that it\ndid not occur to her to offer the three hundred rubles!] But what can\nI do about it? Do I know the ways and means? I have no way of knowing.\nWell, I depend upon you; you know my wishes. Do what you can to satisfy\neverybody; but have it legal. What\'s to be done? They are not the only\nones. Troublous times come to all. Only, Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf must not be sent. You\nmust know that that would be terrible for me."\n\nShe would have gone on speaking,--she was so excited,--but just then a\nchambermaid came into the room.\n\n"Is that you, Duniasha?"\n\n"A muzh\xc3\xadk is here, and asks for Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xafluitch; they are waiting\nfor him at the meeting," said Duniasha, and looked angrily at Y\xc3\xa9gor\nMikha\xc3\xaflovitch.\n\n"What an overseer he is!" she said to herself, "stirring up my\nmistress. Now she won\'t get to sleep till two o\'clock again."\n\n"Now go, Y\xc3\xa9gor," said the lady. "Do the best you can."\n\n"I obey. [He now said nothing at all about Dutlof.] But shall I send to\nthe gardener for the money?"\n\n"Hasn\'t Petrushka got back from town."\n\n"Not yet."\n\n"But can\'t Nikola\xc3\xaf go?"\n\n"Papa has the lumbago," said Duniasha.\n\n"Won\'t you have me go to-morrow?" asked the overseer.\n\n"No, you are needed here, Y\xc3\xa9gor." The lady paused to consider. "How\nmuch money?"\n\n"Four hundred and sixty-two rubles."\n\n"Send Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf to me," said the lady, looking resolutely into Y\xc3\xa9gor\'s\nface.\n\nThe overseer not opening his teeth stretched his lips into a sort of\nsmile, but did not alter his expression.\n\n"Very well."\n\n"Send him to me."\n\n"Very well." And Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch went to his office.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Most of the serfs in Russia were attached to the land, and\ncould not be sold apart from It. Others, called _dvor\xc3\xb3vui,_ constituted\nthe class of domestic servants, and plied various trades. Their owners\ngave them monthly rations or a small allowance for rations. Often they\nwere allowed to go to the large cities on _obrok,_ a sort of leave of\nabsence, for which they paid their masters out of their earnings. The\n_b\xc3\xa1rin_ or _b\xc3\xa1ruin\'ya--_that is, the lord or lady of the estate--had\nthe right to excuse any one from the conscription; but unless a\nsubstitute were sent, a sum of money was required. Other things being\nequal, the draft was made first on families where there were three\nor more grown-up men besides the head of the house, the _tro\xc3\xafniki;_\nnext, on the _dvo\xc3\xafniki,_ families where there were two grown-up sons\nor nephews; and last of all, where there was only one. Families where\nseveral generations, and even with collateral branches, lived under one\nroof, were apt to be more prosperous than when the sous scattered, and\ntook separate farms.]\n\n[Footnote 2: _mir_]\n\n[Footnote 3: _st\xc3\xa1rosta tserkovnui,_ a small office, giving the man the\nprivilege of selling candles, etc.]\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, as a man of no consequence, and inclined to be disreputable,\nand moreover as being from another village, had no one to look out for\nhis interests, neither the housekeeper nor the butler, neither the\noverseer nor the housemaid. And his _corner,_ where he lived with his\nwife and five children, was as wretched as it could be. The _corners_\nhad been arranged by the late lamented b\xc3\xa1rin as follows: The hut was\nabout twenty feet long, and built of stone; in the middle stood the\ngreat Russian stove; around it ran a corridor, as the servants called\nit; and in each corner a room was partitioned off by boards. Of course\nthere was not much room, especially in Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s _corner_ which was\nnext the door. The nuptial couch, with quilted counterpane and chintz\npillows; a cradle with a baby in it; a three-legged table which served\nfor cooking, washing, piling up all the household utensils, and as a\nwork-table for Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, who was a horse-doctor; tubs, clothes, hens,\na calf, and the seven members of the household,--occupied the corner;\nand there would mot have been room to move, had it not been that the\ncommon stove offered its share of room (though even this was covered\nwith things and human beings), and that it was possible to get out upon\nthe door-steps. It was not always possible, if you stop to think: in\nOctober it begins to grow cold, and there was only one warm sheep-skin\ngarment for the whole family. And so the young children were obliged\nto get warm by running about, and the older ones by working and taking\nturns in climbing upon the big stove, where the temperature was as\nhigh as ninety degrees. It must have been terrible to live in such\ncircumstances, but they did not find it so: they were able to get along.\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna did the washing and mending for her husband and children;\nshe spun and wove and bleached her linen; she cooked and baked at\nthe common stove, and scolded and quarrelled with her neighbors. The\nmonthly rations sufficed not only for the children, but also for the\nfeed of the cow. The firewood was plentiful, also fodder for the\ncattle; and hay from the stable fell to their share. They had an\noccasional bunch of vegetables. The cow would give them a calf; then\nthey had their hens. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf had charge of the stable: he took care of\nthe young colts, and bled horses and cattle; he cleaned their hoofs, he\ntapped varicose veins, and made a salve of peculiar virtue, and this\nbrought him in some money and provisions. Some of the oats belonging\nto the estate also made their way into his possession: in the village\nthere was a man who regularly once a month, for two small measures,\ngave twenty pounds of mutton.\n\nIt would have been easy for them to get along, had there not been moral\nsuffering. But this suffering was severe for the whole family. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\nhad been from childhood in a stable, in another village. The groom who\nhad charge of him was the worst thief in the neighborhood; the Commune\nbanished him to Siberia. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf soon began to follow this groom\'s\nexample, and thus became from early youth accustomed to these _little\ntricks,_ so that afterward, when he would have been glad to break loose\nfrom the habit, he could not.\n\nHe was young and weak; his father and mother were dead, and his\neducation had been neglected. He liked to get drunk, but he did not\nlike to see things lying round loose: whether it were ropes or saddle,\nlock or coupling-bolt, or any thing even more costly, no matter, it\nfound its way into Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s possession. Everywhere were men who\nwould take these things, and pay for them in wine or money according\nto agreement. Money gained this way comes easy, the people say: no\nlearning is needed, no hard work, nothing; and if you try it once, you\nwon\'t like other work. One thing is, however, not good in such labors:\nhowever cheaply and easily things are acquired in this way, and however\npleasant life becomes, still there is danger that disaffected people\nmay suddenly object to your profession, and cause you tears, and make\nyour life unhappy.\n\nThis was what happened in Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s case. He got married, and God gave\nhim great happiness: his wife, the daughter of a herder, proved to be\na healthy, bright, industrious woman. Their children came in quick\nsuccession. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf had not entirely abandoned his trade, and all went\nwell. Suddenly temptation came to him, and he fell; and it was a mere\ntrifle that caused his fall. He secreted a pair of leather reins that\nbelonged to a muzh\xc3\xadk. He was detected, thrashed, taken to the mistress,\nand afterwards watched. A second time, a third time, he fell. The\npeople began to make complaints. The overseer threatened to send him\nto the army; the lady of the house expostulated; his wife wept, and\nbegan to pine away: in fact, every thing went entirely wrong. As a man,\nhe was kindly, and not naturally bad, but weak; he loved to drink,\nand he had such a strong taste for it, that he could not resist. His\nwife would scold him and even beat him when he came in drunk, but he\nwould weep. "Wretched man that I am," he would say, "what shall I do?\nTear out my eyes. I will swear off, I won\'t do it again." But lo! in a\nmonth\'s time he goes out, gets drunk, and is not seen for two days.\n\n"Where on earth does he get the money to go on sprees?" the people\nasked themselves. His latest escapade was in the matter of the\noffice-clock. In the office there was an old clock hanging on the wall.\nIt had not gone for years. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf got into the office alone when it\nhappened to be unlocked. He took a fancy to the clock, carried it off,\nand disposed of it in town. Not long afterward it happened that the\nshop-keeper, to whom he sold it, came out on some holiday to visit his\ndaughter, who was married to one of the house-servants; and he happened\nto mention the clock. An investigation was made, though it was hardly\nnecessary. The overseer especially disliked Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf. The theft was\ntraced to him. They laid the matter before the lady of the house. The\nlady of the house summoned Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf. He fell at her feet, and, with\ntouching contrition, confessed every thing as his wife had counselled\nhim to do. He accomplished it admirably. The lady began to reason with\nhim. She talked and she talked, she lectured and she lectured, about\nGod and duty and the future life, and about his wife, and about his\nchildren; and she affected him to tears. The lady said,--\n\n"I will forgive you, only promise me that you will never do it again."\n\n"Never in the world. May the earth swallow me, may I be torn in\npieces!" said Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf; and he wept in a touching manner.\n\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf went home, and at home wept all day like a calf, and lay on\nthe stove. From that time forth Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf had conducted himself in a way\nabove reproach. But his life ceased to be happy. The people regarded\nhim as a thief; and now that the hour of conscription had come, all\nfelt that it was a good way to get rid of him.\n\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf was a horse-doctor, as we have already said. How he so suddenly\ndeveloped into a horse-doctor, was a mystery to every one, and to\nhimself most of all. In the stable where he had been with the groom who\nhad been exiled to Siberia, he had fulfilled no other duty than that of\nclearing manure out of the stalls, or occasionally currying the horses,\nand carrying water. It was not there that he could have learned it.\nThen he became a weaver; then he worked in a garden, cleared paths;\nthen he got leave of absence, and became a porter[4] for a merchant.\nBut he could not have got any practice there. But when he was last\nat home, somehow or other, little by little, his reputation began to\nspread for having an extraordinary, if not even supernatural, knowledge\nof the ailments of horses.\n\nHe let blood two or three times; then he tripped up a horse, and made\nan incision in its fetlock; then he asked to have the horse brought\nto a stall, and began to cut her with a needle until the blood came,\nalthough she kicked, and even squealed: and he said that this was\nmeant "to let the blood out from under the hoof." Then he explained to\na muzh\xc3\xadk that it was necessary to bleed the veins in both frogs "for\ngreater comfort," and he began to strike his wooden mallet upon the\nblunt lancet. Then under the side of the dvornik\'s horse he twisted a\nbandage made of a woman\'s kerchief. Finally he began to scatter oil\nof vitriol over the whole wound, wet it from a bottle, and to give\noccasionally something to take internally, as it occurred to him. And\nthe more he tormented and killed the poor horses, the more people\nbelieved in him, and brought him their horses to cure.\n\nI think that it is pot quite seemly of us gentlemen to make sport of\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf. The remedies which he employed to stimulate belief in him\nwere the very same which were efficacious for our fathers, and will\nbe efficacious for us and our children. The muzh\xc3\xadk, as he held down\nthe head of his one mare, which not only constituted his wealth, but\nwas almost a part of his family, and watched, with both confidence and\nterror, Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s face marked by a consequential frown, and his slender\nhands, with the sleeves rolled up, with which he managed always to\npinch the very places that were most tender, and boldly to hack the\nliving body with the secret thought, "Now here\'s to luck," and making\nbelieve that he knew where the blood was, and where the matter, where\nwas the dry and where was the fluid vein, and holding the handkerchief\nof healing or the phial of sulphuric acid,--this muzh\xc3\xadk could not\nimagine such a thing as Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf raising his hand to cut without the\nrequisite knowledge. He himself could not have done such a thing. And,\nas soon as the incision was made, he did not reproach himself because\nhe had hacked unnecessarily.\n\nI don\'t know how it is with you; but I have had experience with a\ndoctor who, at my own request, treated people who were very dear to\nmy heart in almost exactly the same way. The veterinary lancet and\nthe mysterious white phial with corrosive sublimate, and the words,\n"_apoplexy, hemorrhoids, blood-letting, pus,_" and so forth, are\nthey so different from "_nerves, rheumatism, organism,_" and the\nothers? _Wage du zu irren und zu tr\xc3\xa4umen,--_"dare to be in error and\nto dream,"--was said not only to poets, but to doctors and veterinary\nsurgeons.\n\n\n[Footnote 4: _dvornik._]\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nOn that very evening, while the elders had come together at the office\nto settle upon a recruit, and while their voices were heard amid the\nchill darkness of the October night, Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf was sitting upon the\nedge of his bed at the table, and was triturating in a bottle some\nveterinary medicament, the nature of which he himself knew not. It was\na mixture of corrosive sublimate, sulphur, Glauber\'s salts, and grass,\nwhich he was compounding, under some impression that this grass was\ngood for broken wind and other ailments.\n\nThe children were already abed; two on the stove, two on the couch,\none in the cradle, beside which sat Akul\xc3\xadna with her spinning. The\ncandle-end, which remained from some of his mistress\'s that had not\nbeen properly put away, and Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf had taken care of, stood in a\nwooden candlestick on the window; and in order that her husband might\nnot be disturbed in his important task, Akul\xc3\xadna got up to snuff the\ncandle with her fingers. There were conceited fellows who considered\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf as a worthless horse-doctor, and a worthless man. Others--and\nthey were in the majority--considered him worthless as a man, but a\ngreat master of his calling. Akul\xc3\xadna, notwithstanding the fact that\nshe often berated and even beat her husband, considered him beyond a\nperadventure the first horse-doctor and the first man in the world.\n\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf poured into the hollow of his hand some spice. (He did not use\nscales, and he spoke ironically of the Germans who used scales. "This,"\nhe would say, "is not an apothecary-shop.") Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf hefted the spice in\nhis hand, and shook it up; but it seemed to him too little in quantity,\nand, for the tenth time, he added more. "I will put it all in, it will\nhave a better effect," he said to himself. Akul\xc3\xadna quickly looked\nup as she heard the voice of her lord and master, expecting orders;\nbut seeing that it was nothing that concerned her, she shrugged her\nshoulders. "Ho! great chemist! Where did he learn it all?" she thought\nto herself, and again took up her work. The paper from which the spice\nwas taken fell under the table. Akul\xc3\xadna did not let this pass.\n\n"Aniutka!"[5] she cried, "here, your father has dropped something: come\nand pick it up."\n\nAniutka stuck out her slender bare legs from under the dress that\ncovered her, and, like a kitten, crept under the table, and picked up\nthe paper.\n\n"Here it is, papa," said she, and again plunged into the bed with her\ncold feet.\n\n"Stop pushing me," whimpered her younger sister, in a sleepy voice,\nhissing her _s_\'s.\n\n"I\'ll give it to you," said Akul\xc3\xadna, and both heads disappeared under\nthe wrapper.\n\n"If he will pay three silver rubles," muttered Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, shaking the\nbottle, "I will cure his horse. Cheap enough," he added. "I\'ve racked\nmy brains for it. Come now, Akul\xc3\xadna, go and borrow some tobacco of\nNik\xc3\xadta. We will pay it back to-morrow."\n\nAnd Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf drew from his trousers a linden-wood pipe, that had once\nbeen painted, and that had sealing-wax for a mouthpiece, and began to\nput it in order.\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna pushed aside her flax-wheel, and went out without a word of\nreply, though it was a struggle for her. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf opened the cupboard,\nput away his bottle, and applied to his mouth an empty jug. But the\nvodka was all gone. He scowled; but when his wife brought him the\ntobacco, and he had lighted his pipe, and began to smoke, sitting on\nthe couch, his face gleamed with complacency and the pride that a man\nfeels when he has ended his day\'s work.\n\nHe was even thinking how, on the morrow, he would seize the tongue of\na horse, and pour into her mouth that marvellous mixture, or he was\nruminating on the fact of how a man of importance met with no refusals,\nas was proved by Nik\xc3\xadta sending him the tobacco; and the thought was\npleasant to him. Suddenly the door, which swung upon one hinge, was\nflung open; and into the room came a girl from the _upper_ house,--not\nthe second girl, but a small damsel employed to run of errands.\n(Everybody calls the manor-house _upper,_ even though it may be built\non a lower level.) Aksintka, as the damsel was called, always flew like\nlightning; and on this account her arms were not folded, but swung\nlike pendulums, in proportion to the swiftness of her motions, not by\nher side, but in front of her body. Her cheeks were always redder than\nher pink dress; her tongue always ran as swiftly as her legs. She flew\ninto the room, and holding by the stove, for some reason or other, she\nbegan to wave her arms; and as though she wished to utter not less than\ntwo or three words at once, and scarcely stopping to get breath, she\nsuddenly broke out as follows, addressing Akul\xc3\xadna:--\n\n"Our lady bids Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf Ilyitch to come up to the house this\nminute,--she does. [Here she stopped, and drew a long breath.]\nY\xc3\xa9gor Mikh\xc3\xa1ltch was at the house, and talked with our lady about the\n_n_ecruits; and they\'ve took Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf Ilyitch.... Avd\xc3\xb3t\'ya Mikol\xc3\xa1vna\nbids you come up this very minute.... Avd\xc3\xb3t\'ya Mikol\xc3\xa1vna bids you\n[again a long breath] come up this minute."\n\nFor thirty seconds Aksiutka stared at Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, at Akul\xc3\xadna, at the\nchildren, who were asleep under the wrapper; then she seized a\nhazel-nut shell that was rolling around on the stove, and threw it at\nAniutka, and once more repeating, "Come up this minute," flew like\na whirlwind out of the room; and the pendulums, with their wonted\nquickness, outstripped the course of her feet.\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna got up again, and fetched her husband his boots. The boots were\nsoiled and ripped: they had been made for a soldier. She took down from\nthe stove a kaftan, and handed it to him without looking at him.\n\n"Ilyitch, are you going to change your shirt?"\n\n"Nay," said Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf.\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna did not look into his face once while he silently put on his\nboots and coat, and she did well not to look at him. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s face was\npale, his chin trembled, and in his eyes there came that expression of\ndeep and submissive unhappiness, akin to tears, peculiar to weak and\nkindly men who have fallen into sin. He brushed his hair, and was about\nto go. His wife kept him back, and arranged his shirt-band, which hung\nbelow his cloak, and straightened his cap.\n\n"Say, Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf Ilyitch, what does the mistress want of you?" said the\nvoice of the joiner\'s wife on the other side of the partition.\n\nThe joiner\'s wife had, that very morning, been engaged in a warm\ndispute with Akul\xc3\xadna, in regard to a pot of lye which Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s\nchildren had spilt; and, at the first moment, she was glad to hear\nthat Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf was summoned to the mistress. It could not be for any\nthing good. Moreover, she was a sharp, shrewd, and shrewish woman. No\none understood better than she how to use her tongue; at least, so she\nherself thought.\n\n"It must be that they are going to send you to the city to be a\nmerchant," she continued. "I suppose they want to get a trusty man, and\nso will send you. You must sell me then some tea for a quarter, Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\nIlyitch."\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna restrained her tears, and her lips took on an expression of\nbitter anger, as though she would have wound her fingers in the untidy\nhair of that slattern, the joiner\'s wife; but when she glanced at\nher children, and thought that they might be left orphans, and she a\nsoldier\'s widow, she forgot the shrewish joiner\'s wife, covered her\nface with her hands, sat down on the bed, and leaned her head on the\npillow.\n\n"M\xc3\xa1muska, you are squeesing me," cried the little girl who hissed her\ns\'s, and she pulled away her dress from under her mother\'s elbow.\n\n"I wish you were all of you dead! You were born for misfortune," cried\nAkul\xc3\xadna; and she began to walk up and down the _corner,_ wailing, much\nto the delight of the joiner\'s wife, who had not yet forgotten about\nthe lye.\n\n\n[Footnote 5: Peasant diminutive for Anna.]\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nA half-hour passed by. The baby began to cry. Akul\xc3\xadna took him, and\ngave him the breast. She was no longer weeping; but resting her thin,\ntear-stained face on her hand, she fixed her eyes on the flickering\ncandle, and asked herself why she had got married, and why so many\nsoldiers were needed, and, still more, how she might pay back the\njoiner\'s wife.\n\nHer husband\'s steps were heard; she wiped away the traces of the tears,\nand got up to light his way. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf came in with an air of triumph,\nthrew his hat on the bed, drew a long breath, and began to take off his\nclothes.\n\n"Well, what was it? why did she call you?"\n\n"Hm! a good reason! Polikushka is the lowest of men; but, when there is\nsomething needed, who is called on? Polikushka!"\n\n"What is it?"\n\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf did not make haste to reply: he smoked his pipe, and kept\nspitting.\n\n"She wants me to go to the merchant, and get her money."\n\n"Get her money!" repeated Akul\xc3\xadna.\n\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf grinned and nodded.\n\n"How well she knows how to talk! \'You had,\' says she, \'the reputation\nof being untrustworthy, but I have more faith in you than in any one\nelse. [Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf raised his voice so that his neighbors might hear.]\n\'You promised me to reform,\' says she, \'and here is the first proof\nthat I believe in you: go,\' says she, \'to the merchant, get some money\nfor me, and bring it back.\' And says I, \'My lady,\' says I, \'we be all\nyour slaves, and it be our duty to serve you as faithfully as we serve\nGod, and so I feel that I can do every thing for your well-being,\nbecause I owe it to you, and I could not refuse no service; so,\nwhatever you order, that I will perform, because I be your slave.\'\n[He again smiled with that peculiar smile of a man who is weak, but\ngood-natured, and has been guilty of some sin.] \'And so,\' says she,\n\'will you do this faithfully? Do you understand,\' says she, \'that your\nfate depends upon this?\'--\'How can I help comprehending that I can do\nit? People may slander me, and any one may fall into sin; but it would\nbe a moral impossibility for me do any thing contrary to your interest,\nnor even think of it.\' So, you see, I talked to her till my lady was\njust as soft as wax. \'You will be,\' says she, \'my principal man.\' [He\nwas quiet for a moment, and again the same smile played over his face.]\nI know very well how to talk with her. When I used to go on leave of\nabsence, I got practice in talking. Only let me talk with \'em, I make\n\'em just like silk."\n\n"Much money?" asked Akul\xc3\xadna.\n\n"Fifteen hundred rubles," replied Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf carelessly.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n"When do you go?"\n\n"To-morrow, she said. \'Take a horse,\' says she, \'any one you wish, come\nto the office, and God be with you.\'"\n\n"Glory to thee, O Lord!" exclaimed Akul\xc3\xadna, getting up and crossing\nherself. "God be thy help, Ilyitch," she added in a whisper, so as not\nto be heard beyond the partition, and holding him by the sleeve of his\nshirt. "Ilyitch, heed what I say; I will pray Christ the Lord, that you\ngo in safety. Kiss the cross, that you will not take a drop into your\nmouth."\n\n"But of course I am not going to drink, when I have all that money\nwith me!" he said with a snort. "Some one was playing there on the\npiano,--handsomely, my!" he added, after a silence breaking into a\nlaugh. "It must have been the young lady. I was standing right before\nher, near the _shiffonere--_that is, before her ladyship; but the young\nlady was there behind the door, pounding away. She bangs and she bangs\nso harmoniously--like--She just makes it sing, I tell you! I should\nlike to play a little, that\'s a fact. I\'d have liked to gone in just\nfor once. I am just right for such things. To-morrow give me a clean\nshirt."\n\nAnd they went to bed happy.\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nMeantime the office was buzzing with the voices of the muzh\xc3\xadks. It was\nno laughing matter. Almost all the muzh\xc3\xadks were in the meeting; and\nwhile Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikh\xc3\xa1\xc3\xaflovitch was conferring with her ladyship, the men\nput on their hats, more voices began to be heard above the general\nconversation, and the voices became louder.\n\nThe murmur of many voices, occasionally interrupted by some eager,\nheated discourse, filled the air; and this murmur, like the sound of\nthe roaring sea, came to the ears of the lady of the house, who felt at\nhearing it a nervous unrest analogous to the feeling excited by a heavy\nthunder-shower. It was neither terrible nor yet unpleasant to her. It\nseemed to her that the voices kept growing louder and more turbulent,\nand then some one person would make himself heard. "Why should it\nbe impossible to do every thing gently, peaceably, without quarrel,\nwithout noise?" she said, "according to the sweet law of Christianity\nand brotherly love?"\n\nMany voices suddenly were heard together, but louder than all shouted\nFe\xc3\xb3dor R\xc3\xa9zun, the carpenter. He was a man who had two grown sons, and\nhe attacked the Dutlofs. The old man Dutlof spoke in his own defence;\nhe came out in front of the crowd, behind which he had been standing,\nand spreading his arms wide and lifting up his beard spoke so rapidly,\nin a choked voice, that it would have been hard for himself to know\nwhat he was saying. His children and nephews, fine young fellows, stood\nand pressed behind him; and the old man Dutlof reminded one of the one\nwho is the _old hen_ in the game of _Korshun,_[6] or "Hawk." R\xc3\xa9zun was\nthe hawk; and not R\xc3\xa9zun alone, but all those who had two sons, and all\nthe bachelors, almost all the meeting, in fact, united against Dutlof.\nThe trouble lay in this: Dutlofs brother had been sent as a soldier\nthirty years before; and therefore he did not wish to be considered\nas one of those who had three men in the family, but he desired his\nbrother\'s service to be taken into account, and that he should be\nreckoned as one who had two grown assistants, and that the third\nrecruit should be taken from that set.\n\nThere were four families, besides Dutlofs, that had three able-bodied\nmen. But one was the village elder\'s, and his mistress had freed him\nfrom service. From another family, a recruit had been taken at the last\nconscription. From the other two families, two men had been already\nnominated, and one of them had not come to the meeting; but his wife\nstood, heavy at heart, in the very rear, anxiously hoping that somehow\nthe wheel would turn in favor of her happiness. The other of the two\nnominees, the red-haired Rom\xc3\xa1n, in a torn cloak (though he was not\npoor), stood leaning against the door-step, with downcast head; he said\nnothing all the while, but occasionally looked up attentively when any\none spoke louder than usual, and then dropped his head again; and thus\nhis unhappiness was expressed in his whole appearance. The old man,\nSem\'y\xc3\xb3n Dutlof, would have given the impression, even to these who knew\nhim slightly, that he had laid up hundreds and thousands of rubles. He\nwas dignified, God-fearing, substantial; he was, moreover, an elder of\nthe Church. So much the more striking was the chance in which he found\nhimself.\n\nR\xc3\xa9zun the carpenter was, on the contrary, a tall, dark, dissipated\nman, quick to quarrel, and fond of speaking in meetings and in the\nmarket-place, with workmen, merchants, muzh\xc3\xadks, or gentlemen. Now he\nwas calm and sarcastic, and with all the advantage of his stature, all\nthe force of his loud voice, and his oratorical talent, was nagging the\nelder of the church, who was such a slip-shod speaker, and had been\ndriven far out of his path.\n\nThe others who took part in the discussion were as follows: The\nround-faced, young-looking Garaska Kopilof, stocky, with a four-square\nhead, and curly beard; one of the speakers who imitated R\xc3\xa9zun rather\nthan the younger generation, always distinguished for his bitter\nspeech, and already a man of weight in the meeting. Then F\xc3\xa9odor\nMelnitchnui, a tall, yellow, gaunt, round-shouldered muzh\xc3\xadk, also\nyoung, with thin hair and beard, and with small eyes; always prone to\nanger, sour-tempered, ready to see every one\'s bad side, and frequently\nembarrassing the meeting with his abrupt and unexpected questions and\nremarks. Both of these speakers were on R\xc3\xa9zun\'s side. Moreover, two\nchatterers occasionally took part,--one who had a good-natured phiz,\nand a large and bushy red beard; his name was Khrapkof, and he was\nforever saying, "My dearly beloved friend:" and the other, Zhidkof, a\nsmall man, with a bird-like face, who was also in the habit of saying,\n"It follows, my brethren;" he kept turning to all sides, and his words\nwere without rhyme or reason. One of these two took one side, the\nother the other; but no one heeded what they said. There were others\nlike them; but these two kept moving in and out in the crowd, shouted\nmore than anybody else, disturbing the mistress, were listened to less\nthan anybody else, and, being confused by the racket and shouting,\nfound full satisfaction in talking nonsense.\n\nThere were many different characters in this group of peasants: some\nwere morose, some courteous, some indifferent, some disputatious;\nthere were also a few women behind the muzh\xc3\xadks, with sticks. But\nabout all these I will tell some other time, as God shall give. The\nthrong consisted, for the most part, however, of muzh\xc3\xadks, who behaved\nduring the meeting as though it were church, and standing in the rear\ntalked in a whisper about their domestic affairs, exchanging views,\nfor instance, about the best time for beginning to cut their wood, or\nquietly hoped that they soon adjourn the meeting. And then there were\nsome well-to-do men, whose comfort the meeting could not benefit or\ncurtail. To this number belonged Yermil, with his broad, shiny face,\nwhom the muzh\xc3\xadks called "big-belly" because he was rich. To this number\nalso belonged Starostin, on whose face a self-satisfied expression of\npower was habitual: "Say whatever you please among yourselves, but I\nam safe enough. I have four sons, but you won\'t take any of them."\nOccasionally, the opinionated young orators, like Kopilof or R\xc3\xa9zun,\nwould have a fling at them; and they would reply, but calmly and\ndecidedly in the consciousness of their unassailable position.\n\nHowever much Dutlof was like the old hen in the game of "Hawk," it\ncould not be said that his lads were like the chickens. They did not\nhop about nor scream, but stood calmly behind him. The oldest, Ignat,\nwas now thirty years old; the second, Vas\xc3\xadli, was already married, but\nwas not old enough to come under the conscription; the third, Ilyushka,\nthe nephew who had just been married, had a red and white complexion,\nand was dressed in an elegant sheepskin coat (he was a driver[7] by\nprofession); he stood gazing at the people, occasionally scratching the\nback of his head under the cap, as though the affair did not concern\nhim at all any more than if it were the game of "Hawk."\n\n"Because my grandfather went as a soldier," R\xc3\xa9zun was saying, "that\'s\nno reason why I should refuse the lot. Friends, it is no kind of a law\nat all. At the last conscription they took Mikh\xc3\xa9ichef, and his uncle is\nstill in the service."\n\n"Neither your father nor your uncle ever served the Tsar both at once,"\nsaid Dutlof, "and you never served gentlemen nor the Commune; but\nyou\'ve always been a tippler, and your children take after you. It\'s\nimpossible to live with you, and yet you point out other men. But for\nten years I have been police-commissioner,[8] and I have been elder,\nand twice I have been burnt out, and no one ever helped me; and is it\nbecause we live peaceably at our place, ay and honorably, that I am to\nbe ruined? Give me back my brother. He died there, didn\'t he? Judge\nright, judge according to God\'s law, O orthodox Commune! and do not\nlisten to the lies of that drunkard."\n\nAt this instant Ger\xc3\xa1sim said to Dutlof,--\n\n"You refer to your brother. But he was not sent by the Commune, but the\nmaster sent him because of his good-for-nothingness; so he\'s no excuse\nfor you."\n\nGer\xc3\xa1sim had no chance to say another word, for the tall, yellow Fe\xc3\xb3dor\nMelnitchnui leaning forward began to speak in a gloomy tone:--\n\n"Well, masters send whomever they please; then let the Commune make the\nbest of it. The Commune tells your son to go; and if you don\'t like it,\nask the mistress: she has the right to command me or any of my children\nto wear the uniform. A fine law!" said he bitterly; and, again waving\nhis hand, took his former place.\n\nThe red-haired Rom\xc3\xa1n, whose son had been drafted, lifted his head, and\nsaid, "That\'s so, that\'s so," and sat down morosely on the step.\n\nBut there were many other voices that also joined suddenly in the\nhubbub. Besides those who stood in the background and talked about\ntheir affairs, there were the babblers, who did not forget their duty.\n\n"Certainly, O orthodox Commune," said the little Zhidkof, slightly\nvarying Dutlofs words, "it is necessary to decide according to\nChristianity; according to Christianity, my brethren, it is necessary\nto decide."\n\n"It is necessary to decide on our consciences, my dearly beloved\nfriend," said the good-natured Khrapkof, slightly varying Kopilof\'s\nwords, and taking hold of Dutlofs sheepskin coat; "it is according to\nthe will of our lady, and not the decision of the Commune."\n\n"Indeed, how is that?" exclaimed several.\n\n"What\'s that drunken fellow barking about?" retorted R\xc3\xa9zun. "Did you\nget me drunk, or was it your son whom they have found rolling round\nin the road, and does he dare to fling at me about drink? I tell you,\nbrethren, we must act more wisely. If you want to let Dutlof off,\nthough he is not of those who have two grown men, then name some one\nwho has only one son; but he will laugh at us."\n\n"Let Dutlof go. What\'s to be said?"\n\n"Of course. We must cast lots for the men of large family[9] first,"\nsaid several voices.\n\n"Just as the mistress commands. Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikh\xc3\xa1iluitch said she wanted to\nsend one of the household servants," said some one\'s voice.\n\nThis observation raised a great hubbub; but it quickly subsided, and\nsingle individuals again got the floor.\n\nIgnat, who, according to Rerun\'s remark, had been found drunk in the\nstreet, began to accuse R\xc3\xa9zun of having stolen a saw of some passing\ncarpenter, and of having beaten his wife almost to death during a\ndrunken spree.\n\nR\xc3\xa9zun replied that he beat his wife when he was sober as well as when\nhe was drunk, and very little anyway; and this made every one laugh.\nReferring to the saw he suddenly lost his temper, and pressing nearer\nto Ignat began to question him:--\n\n"Who was it stole the saw?"\n\n"You did," replied the strong Ignat, boldly advancing still nearer to\nhim.\n\n"Who stole it? Wasn\'t it yourself?"\n\n"No, you!" screamed Ignat.\n\nAfter the saw, they disputed about the stealing of a horse, then of\nsome bags of oats, then of some vegetables from the fields, then of\nsome dead body. And such strange things both muzh\xc3\xadks said of each\nother, that if the hundredth part of their mutual charges had been\ntrue, it would have been incumbent on the authorities according to law\nto send both of them instanter to Siberia at the least.\n\nDutlof meantime sought another kind of protection. His son\'s outburst\nhad not been pleasing to him; in order to restrain him he said, "It\'s a\nsin! it\'s no use, I tell you." And he himself went to work to show that\nthe men whose sons lived under the same roof with their fathers were no\nmore to be put in the category of those liable to the subscription than\nthose whose sons lived on separate farms: and he referred to St\xc3\xa1rostin.\n\nSt\xc3\xa1rostin smiled slightly, gave a snort, and, stroking his beard after\nthe manner of the well-to-do muzh\xc3\xadk, he replied that it was as it\nseemed fit to her ladyship; his son would go, of course, if she ordered\nhim to go.\n\nAs regarded divided families, Ger\xc3\xa1sim also demolished Dutlofs\narguments, remarking that it was far better not to allow families to\nlive apart, as it had been in the time of the old b\xc3\xa1rin; that "at the\nend of summer it isn\'t the time to get strawberries" (that is, it was\ntoo late to talk about it); that now it wasn\'t the time to send those\nwho were the sole protection of their families.\n\n"Do we set up separate establishments just for the fun of it? Why\nshouldn\'t we get some advantage for it?" asked some of those who had\nleft their fathers\' houses; and the babblers took the same side.\n\n"Well, hire a substitute if you don\'t like it. You can afford it," said\nR\xc3\xa9zun to Dutlof.\n\nDutlof in despair buttoned up his kaftan, and turned to the other\nmuzh\xc3\xadks.\n\n"You seem to know a good deal about my affairs," he replied viciously.\n"Here comes Y\xc3\xa9gor with word from the mistress."\n\n\n[Footnote 6: A game somewhat like "snap the whip."]\n\n[Footnote 7: _yamshch\xc3\xadk._]\n\n[Footnote 8: _sotsky,_ centurion; an officer chosen by the Commune.]\n\n[Footnote 9: _tro\xc3\xafniki:_ a peasant family with _three_ able-bodied\nmen.]\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nIn fact, Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch at this moment came out of the house. The\npeasants one after another removed their hats, and, as the overseer\nadvanced, there were exposed one after another heads in various stages\nof baldness, and shocks of white, _gray,_ black, red, or blond hair;\nand little by little, little by little, the voices were hushed, and\nfinally there was perfect silence. The overseer stood on the step, and\nmade it evident that he had something to say.\n\nY\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch, in his long frock coat, with his hands negligently\nthrust into his pockets, with his factory-made uniform cap pushed well\nforward, and standing firmly, with his legs set wide apart, on a height\nlooking down upon all these faces lifted and turned to him, faces for\nthe most part dignified with age, and for the most part handsome and\nfull-bearded, had an entirely different mien from that which he wore in\npresence of his mistress. He was majestic.\n\n"Well, boys, here\'s the mistress\'s message: she is not willing to let\nany of the household servants go, and whoever among you you may see\nfit to send will have to go. This time three are required. At present\naccounts the matter is five-sixths settled; now there\'s only half a\nchoice left. But it makes no difference: put it off till another time\nif you don\'t want to decide to-day."\n\n"Now\'s the time! let\'s have it settled," cried several voices.\n\n"In my opinion," continued Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch, "if Khoriushkin and\nMitiukhin\'s Vaska go, it will be in accordance with the will of God."\n\n"That\'s a fact, true enough," cried a number of voices.\n\n"For the third we shall have to send either Dutlof, or from one of the\nfamilies where there are two grown sons."\n\n"Dutlof, Dutlof," echoed the voices. "Dutlof has three."\n\nAnd again, little by little, little by little, the din began, and\nagain recriminations flew about in regard to vegetables taken from the\nfields, and things stolen from the manor-house. Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch had\nbeen manager of the estate now for twenty years, and was a man of sense\nand experience. He stood in silence for fifteen minutes and listened;\nthen he suddenly commanded all to be silent, and bade Dutlof cast lots\nas to which of his family should go. They cast the lots into a cap, and\nwhen it had been well shaken Khrapkof drew from it. The lot fell to\nIlyushkin. All were silent.\n\n"So it\'s mine, is it? Let me see," said the nephew in a broken voice.\n\nAll looked on in silence. Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch commanded to bring on the\nnext day the conscription money, seven kopeks for each peasant farm,\nand, explaining that all the business was now at an end, adjourned\nthe meeting. The crowd moved away, putting on their caps, as they\nwent around the house with a noise of voices and shuffling steps. The\noverseer stood on the doorstep, gazing after the departing people. When\nthe young Dutlofs had gone out of sight, he called the old man who had\nremained behind, and the two went into the office.\n\n"I am sorry for you, old man," said the overseer, sitting down in an\narm-chair by the table. "It was your turn though. Will you hire a\nsubstitute for your nephew, or not?"\n\nThe old man without replying looked earnestly at the overseer.\n\n"You won\'t let him go?" queried the overseer in reply to his look.\n\n"We\'d gladly buy him off, but haven\'t any thing, Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikha\xc3\xaflovitch.\nLost two horses this summer. I have just got my nephew married. You\nsee, it\'s our luck, just because we\'ve lived decently. Fine for him to\ntalk as he did." (The old man referred to R\xc3\xa9zun.)\n\nThe overseer rubbed his face with his hand, and yawned. It was getting\ntiresome to him, and besides it was tea-time.\n\n"Well, old man, don\'t be blue," said he; "but just dig in your cellar,\nand perhaps you can find enough to make up four hundred silver rubles.\nI will hire you a substitute. A few days ago a man offered himself."\n\n"What! in the _government_?" asked Dutlof, meaning by "government" the\nchief city.\n\n"Well, will you hire him?"\n\n"I\'d be glad to, but, before God, I"--\n\nThe overseer looked at him sternly.\n\n"Now, you just listen to me, old man: don\'t let Ilyushka do any harm to\nhimself; when I send to-night or to-morrow, have him come immediately.\nYou bring him, and you shall be answerable for him; and if any thing\nhappens to him, God be my witness, I will take your oldest son. Do you\nhear?"\n\n"But couldn\'t they have taken some one else, Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikh\xc3\xa1iluitch?" he\nsaid in an aggrieved tone after a short silence; "because my brother\ndied in the army, must they take his son also? Why should such luck\ncome to me?" he added, almost weeping, and ready to get on his knees.\n\n"Now, hold on, hold on!" said the overseer. "There\'s no need of\nany trouble; it\'s my orders. You look out for your nephew; you\'re\nresponsible for him."\n\nDutlof went home, carefully helping himself with his cane over the\nirregularities of the road.\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nOn the next day, early in the morning, there was drawn up before the\ndoor of the _wing_ a travelling carriage (the one which the overseer\ngenerally used), with a wide-tailed brown gelding called, for some\ninscrutable reason, Barab\xc3\xa1n, or the drum. At a safe distance from his\nhead stood Aniutka, Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s oldest daughter, barefoot, in spite of\nthe rain and sleet, and the cold wind, holding the bridle in one hand\nwith evident terror, and protecting her own head with a yellow-green\njacket, which fulfilled in the family the manifold functions of dress,\nsheepskin, head-dress, carpet, overcoat for Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, and many other\nuses besides.\n\nIn the _corner_ a tumult was let loose. It was still dark. The morning\nlight, ushering in a rainy day, fell through the window, the broken\npanes of which were in places mended with pieces of paper.\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna, who was up betimes to get ready for breakfast, and her\nchildren, the younger of whom were not yet up, were shivering with\ncold, as their covering had been taken from them for Aniutka\'s use,\nand they had only their mother\'s kerchief for protection. Akul\xc3\xadna was\nbusily engaged in getting her husband started on his journey. His shirt\nwas clean. His boots, which, as they say, were asking _for gruel,_\ncaused her the greatest labor. In the first place, she took off her own\nlong woollen stockings, and gave them to her spouse; next, out of the\nsaddle-cloth which had been _lying round_ in the stable, and Ilyitch\nhad brought into the hut a few days before, she managed to make some\ninsoles and lining, so as to stop up the holes, and protect Ilyitch\'s\nfeet from the dampness. Ilyitch himself, sitting with his feet on\nthe bed, was busy in turning his belt so that it might not have the\nappearance of a dirty rope. The cross little girl who hissed her s\'s,\nwearing a sheepskin, which not only covered her head, but protected her\nlegs, had been sent to Nik\xc3\xadta to borrow a cap.\n\nThe hubbub was increased by the household servants, who came to ask\nIlyitch to do errands for them in the city: to buy a needle for one\nwoman, tea for another, olive-oil for another; tobacco for this muzh\xc3\xadk,\nand sugar for the joiner\'s wife, who had already made haste to set up\nher samovar, and in order to bribe Ilyitch had asked him to share in\nthe concoction which she called tea.\n\nAlthough Nik\xc3\xadta refused to loan his cap, and he was obliged to put his\nown in order, that is to say, to fasten on the shreds of wool that were\nfalling off or hanging by a thread, and to sew up the holes with his\nveterinary needle; though he could not get on his boots with the felt\ninsoles made out of the saddle-cloth; though Aniutka had got so chilled\nthat she let Barab\xc3\xa1n go, and Mashka, in her sheepskin, went in her\nplace; and then Mashka was obliged to give her father the sheepskin,\nand Akul\xc3\xadna herself went to hold Barab\xc3\xa1n,--still at last Ilyitch\nmanaged to get dressed, making use of all the clothing that appertained\nto his family, and leaving only the one jacket and some dirty rags,\nand, now in spick and span order, took his seat in the tely\xc3\xa9ga, bundled\nhimself up, arranged the hay, once more bundled himself up, picked up\nthe reins, bundled himself up still more warmly, just as is done by\nvery dignified people, and drove off.\n\nHis small boy Mishka rushing down the steps asked to be taken on. The\nsibilating Mashka began to ask for "a _l_ide," and would be "warm\nenough, even if she hadn\'t any seepskin;"[10] and Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf reined in the\nhorse, smiled his ineffectual smile, and Akul\xc3\xadna helped the children to\nget in, and, bending close, whispered to him to remember his promise,\nand not drink any thing on the road. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf carried the children as\nfar as the blacksmith-shop, helped them out, again tucked himself in,\nagain settled his cap, and drove off alone in a slow, dignified trot,\nhis fat cheeks shaking, and his feet thumping on the floor of the wagon.\n\nMashka and Mishka, both barefooted, flew home down the little hill with\nsuch fleetness, and with such a noise, that a dog running from the\nvillage to the manor gazed after them, and, suddenly casting his tail\nbetween his legs, fled home with a yelp; so that the noise made by the\nPolikushka hopefuls was increased tenfold.\n\nThe weather was wretched, the wind was cutting; and something that was\nneither snow nor rain, nor _yet_ sleet, began to lash Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s face,\nand his bare hand with which he grasped the reins, protected as well\nas possible by the sleeve of his cloak; and it rattled on the leather\ncover of the horse-collar, and on the head of old Barab\xc3\xa1n, who lay back\nhis ears, and blinked his eyes.\n\nThen suddenly if stopped, and lighted up for an instant; the form of\nthe dark purple snow-clouds became clearly visible; and the sun, as it\nwere, prepared to glance forth, but irresolutely and gloomily, like\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s own smile.\n\nNevertheless, the son of Ilya was absorbed in pleasant thoughts.\nHe,--a man whom they thought of exiling, whom they threatened with\nthe conscription, whom no one except the lazy spared either abuse or\nblows, whom they always saddled with the most unpleasant jobs,--he was\nnow going to collect a _sum o\'_ money, and a big sum; and he had his\nmistress\'s confidence; and he was driving in the overseer\'s wagon with\nBarab\xc3\xa1n, his mistress\'s own horse; and he was driving like some rich\nhouseholder, with leather tugs and reins. And Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf straightened\nhimself up, smoothed the wool on his cap, and once more bundled him up.\n\nHowever, if Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf thought that he was like a rich householder, he\nwas greatly mistaken. Everybody knows that merchants who do a business\nof ten thousand rubles ride in carriages with leather trappings. Well,\nsometimes it\'s one way, and sometimes it\'s another. There comes a man\nwith a beard, in a blue or it may be a black kaftan, sitting alone\non the box behind a plump steed: as soon as you look at him and see\nwhether his horse is plump, whether he himself is plump, how he sits,\nhow his horse is harnessed, how the carriage shines, how he himself\nis girdled, you know instantly whether he is a muzh\xc3\xadk, who makes a\nthousand or a hundred rubles\' worth of sales. Every experienced man,\nas soon as he looked closely at Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, at his hands, at his face, at\nhis short neglected beard, at his girdle, at the hay spread carelessly\nover the box, at the lean Barab\xc3\xa1n, at the worn tire, would have known\ninstantly that the rig belonged to a slave, and not a merchant, or\na drover, or a householder with a thousand or a hundred or even ten\nrubles.\n\nBut Ilyitch did not realize this: he deceived himself, and deceived\nhimself pleasantly. Fifteen hundred rubles he will carry in his bosom.\nIt comes into his mind, that he might drive Barab\xc3\xa1n to _Odesta_\ninstead of home, and then go where God might give. But he will not do\nthat, but will certainly carry the money to his mistress, and it will\nbe said that no amount of money tempted him.\n\nAs he came near a tavern, Barab\xc3\xa1n began to tug on the left rein, to\nslacken his pace, and to turn in; but Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, in spite of the fact\nthat he had money in his pocket given him for various commissions, cut\nBarab\xc3\xa1n with the knout, and drove by. The same thing took place at the\nnext tavern; and at noon he dismounted from the tely\xc3\xa9ga, and opening\nthe gate of the merchant\'s house, where the people from the estate\nalways put up, drove the team in, unharnessed the horse, and gave him\nsome hay, and ate his own dinner with the merchant\'s hired help, not\nfailing to make the most of his important errand; and then, with his\nletter in his cap, betook himself to the gardener.\n\nThe gardener, who knew Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, read the letter, and found it evidently\ndifficult to believe that he was really to deliver the money to the\nbearer. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf did his best to be offended, but was not able to\naccomplish it; he only smiled his peculiar smile. The gardener re-read\nthe letter, and delivered the money. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf placed the money in his\nbosom, and went back to his lodgings. Not a beer-saloon, not a tavern,\nnothing seduced him. He experienced a pleasant exhilaration in all\nhis being; and not once did he loiter at the shops where all sorts of\ntempting wares were displayed,--boots, cloaks, caps. But as he walked\nalong slowly, he had the pleasant consciousness: "I could buy all these\nthings, but I\'m not going to."\n\nHe went to the bazaar to execute his commissions, made them into a\nbundle, and then tried to beat down the price of a tanned sheepskin\nshuba, which was set at twenty-five rubles. The vender, looking\ncritically at Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, did not believe that he had the money to buy it\nwith; but Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf pointed to his breast, saying that he had enough to\nbuy out his whole establishment if he wanted. He asked to try it on,\nhesitated, pulled on it, crumpled it, blew the fur, kept it on long\nenough to smell of it, then took it off with a sigh. "Unconscionable\nprice! If you would only let it go for fifteen rubles," he said. The\ndealer angrily pulled the garment over the counter, but Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf went\nout with a gay heart, and directed his steps to his lodgings. After\neating his supper, and giving Barab\xc3\xa1n his water and oats, he climbed up\non the stove, took out the envelope, and gazed at it long, and asked\nthe lettered porter[11] to read the address to him, and the words,\n"with an enclosure of sixteen hundred and seventy paper rubles." The\nenvelope was made of simple paper; the seals were of dark brown wax\nwith the impression of an anchor; one large seal in the centre, four on\nthe edge. On one side, a drop of wax had fallen. Ilyitch looked at all\nthis, and fixed it in his memory, and even moved the sharp ends of the\nnotes. He experienced a certain childish satisfaction in knowing that\nhe held so much money in his hands. He put the envelope in the lining\nof his cap, made the cap into a pillow, and lay down; but several times\nduring the night he woke up, and felt after the money. And every time,\nfinding the envelope in its place, he experienced the same pleasurable\nfeeling in the consciousness that he, the proscribed and ridiculed, was\ncarrying so much money, and was going to deliver it faithfully,--as\nfaithfully as the overseer himself.\n\n\n[Footnote 10: _suba_ for _shuba._]\n\n[Footnote 11: _dvornik._]\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nAbout midnight the merchant\'s people and Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf were aroused by a\nknocking at the gate and the shouting of muzh\xc3\xadks. It was the contingent\nof recruits, whom they were bringing in from Pokrovsko\xc3\xa9. There were\nten men in all: Khoriushkin, Mitiushkin, and Ilya, Dutlofs nephew,\ntwo substitutes, the st\xc3\xa1rosta or elder, the old man Dutlof, and three\ndrivers. The night-lamp was burning in the house, and the cook was\nasleep on the bench under the holy images. She sprang up, and began to\nlight the lamps. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf also woke up, and bending down from the stove\ntried to see who the muzh\xc3\xadks were.\n\nSome of them came in, crossed themselves, and sat down on the bench.\nThey were all extremely quiet, so that it was impossible to make out\nwho belonged to the detachment. They greeted each other, jested, and\nasked for something to eat. To be sure, some were silent and glum; on\nthe other hand, others were extraordinarily gay, and apparently the\nworse for liquor. In this number was Ilya, who had never been drunk\nbefore.\n\n"Well, boys, are you going to have something to eat, or are you going\nto bed?" asked the village elder.\n\n"Have something to eat," replied Ilya, throwing back his sheepskin, and\nsprawling out on the bench. "Send for some vodka."\n\n"You\'ve had enough vodka!" rejoined the elder shortly, and turned to\nthe others.... "Better lunch on some bread, boys, and not keep the\npeople sitting up."\n\n"Give us some vodka," repeated Ilya, not looking at any one, and in a\ntone of voice that made it evident that he was not going to be put off.\n\nThe muzh\xc3\xadks listened to the elder\'s advice, brought from the cart a\ngreat loaf of bread, ate it up, asked for kvas,[12] and lay down to\nsleep; some on the floor, some on the stove.\n\nIlya kept saying occasionally, "Give me vodka, I say, give me vodka."\nSuddenly he caught sight of Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf. "Ilyitch--there\'s Ilyitch! you\nhere, dear old fellow! Here I am going as a soldier; said good-by to\nmamma, and my wife,--how bad she felt! They made me a soldier.--Set up\nsome vodka!"\n\n"No money," said Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf. "However, it\'s as God gives: maybe they\'ll\nfind you disqualified," he added in a comforting tone.\n\n"No, brother, I have always been as sound as a birch: how could they\nfind me disqualified? How many soldiers more does the Tsar need?"\n\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf began to relate a story of how a muzh\xc3\xadk gave a bribe to a\n_dokhter,_ and so escaped.\n\nIlya came up to the stove, and continued the conversation.\n\n"No, Ilyitch, now it\'s done, and I myself don\'t want to get off. My\nuncle didn\'t buy me off. Wouldn\'t they have bought themselves off? No,\nhe didn\'t want to spare his son, and he didn\'t want to spare his money;\nand they sent me instead.... And now I don\'t want to get off. [He\nspoke quietly, confidentially, under the influence of deep dejection.]\nHowever, I\'m sorry for mamma. And how the sweetheart took on! Yes, and\nmy wife--that\'s the way they kill the women. Now it\'s all over; I am a\nsoldier. Better not to have got married. Why did they make me marry?\nTo-morrow we go."\n\n"Why did they take you away with short notice?" asked Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf "Nothing\nhad been said about it, and then suddenly" ...\n\n"You see, they were afraid I should do something to myself," replied\nIlyushka smiling. "I wouldn\'t have done any thing, of course. I sha\'n\'t\nbe ruined by going as a soldier; but I\'m sorry for the old woman. Why\ndid they make me marry?" he repeated in a soft and melancholy tone.\n\nThe door opened, squeaking loudly, and the old man Dutlof, shaking the\nwet from his hat, came into the room in his huge sabots, which fitted\nhis feet almost like canoes.\n\n"Afan\xc3\xa1si," said he, crossing himself and addressing the porter,[13]\n"isn\'t there some one to hold a lantern while I give the horses their\noats?"\n\nDutlof did not look at his nephew, but quietly busied himself with\nmaking a candle-end burn. His glove and whip were thrust into his belt,\nand his cloak was closely buttoned; he had just come with the baggage.\nHis ordinarily calm, peaceful, and thoughtful face was full of care.\n\nIlya, when he saw his uncle, stopped talking, again turned his eyes\ngloomily toward the bench, and then addressing the st\xc3\xa1rosta said,--\n\n"Give me some vodka, Yermil; I want something to drink."\n\nHis voice was angry and stern.\n\n"This is no time for wine now," replied the st\xc3\xa1rosta, sipping his cup\nof kvas.--"Don\'t you see the folks have gone to bed? What do you want\nto make a disturbance for?"\n\nThe words "make a disturbance" apparently suggested to him the idea of\nmaking a disturbance.\n\n"St\xc3\xa1rosta, I\'ll do myself some harm, if you don\'t give me some vodka."\n\n"You\'d better bring him to reason," said the st\xc3\xa1rosta to Dutlof, who\nhad now lighted the lantern, but stood listening to what was coming,\nand looking askance with deep commiseration at his nephew, as though\nwondering at his childishness.\n\nIlya, in a tone of desperation, repeated his threat,--\n\n"Give me wine, or I\'ll do myself some harm."\n\n"Don\'t, Ilya," said the st\xc3\xa1rosta gently, "please don\'t. It\'s better\nnot."\n\nBut these words had scarcely passed his lips ere Ilya leaped up,\nsmashed the window-pane with his fist, and screamed with all his might.\n\n"You won\'t listen, here\'s for you," and darted for the other window to\nsmash that also.\n\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, in the twinkling of an eye, rolled over twice, and hid himself\nin an angle of the stove, raising a panic among all the cockroaches.\nThe elder threw aside his cup, and hastened after Ilya. Dutlof slowly\nput down the lantern, took off his girdle, clucked with his tongue,\nshook his head, and went to Ilya, who was already struggling with the\nelder and the porter, who tried to keep him from the window. They had\nhis hands behind his back, and held him tight apparently; but as soon\nas he saw his uncle with the belt in his hand, tenfold strength was\ngiven to him. He tore himself away, and, rolling his eyes in frenzy,\nflung himself upon Dutlof with doubled fist.\n\n"I\'ll kill you, don\'t you dare--You have ruined me! Why did you make me\nmarry? Don\'t you dare--I will kill you!"\n\nIlyushka was frantic. His face was purple, his eyes were wild, his\nwhole healthy young body trembled as in an ague. It seemed as if he\ncould and would kill all three of the muzh\xc3\xadks who were trying to subdue\nhim.\n\n"You will shed your kinsman\'s blood, you blood-hound!"\n\nSomething passed over Dutlofs ever-calm face. He made a step forward.\n\n"You\'d better not do it," he said; and then, however he got his energy,\nhe threw himself with a quick motion on his nephew, rolled over with\nhim on the floor, and with the help of the elder, began to bind his\nhands. Within five minutes they had him fast. At last Dutlof, with the\naid of the muzh\xc3\xadks, got up, tearing Ilya\'s hands from his sheepskin, in\nwhich they were convulsively clutched, got up himself, and then carried\nthe young man, with his hands behind his back, to a bench in one corner\nof the room.\n\n"I said it would be worse," he remarked, getting his breath after the\nstruggle, and adjusting his shirt-band. "Why should he sin? We must\nall die. Let him have a cloak for a pillow," he added, turning to the\ndvornik; "the blood will run to his head" and, after girding himself\nwith a rope, he took his lantern, and went out to his horses.\n\nIlya with dishevelled locks, pale face, and disordered linen, glared\nabout the room as though he were trying to remember where he was. The\nporter picked up the broken glass, and put a jacket in the window so\nas to keep out the cold. The elder again sat down with his cup of kvas.\n\n"Ay, Ily\xc3\xbakha, Ily\xc3\xbakha, I\'m sorry for you, indeed I am. What\'s to be\ndone? Here\'s Khoriushkin, he\'s married too. No way of avoiding it."\n\n"My uncle is my enemy, and he wants to kill me," reiterated Ilya with\ntearless wrath. "Much he pities his own!... M\xc3\xa1tushka said the overseer\ntold him to hire a substitute. He wouldn\'t do it. He says he wouldn\'t\nborrow. Did I and my brother bring nothing into the house?... He is our\nenemy."\n\nDutlof came into the house, said a prayer before the holy images, took\noff his coat and hat, and sat down by the elder. The maid brought him\nalso a cup of kvas and a spoon. Ilya said nothing, shut his eyes, and\nlay still on the cloak. The st\xc3\xa1rosta silently pointed to him, and shook\nhis head. Dutlof waved his hand.\n\n"Am I not sorry to have him go? He\'s my own brother\'s son. And though\nI pity him so, they make it out that I\'m his enemy. His wife[14] put\nit into his head; a crafty woman, but quite too young. The idea of her\nthinking that we had money enough to hire a substitute! And so she\nblamed me. And yet I\'m sorry for him."\n\n"Akh, he\'s a fine young fellow," said the st\xc3\xa1rosta.\n\n"With my little means I couldn\'t do any thing for him. To-morrow I am\ngoing to send Ignat in, and his wife will want to go."\n\n"Send her along, first-rate," said the st\xc3\xa1rosta, and he got up and\nmounted the stove. "What\'s money? Money\'s dust."\n\n"Who would begrudge money if he had it?" asked one of the merchant\'s\npeople, lifting his head.\n\n"Ekh! money, money! it causes many a sin," replied Dutlof. "Nothing\nin the world causes so much sin as money, and it says so in the\nScriptures."\n\n"It says every thing," said the porter. "A man told me the other day:\nthere was a merchant, he had made a lot of money, and he did not want\nany of it to remain behind him. He loved his money so that he took it\nwith him into his tomb. He came to die, and ordered every penny that\nhe had to be put into a pillow in the grave with him. And so they did.\nBy and by his sons began to seek for his money. None anywhere. One of\nthem suspected that it was in the cushion. They go to the Tsar, and get\npermission to dig it up. And what do you think? They discovered that\nthere was nothing there, but the grave was full of mould and worms; and\nthen they dig again, and there they find the money."\n\n"Truly, much sin!" said Dutlof, and, standing up, he began to say his\nprayers.\n\nAfter he had prayed, he looked at his nephew. He was asleep. Dutlof\nwent to him, took off his belt, and then lay down. Another muzh\xc3\xadk went\nout to sleep with the horses.\n\n\n[Footnote 12: A sort of beer made of rye-bread soaked in water and\nfermented.]\n\n[Footnote 13: _dvornik._]\n\n[Footnote 14: _khozy\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafka._]\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nAs soon as all was quiet, Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, like one engaged in some guilty\ndeed, quietly slipped down from the stove, and began to make ready to\ndepart. It somehow seemed to him a trying task to spend the night here\nwith the recruits. The cocks were already calling to each other.\n\nBarab\xc3\xa1n had eaten all his oats, and was stretching after water. Ilyitch\nharnessed him, and led him out past the teams of the muzh\xc3\xadks. His cap\nwith its precious contents was safe, and his carriage-wheels were soon\nrolling anew over the frosty Pokrovsk\xc3\xad road. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf began to breathe\nmore easily as soon as he got out of the city. At first, somehow,\nit seemed to him that he heard some one right behind him, following\nhim; it was as though they stopped him, and bound his hands behind\nhim instead of Ilya, and to-morrow he would have to go to camp. It\nwas neither from the cold nor from terror that a chill struck down\nhis back, and he urged and urged Barab\xc3\xa1n to his utmost endeavor. The\nfirst man whom he met was a priest in a high winter cap, walking with\na one-eyed workman. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf grew even more troubled. But as he left\nthe city behind, this terror gradually diminished. Barab\xc3\xa1n proceeded\nin a slow walk. It grew lighter, so that it was possible to see the\nroad before him. Ilyitch took his cap, felt to see that the money was\nall right. "Shall I put it in my bosom?" he queried. "I should have\nto untie my girdle. Now I am coming to the hill. I\'ll get out of the\ntely\xc3\xa9ga when I get there. I\'ll be careful. My cap fits tight, and it\ncan\'t slip out from under the lining, and I won\'t take off my cap till\nI get home."\n\nWhen he came to the hill, Barab\xc3\xa1n, in his peculiar trot, dashed up the\nslope; and Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, who, like the horse, felt a strong desire to get\nhome, did not hinder him in his endeavor.\n\nEvery thing was in order, or, at least, seemed to him so; and he gave\nfree course to his imagination in respect to his mistress\'s delight,\nand the five-silver-ruble piece which she would give him, and the joy\nof his family. He took off his cap, once more felt of the letter,\ncrushed his cap down closer to his head, and smiled. The wool on his\ncap was rotten; and for the very reason that Akul\xc3\xadna, the day before,\nhad carefully sewed the torn place, he tore the other end; and the very\nmotion that Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf made when he thought that he was pulling down the\nenvelope with the money closer under the wool,--that same motion tore\naway the cap, and, gave the envelope a chance to escape from one corner\nunder the pelt.\n\nIt began to grow light, and Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, who had not slept all night, grew\ndrowsy. Adjusting his cap again, and still more loosening the envelope,\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf leaned his head on the side of the wagon, and drowsed.\n\nHe woke up just as he reached home. His first impulse was to feel\nfor his cap: it was firm on his head. He did not take it off, being\nconvinced that the envelope was there. He whipped up Barab\xc3\xa1n, adjusted\nthe hay, again assumed the dignity of a householder, and, looking\naround him with an air of importance, rattled up toward his home.\n\nThere was the cook-house, there the wing, there the joiner\'s wife\nhanging out her wash, there the office; there the manor-house, where,\nin a moment, Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf would give proof that he was a faithful and honest\nman, "for any man can be slandered," and the mistress would say,\n"Well, thank you, Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf, here\'s three--or maybe five, or maybe even\nten--silver rubles for you;" and would have some tea brought to him,\nand perhaps some spirits besides. It would not come amiss after the\nchilly ride. "And with the ten rubles we\'ll have a holiday, and buy\nsome boots, and pay back Nik\xc3\xadta the four rubles and a half, since he\'s\nbegun to dun me for them."\n\nNot driving the two hundred steps that remained, Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf straightened\nhimself up, tightened his belt, adjusted his collar, took off his\ncap, smoothed his hair, and with confidence thrust his hand under the\nlining. His hand moved more and more nervously; he inserted the other\nalso. His face grew paler and paler. One hand came out on the other\nside.... Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf fell on his knees, stopped the horse, and began to\nsearch all over the tely\xc3\xa9ga, the hay, the bundle of purchases, to feel\nin his bosom, in his overalls. The money was nowhere to be found.\n\n"Mercy on me![15] What does this mean? What will be done to me?" he\nroared, tearing his hair.\n\nBut just then, remembering that he might be seen, he turned Barab\xc3\xa1n\naround, put on his cap, and drove the astonished and reluctant animal\nup the road again.\n\n"I can\'t bear to have Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf drive me," Barab\xc3\xa1n must have said to\nhimself. "Once in my life he has fed me and watered me in time, and\njust for the sake of deceiving me in the most unpleasant manner. How I\nput myself out to get home! He stopped me, and just as I smelled our\nhay, he drives me back again."\n\n"You devilish good-for-nothing beast!" cried Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf through his tears,\nstanding up in the tely\xc3\xa9ga, and sawing on Barab\xc3\xa1n\'s mouth, and plying\nthe whip.\n\n\n[Footnote 15: _b\xc3\xa1tiushki._]\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nThat whole day no one at Pokrovsko\xc3\xa9 saw Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf. The mistress several\ntimes after dinner made inquiries, and Aksiutka flew down to Akul\xc3\xadna:\nbut Akul\xc3\xadna said that he had not come; that the merchant must have\ndetained him, or something had happened to the horse. "Can\'t he have\ngone lame?" she suggested. "The last time Maksim was gone four and\ntwenty hours,--walked the whole way." And Aksiutka\'s pendulums brought\nback the message to the house; and Akul\xc3\xadna thought over all the reasons\nfor her husband\'s delay, and tried hard to calm her fears, but she did\nnot succeed. Her heart was heavy, and her preparations for the next\nday\'s festival made little progress in her hands. She tormented herself\nall the more because the joiner\'s wife was convinced that she had seen\nhim.\n\n"A man just like Ilyitch had driven up the _proshpect,_ and then turned\nback again."\n\nThe children also waited restlessly and impatiently for their papa; but\nfor other reasons. Aniutka and Mashka were without any sheepskin or\ncloak; and so they were deprived of the possibility of taking turns in\ngoing into the street, and were therefore obliged to content themselves\nin their single garments, and to make circuits around the house with\nstrenuous swiftness so as to be troubled as little as possible by the\ninhabitants of the _wing_ coming and going. Once Mashka tripped over\nthe feet of the joiner\'s wife, who was lugging water; and though she\nwas crying lustily from the knock that she received on her knee,\nyet her hair was pulled violently, and she began to cry still more\ngrievously. When she did not meet any one, she flew straight into the\ndoor, and mounted the stove by means of the tub.\n\nThe mistress and Akul\xc3\xadna began to be really worried about Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\nhimself; the children, about what he wore. But Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikhailovitch, in\nreply to her ladyship\'s question, "Hasn\'t Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf come yet, and where\ncan he be?" smiled, and said, "I cannot tell;" and it was evident that\nhe was satisfied to have his pre-supposition confirmed. "He would have\nto come to dinner," he said significantly.\n\nAll that day no one at Pokrovsko\xc3\xa9 had any tidings of Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf: except it\nwas noised abroad that some neighboring muzh\xc3\xadks had seen him without\nhis cap, and asking every one "if they seen a letter."\n\nAnother man had seen him asleep by the side of the road, near a horse\nhitched into a tely\xc3\xa9ga. "I thought he was drunk," said this man, "and\nthat the horse had not been fed or watered for a couple of days, his\nbelly was so drawn up."\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna did not sleep all night, but sat up waiting for him; but not\neven in the night did he put in an appearance. If she had lived alone,\nand had a cook and second girl, she would have been still more unhappy;\nbut as soon as the cocks began to crow for the third time, and the\njoiner\'s wife got up, Akul\xc3\xadna was obliged to rise and betake herself\nto the stove. It was a holiday; so it was necessary before daylight to\ntake out her bread, to make kvas, to bake cookies, to milk the cow, to\niron the dresses and shirts, to wash the children, to bring water, and\nkeep her neighbor from occupying the whole oven. Akul\xc3\xadna ceased not\nto keep her ears open while she was fulfilling these duties. It was\nalready broad daylight: already the bells had begun to peal, already\nthe children were up, and still no Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf. Yesterday, winter had\nreally set in; the fields, roads, and roofs were covered with patches\nof snow; but to-day, as though in honor of a festival, it was clear,\nsunny, and cool, so that one could see and hear a long distance. But\nAkul\xc3\xadna standing by the oven, and with her head thrust into the door\nso as to watch the baking of her cookies, did not hear Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf as\nhe came in, and only by the cries of the children did she know that\nher husband had come. Aniutka, as the eldest, had oiled her hair and\ndressed herself. She had on a new calico dress, somewhat rumpled, the\ngift of the gracious lady, and it fitted her like the bark on a tree,\nand dazzled the neighbors\' eyes; her hair was shiny, having been rubbed\nwith a candle-end; her shoos were not exactly new, but were elegant.\n\nMashka was still in jacket and rags, so Aniutka would not let her come\nnear to her lest she should soil her clean things. Mashka was in the\nyard when her father came along with a bag.\n\n"Papa\'s come!" she shouted, beginning to cry, and threw herself\nhead-first into the door past Aniutka, leaving a great smutch on her\ndress. Aniutka, no longer afraid of getting soiled, immediately struck\nMashka. Akul\xc3\xadna could not leave her work, and had to shout to the\nchildren, "There now, stop! I\'ll give you both a good thrashing!" and\nshe glanced toward the door. Ilyitch, with his sack in his hand, came\nthrough the entry, and instantly threw himself into his corner. Akul\xc3\xadna\nnoticed that he was pale, and that his face had an expression as though\nhe had been neither weeping nor laughing: she could not understand it.\n\n"Well, Ilyitch," she asked, not leaving the oven, "what luck?"\n\nIlyitch muttered something which she did not hear.\n\n"How?" she screamed, "have you been to our lady\'s?"\n\nIlyitch sat down on the bed, looked wildly around, and smiled his\nguilty and deeply unhappy smile. For a long time he said nothing.\n\n"Well, Ilyitch? why so long?" rang Akul\xc3\xadna\'s voice.\n\n"I, Akul\xc3\xadna,--I gave the money to our lady; how thankful she was!"\nsaid he suddenly, and looked around even more restlessly than ever,\nstill smiling. Two objects especially attracted his restless,\nfeverishly-staring eyes,--the rope fastened to the cradle, and the\nbaby. He went to the cradle, and with his slender fingers began rapidly\nto untie a knot in the rope. Then his eyes rested on the babe; but here\nAkul\xc3\xadna, with the cookies on a platter, came into the _corner._ Ilyitch\nquickly hid the rope in his bosom, and sat down on the bed.\n\n"What\'s the matter, Ilyitch? you don\'t seem like yourself," said Akulna.\n\n"I haven\'t had any sleep," was his reply.\n\nSuddenly something flashed by the window; and in an instant Aksiutka,\nthe maid from the upper house, darted into the room.\n\n"The gracious lady[16] commands Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf Ilyitch to come to her this\nminute," said she. "Avd\xc3\xb3t\'ya Mikol\xc3\xa1vna commands you to come this\nminute,--this minute."\n\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf gazed at Akul\xc3\xadna, at the maid-servant.\n\n"Right away! what more is wanted?" he asked so simply that Akul\xc3\xadna\'s\napprehensions were quieted: maybe he is going to be rewarded. "Say I\nwill come right away."\n\nHe got up and went out. Akul\xc3\xadna took a trough, placed it on the bench,\npoured in water from the buckets which stood by the door, filled it up\nwith boiling water from the kettle, began to roll up her sleeves, and\ntry the temperature of the water.\n\n"Come, Mashka, I want to wash you."\n\nThe cross sibilating little girl began to cry.\n\n"Come, you scabby wench! I want to put you on a clean shirt. Now, make\nup faces, will you? Come, I\'ve got to wash your sister yet."\n\nPolik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf meantime was going, not in the direction taken by the maid\nfrom the house, but exactly opposite. In the entry next the wall was a\nstraight staircase leading to the loft. When Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf reached the entry\nhe looked around, and, seeing no one, he bent down, and almost running\nclimbed up this stairs quickly and with agility.\n\n"What in the world does it mean that Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf doesn\'t come?" asked the\nlady impatiently, turning to Duniasha, who was combing her hair. "Where\nis Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf? Why doesn\'t he come?"\n\nAksiutka again flew down to the servants\' wing, and again flew into the\nentry, and summoned Ilyitch to the mistress. "But he went long ago,"\nsaid Akul\xc3\xadna, who, having washed Mashka, was at this time in the act\nof putting her contumacious little boy in the trough, and silently,\nin spite of his cries, was washing his red head. The boy screamed,\nwrinkled up his face, and tried to clutch something with his helpless\nhands. Akul\xc3\xadna with one big hand supported his weak, soft little back,\nall dimples, and soaped it.\n\n"See if he isn\'t asleep somewhere," she said, glancing around nervously.\n\nThe joiner\'s wife at this time with her hair unkempt, with her bosom\nopen, and holding up her dress, was climbing up to the loft to get her\nclothes which were drying there. Suddenly a cry of horror was heard\nfrom the loft, and the joiner\'s wife, like one crazy, with wide-open\neyes, came down on her hands and feet backwards, quicker than a cat,\nand fled from the stairs.\n\n"Ilyitch," she cried.\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna dropped the child which she was holding.\n\n"He has hung himself!" roared the joiner\'s wife.\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna--not noticing that the child, like a ball, rolled over and over\non his face, and, kicking his little legs, fell head first into the\nwater--ran to the entry.\n\n"From the beam--he is hanging," repeated the joiner\'s wife, but stopped\nwhen she saw Akul\xc3\xadna.\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna flew to the stairs, and before any one could prevent her\nclimbed up, and with a terrible cry fell back like a dead body on the\nsteps; and she would have killed herself if the people, coming from all\nparts, had not been in time to seize her.\n\n\n[Footnote 16: _b\xc3\xa1rinya._]\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nFor some minutes it was impossible to bring any order out of the\ngeneral chaos. The people ran about in crowds, all screaming, all\ntalking; children and old people weeping. Akul\xc3\xadna lay in a dead faint.\nAt last some peasants, the joiner, and the overseer, who came running\nup, mounted the stairs; and the joiner\'s wife for the twentieth time\nrelated how she, without any thought of any thing, went after her\nclothes, looked in this way: "I see a man; I look more close: there\'s a\ncap lying on one side. I see his legs twitching. Then a cold chill ran\ndown my back. At last I make out a man hanging there, and ... that I\nshould have to see that! How ever I got down is more than I can tell.\nAnd it is a miracle that God saved me. Truly the Lord had mercy. It was\nso steep, and--such a height! I might have got my death."\n\nThe men who went into the loft told the same story. Ilyitch was hanging\nfrom the beam, in his shirt and stockings alone, with the very rope\nthat he had taken off from the cradle. His cap which had fallen off lay\nbeside him. He had taken off his jacket and sheepskin shuba, and folded\nthem neatly. His feet just touched the floor, and there was not a sign\nof life. Akul\xc3\xadna came to herself, and tried to climb to the loft again;\nbut they would not let her.\n\n"Mamma,[17] little brother has fallen into the water," suddenly\nscreamed the sibilating girl from the _corner._ Akul\xc3\xadna tore herself\naway, and darted back to the house. The babe, not stirring, lay head\ndownwards in the tub, and his legs were motionless. Akul\xc3\xadna seized him,\nbut the child did not breathe, and gave no signs of life. Akul\xc3\xadna threw\nhim on the bed, put her arms akimbo, and burst into a fit of laughter\nso loud, discordant, and terrible, that Mashka, who at first began to\nlaugh too, put her fingers in her ears, and ran weeping into the entry.\n\nThe people also poured into the _corner,_ and filled it with their\nlamentations. They picked up the child, and tried to bring him to;\nbut it was in vain. Akul\xc3\xadna jumped about on the bed, and laughed and\nlaughed so uncannily, that it threw a terror over those who heard it.\n\nAnd now to see this heterogeneous throng of lusty peasants and women,\nof old men and children, pressing into the entry, one could get some\nidea of the number of people who lived in the servants\' quarters.[18]\nAll were running about this way and that, all talking at once; many\nwere weeping, and no one did any thing useful. The joiner\'s wife kept\nfinding new-comers who had not heard her story; and again and again she\nrepeated how her deepest feelings had been stirred up by the unexpected\nsight, and how God had saved her from falling down the stairs. The old\nbutler, in a woman\'s jacket, told how a woman in the time of the late\nb\xc3\xa1rin had drowned herself in the pond. The overseer sent messengers\nafter the police inspector[19] and a priest, and stationed guards. The\nmaid-servant Aksiutka, her eyes red with weeping, peeped through a\nhole in the loft; and though she could not see any thing there, yet she\ncould not tear herself away and go to her mistress.\n\nAg\xc3\xa1fya Mikha\xc3\xaflovna, who had been the dowager\'s lady\'s-maid, made some\ntea to calm her nerves, and wept. The experienced old grandmother,\nAnna, with her swollen hands smeared with olive-oil, was laying out\nupon the table the dead body of the little babe. The women stood\naround Akul\xc3\xadna, and looked at her in silence. The children who lived\nin the _corners_ looked at the mother, and began to cry, then choked\ndown their sobs, and then again, looking at her, began to weep louder\nthan ever. The boys and men collected around the steps, and with\nterror-stricken faces peered into the door and into the windows, unable\nto see any thing, and not understanding it all, and asking each other\nquestions about what had happened. One said that the joiner had cut his\nwife\'s leg off with an axe. Another said that the laundress had had\ntriplets. A third said that the cook\'s cat had had a fit, and bitten\nthe people. But the truth gradually became generally known, and at last\nreached the mistress\'s ears. And it seems that they hadn\'t the wit to\nbreak the news gently to her: the rough Y\xc3\xa9gor told her point-blank, and\nso shattered her nerves that for a long time afterwards she could not\nget over it.\n\nThe crowd now began to grow calmer! The joiner\'s wife set up her\nsamovar, and made some warm tea; and so those from outside, not\nreceiving an invitation, took the hint that it was incumbent upon them\nto go home. The boys began to tear themselves away from the steps.\nEverybody now knew what the trouble was, and crossing themselves were\nbeginning to scatter in different directions, when suddenly the cry\nwas raised, "b\xc3\xa1rinya, b\xc3\xa1rinya."[20] and all came rushing back again,\nand crowding together so as to give her room to pass. Nevertheless, all\nwanted to see what the lady would do.\n\nThe b\xc3\xa1rinya, pale, and with tears in her eyes, passed through the\nentry, and crossed the threshold into Akul\xc3\xadna\'s _corner._ A dozen heads\ncrowded together and peered through the door. They pressed so violently\nagainst one woman who was heavy with child, that she screamed, but\nnevertheless, taking advantage of the situation, this same woman\nmanaged to get the foremost place. And how could they help wishing to\nsee the mistress in Akul\xc3\xadna\'s _corner!_ For the domestics it was much\nthe same as a Bengal fire at the end of an exhibition. Of course it\'s\na fine thing to burn the Bengal fire; and of course it\'s a fine thing\nwhen the mistress, in her silk and laces, goes into Akul\xc3\xadna\'s _corner._\nThe lady went up to Akul\xc3\xadna, and took her by the hand. But Akul\xc3\xadna\nsnatched it away. The old domestics shook their heads disapprovingly.\n\n"Akul\xc3\xadna," said the lady, "for your children\'s sake calm yourself."\n\nAkul\xc3\xadna gave a loud laugh and drew herself up.\n\n"My children are solid silver, solid silver! I don\'t deal in paper\nnotes," she muttered rapidly. "I told Ilyitch, \'Don\'t keep the\nbank-notes,\' and now they\'ve smeared him with tar, smeared him--with\ntar and soap, lady. So if he\'s got the barn-itch, it\'ll cure him right\naway;" and again she went into a fit of laughter, louder than before.\n\nThe mistress turned around, and asked for the doctor\'s boy with some\nmustard. "Give me some cold water," and she herself began to look about\nfor water. But when she saw the dead child, and the old grandmother\nAnna standing by him, the mistress turned away, and all saw that she\ncovered her face with a handkerchief and wept. But the grandmother\nAnna (it was a pity that the mistress did not see it: she would have\nappreciated it, and it was all done for her too) covered the child with\na piece of linen, folded the little arms with her soft, skilful hand,\nand arranged the little head, composed the lips, and feelingly closed\nthe eyes, and sighed, so that every one could see what a beautiful\nheart she had. But the mistress did not see it, and she could not have\nseen it. She began to sob, and when the first attack of hysterics was\nover they led her out into the entry, and they led her home.\n\n"That\'s all she could do," was what many thought, and they began to\nseparate. Akul\xc3\xadna was still laughing, and talking nonsense. They led\nher into another room, cupped her, put on mustard-plasters, applied\nice to her forehead; but all the time she did not understand it in the\nleast, did not weep, but laughed, and said and did such things that the\nkind people who were waiting on her could not restrain themselves, but\neven laughed.\n\n\n[Footnote 17: _m\xc3\xa1muska._]\n\n[Footnote 18: _fliger,_ peasant corruption of _fl\xc3\xbcgel,_ the wing; the\ncollection of izb\xc3\xa1s occupied by the _dvor\xc3\xb3vui_ or domestic servants.]\n\n[Footnote 19: _stanov\xc3\xb3\xc3\xaf._]\n\n[Footnote 20: "The mistress, the mistress," or, "the gracious lady."\n_B\xc3\xa1rin_ and _b\xc3\xa1ruinya_ or _b\xc3\xa1rinya_ are the terms used by the domestics\nfor the master and mistress.]\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nThe festival was not gay at Pokrovsko\xc3\xa9. Notwithstanding the fact that\nthe day was beautiful, the people did not go out to enjoy themselves:\nthe girls did not collect to sing songs: the factory-boys who came out\nfrom the city did not play the harmonica or on the _balal\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafka;_[21]\nthey did not jest with the girls. All sat around in the _corners;_ and\nif they talked, they talked quietly, as though some ill-disposed person\nwere there, and might overhear them.\n\nAll day nothing happened. But in the evening, as it grew dusk, the\ndogs began to howl: and, as though signifying some misfortune, a wind\nsprang up and howled in the chimneys; and such fear fell upon all the\ninhabitants of the _dvor,_ that those who had candles lighted them\nbefore, it was necessary; those who were alone in any _corner_ went to\nask their neighbors to give them a night\'s lodging where there were\nmore people; and whoever had to go to the stables did not go, and did\nnot hesitate to leave the cattle without fodder that night. And the\nholy water, which every one keeps in a vial, was all that night in\nconstant requisition. Many were sure that they heard, during the night,\nsome one walking up and down with a heavy tread over the loft; and the\nblacksmith saw how a serpent flew straight to the loft.\n\nNone of the family staid in Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s _corner._ The children and\nthe crazy woman had been carried to other quarters. The dead little\nbaby lay there, however. And there were two old grandmothers and a\npilgrim-woman[22] who diligently read the psalter, not for the sake of\nthe child so much as for the solace of all this unhappiness. This was\nthe mistress\'s desire. These old grandmothers and the pilgrim-woman\nthemselves heard, while one portion of the psalter was read, how the\nbeam above creaked, and some one groaned. When they read the words,\n"Let God rise up," the sounds ceased.\n\nThe joiner\'s wife asked in one of her cronies; and that night they did\nnot sleep, but drank up enough tea to last her a week. They also heard\nhow the beam creaked, and something sounded like the falling of heavy\nbags. The muzh\xc3\xadks on guard imparted some courage to the domestics,\notherwise they would all have perished with fear. The muzh\xc3\xadks lay in\nthe entry on the hay, and afterwards they also became convinced that\nthey heard marvels in the loft; although that same night they calmly\ntalked about the _n_ecruits, munched their bread, combed their hair,\nand, most of all, filled the entry with that odor peculiar to the\nmuzh\xc3\xadks, so that the joiner\'s wife, passing by them, spat, and scolded\nthem for foul peasants.\n\nHowever it was, the suicide all the time was hanging in the loft; and\nit seemed as if the evil spirit himself that night overshadowed the\npremises with his monstrous pinions, showing his power, and coming\nnearer to all these people than ever before. At least, all of them had\nthat impression.\n\nI don\'t know whether they were right. I am inclined to think that they\nwere entirely wrong. I think that if some man, that terrible night,\nhad had courage enough to take a candle or a lantern, and blessing\nhimself, or even not blessing himself, with the sign of the cross,\nhad gone to the loft, slowly driving before him, by the flame of the\ncandle, the terror of the night, and lighting up the beams, the sand,\nthe cobweb-garlanded chimney, and the forgotten washing of the joiner\'s\nwife,--had gone straight up to Ilyitch, and if, not giving way to the\nfeeling of fear, he had lifted the lantern to the level of his face,\nthen he would have seen the familiar, emaciated body, with the legs\ntouching the floor (the rope had stretched), lifelessly falling to one\nside, the unbuttoned shirt, under the opening of which his baptismal\ncross could not be seen, and with the head bent over on the breast,\nand the good-natured face, with the sightless eyes wide open, and the\nsweet, guilty smile, and a stern calmness, and silence over all.\n\nTruly the joiner\'s wife, huddling up in the corner of her bed, with\ndishevelled hair and frightened eyes, telling how she heard what seemed\nlike bags falling, was a far more terrible and fear-inspiring object\nthan Ilyitch, though he had taken off his cross and laid it on a bench.\n\n_Above--_that is, at the great house--there was the same fear that\nreigned in the _wing._ In the lady\'s room there was an odor of _eau\nde cologne_ and medicine. Duniasha was melting beeswax, and making a\ncerate. Why a cerate especialty, is more than I can tell; but I know\nthat a beeswax plaster was always made when the mistress was ill. And\nnow she was so disturbed that she was really ill. Duniasha\'s aunt had\ncome to spend the night with her, so as to keep her courage up. Four of\nthem were sitting in the girls\' sitting-room,--among them the little\nmaid,--and were quietly conversing.\n\n"Who is going after the oil?" asked Duniasha.\n\n"I wouldn\'t go, not for any thing, Avd\xc3\xb3t\'ya Mikol\xc3\xa1vna," said the second\ngirl in atone of determination.\n\n"Come now, go with Aksiutka."\n\n"I will run alone. I ain\'t afraid of nothing," said Aksiutka, "but\nshe\'s afraid of every thing."\n\n"Well, then, go ahead, dear; borrow it of the old granny Anna, and\ndon\'t spill it," said Duniasha.\n\nAksiutka lifted her skirt with one hand, and though on account of this\nshe could not swing both arms, she swung one twice as violently across\nthe line of her direction, and flew off. It was terrible to her; and\nshe felt that if she should see or hear any thing whatsoever, even\nthough it were her own mother, she should fall with fright. She flew,\nwith her eyes shut, over the well-known path.\n\n\n[Footnote 21: A sort of primitive guitar, with long neck, and short\nthree-cornered sounding-board, strung with two or three strings, and\nthrummed with the fingers.]\n\n[Footnote 22: str\xc3\xa1nnitsa.]\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\n"Is our lady asleep, or not?" asked a muzh\xc3\xadk\'s hoarse voice suddenly\nnear Aksiutka. She opened her eyes, which had been tightly shut, and\nsaw a form which it seemed to her was higher than the _wing._ She\nwheeled round, and sped back so fast that her petticoat did not have\ntime to catch up with her. With one bound she was on the steps, with\nanother in the sitting-room, and giving a wild shriek flung herself on\nthe lounge.\n\nDuniasha, her aunt, and the second girl almost died of fright; but they\nhad no time to open their eyes, ere heavy, deliberate, and irresolute\nsteps were heard in the entry and at the door. Duniasha ran into her\nmistress\'s room, dropping the cerate. The second girl hid behind a\nskirt that was hanging on the wall. The aunt, who had more resolution,\nwas about to hold the door; but the door opened, and a muzh\xc3\xadk strode\ninto the room.\n\nIt was Dutlof in his huge boots. Not paying any heed to the affrighted\nwomen, his eyes sought the ikons; and, not finding the small holy image\nthat hung in a corner, he crossed himself toward the cupboard, laid his\ncap down on the window, and thrusting his thick hand into his sheepskin\ncoat, as though he were trying to scratch himself under the arm, he\ndrew out a letter with five brown seals, imprinted with an anchor.\nDuniasha\'s aunt put her hand to her breast; she was scarcely able to\narticulate,--\n\n"How you frightened me, Naumuitch![23] I ca-n-n\'t sa-y a wo-r-d. I\nthought that the end ... had ... come."\n\n"What do you want?" asked the second girl, emerging from behind the\nskirt.\n\n"And they have stirred up our lady so," said Duniasha coming from\nthe other room. "What made you come up to the sitting-room without\nknocking? You stupid muzh\xc3\xadk!"\n\nDutlof, without making any excuse, said that he must see the mistress.\n\n"She is ill," said Duniasha.\n\nBy this time Aksiutka was snorting with such unbecomingly loud\nlaughter, that she was again obliged to hide her head under the\npillows, from which, for a whole hour, notwithstanding Duniasha\'s and\nher aunt\'s threats, she was unable to lift it without falling into\nrenewed fits of laughter, as though something were loose in her rosy\nbosom and red cheeks. It seemed to her so ridiculous that they were all\nso frightened--and she again would hide her head, and, as it were in\nconvulsions, shuffle her shoes, and shake with her whole body.\n\nDutlof straightened himself up, looked at her attentively as though\nwishing to account for this peculiar manifestation; but, not finding\nany solution, he turned away and continued to explain his errand.\n\n"Of course, as this is a very important business," he said, "just tell\nher that a muzh\xc3\xadk has brought her the letter with the money."\n\n"What money?"\n\nDuniasha, before referring the matter to the mistress, read the\naddress, and asked Dutlof when and how he had got this money which\nIlyitch should have brought back from the city. Having learned all the\nparticulars, and sent the errand-girl, who still continued to laugh,\nout into the entry, Duniasha went to the mistress; but to Dutlof\'s\nsurprise the lady would not receive him at all, and sent no message to\nhim through Duniasha.\n\n"I know nothing about it, and wish to know nothing," said the mistress,\n"about any muzh\xc3\xadk or any money. I can not and I will not see any one.\nLet him leave me in peace."\n\n"But what shall I do?" asked Dutlof, turning the envelope around and\naround; "it\'s no small amount of money. It\'s written on there, isn\'t\nit?" he inquired of Duniasha, who again read to him the superscription.\n\nIt seemed hard for Dutlof to believe Duniasha. He seemed to hope that\nthe money did not belong to the gracious lady, and that the address\nread otherwise. But Duniasha repeated it a second time. He sighed,\nplaced the envelope in his breast, and prepared to go out.\n\n"I must give it to the police inspector," he said.\n\n"Simpleton, I will ask her again; I will tell her," said Duniasha,\ndetaining him when she saw the envelope disappearing under his coat.\n"Give me the letter."\n\nDutlof took it out again, but did not immediately put it into\nDuniasha\'s outstretched hand.\n\n"Tell her that Dutlof Sem\'y\xc3\xb3n found it on the road."\n\n"Well, give it here."\n\n"I was thinking--well, take it. A soldier read the address for me--that\nit had money."\n\n"Well, let me have it."\n\n"I didn\'t dare to go home on account of this," said Dutlof again, not\nletting go the precious envelope. "Well, let her see it."\n\nDuniasha took the envelope, and once more went to her ladyship.\n\n"Duniasha,"[24] said the mistress in a reproachful tone, "don\'t speak\nto me about that money. I can\'t think of any thing else except that\npoor little babe."\n\n"The muzh\xc3\xadk, my lady,[25] knows not who you want him to give it to,"\ninsisted Duniasha.\n\nThe lady broke the seals, shuddered as soon as she saw the money, and\npondered for a moment.\n\n"Horrible money! it has brought nothing but woe," she mused.\n\n"It is Dutlof, my lady. Do you wish him to go, or will you come and see\nhim? Is all the money there?" asked Duniasha.\n\n"I do not wish this money. This is horrible money. What harm it has\ndone! Tell him that he may have it if he wants it," suddenly exclaimed\nthe lady, seizing Duniasha\'s hand.\n\n"Fifteen hundred rubles," remarked Duniasha, smiling gently as to a\nchild.\n\n"Let him have it all," repeated the lady impatiently. "Why, don\'t you\nunderstand me? This is misfortune\'s money: don\'t ever speak about it to\nme again. Let this muzh\xc3\xadk have it, if he brought it. Go, go right away!"\n\nDuniasha returned into the sitting-room.\n\n"Was it all there?" asked Dutlof.\n\n"Count for yourself," said Duniasha, handing him the envelope: "she\ntold me to give it to you."\n\nDutlof stuffed his cap under his arm, and bending over tried to count.\n\n"Haven\'t you got a counting-machine?"\n\nDutlof understood that it was a whim of the mistress\'s not to count,\nand that she had bidden him to do it.\n\n"Take it home, and count it. It\'s yours,--your money," said Duniasha\nseverely. "Says she, \'I don\'t want it; let the man have it who found\nit.\'"\n\nDutlof, not straightening himself up, fixed his eyes on Duniasha.\n\nDuniasha\'s aunt also clapped her hands. "Goodness gracious![26] God has\ngiven you such luck! Goodness gracious!"\n\nThe second girl could not believe it. "You\'re joking! Did really\nAvd\xc3\xb3t\'ya Nikol\xc3\xb3vna say that?"\n\n"What do you mean--joking! She told me to give it to the muzh\xc3\xadk. Now\ntake your money, and be off," said Duniasha, not hiding her vexation.\n"One has sorrow, another joy."\n\n"It must be a joke,--fifteen hundred rubles!" said the aunt.\n\n"More than that," said Duniasha sharply. "Now you will place a great\nbig candle for Mikola,"[27] she continued maliciously. "What! have you\nlost your wits? It would be good for some poor fellow. And you have so\nmuch of your own."\n\nDutlof finally arrived at a comprehension that it was meant in earnest;\nand he began to fold together and smooth down the envelope with the\nmoney, which in the counting he had burst open: but his hands trembled,\nand he kept looking at the women, to persuade himself that it was not\na jest.\n\n"You see you haven\'t come to your senses with joy," said Duniasha,\nmaking it evident that she despised both the muzh\xc3\xadk and money. "Give it\nto me, I\'ll fix it for you."\n\nAnd she offered to take it, but Dutlof did not trust it in her hands.\nHe doubled the money up, thrust it in still farther, and took his cap.\n\n"Glad?"\n\n"I don\'t know; what\'s to be said? Here it\'s"--He did not finish his\nsentence, but waved his hand, grinned, almost burst into tears, and\nwent out.\n\nThe bell tinkled in the mistress\'s room.\n\n"Well, did you give it to him?"\n\n"I did."\n\n"Well, was he very glad?"\n\n"He was like one gone crazy."\n\n"Oh, bring him back! I want to ask him how he found it. Bring him in\nhere. I can\'t go out to him."\n\nDuniasha flew out, and overtook the muzh\xc3\xadk in the hall. He had not put\non his hat, but had taken out his purse, and bending over was opening\nit; but the money he held between his teeth. Maybe it seemed to him\nthat it was not his until he had put it in his purse. When Duniasha\ncalled him back, he was startled.\n\n"What ... Avd\xc3\xb3t\'ya?... Avd\xc3\xb3t\'ya Mikolavna? Is she going to take it\naway from me? If you would only take my part, I would bring you some\nhoney,--before God I would."\n\n"All right, bring it,\'"\n\nAgain the door opened, and the muzh\xc3\xadk was led into the mistress\'s\npresence. It was not a happy moment for him. "Akh! she\'s going to take\nit back!" he said to himself, as he went through the rooms, lifting\nhis feet very high, as though walking through tall grass, so as not to\nmake a noise with his big wooden shoes. He did not comprehend, and he\nscarcely noticed what was around him. He passed by the mirror; he saw\nsome flowers, some muzh\xc3\xadk or other lifting up his feet shod in sabots,\nthe b\xc3\xa1rin painted with one eye and something that seemed to him like\na green tub, and a white object.... Suddenly, from the white object\nissued a voice. It was the mistress. He could not distinguish any one\nclearly, but he rolled his eyes around. He knew not where he was, and\nevery thing seemed to be in a mist.\n\n"Is it you, Dutlof?"\n\n"It\'s me, your ladyship.[28] It\'s just as it was. I didn\'t touch it,"\nhe said. "I wasn\'t glad,--before God, I wasn\'t. I almost killed my\nhorse."\n\n"It\'s your good luck," she said with a perfectly sweet smile. "Keep it,\nkeep it. It\'s yours."\n\nHe only opened wide his eyes.\n\n"I am glad that you have it. God grant that it prove useful to you. Are\nyou glad to have it?"\n\n"How could I help being glad? Glad as I can be, m\xc3\xa1tushka! I will always\npray to God for you. I am as glad as I can be, that, glory to God, our\nmistress is alive. Only it was my fault."\n\n"How did you find it?"\n\n"You know that we can always work for our lady for honor\'s sake, and,\nif not that" ...\n\n"He\'s getting all mixed up, my lady said," Duniasha.\n\n"I carried my nephew, who\'s gone as a _n_ecruit, and on my way back I\nfound it on the road. Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf must have dropped it accidentally."\n\n"Well, now go, now go! I am glad."\n\n"So am I glad, m\xc3\xa1tushka," said the muzh\xc3\xadk.\n\nThen he recollected that he had not thanked her, but he did not know\nhow to go about it in the proper manner. The lady and Duniasha both\nsmiled, as he again started to walk, as though through tall grass, and\nby main force conquered his impulse to break into a run. But all the\ntime it seemed to him that they were going to hold him, and take it\nfrom him.\n\n\n[Footnote 23: The son of Nahum. It is customary among the peasantry to\ncall each other by the patronymic. Thus Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf is generally called\nIlyitch, son of Ilya, instead of the more formal Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf Ilyitch.]\n\n[Footnote 24: _Akh Bozhe mo\xc3\xaf._]\n\n[Footnote 25: _sud\xc3\xa1rinya._]\n\n[Footnote 26: _m\xc3\xa1tushki rodimu\xc3\xafa!_]\n\n[Footnote 27: St. Nicholas.]\n\n[Footnote 28: _Ya-s sud\xc3\xa1rinya._]\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\nMaking his way out into the fresh air, Dutlof turned off from the road\nto the lindens, unloosed his belt so the more conveniently to get at\nhis purse, and then began to put away the money. He moved his lips,\nsucking them in and pushing them out again, though he made no sound.\nAfter he had stowed away the money, and buckled his girdle again, he\ncrossed himself, and went roiling along the path as though he were\ndrunk; so absorbed was he by the thoughts rushing through his brain.\nSuddenly he saw before him the form of a muzh\xc3\xadk, coming to meet him.\nHe screamed. It was Yef\xc3\xadm, who with a club was acting as guard on the\noutside of the wing.\n\n"Ah, uncle Sem\'y\xc3\xb3n," said Yef\xc3\xadmka joyfully as he came nearer. [It\nwas rather gloomy for him to be all alone.] "Well, have you got the\nrecruits off?"\n\n"Yes. What are you doing?"\n\n"They stationed me here to guard Ilyitch, who hung himself."\n\n"But where is Ilyitch?"\n\n"Here in the loft: they say he\'s hanging there," replied Yef\xc3\xadmka,\npointing with his stick through the darkness, to the roof of the _wing._\n\nDutlof looked in the direction indicated; and though he saw nothing, he\nblinked his eyes and shook his head.\n\n"The police inspector has come," said Yef\xc3\xadmka. "The coachman told\nme. They are going to take him right down. Kind of a fearful night,\nuncle.[29] I wouldn\'t go in there to-night, not even if orders had come\nfrom the _upper_ house. Not if Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikhaluitch beat me to death would\nI go in there."\n\n"What a terrible misfortune!" said Dutlof, evidently from a sense of\npropriety; for in reality he was not thinking of what he was saying,\nand was anxious to go his way. But the overseer\'s voice chained him to\nthe spot.\n\n"Hey, guard, come here!" cried Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikh\xc3\xa1ilovitch, from the steps.\n\nYef\xc3\xadmka responded to the call.\n\n"What muzh\xc3\xadk was standing there with you?"\n\n"Dutlof."\n\n"You too, Sem\'y\xc3\xb3n, come here."\n\nAs Dutlof drew near, he saw, by the light of the lantern carried by the\ncoachman, not only the overseer, but a strange man in a uniform cap\nwith a cockade, and wearing a cloak: this was the police inspector.\n\n"Here is an old man will go with us," said the overseer, pointing to\nhim.\n\nThe old man winced, but there was nothing to be done.\n\n"And you, Yef\xc3\xadmka, you\'re only a young man; just run on ahead to the\nloft where he\'s hanging, and clear away the stairs so that his honor\ncan get up."\n\nYef\xc3\xadmka, although he would not for any thing go into the _wing,_\nstarted off, tramping with his feet as though they were beams.\n\nThe police inspector struck a light, and began to smoke his pipe. He\nlived two versts away; and he had just been engaged in receiving from\nthe captain of police[30] a sharp dressing for drunkenness, and was,\nconsequently, still suffering from an attack of ill humor. The overseer\nasked Dutlof why he was there. Dutlof told him in a straightforward way\nabout the finding of the money, and what the b\xc3\xa1rinya had done. Dutlof\nsaid that he was going to ask the overseer\'s permission. The overseer,\nto Dutlof\'s horror, asked for the envelope, and looked at it. The\npolice inspector also took the envelope, and asked, in a few dry words,\nabout the particulars.\n\n"Now, good-by to my money," thought Dutlof, and began already to excuse\nhimself. But the police inspector gave him the money.\n\n"That\'s luck for the rascal!" he said.\n\n"Comes in good time," said the overseer. "He\'s just taken his nephew to\ncamp. Now he can buy him off."\n\n"Ah!" said the police inspector, and started on.\n\n"Are you going to get Ilyushka a substitute?" inquired the overseer.\n\n"How get him a substitute? Is there money enough? And, besides, it\'s\ntoo late."\n\n"You know best," said the overseer, and both followed the police\ninspector.\n\nThey went into the wing, at the entry of which the ill-smelling guards\nwere waiting with a lantern. Dutlof followed them. The guards had a\nguilty look, which was to be attributed only to the odor arising from\nthem, because they had been doing nothing wrong. All were silent.\n\n"Where?" asked the police inspector.\n\n"Here," whispered the overseer. "Yef\xc3\xadmka," he added, "you\'re a fine\nyoung man, go ahead with the lantern."\n\nYef\xc3\xadmka straightened his forelock; it seemed as if he had lost all\nhis fear. Going up two or three steps, he kept turning round, with a\nglad countenance, and throwing the light on the police inspector\'s\nway. Behind the inspector followed the overseer. When they were out of\nsight, Dutlof, resting one foot on the step, sighed and stopped. In the\ncourse of two minutes, the sound of the steps ceased; evidently they\nwere approaching the body.\n\n"Uncle! you\'re wanted," cried Yef\xc3\xadmka, in the skylight.\n\nDutlof went up. The police inspector and the overseer could be seen in\nthe light of the lantern, but the beam partly hid them from sight. Near\nthem stood some one with back toward them. It was Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf. Dutlof went\nbeyond the beam, and, crossing himself, halted.\n\n"Turn him round, boys," commanded the coroner. No one stirred.\n\n"Yef\xc3\xadmka, you\'re a fine young man," said the overseer.\n\nThe "fine young man" walked up to the beam, and turning Ilyitch\'s body\nround stood by him, looking with the same pleased expression, now at\nIlyitch, now at the officer, just as a showman exhibiting an albino, or\nsome monstrosity,[31] looks now at the public, now at the object of his\nexhibition, and is ready to fulfil all the desires of his spectators.\n\n"Turn him round again."\n\nThe body turned around once more, waved its hands slightly, and the leg\nmade a circle on the sanded floor.\n\n"Come now, take him down."\n\n"Do you order him cut down, Vas\xc3\xadli Borisovitch?" demanded the overseer.\n"Bring an axe, friends!"\n\nTwice the order had to be given to Dutlof and the guards to lift him\nup. But the "fine young man" handled Ilyitch as he would the carcass\nof a sheep. Finally they cut the rope, took down the body, and threw a\ncloth over it. The police inspector said that the doctor would come on\nthe next day, and sent the people away.\n\n\n[Footnote 29: _d\'yadiushka,_ diminutive of _d\'y\xc3\xa1d\'ya._]\n\n[Footnote 30: _ispravnik._]\n\n[Footnote 31: Tulia Pastrana: a girl like a monkey, with hairy arms and\nface, exhibited all over Europe, some years ago.]\n\n\n\nXV.\n\n\nDutlof, still moving his lips, went home. At first, it was hard for\nhim; but in proportion as he drew near the village, this feeling passed\naway, and a feeling of pleasure more and more penetrated his heart.\nSongs and drunken voices were heard in the village. Dutlof never drank,\nand now he went straight home. It was already late when he reached\nhis cottage.[32] His old woman was asleep. His oldest son and the\ngrand-children were asleep on the oven, the other son in the closet.\nThe nephew\'s wife[33] was the only person awake; and she, in a dirty,\nevery-day shirt, with her hair unkempt, was sitting on the bench and\nweeping. She did not get up to open the door for the uncle, but began\nto weep more bitterly, and to reproach him, as soon as he came into the\ncottage. By the old woman\'s advice she talked very clearly and well,\nthough, being still young, she could not have had any practice.\n\nThe old woman got up, and began to get her husband something to eat.\nDutlof drove his nephew\'s wife away from the table. "That\'ll do!\nthat\'ll do!" said he. Aks\xc3\xadnya got up, and then throwing herself down\non the bench still continued to weep. The old woman silently set the\nthings on the table, and then put them in order. The old man also\nrefrained from saying a single word. After performing his devotions, he\nbelched once or twice, washed his hands, and, taking the abacus down\nfrom the nail, went to his closet. There he began to whisper with his\nold wife: then the old woman left him alone, and he began to rattle the\nabacus; finally he lifted the lid of a chest, and climbed down into a\nsort of cellar. He rummaged round long in the closet and in the cellar.\nWhen he came out, it was dark in the cottage; the pitch-pine knot had\nburnt out.\n\nThe old woman, who by day was ordinarily mild and quiet, had retired to\nher room, and was snoring so as to be heard all over the cottage. The\nnoisy niece,[34] on the other hand, was also asleep, and her breathing\ncould not be heard. She was asleep on the bench just as she was, not\nhaving undressed, and without any thing under her head. Dutlof said his\nprayers, then glanced at his niece, raised her head a little, slipped a\nstick under it, and, after belching again, climbed upon the oven, and\nlay down next his grandson. In the darkness he took off his shoes, and\nlay on his back, and tried to make out the objects on the stove, barely\nvisible above his head; and listened to the cockroaches rustling over\nthe wall, to the breathing, and the restless moving of feet, and to the\nnoises of the cattle in the yard.\n\nIt was long before he went to sleep. The moon came up, and it grew\nlighter in the cottage. He could see Aks\xc3\xadnya in the corner, and\nsomething which he could not make out. Was it a cloak that his son\nhad forgotten? or had the women left a tub there? or was it some one\nstanding? Whether he drowsed or not, who can say? but now he began to\nlook again.... Evidently that dark spirit which led Ilyitch to commit\nthe terrible deed, and which impressed the domestics that night with\nits presence,--evidently that spirit spread its pinions over the whole\nestate, and over Dutlof\'s cottage, where was concealed that money which\n_he_ enjoyed at the cost of Ilyitch\'s ruin. At all events, Dutlof\nfelt _it_ there. And Dutlof was not in his usual spirits,--could not\nsleep, nor sit up. When he saw something that he could not explain, he\nremembered his nephew with his pinioned arms, he remembered Aks\xc3\xadnya\'s\nface and her flowing discourse, he remembered Ilyitch with his dangling\nhands.\n\nSuddenly it seemed to the old man that some one passed by the window.\n"What is that? Can it be the elder[35] has come to ask the news?"\nhe said to himself. "How did he unlock the door?" the old man asked\nhimself in surprise, hearing steps in the entry; "or did the old woman\nleave it open when she went to the door?" The dog howled in the back\nyard, but IT passed along the entry, and, as the old man afterwards\nrelated the story, seemed to hunt for the door, passed by, once more\ntried to feel along the wall, stumbled across the tub, and it rang.\nAnd once more IT tried to feel along the wall, actually found the\nlatch-string. Then IT took hold of it. A chill ran over the old man\'s\nbody. Here the latch was lifted, and the form of a man came in. Dutlof\nalready knew that it was IT. He tried to get hold of his cross, but\ncould not. IT came to the table, on which lay a cloth, threw it on the\nfloor, and came to the oven. The old man knew that IT was in Ilyitch\'s\nform. He trembled; his hands shook. IT came to the oven, threw itself\non the old man, and began to choke him.\n\n"My money," said _Ilyitch._\n\nSem\'y\xc3\xb3n tried, but could not say, "Let me go, I will not."\n\nIlyitch pressed down upon him with all the weight of a mountain of\nstone resting upon his breast. Dutlof knew that if he could say a\nprayer, IT would leave him; and he knew what kind of a prayer he ought\nto say, but this prayer would not form itself on his lips.\n\nHis grandson was sleeping next him. The boy uttered a piercing scream,\nand began to weep. The grandfather had crowded him against the wall.\nThe child\'s cry unsealed the old man\'s lips. "Let God arise up," he\nrepeated. IT loosed its hold a little. "And scatter our enemies,"\nwhispered Dutlof. IT got down from the stove. Dutlof listened as IT\ntouched both feet to the floor. Dutlof kept repeating all the prayers\nthat he knew; said them all in order. IT went to the door, passed the\ntable, and struck the door such a rap that the cottage trembled. Every\none was asleep except the old man and his grandson. The grandfather\nrepeated the prayers, and trembled all over: the grandson wept as he\nfell asleep, and cuddled up to his grandfather.\n\nAll became quiet again. The old man lay motionless. The cock crowed\nbehind the wall at Dutlof\'s ear. He heard how the hens began to stir\nthemselves; how the young cockerel endeavored to imitate the old cock,\nand did not succeed. Something moved on the old man\'s legs. It was the\ncat. She jumped down on her soft paws from the oven to the ground, and\nbegan to miaw at the door.\n\nThe grandfather got up, opened the window. In the street it was dark,\nmuddy. The corpse stood there under the very window. He went in his\nstocking-feet to the yard,[36] crossing himself as he went. And here\nit was evident that the _master_[37] was coming. The mare, standing\nunder the shed by the wall, with her leg caught in the bridle, was\nlying in the husks, and raised her head, waiting for the master. The\nfoal was stretched out on the manure. The old man lifted him on his\nlegs, freed the mare, gave her some fodder, and went back to the\ncottage. The old woman got up, and kindled the fire.\n\n"Wake the boys; I am going to town."\n\nAnd lighting one of the wax candles that stood before the sacred\nimages, he took it, and went with it down into the cellar. When he came\nup, not only was his own fire burning, but those in the neighboring\ncottages were lighted. The children were up, and all ready. Women were\ncoming and going with pails and tubs of milk. Ignat was harnessing a\ntely\xc3\xa9ga. The other son was oiling another. The niece[38] was not to be\nseen, but, dressed in her best, and with a shawl on, was sitting on the\nbench in the cottage, and waiting for the time to go to town and say\ngood-by to her husband.\n\nThe old man had an appearance of peculiar sternness. He said not a word\nto any one: put on his new kaftan, girdled himself tightly, and with\nall of Polik\xc3\xa9\xc3\xaf\'s money under his coat, went to the overseer.\n\n"You wait for me," he shouted to Ignat, who was whirling the wheel\nround on the raised axle, and oiling it. "I\'ll be back in a moment. Be\nall ready."\n\nThe overseer, who was just up, was drinking his tea, and had made his\npreparations to go to the city to deliver the recruits over to the\nauthorities.\n\n"What do you wish?" he asked.\n\n"Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikh\xc3\xa1luitch, I want to buy the young fellow off. Be so good. You\ntold me a day or two ago that you knew a substitute in the city. Tell\nme how. I am ignorant."\n\n"What! have you reconsidered it?"\n\n"I have, Y\xc3\xa9gor Mikh\xc3\xa1luitch. It\'s too bad,--my brother\'s son. Whatever\nhe did, I\'m sorry for him. Much sin comes from it, from this money. So\nplease tell me," said he, making a low bow.\n\nThe overseer, as always in such circumstances, drew in his lips\nsilently, and went into a brown study; then having made up his mind,\nwrote two letters, and told him what and how he must do in town.\n\nWhen Dutlof reached home, the niece was just coming out with Ignat; and\nthe gray, pot-bellied mare, completely harnessed, was standing at the\ngate. He broke off a switch from the hedge. Wrapping himself up, he\ntook his seat on the box, and started up the horse.\n\nDutlof drove the mare so fast that her belly seemed to shrink away, and\nhe did not dare to look at her lest he should feel compunction. He was\ntormented by the thought that he might be late in reaching camp, that\nIly\xc3\xbakha would have already gone as a soldier, and that the _devilish_\nmoney would still be in his hands.\n\nI am not going to give a detailed description of all Dutlof\'s\nadventures that morning. I will only say that he was remarkably\nsuccessful. At the house of the man to whom the overseer gave him\na letter, there was a substitute ready and waiting, who had spent\ntwenty-three silver rubles of his bounty-money, and had already passed\nmuster. His master[39] wanted to get for him four hundred rubles; but\nanother man,[40] who had already been after him for three weeks, was\nanxious to beat him down to three hundred.\n\nDutlof concluded the business with few words. "Will you take three\nhundred and twenty-five?" said he, offering his hand, but with an\nexpression that made it evident that he was ready to give even more.\nThe master held out his hand, and continued to demand four hundred.\n\n"Won\'t you take three hundred and twenty-five?" repeated Dutlof,\nseizing the master\'s right hand with his left, and making the motion\nto clap it with the other. "You won\'t take it? Well, God be with you,"\nhe exclaimed, suddenly striking hands with the master, and, with\nthe violence of the motion, swinging his whole body round from him.\n"Then, make it this way! Take three hundred and fifty. Make out the\n_fitanets._[41] Bring the young man. And now for the earnest-money.\nWill two ten-ruble pieces do?"\n\nAnd Dutlof unbuckled his belt, and drew out the money.\n\nThough the master did not withdraw his hand, yet apparently he was not\nwholly satisfied, and before accepting the earnest-money, he demanded a\nfee, and entertainment money for the substitute.\n\n"Don\'t commit a sin," said Dutlof, pressing the money upon him. "We\nmust all die," he went on in such a short, didactic, and confident\nvoice that the master said, "There\'s nothing to be done," once more\nshook hands, and began to say a prayer. "With God\'s blessing," he said.\n\nThey awoke the substitute, who was still sleeping off his yesterday\'s\nspree; they inspected him, and then all went to the authorities. The\nsubstitute was hilarious, asked to be refreshed with some rum, for\nwhich Dutlof gave him money, and began to feel scared only at the\nmoment when they first entered the vestibule of the court-house. They\nstood long in the vestibule: the old master[42] in a blue overcoat,\nand the substitute in a short sheepskin, with lifted eyebrows and\nwide-staring eyes; long they stood there whispering together, asked\nquestions of this man and that, were sent from pillar to post, took off\ntheir hats and bowed before every petty clerk, and solemnly listened to\nthe speech made by a clerk whom the master knew. All hope of finishing\nthe business that day was vanishing, and the substitute was already\nbeginning to feel more cheerful and easy, when Dutlof caught sight of\nY\xc3\xa9gor Mikhailovitch, immediately went to him, and began to beseech him,\nand make low bows. The overseer\'s influence was so powerful, that by\nthree o\'clock the substitute, much to his disgust and surprise, was\nconducted into the audience-chamber, enrolled on the army list, and\nto the satisfaction of every one, from door-tender to president, was\nstripped, shaved, dressed in uniform, and sent out to camp. And at\nthe end of five minutes Dutlof had paid the money over, and taken his\nreceipt; and after saying good-by to the recruit and his master, he\nwent to the merchant\'s lodging-house where the recruits from Pokrovsko\xc3\xa9\nwere stopping.\n\nHis nephew and the wife were sitting in one corner of the merchant\'s\nkitchen; and when the old man came in, they ceased talking, and behaved\ntoward him in a humble and yet hostile manner.\n\n"Don\'t be vexed, Ily\xc3\xbakha," he said, approaching his nephew. "Day before\nyesterday you said a harsh word to me. Am I not sorry for you? I\nremember how my brother commended you to my care. If it had been in my\npower, would I have let you go? God granted me a piece of good fortune:\nyou see I have not been mean. Here is this paper," said he, laying the\nreceipt on the table, and carefully smoothing it out with his crooked,\nstiffened fingers.\n\nAll of the Prokrovski muzh\xc3\xadks, and the merchant\'s people, and also some\nof the neighbors, came into the inn.[43] All watched inquisitively what\nwas going on. No one interrupted the old man\'s triumphal words.\n\n"Here\'s the paper. I paid nearly four hundred silver rubles for it.\nDon\'t blame your uncle!"\n\nIly\xc3\xbakha stood up; but said nothing, not knowing what to say. His lips\ntrembled with emotion. His old mother came to him sobbing, and wanted\nto throw herself on his neck; but the old man slowly and imperiously\npushed her away with his hand, and proceeded to speak:--\n\n"You said a harsh word to me," repeated the old man. "With that word\nyou stabbed me to the heart, as with a knife. Your dying father\ncommended you to my care. You have taken the place of my own son; but\nif I have done you any harm, I am sorry. We are all sinners. Is that\nnot so, Orthodox believers?" he asked, turning to the muzh\xc3\xadks standing\naround. "Here is your own mother, and your young wife;[44] here is\nthe _fitanets_ for you. God bless it,--the money. But forgive me, for\nChrist\'s sake!"\n\nAnd spreading his cloak out on the floor, he slowly got down upon his\nknees, and bent low before the feet of Ilyushka and his wife. The young\npeople tried in vain to raise him: not until he had touched his head to\nthe ground, did he rise, and shaking himself sit down upon the bench.\nIlyushka\'s mother and the young wife wept for joy. In the crowd were\nheard voices expressing approbation.\n\n"That\'s right, that\'s God\'s way," said one.\n\n"What money? It must have taken a lot."\n\n"What a joy!" said a third. "A righteous man, that\'s the word for it."\n\nBut the muzh\xc3\xadks, who had been named as recruits, said nothing, and went\nnoiselessly out into the court-yard.\n\nIn two hours\' time, the two Dutlofs\' tely\xc3\xa9gas drove through the suburbs\nof the city. In the first, drawn by the pot-bellied gray mare with\nsweaty neck, sat the old man and Ignat. Behind rattled a number of\npretzels and crackers. In the second tely\xc3\xa9ga, which no one drove,\ndignified and happy, sat the young wife and her mother-in-law wrapped\nup in shawls. The young woman held a jug under her apron. Ily\xc3\xbashka,\nbending over with his back to the horse, with ruddy face, shaking on\nthe dasher, was munching a cracker[45] and talking in a steady stream.\nAnd the voices, and the rumble of the wheels on the bridge, and the\noccasional snorting of the horses, all united into one merry sound. The\nhorses, switching their tails, trotted along steadily, feeling that\nthey were on the home stretch. Those whom they passed and those whom\nthey met looked upon a happy family.\n\nJust as they were leaving the city the Dutlofs overtook a detachment\nof recruits. A group of the soldiers stood in a circle in front of a\ndrinking-saloon. One recruit, with that peculiarly unnatural expression\nwhich a shorn brow gives a man, with his gray uniform cap pushed on the\nback of his head, was skilfully picking on a three-stringed balal\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafka;\nanother, without any thing on his head, and holding a jug of vodka\nin one hand, was dancing in the midst of the circle. Ignat halted his\nhorse, and got out to gather up the reins. All the Dutlofs looked on\nwith curiosity, satisfaction, and joy, at the man who was dancing.\n\nThe recruit did not seem to notice any one, but had the consciousness\nthat an admiring public was attracted by his antics, and this gave him\nstrength and ability. He danced dexterously. His forehead was wrinkled,\nhis ruddy face was motionless, his mouth was parted in a smile which\nhad long lost all expression. It seemed as though all the energies of\nhis soul were directed to making one leg follow the other with all\npossible swiftness, now on the heel and now on the toe. Sometimes he\nwould suddenly stop, and signal to the accompanist, who would instantly\nbegin to thrum on all the strings, and even to rap on the back of\nthe instrument with his knuckles. The recruit stopped, but even when\nhe stopped still, he seemed, as it were, to be all the time dancing.\nSuddenly he began to slacken his pace, shrugging his shoulders, and,\nleaping into the air, landed on his heels, and with a wild shriek set\nup the Russian national dance.\n\nThe lads laughed, the women shook their heads, the lusty peasants\nsmiled with satisfaction. An old non-commissioned officer stood calmly\nnear the dancer with a look that said, "To you this is wonderful, but\nto _us_ it\'s an old story." The balal\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafka-player stood up in plain\nsight, surveyed the crowd with a cool stare, struck a false chord, and\nsuddenly rapped his fingers on the back, and the dance was done.\n\n"Hey! Aly\xc3\xb3kha," cried the accompanist to the dancer, and pointed to\nDutlof. "Isn\'t that your sponsor?"\n\n"Where? O my dearly beloved friend!" screamed the recruit,--the same\none whom Dutlof had bought,--and stumbling out on his weary feet, and\nlifting his jug of vodka above his head, he made for the team. "Mishka!\nwaiter! a glass," he shouted. "Master! O my dear old friend! How glad\nI am! fact!" he went on, jerking his tipsy head towards the tely\xc3\xa9ga,\nand began to treat the muzh\xc3\xadks and the women to vodka. The muzh\xc3\xadks\naccepted, the women declined. "You are darlings, why shouldn\'t I treat\nyou?" cried the recruit, throwing his arms around the old women.\n\nA woman peddling eatables was standing in the throng. The recruit saw\nher, grabbed her tray, and flung its contents into the tely\xc3\xa9ga.\n\n"D-don\'t worry, I\'ll p-pay--the d-deuce," he began to scream in a\ndrunken voice; and here he drew out of his stocking a purse with money\nin it, and flung it to the waiter.\n\nHe stood leaning with his elbows on the wagon, and stared, with moist\neyes, at those who sat in it.\n\n"Which is my m\xc3\xa1tushka?" he asked. "Be you her? I\'ve got something for\nher too."\n\nHe pondered a moment, and diving into his pocket brought out a new\nhandkerchief folded, untied another which he had put on as a girdle\nunder his coat, hastily took the red scarf from his neck, bundled them\ntogether, and thrust them into the old woman\'s lap.\n\n"Na! I give \'em to you," he said, in a voice that grew weaker and\nweaker.\n\n"Why? thank you, friend!--What a simple lad he is!" said she,\naddressing the old man Dutlof, who came up to their tely\xc3\xa9ga.\n\nThe recruit was now entirely quiet and dumb, and kept dropping his head\nlower and lower, as though he were going to sleep then and there.\n\n"I\'m going for you, I\'m going to destruction for you," he repeated.\n"And so I make you a present."\n\n"I s\'pose he\'s really got a mother," cried some one in the crowd. "Fine\nyoung fellow! Too bad!"\n\nThe recruit lifted his head. "I\'ve got a mother," he said. "I\'ve got a\nfather[46] too. They\'ve all given me up, though. Listen, old woman!" he\nadded, seizing Ilyushkin\'s mother by the hand. "I made you a present.\nListen to me, for Christ\'s sake. Go to my village of Vodnoe, ask there\nfor Nikonof\'s old woman,--she\'s my own mother, you understand,--and\ntell this same old woman, Nikonof\'s old woman--third hut at the\nend--new pump--tell her that Aly\xc3\xb3kha--your son--you know--Come!\nmusician, strike up!" he screamed.\n\nAnd once more he began to dance, talking all the time, and spilling the\nvodka that was left in the jug all over the ground.\n\nIgnat climbed into his wagon, and started to drive on.\n\n"Good-by, good luck to you," cried the old woman, as she wrapped\nherself up in her sheepskin.\n\nThe recruit suddenly stopped.\n\n"Go to the devil!" he shouted, threatening the teams with his doubled\nfist.\n\n"Oh, good Lord!"[47] ejaculated Ilyushkin\'s mother, crossing herself.\n\nIgnat started up the mare, and the teams drove away. Aleks\xc3\xa9i the\nrecruit still stood in the middle of the road, and doubling up his\nfists, with an expression of wrath on his face, berated the mush\xc3\xadks to\nthe best of his ability.\n\n"What are you standing here for? She\'s gone. The devil, cannibals!" he\nscreamed. "You won\'t escape from me! You devils! You dotards!"\n\nWith these words his voice failed him; he fell at full length, just\nwhere he stood in the middle of the road.\n\nSwiftly the Dutlofs drove across the country, and as they looked\naround, the crowd of recruits were already lost from sight. When they\nhad gone five versts, and were slowing up a little, Ignat got out of\nhis father\'s wagon, when the old man was drowsing, and got in with his\ncousin.\n\nThe two young men drank up the jug of vodka which they had brought\nfrom the city. Then after a little, Ilya struck up a song; the women\njoined in with him; Ignat gayly shouted in harmony. A jolly party,\nin a post-wagon, dashed swiftly by. The driver shouted to the horses\nharnessed to the two jolly tely\xc3\xa9gas. The postilion glanced at the\nhandsome faces of the muzh\xc3\xadks and the women in the tely\xc3\xa9ga as they\ndashed by, singing their merry songs, and waved his hand.\n\n\n[Footnote 32: _izb\xc3\xa1._]\n\n[Footnote 33: _Ilyushkin\'s baba._]\n\n[Footnote 34: _Ilyushkina baba._]\n\n[Footnote 35: _st\xc3\xa1rosta._]\n\n[Footnote 36: _dvor_.]\n\n[Footnote 37: _khozy\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafn_.]\n\n[Footnote 38: _molod\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafka_.]\n\n[Footnote 39: _khozhy\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafn._]\n\n[Footnote 40: a _meshch\xc3\xa1nin._]\n\n[Footnote 41: Mispronunciation of _quittance._]\n\n[Footnote 42: _starik-khozhy\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafn._]\n\n[Footnote 43: _izb\xc3\xa1_.]\n\n[Footnote 44: _khozy\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafka_.]\n\n[Footnote 45: _kal\xc3\xa1tch._]\n\n[Footnote 46: _b\xc3\xa1tiushka._]\n\n[Footnote 47: _okh Gospodi._]\n\n\n\n\nKHOLSTOM\xc3\x8dR.\n\n\n_THE HISTORY OF A HORSE._[1]\n\n\n(1861.)\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nConstantly higher and higher the sky lifted itself, wider and wider\nspread the dawn, whiter and whiter grew the unpolished silver of the\ndew, more and more lifeless the sickle of the moon, more vocal the\nforest. The men began to arise; and at the stables belonging to the\nb\xc3\xa1rin were heard with increasing frequency the whinnying of the horses,\nthe stamping of hoofs on the straw, and also the angry, shrill neighing\nof the animals collecting together, and even disputing with each other\nover something.\n\n"Noo! you got time enough; mighty hungry, ain\'t you?" said the old\ndrover, quickly opening the creaking gates. "Where you going?" he\nshouted, waving his hands at a mare which tried to run through the gate.\n\nNester, the drover, was dressed in a Cossack coat,[2] with a decorated\nleather belt around his waist; his knout was slung over his shoulder,\nand a handkerchief, containing some bread, was tied into his belt. In\nhis arms he carried a saddle and halter.\n\nThe horses were not in the least startled, nor did they show any\nresentment, at the drover\'s sarcastic tone: they made believe that it\nwas all the same to them, and leisurely moved back from the gate,--all\nexcept one old dark-bay mare, with a long flowing mane, who laid back\nher ears and quickly turned around. At this opportunity a young mare,\nwho was standing behind, and had nothing at all to do with this,\nwhinnied, and began to kick at the first horse that she fell in with.\n\n"No!" shouted the drover still more loudly and angrily, and turned to\nthe corner of the yard.[3]\n\nOut of all the horses,--there must have been nearly a hundred--that\nwere moving off toward their breakfast, none manifested so little\nimpatience as a piebald gelding, which stood alone in one corner under\nthe shed, and gazed with half-shut eyes, and bit on the oaken lining of\nthe shed.\n\nIt is hard to say what enjoyment the piebald gelding got from this, but\nhis expression while doing so was solemn and thoughtful.\n\n"Nonsense!" again cried the drover in the same tone, turning to him;\nand going up to him he laid the saddle and shiny blanket on a pile of\nmanure near him.\n\nThe piebald gelding ceased biting, and looked long at Nester without\nmoving. He did not manifest any sign of mirth or anger or sullenness,\nbut only drew in his whole belly and sighed heavily, heavily, and\nthen turned away. The drover took him by the neck, and gave him his\nbreakfast.\n\n"What are you sighing for?" asked Nester.\n\nThe horse switched his tail as though to say, "Well, it\'s nothing,\nNester." Nester put on the blanket and saddle, whereupon the horse\npricked up his ears, expressing as plainly as could be his disgust;\nbut he received nothing but execrations for this "rot," and then the\nsaddle-girth was pulled tight.\n\nAt this the gelding tried to swell out; but his mouth was thrust open,\nand a knee was pressed into his side, so that he was forced to let out\nhis breath. Notwithstanding this, when they got the bit between his\nteeth, he still pricked back his ears, and even turned round. Though he\nknew that this was of no avail, yet he seemed to reckon it essential\nto express his displeasure, and always showed it. When he was saddled,\nhe pawed with his swollen right leg, and began to champ the bit,--here\nalso for some special reason, because it was full time for him to know\nthat there could be no taste in bits.\n\nNester mounted the gelding by the short stirrups, unwound his knout,\nfreed his Cossack coat from under his knee, settled down in the\nsaddle in that position peculiar to coachmen, hunters, and drivers,\nand twitched on the reins. The gelding lifted his head, showing a\ndisposition to go where he should be directed, but he stirred not from\nthe spot. He knew that before he went there would be much shouting on\nthe part of him who sat on his back, and many orders to be given to\nVaska, the other drover, and to the horses. In fact Nester began to\nshout, "Vaska! ha, Vaska! have you let out any of the mares,--hey?\nWhere are you, you old devil? No-o! Are you asleep? Open the gate. Let\nthe mares go first," and so on.\n\nThe gates creaked. Vaska, morose, and still full of sleep, holding a\nhorse by the bridle, stood at the gate-post and let the horses out.\nThe horses, one after the other, gingerly stepping over the straw and\nsniffing it, began to pass out,--the young fillies, the yearlings, the\nlittle colts; while the mares with young stepped along needfully, one\nat a time, avoiding all contact. The young fillies sometimes crowded in\ntwo at once, three at once, throwing their heads across each other\'s\nbacks, and hitting their hoofs against the gates, each time receiving a\nvolley of abuse from the drovers. The colts sometimes kicked the mares\nwhom they did not know, and whinnied loudly in answer to the short\nneighing of their mothers.\n\nA young filly, full of wantonness, as soon as she got outside the\ngate, tossed her head up and around, began to back, and whinnied,\nbut nevertheless did not venture to dash ahead of the old gray,\ngrain-bestrewed Zhuldiba, who, with a gentle but solid step, swinging\nher belly from side to side, was always the dignified leader of the\nother horses.\n\nAfter a few moments the lively yard was left in melancholy loneliness;\nthe posts stood out in sadness under the empty sheds, and only the\nsodden straw, soiled with dung, was to be seen.\n\nFamiliar as this picture of emptiness was to the piebald gelding, it\nseemed to have a melancholy effect upon him. He slowly, as though\nmaking a bow, lowered and lifted his head, sighed as deeply as the\ntightly drawn girth permitted, and dragging his somewhat bent and\ndecrepit legs, he started off after the herd, carrying the old Nester\non his bony back.\n\n"I know now. As soon as we get out on the road, he will go to work to\nmake a light, and smoke his wooden pipe with its copper mounting and\nchain," thought the gelding. "I am glad of this, because it is early in\nthe morning and the dew is on the grass, and this odor is agreeable\nto me, and brings up many pleasant recollections. I am sorry only that\nwhen the old man has his pipe in his mouth he always becomes excited,\ngets to imagining things, and sits on one side, far over on one side,\nand on that side it always hurts. However, God be with him. It\'s no new\nthing for me to suffer for the sake of others. I have even come to find\nsome equine satisfaction in this. Let him play that he\'s cock of the\nwalk, poor fellow; but it\'s for his own pleasure that he looks so big,\nsince no one sees him at all. Let him ride sidewise," said the horse to\nhimself; and, stepping gingerly on his crooked legs, he walked along\nthe middle of the road.\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Dedicated to the memory of M. A. Stakhovitch, the\noriginator of the subject, which was given by his brother to Count\nTolstoi.]\n\n[Footnote 2: _kasak\xc3\xadn._]\n\n[Footnote 3: _dvor_.]\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nAfter driving the herd down to the river, near which the horses were\nto graze, Nester dismounted and took off the saddle. Meantime the herd\nbegan slowly to scatter over the as yet untrodden field, covered with\ndew and with vapor rising alike from the damp meadow and the river that\nencircled it.\n\nTaking off the blanket from the piebald gelding, Nester scratched\nhim on his neck; and the horse in reply expressed his happiness and\nsatisfaction by shutting his eyes.\n\n"The old dog likes it," said Nester.\n\nThe gelding really did not like this scratching very much, and only\nout of delicacy intimated that it was agreeable to him. He shook his\nhead as a sign of assent. But suddenly, unexpectedly, and without any\nreason, Nester, imagining perhaps that too great familiarity might\ngive the horse false ideas about what he meant,--Nester, without any\nwarning, pushed away his head, and, lifting up the bridle, struck the\nhorse very severely with the buckle on his bare leg, and, without\nsaying any thing, went up the hillock to a stump, near which he sat\ndown as though nothing had happened.\n\nThough this proceeding incensed the gelding, he did not manifest it;\nand leisurely switching his thin tail, and sniffing at something, and\nmerely for recreation cropping at the grass, he wandered down toward\nthe river.\n\nNot paying any heed to the antics played around him by the young\nfillies, the colts, and the yearlings, and knowing that the health of\neverybody, and especially one who had attained his years, was subserved\nby getting a good drink of water on an empty stomach, and then eating,\nhe turned his steps to where the bank was less steep and slippery; and\nwetting his hoofs and gambrels, he thrust his snout into the river,\nand began to suck the water through his lips drawn back, to puff with\nhis distending sides, and out of pure satisfaction to switch his thin,\npiebald tail with its leathery stump.\n\nA chestnut filly, always mischievous, always nagging the old horse, and\ncausing him manifold unpleasantnesses, came down to the water as though\nfor her own necessities, but really merely for the sake of roiling the\nwater in front of his nose.\n\nBut the gelding had already drunk enough, and apparently giving no\nthought to the impudent mare, calmly put one miry leg before the other,\nshook his head, and, turning aside from the wanton youngster, began\nto eat. Dragging his legs in a peculiar manner, and not tramping down\nthe abundant grass, the horse grazed for nearly three hours, scarcely\nstirring from the spot. Having eaten so much that his belly hung down\nlike a bag from his thin, sharp ribs, he stood solidly on his four weak\nlegs, so that as little strain as possible might come on any one of\nthem,--at least on the right foreleg, which was weaker than all,--and\nwent to sleep.\n\nThere is an honorable old age, there is a miserable old age, there is a\npitiable old age; there is also an old age that is both honorable and\nmiserable. The old age which the piebald gelding had reached was of\nthis latter sort.\n\nThe old horse was of a great size,--more than seventeen hands high.[4]\nHis color was white, spotted with black; at least, it used to be so,\nbut now the black spots had changed to a dirty brown. The regions of\nblack spots were three in number: one on the head, including the mane,\nand side of the nose, the star on the forehead, and half of the neck;\nthe long mane, tangled with burrs, was striped white and brownish; the\nsecond spotted place ran along the right side, and covered half the\nbelly; the third was on the flank, including the upper part of the tail\nand half of the loins; the rest of the tail was whitish, variegated.\n\nThe huge, corrugated head, with deep hollows under the eyes, and with\npendent black lips, somewhat lacerated, sat heavily and draggingly\non the neck, which bent under its leanness, and seemed to be made of\nwood. From under the pendent lip could be seen the dark-red tongue\nprotruding on one side, and the yellow, worn tusks of his lower\nteeth. His ears, one of which was slit, fell over sidewise, and only\noccasionally he twitched them a little to scare away the sticky flies.\nOne long tuft still remaining of the forelock hung behind the ears;\nthe broad forehead was hollowed and rough; the skin hung loose on the\nbig cheek-bones. On the neck and head the veins stood out in knots,\ntrembling and twitching whenever a fly touched them. The expression of\nhis face was sternly patient, deeply thoughtful, and expressive of pain.\n\nHis forelegs were crooked at the knees. On both hoofs were swellings;\nand on the one which was half covered by the marking, there was\nnear the knee at the back a sore boil. The hind legs were in better\ncondition, but there had been severe bruises long before on the\nhaunches, and the hair did not grow on those places. His legs seemed\ndisproportionately long, because his body was so emaciated. His ribs,\nthough also thick, were so exposed and drawn that the hide seemed dried\nin the hollows between them.\n\nThe back and withers were variated with old scars, and behind was still\na freshly galled and purulent slough. The black stump of the tail,\nwhere the vertebr\xc3\xa6 could be counted, stood out long and almost bare. On\nthe brown flank near the tail, where it was overgrown with white hairs,\nwas a scar as big as one\'s hand, that must have been from a bite.\nAnother cicatrice was to be seen on the off shoulder. The houghs of the\nhind legs and the tail were foul with excrement. The hair all over the\nbody, though short, stood out straight.\n\nBut in spite of the filthy old age to which this horse had come,\nany one looking at him would have involuntarily thought, and a\n_connoisseur_ would have said immediately, that he must have been in\nhis day a remarkably fine horse. The _connoisseur_ would have said also\nthat there was only one breed in Russia[5] that could give such broad\nbones, such huge joints, such hoofs, such slender leg-bones, such an\narched neck, and, most of all, such a skull,--eyes large, black, and\nbrilliant, and such a thoroughbred network of nerves over his head and\nneck, and such delicate skin and hair.\n\nIn reality there was something noble in the form of this horse, and\nin the terrible union in him of the repulsive signs of decrepitude,\nthe increased variegatedness of his hide, and his actions, and the\nexpression of self-dependence, and the calm consciousness of beauty\nand strength.\n\nLike a living ruin he stood in the middle of the dewy field, alone;\nwhile not far away from him were heard the galloping, the neighing, the\nlively whinnying, the snorting, of the scattered herd.\n\n\n[Footnote 4: Two _arshin,_ three _vershoks,_= 6.65 feet.]\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nThe sun was now risen above the forest, and shone brightly on the grass\nand the winding river. The dew dried away and fell off in drops. Like\nsmoke the last of the morning mist rolled up. Curly clouds made their\nappearance, but as yet there was no wind. On the other side of the\ngleaming river stood the rye, bending on its stalks, and the air was\nfragrant with bright verdure and the flowers. The cuckoo cooed from\nthe forest with echoing voice; and Nester, lying flat on his back, was\nreckoning up how many years of life lay before him. The larks arose\nfrom the rye and the field. The belated hare stood up among the horses\nand leaped without restraint, and sat down by the copse and pricked up\nhis ears to listen.\n\nVaska went to sleep, burying his head in the grass; the mares, making\nwide circuits around him, scattered themselves on the field below.\nThe older ones, neighing, picked out a shining track across the dewy\ngrass, and constantly tried to find some place where they might be\nundisturbed. They no longer grazed, but only nibbled on the sweet\ngrass-blades. The whole herd was imperceptibly moving in one direction.\n\nAnd again the old Zhuldiba, stately stepping before the others, showed\nhow far it was possible to go. The young Mushka, who had cast her\nfirst foal, constantly hinnying, and lifting her tail, was scolding\nher violet-colored colt. The young Atl\xc3\xa1snaya, with smooth and shining\nskin, dropping her head so that her black and silken forelock hid her\nforehead and eyes, was gambolling in the grass, nipping and tossing\nand stamping her leg, with its hairy fetlock. One of the older little\ncolts,--he must have been imagining, some kind of game,--lifting, for\nthe twenty-sixth time, his rather short and tangled tail, like a plume,\ngambolled around his dam, who calmly picked at the herbage, having\nevidently had time to sum up her son\'s character, and only occasionally\nstopping to look askance at him out of her big black eye.\n\nOne of these same young colts,--black as a coal, with a large head\nwith a marvellous top-knot rising above his ears, and his tail\nstill inclining to the side on which he had laid in his mother\'s\nbelly--pricking up his ears, and opening his stupid eyes, as he\nstood motionless in his place, looked steadily at the colt jumping\nand dancing, not at all understanding why he did it, whether out of\njealousy or indignation.\n\nSome suckle, butting with their noses; others, for some unknown reason,\nnotwithstanding their mothers\' invitation, move along in a short,\nawkward trot, in a diametrically opposite direction, as though seeking\nsomething, and then, no one knows why, stop short and hinny in a\ndesperately penetrating voice. Some lie on their sides in a row; some\ntake lessons in grazing; some try to scratch themselves with their hind\nlegs behind the ear.\n\nTwo mares, still with young, go off by themselves, and slowly moving\ntheir legs continue to graze. Evidently their condition is respected by\nthe others, and none of the young colts ventures to go near or disturb\nthem. If any saucy young steed takes it into his head to approach too\nnear to them, then merely a motion of an ear or tail is sufficient to\nshow him all the impropriety of his behavior.\n\nThe yearlings and the young fillies pretend to be full-grown and\ndignified, and rarely indulge in pranks, or join their gay companions.\nThey ceremoniously nibble at the blades of grass, bending their\nswan-like, short-shorn necks, and, as though they also were blessed\nwith tails, switch their little brushes. Just like the big horses, some\nof them lie down, roll over, and scratch each others\' backs.\n\nA very jolly band consists of the two-year-old and the three-year-old\nmares who have never foaled. They almost all wander off by themselves,\nand make a specially jolly virgin throng. Among them is heard a\ngreat tramping and stamping, hinnying and whinnying. They gather\ntogether, lay their heads over each others\' shoulders, snuff the air,\nleap; and sometimes, lifting the tail like an oriflamme, proudly and\ncoquettishly, in a half-trot, half-gallop, caracole in front of their\ncompanions.\n\nConspicuous for beauty and sprightly dashing ways, among all this young\nthrong, was the wanton bay mare. Whatever she set on foot, the others\nalso did; wherever she went, there in her track followed also the whole\nthrong of beauties.\n\nThe wanton was in a specially playful frame of mind this morning. The\nspirit of mischief was in her, just as it sometimes comes upon men.\nEven at the river-side, playing her pranks upon the old gelding, she\nhad galloped along in the water, pretending that something had scared\nher, snorting, and then dashed off at full speed across the field;\nso that Vaska was constrained to gallop after her, and after the\nothers who were at her heels. Then, after grazing a little while, she\nbegan to roll, then to tease the old mares, by dashing in front of\nthem. Then she separated a suckling colt from its dam, and began to\nchase after it, pretending that she wanted to bite it. The mother was\nfrightened, and ceased to graze; the little colt squealed in piteous\ntones. But the wanton young mare did not touch it, but only scared it,\nand made a spectacle for her comrades, who looked with sympathy on her\nantics.\n\nThen she set out to turn the head of the roan horse, which a muzh\xc3\xadk,\nfar away on the other side of the river, was driving with a plough in\nthe rye-field. She stood proudly, somewhat on one side, lifting her\nhead high, shook herself, and neighed in a sweet, significant, and\nalluring voice.\n\n\'Tis the time when the rail-bird, running from place to place among the\nthick reeds, passionately calls his mate; when also the cuckoo and the\nquail sing of love; and the flowers send to each other, on the breeze,\ntheir aromatic dust.\n\n"And I am young and kind and strong," said the jolly wanton\'s neighing,\n"and till now it has not been given to me to experience the sweetness\nof this feeling, never yet to feel it; and no lover, no, not one, has\nyet come to woo me."\n\nAnd the significant neighing rang with youthful melancholy over lowland\nand field, and it came to the ears of the roan horse far away. He\npricked up his ears, and stopped. The muzh\xc3\xadk kicked him with his wooden\nshoe; but the roan was bewitched by the silver sound of the distant\nneighing, and whinnied in reply. The muzh\xc3\xadk grew angry, twitched him\nwith the reins, and again kicked him in the belly with his bast shoe,\nso that he did not have a chance to complete all that he had to say\nin his neighing, but was forced to go on his way. And the roan horse\nfelt a sweet sadness in his heart; and the sounds from the far-off\nrye-field, of that unfinished and passionate neigh, and the angry voice\nof the muzh\xc3\xadk, long echoed in the ears of the herd.\n\nIf through one sound of her voice the roan horse could become so\ncaptivated as to forget his duty, what would have become of him if he\nhad had full view of the beautiful wanton, as she stood pricking up her\nears, inflating her nostrils, breathing in the air, and filled with\nlonging, while her young and beauteous body trembled as she called to\nhim?\n\nBut the wanton did not long ponder over her novel sensations. When the\nvoice of the roan was still, she whinnied scornfully, and, sinking her\nhead, began to paw the ground; and then she trotted off to wake up and\ntease the piebald gelding. The piebald gelding was a long-suffering\nbutt for the amusement of this happy young wanton. She made him suffer\nmore than men did. But in neither case did he give way to wrath. He was\nindispensable to men, but why should these young horses torment him?\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nHe was old, they were young; he was lean, they were fat; he was sad,\nthey were happy. So he was thoroughly strange, alien, an absolutely\ndifferent creature; and it was impossible for them to have compassion\non him. Horses have pity only on themselves, and rarely on those whose\nplaces they may easily come themselves to fill. But, indeed, was not\nthe piebald gelding himself to blame, that he was old and gaunt and\ncrippled?...\n\nOne would think that he was not to blame. But in equine ethics he was,\nand only those were right who were strong, young, and happy; those\nwho had all life before them; those whose every muscle was tense with\nsuperfluous energy, and curled their tails into a wheel.\n\nMaybe the piebald gelding himself understood this, and in tranquil\nmoments was agreed that he was to blame because he had lived out all\nhis life, that he must pay for his life; but he was after all only\na horse, and he could not restrain himself often from feeling hurt,\nmelancholy, and discontented, when he looked on all these young horses\nwho tormented him for the very thing to which they would be subjected\nwhen they came to the end of their lives.\n\nThe reason for the heartlessness of these horses was a peculiarly\naristocratic feeling. Every one of them was related, either on the side\nof father or mother, to the celebrated Smetanka; but it was not known\nfrom what stock the piebald gelding sprang. The gelding was a chance\ncomer, bought at market three years before for eighty paper rubles.\n\nThe young chestnut mare, as though accidentally wandering about, came\nup to the piebald gelding\'s very nose, and brushed against him. He knew\nbefore-hand what it meant, and did not open his eyes, but laid back his\nears and showed his teeth. The mare wheeled around, and made believe\nthat she was going to let fly at him with her heels. He opened his\neyes, and wandered off to another part. He had no desire to sleep, and\nbegan to crop the grass. Again the wanton young mare, accompanied by\nher confederates, went to the gelding. A two-year-old mare with a star\non her forehead, very stupid, always in mischief, and always ready to\nimitate the chestnut mare, trotted along with her, and, as imitators\nalways do, began to: play the same trick that the instigator had done.\n\nThe brown mare marched along at an ordinary gait, as though bent on her\nown affairs, and passed by the gelding\'s very nose, not looking at him,\nso that he really did not know whether to be angry or not; and this was\nthe very fun of the thing.\n\nThis was what she did; but the starred mare following in her steps, and\nfeeling very gay, hit the gelding on the chest. He showed his teeth\nonce more, whinnied, and, with a quickness of motion unexpected on his\npart, sprang at the mare, and bit her on the flank. The young mare with\nthe star flew out with her bind legs, and kicked the old horse heavily\non his thin bare ribs. The old horse uttered a hoarse noise, and was\nabout to make another lunge, but thought better of it, and sighing\ndeeply turned away.\n\nIt must have been that all the young horses of the drove regarded as\na personal insult the boldness which the piebald gelding permitted\nhimself to show toward the starred mare; for all the rest of the day\nthey gave him no chance to graze, and left him not a moment of peace,\nso that the drover several times rebuked them, and could not comprehend\nwhat they were doing.\n\nThe gelding was so abused that he himself walked up to Nester when it\nwas time for the old man to drive back the drove, and he showed greater\nhappiness and content when Nester saddled him and mounted him.\n\nGod knows what the old gelding\'s thoughts were as he bore on his back\nthe old man Nester. Did he think with bitterness of these importunate\nand merciless youngsters? or, with a scornful and silent pride peculiar\nto old age, did he pardon his persecutors? At all events, he did not\nmake manifest any of his thoughts till he reached home.\n\nThat evening some cronies had come to see Nester; and as the horses\nwere driven by the huts of the domestics, he noticed a horse and\ntely\xc3\xa9ga standing at his doorstep. After he had driven in the horses, he\nwas in such a hurry that he did not take the saddle off: he left the\ngelding at the yard,[5] and shouted to Vaska to unsaddle the animal,\nthen shut the gate, and hurried to his friends.\n\nPerhaps owing to the affront put upon the starred mare, the descendant\nof Smetanka, by that "low trash" bought for a horse, and not knowing\nfather or mother, and therefore offending the aristocratic sentiment\nof the whole community; or because the gelding with the high saddle\nwithout a rider presented a strangely fantastic spectacle for the\nhorses,--at all events, that night something extraordinary took place\nin the paddock. All the horses, young and old, showing their teeth,\ntagged after the gelding, and drove him from one part of the yard to\nthe other; the trampling of their hoofs echoed around him as he sighed\nand drew in his thin sides.\n\nThe gelding could not longer endure this, could not longer avoid their\nkicks. He halted in the middle of the field: his face expressed the\nrepulsive, weak anger of helpless old age, and despair besides. He laid\nback his ears, and suddenly[6] something happened that caused all the\nhorses suddenly to become quiet. A very old mare, Viazop\xc3\xbarikha, came up\nand sniffed the gelding, and sighed. The gelding also sighed.\n\n.. .. .. .. .. .\n\n\n[Footnote 5: _dvor_.]\n\n[Footnote 6: So in the original.]\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nIn the middle of the yard, flooded with the moonlight, stood the\ntall, gaunt figure of the gelding, still wearing the high saddle with\nits prominent pommel. The horses, motionless and in deep silence,\nstood around him, as though they were learning something new and\nextraordinary from him. And, indeed, something new and extraordinary\nthey learned from him.\n\nThis is what they learned from him:--\n\n.. .. .. .. .. .\n\n.. .. .. .. .. .\n\n\nFIRST NIGHT.\n\n"Yes, I was sired by Liubeznu\xc3\xaf I. Baba was my dam. According to\nthe genealogy my name is Muzh\xc3\xadk I. Muzh\xc3\xadk I., I am according to my\npedigree; but generally I am known as Kholstom\xc3\xadr, on account of a long\nand glorious gallop, the like of which never took place in Russia. In\nlineage no horse in the world stands higher than I, for good blood.\nI would never have told you this. Why should I?

The first remark made about\nmy hide, I remember, deeply surprised me and my dam.\n\n"I must have been foaled in the night. In the morning, licked clean by\nmy dam\'s tongue, I stood on my legs. I remember all my sensations, and\nthat every thing seemed to me perfectly wonderful, and, at the same\ntime, perfectly simple. Our stalls were in a long, warm corridor, with\nlatticed gates, through which nothing could be seen.\n\n"My dam tempted me to suckle; but I was so innocent as yet that I\nbunted her with my nose, now under her fore-legs, now in other places.\nSuddenly my dam gazed at the latticed gate, and, throwing her leg over\nme, stepped to one side. One of the grooms was looking in at us through\nthe lattice.\n\n"\'See, Baba has foaled!\' he exclaimed, and began to draw the bolt. He\ncame in over the straw bed, and took me up in his arms. \'Come and look,\nTaras!\' he cried; \'see what a piebald colt, a perfect magpie!\'\n\n"I tore myself away from him, and fell on my knees.\n\n"\'See, a perfect little devil!\' he said.\n\n"My dam became disquieted; but she did not take my part, and merely\ndrew a long, long breath, and stepped to one side. The grooms came, and\nbegan to look at me. One ran to tell the equerry.\n\n"All laughed as they looked at my spotting, and gave me various odd\nnames. I did not understand these names, nor did my dam either. Up to\nthat time in all my family there had never been a single piebald known.\nWe had no idea that there was any thing disgraceful in it. And then all\nexamined my structure and strength.\n\n"See what a lively one!" said the hostler. \'You can\'t hold him.\'\n\n"In a little while came the equerry, and began to marvel at my\ncoloring. He also seemed disgusted.\n\n"\'What a nasty beast!\' he cried. \'The general will not keep him in the\nstud. Ekh! Baba, you have caused me much trouble,\' he said, turning\nto my dam. \'You ought to have foaled a colt with a star, but this is\ncompletely piebald.\'\n\n"My dam vouchsafed no answer, and, as always in such circumstances,\nmerely sighed again.\n\n"\'What kind of a devil was his sire? A regular muzh\xc3\xadk!\' he went on to\nsay. \'It is impossible to keep him in the stud; it\'s a shame! But we\'ll\nsee, we\'ll see,\' said he; and all said the same as they looked at me.\n\n"After a few days the general himself came. He took a look at me, and\nagain all seemed horror-struck, and scolded me and my mother also on\naccount of my hide. \'But we\'ll see, we\'ll see,\' said every one, as soon\nas they caught sight of me.\n\n"Until spring we young colts lived in separate cells with our dams;\nonly occasionally, when the snow on the roof of the sheds began to\nmelt in the sun, they would let us out into the wide yard, spread with\nfresh straw. There for the first time I became acquainted with all my\nkin, near and remote. There I saw how from different doors issued all\nthe famous mares of that time with their colts. There was the old\nHolland mare, Mushka, sired by Smetankin, Krasnukha, the saddle-horse\nDobrokhot\xc3\xadkha, all celebrities at that time. All gathered together\nthere with their colts, walked up and down in the sunshine, rolled over\non the fresh straw, and sniffed of each other like ordinary horses.\n\n"I cannot even now forget the sight of that paddock, full of the\nbeauties of that day. It may seem strange to you to think of me as\never having been young and frisky, but I used to be. This very same\nViazop\xc3\xbarikha was there then, a yearling, whose mane had just been\ncut,[8]--a kind, jolly, frolicsome little horse. But let it not be\ntaken as unkindly meant when I say, that, though she is now considered\na rarity among you on account of her pedigree, then she was only one of\nthe meanest horses of that stud. She herself will corroborate this.\n\n"Though my coat of many colors had been displeasing to the men, it\nwas exceedingly attractive to all the horses. They all stood round\nme, expressing their delight, and frisking with me. I even began to\nforget the words of the men about my hide, and felt happy. But I soon\nexperienced the first sorrow of my life, and the cause of it was my\ndam. As soon as it began to thaw, and the swallows chirped on the roof,\nand the spring made itself felt more and more in the air, my dam began\nto change in her behavior toward me.\n\n"Her whole character was transformed. Suddenly, without any reason,\nshe began to frisk, galloping around the yard, which certainly did not\naccord with her dignified growth; then she would pause and consider,\nand begin to whinny; then she would bite and kick her sister mares;\nthen she began to smell of me, and neigh with dissatisfaction; then\ntrotting out into the sun she would lay her head across the shoulder\nof my two-year-old sister K\xc3\xbapchika, and long and earnestly scratch her\nback, and push me away from nursing her. One time the equerry came,\ncommanded the halter to be put on her, and they led her out of the\npaddock. She whinnied; I replied to her, and darted after her, but she\nwould not even look at me. The groom Taras seized me in both arms, just\nas they shut the door on my mother\'s retreating form.\n\n"I struggled, threw the groom on the straw; but the door was closed,\nand I only heard my mother\'s whinnying growing fainter and fainter.\nAnd in this whinnying I perceived that she called not for me, but I\nperceived a very different expression. In reply to her voice, there was\nheard in the distance a mighty voice.\n\n"I don\'t remember how Taras got out of my stall; it was too grievous\nfor me. I felt that I had forever lost my mother\'s love; and wholly\nbecause I was a piebald, I said to myself, remembering what the people\nsaid of my hide; and such passionate anger came over me, that I began\nto pound the sides of the stall with my head and feet, and I pounded\nthem until the sweat poured from me, and I could not stand up from\nexhaustion.\n\n"After some time my dam returned to me. I heard her as she came along\nthe corridor in a prancing trot, wholly unusual to her, and entered our\nstall. The door was opened for her. I did not recognize her, so much\nyounger and handsomer had she grown. She snuffed at me, neighed, and\nbegan to snort. But in her whole expression I could see that she did\nnot love me.\n\n"Soon they led us to pasture. I now began to experience new pleasures\nwhich consoled me for the loss of my mother\'s love. I had friends and\ncompanions. We learned together to eat grass, to neigh like the old\nhorses, and to lift our tails and gallop in wide circles around our\ndams. This was a happy time. Every thing was forgiven to me; all loved\nme, and were loved by me, and looked indulgently on all that I did.\nThis did not last long.\n\n"Here something terrible happened to me."\n\nThe gelding sighed deeply, deeply, and moved aside from the horses.\n\nThe dawn was already far advanced. The gates creaked. Nester came. The\nhorses scattered. The drover straightened the saddle on the gelding\'s\nback, and drove away the horses.\n\n\n[Footnote 7: _py\xc3\xa9gi._]\n\n[Footnote 8: All expressed in the word _strig\xc3\xbanchik._]\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nSECOND NIGHT.\n\n\nAs soon as the horses were driven in, they once more gathered around\nthe piebald.\n\n"In the month of August," continued the horse, u I was separated from\nmy mother, and I did not experience any unusual grief. I saw that she\nwas already suckling a small brother,--the famous Usan,--and I was not\nwhat I had been before. I was not jealous, but I felt that I had become\nmore than ever cool toward her. Besides, I knew that in leaving my\nmother I should be transferred to the general division of young horses,\nwhere we were stalled in twos and threes, and every day all went out to\nexercise.\n\nI was in one stall with Milui. Milui was a saddle-horse, and afterwards\nbelonged to the emperor himself, and was put into pictures and\nstatuary. At that time he was a mere colt, with a shiny soft coat,\na swan-like neck, and slender straight legs. He was always lively,\ngood-natured, and lovable; was always ready to frisk, and be caressed,\nand sport with either horse or man. He and I could not help being good\nfriends, living together as we did; and our friendship lasted till we\ngrew up. He was gay, and inclined to be wanton. Even then he began to\nfeel the tender passion to disport with the fillies, and he used to\nmake sport of my guilelessness. To my unhappiness I myself, out of\negotism, tried to follow his example, and very soon was in love. And\nthis early inclination of mine was the cause, in great measure, of my\nfate.\n\n"But I am not going to relate all the story of my unhappy first love;\nshe herself remembers my stupid passion, which ended for me in the most\nimportant change in my life.\n\n"The drovers came along, drove her away, and pounded me. In the evening\nthey led me into a special stall. I whinnied the whole night long, as\nthough with a presentiment of what was coming on the morrow.\n\n"In the morning the general, the equerry, the under grooms, and the\nhostlers came into the corridor where my stall was, and set up a\nterrible screaming. The general screamed to the head groom; the groom\njustified himself, saying that he had not given orders to send me\naway, but that the under grooms had done it of their own free will.\nThe general said that it had spoiled every thing, but that it was\nimpossible to keep young stallions. The head groom replied that he\nwould have it attended to. They calmed down and went out, I did not\nunderstand it at all,--except that something concerning me was under\nconsideration.\n\n.. .. .. .. .. .\n\n.. .. .. .. .. .\n\n"On the next day I had ceased forever to whinny; I became what I am\nnow. All the light of my eyes was quenched. Nothing seemed sweet to\nme; I became self-absorbed, and began to be pensive. At first I felt\nindifferent to every thing. I ceased even to eat, to drink, and to run;\nand all thought of sprightly sport was gone. Then it nevermore came\ninto my mind to kick up my heels, to roll over, to whinny, without\nbringing up the terrible question,--Why? for what purpose?\' And my\nvigor died away.\n\n"Once they led me out at eventide, at the time when they were driving\nthe stud home from the field. From afar I saw already the cloud of dust\nin which could be barely distinguished the familiar lineaments of all\nof our mothers. I heard the cheerful snorting, and the trampling of\nhoofs. I stopped short, though the halter-rope by which the groom held\nme cut my neck; and I gazed at the approaching drove as one gazes at\nhappiness that is lost forever and will ne\'er return again. They drew\nnear, and my eyes fell upon forms so well known to me,--beautiful,\ngrand, plump, full of life every one. Who among them all deigned to\nglance at me? I did not feel the pain that the groom in pulling the\nrope inflicted. I forgot myself, and involuntarily tried to whinny\nas of yore, and to gallop off; but my whinnying sounded melancholy,\nridiculous, and unbecoming. There was no ribaldry among the stud, but I\nnoticed that many of them from politeness turned away from me.\n\n"It was evident that in their eyes I was despicable and pitiable, and\nworst of all ridiculous. My slender, weakly neck, my big head (I had\nbecome thin), my long, thick legs, and the awkward gait that I struck\nup, in my old fashion, around the groom, all must have seemed absurd to\nthem. No one heeded my whinnying, all turned away from me.\n\n"Suddenly I comprehended it all, comprehended how I was forever\nsundered from them, every one; and I know not how I stumbled home\nbehind the groom.\n\n"I had already shown a tendency toward gravity and thoughtfulness;\nbut now a decided change came over me. My variegated coat, which\noccasioned such a strange prejudice in men, my terrible and unexpected\nunhappiness, and, moreover, my peculiarly isolated position in the\nstud--which I felt, but could never explain to myself--compelled me to\nturn my thoughts inward upon myself. I pondered on the disgust that\npeople showed when they berated me for being a piebald; I pondered on\nthe inconstancy of maternal and especially of female affection, and its\ndependence upon physical conditions; and, above all, I pondered on the\ncharacteristics of that strange race of mortals with whom we are so\nclosely bound, and whom we call men,--those characteristics which were\nthe source of the peculiarity of my position in the stud, felt by me\nbut incomprehensible.\n\n"The significance of this, peculiarity, and of the human\ncharacteristics on which it was based, was discovered to me by the\nfollowing incident:--\n\n"It was winter, at Christmas-tide. All day long no fodder had been\ngiven to me, nor had I been led out to water. I afterwards learned that\nthis arose from our groom being drunk. On this day the equerry came to\nme, saw that I had no food, and began to use hard language about the\nmissing groom, and went %way.\n\n"On the next day, the groom with his mates came out to our stalls to\ngive us some hay. I noticed that he was especially pale and glum, and\nin the expression of his long back there was a something significant\nand demanding sympathy.\n\n"He austerely flung the hay behind the grating. I laid my head over his\nshoulder; but he struck me such a hard blow with his fist on the nose,\nthat I started back. Then he kicked me in the belly with his boot.\n\n"\'If it hadn\'t been for this scurvy beast,\' said he, \'there wouldn\'t\nhave been any trouble.\'\n\n"\'Why?\' asked another groom.\n\n"\'He doesn\'t come to inquire about the count\'s you bet! But twice a day\nhe comes out to look after his own.\'\n\n"\'Have they given him the piebald?\' inquired another.\n\n"\'Whether they\'ve given it to him or sold it to him, the dog only\nknows! The count\'s might die o\' starvation--it wouldn\'t make any\ndifference; but see how it upset him when I didn\'t give _his_ horse\nhis fodder! \'Go to bed,\' says he, \'and then you\'ll get a basting.\' No\nChristianity in it. More pity on the cattle than on a man. I don\'t\nbelieve he\'s ever been christened, he himself counted the blows, the\nbarbarian! The general did not use the whip so. He made my back all\nwelts. There\'s no soul of a Christian in him!\'\n\n"Now, what they said about whips and Christianity, I understood well\nenough; but it was perfectly dark to me as to the meaning of the words,\n_my horse, his horse,_ by which I perceived that men understood some\nsort of bond between me and the groom. Wherein consisted this bond, I\ncould not then understand at all. Only long after, when I was separated\nfrom the other horses, I came to learn what it meant. At that time I\ncould not understand at all that it meant that they considered _me_ the\nproperty of a man. To say _my horse_ in reference to me, a live horse,\nseemed to me as strange as to say, _my earth, my atmosphere, my water._\n\n"But these words had a monstrous influence upon me. I pondered upon\nthem ceaselessly; and only after long and varied relations with men\ndid I come at last to comprehend the meaning that men find in these\nstrange words.\n\n"The meaning is this: Men rule in life, not by deeds, but by words.\nThey love not so much the possibility of doing or not doing any thing,\nas the possibility of talking about different objects in words agreed\nupon between them. Such words, considered very important among them,\nare the words, _my, mine, ours,_ which they employ for various things,\nbeings, and objects; even for the earth, people, and horses. In regard\nto any particular thing, they agree that only one person shall say \'It\nis _mine._\' And he who in this play, which they engage in, can say\n_mine_ in regard to the greatest number of things, is considered the\nmost fortunate among them. Why this is so, I know not; but it is so.\nLong before, I had tried to explain this to my satisfaction, by some\ndirect advantage; but it seemed that I was wrong.\n\n"Many of the men who, for instance, called me their horse, did not ride\non me, but entirely different men rode on me. They themselves did not\nfeed me, but entirely different people fed me. Again, it was not those\nwho called me their horse who treated me kindly, but the coachman, the\nveterinary, and, as a general thing, outside men.\n\n"Afterwards, as I widened the sphere of my experiences, I became\nconvinced that the concept _my,_ as applied not only to us horses,\nbut to other things, has no other foundation than a low and animal, a\nhuman instinct, which they call the sentiment or right of property.\nMan says, _my house,_ and never lives in it, but is only cumbered with\nthe building and maintenance of it. The merchant says, _my shop_,--my\nclothing-shop, for example,--and he does not even wear clothes made of\nthe best cloth in the shop.\n\n"There are people who call land theirs, and have never seen their land,\nand have never been on it. There are men who call other people theirs,\nbut have never seen these people; and the whole relationship of these\nowners, to these people, consists in doing them harm.\n\n"There are men who call women theirs,--their wives or mistresses; but\nthese women live with other men. And men struggle in life not to do\nwhat they consider good, but to be possessors of what they call their\nown.\n\n"I am convinced now that herein lies the substantial difference between\nmen and us. And, therefore, not speaking of other things, where we are\nsuperior to men, we are able boldly to say that in this one respect at\nleast, we stand, in the scale of living beings, higher than men. The\nactivity of men--at all events, of those with whom I have had to do--is\nguided by words; ours, by deeds.\n\n"And here the head groom obtained this right to say about me, _my\nhorse;_ and hence he lashed the hostler. This discovery deeply\ndisturbed me; and those thoughts and opinions which my variegated coat\naroused in men, and the thoughtfulness aroused in me by the change\nin my mother, together subserved to make me into that solemn and\ncontemplative gelding that I am.\n\n"I was threefold unhappy: I was piebald; I was a gelding; and men\nimagined that I did not belong to God and myself, as is the prerogative\nof every living thing, but that I belonged to the equerry.\n\n"The consequences of their imagining this about me were many. The first\nwas, that they kept me apart from the others, fed me better, led me\nmore often, and harnessed me up earlier. They harnessed me first when\nI was in my third year. I remember the first time, the equerry himself,\nwho imagined that I was his, began, with a crowd of grooms, to harness\nme, expecting from me some ebullition of temper or contrariness. They\nput leather straps on me, and conducted me into the stalls. They laid\non my back a wide leather cross, and attached it to the thills, so that\nI should not kick; but I was only waiting an opportunity to show my\ngait, and my love for work.\n\n"They marvelled because I went like an old horse. They began to drive\nme, and I began to practise trotting. Every day I made greater and\ngreater improvement, so that in three months the general himself,\nand many others, praised my gait. But this was a strange thing: for\nthe very reason that they imagined that I was the equerry\'s, and not\ntheirs, my gait had for them an entirely different significance.\n\n"The stallions, my brothers, were put through their paces; their time\nwas reckoned; people came to see them; they were driven in gilded\ndrozhkies. Costly saddles were put upon them. But I was driven in the\nequerry\'s simple drozhkies, when he had business at Chesmenka and other\nmanor-houses. All this resulted from the fact that I was piebald, but\nmore than all from the fact that I was, according to their idea, not\nthe property of the count, but of the equerry.\n\n"To-morrow, if we are alive, I will tell you what a serious influence\nupon me was exercised by this right of proprietorship which the equerry\narrogated to himself."\n\nAll that day the horses treated Kholstom\xc3\xadr with great consideration;\nbut Nester, from old custom, rode him into the field. But Nester\'s\nways were so rough! The muzh\xc3\xadk\'s gray stallion, coming toward the\ndrove, whinnied: and again the chestnut filly coquettishly replied to\nhim.\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nTHIRD NIGHT.\n\n\nThe moon had quartered; and her narrow band poured a mild light on\nKholstom\xc3\xadr, standing in the middle of the yard, with the horses\nclustered around him.\n\n"The principal and most surprising consequence to me of the fact\nthat I was not the property of the count nor of God, but of the\nequerry," continued the piebald, "was that what constitutes our chief\nactivity--the eager race--was made the cause of my banishment. They\nwere driving Lebedi around the ring; and a jockey from Chesmenka was\nriding me, and entered the course. Lebedi dashed past us. He trotted\nwell, but he seemed to want to show off. He had not that skill which I\nhad cultivated in myself; that is, of compelling one leg instantly to\nfollow on the motion of the other, and not to waste the least degree\nof energy, but use it all in pressing forward. Lebedi dashed by us. I\nentered the ring: the jockey did not hold me back.\n\n"\'Say, will you time my piebald?\' he cried; and when Lebedi came\nabreast of us a second time, he let me out. He had the advantage of his\nmomentum, and so I was left behind in the first heat; but in the second\nI began to gain on him; came up to him in the drozhsky, caught up\nwith him, passed beyond him, and won the race. They tried it a second\ntime--the same thing. I was the swifter. And this filled them all with\ndismay. The general begged them to send me away as soon as possible,\nso that I might not be heard of again. \'Otherwise the count will know\nabout it, and there will be trouble,\' said he. And they sent me to the\nhorse-dealer. I did not remain there long. A hussar, who came along to\nget a remount, bought me. All this had been so disagreeable, so cruel,\nthat I was glad when they took me from Khr\xc3\xa9nova, and forever separated\nme from all that had been near and dear to me. It was too hard for me\namong them. Before _them_ stood love, honor, freedom; before me labor,\nhumiliation,--humiliation, labor, to the end of my days. Why? Because I\nwas piebald, and because I was compelled to be somebody\'s horse."\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nFOURTH NIGHT.\n\n\nThe next evening when the gates were closed, and all was still, the\npiebald continued thus:--\n\n"I had many experiences, both among men and among my own kind, while\nchanging about from hand to hand. I staid with two masters the longest:\nwith the prince, the officer of the hussars, and then with an old man\nwho lived at Nikola Yavleono\xc3\xaf Church.\n\n"I spent the happiest days of my life with the hussar.\n\n"Though he was the cause of my destruction, though he loved nothing and\nnobody, yet I loved him, and still love him, for this very reason.\n\n"He pleased me precisely, because he was handsome, fortunate, rich, and\ntherefore loved no one.\n\n"You are familiar with this lofty equine sentiment of ours. His\ncoldness, and my dependence upon him, added greatly to the strength\nof my affection for him. Because he beat me, and drove me to death, I\nused to think in those happy days, for that very reason I was all the\nhappier.\n\n"He bought me of the horse-dealer to whom the equerry had sold me, for\neight hundred rubles. He bought me because there was no demand for\npiebald horses. Those were my happiest days.\n\n"He had a mistress. I knew it because every day I took him to her; and\nI took her out driving, and sometimes took them together.\n\n"His mistress was a handsome woman, and he was handsome, and his\ncoachman was handsome; and I loved them all because they were. And life\nwas worth living then.\n\n"This is the way that my life was spent: In the morning the man came\nto groom me,--not the coachman, but the groom. The groom was a young\nlad, taken from among the muzh\xc3\xadks. He would open the door, let the wind\ndrive out the steam from the horses, shovel out the manure, take off\nthe blanket, begin to flourish the brush over my body, and with the\ncurry-comb to brush out the scruff on the floor of the stall, marked\nby the stamping of hoofs. I would make believe bite his sleeves, would\npush him with my leg.\n\n"Then we were led out, one after the other, to drink from a tub of\ncold water; and the youngster admired my sleek spotted coat, my legs\nstraight as an arrow, my broad hoofs, my polished flank, and back\nwide enough to sleep on. Then he would throw the hay behind the broad\nrack, and pour the oats into the oaken cribs. Then Feof\xc3\xa1n and the old\ncoachman would come.\n\n"The master and the coachman were alike. Neither the one nor the other\nfeared any one or loved any one except themselves, and therefore\neverybody loved them. Feof\xc3\xa1n came in a red shirt, plush breeches, and\ncoat. I used to like to hear him when, all pomaded for a holiday, he\nwould come to the stable in his coat, and cry,--\n\n"\'Well, cattle, are you asleep?\' and poke me in the loin with the\nhandle of his fork; but never so as to hurt, only in fun. I could\ninstantly take a joke, and I would lay back my ears and show my teeth.\n\n"We had a chestnut stallion that belonged to a pair. Sometimes they\nwould harness us together. This Polkan could not understand a joke, and\nwas simply ugly as the devil. I used to stand in the next stall to him,\nand feel seriously pained. Feof\xc3\xa1n was not afraid of him. He used to go\nstraight up to him, shout to him,--it seemed as though he were going\nto kick him,--but no, straight by, and put on the halter.\n\n"Once we ran away together, in a pair, over the Kuznetsko\xc3\xab. Neither the\nmaster nor the coachman was frightened; they laughed, they shouted to\nthe people, and they sawed on the reins and pulled up, and so I did not\nrun over anybody.\n\n"In their service I expended my best qualities, and half of my life.\nThen I was given too much water to drink, and my legs gave out.... But\nin spite of every thing, that was the best part of my life. At twelve\nthey would come, harness us, oil my hoofs, moisten my forelock and\nmane, and put us between the thills.\n\n"The sledge was of cane, plaited, upholstered in velvet. The harness\nhad little silver buckles, the reins of silk, and once I wore a\nfly-net. The whole harness was such, that, when all the straps and\nbelts were put on and drawn, it was impossible to make out where the\nharness ended and the horse began. They would finish harnessing in\nthe shed. Feof\xc3\xa1n would come out, his middle wider than his shoulders,\nwith his red girdle under his arms. He would inspect the harness, take\nhis seat, straighten his kaftan, put his foot in the stirrup, get off\nsome joke, always crack his whip, though he scarcely ever touched me\nwith it,--merely for form\'s sake,--and cry, \'Now off with you!\'[9]\nAnd frisking at every step, I would prance out of the gate; and the\ncook, coming out to empty her slops, would pause in the road; and\nthe muzh\xc3\xadk, bringing in his firewood, would open his eyes. We would\ndrive up and down, occasionally stopping. The lackeys come out, the\ncoachmen drive up. There is constant conversation. Always kept waiting.\nSometimes for three hours we were kept at the door; occasionally we\ntake a turn around, and talk a while, and again we halt.\n\n"At last there would be a tumult in the hallway; the gray-haired\nTikhon, fat in paunch, comes out in his dress-coat. \'Drive on;\' then\nthere was none of that use of superfluous words that obtains now.\nFeof\xc3\xa1n clucks as if I did not know what \'forward\' meant; comes up to\nthe door, and drives away quickly, unconcernedly, as though there\nwas nothing wonderful either in the sledge or the horses, or Feof\xc3\xa1n\nhimself, as he bends his back and holds out his hands in such a way\nthat it would seem impossible to keep it up long.\n\n"The prince comes out in his shako and cloak, with a gray beaver collar\nconcealing his handsome, ruddy, black-browed face, which ought never to\nbe covered. He would come out with clanking sabre, jingling spurs, and\ncopper-heeled boots; stepping over the carpet as though in a hurry, and\nnot paying any heed to me or to Feof\xc3\xa1n, whom everybody except himself\nlooked at and admired.\n\n"Feof\xc3\xa1n clucks. I pull at the reins, and with a respectable rapid\ntrot we are off and away. I glance round at the prince, and toss my\naristocratic head and delicate topknot. The prince is in good spirits;\nhe sometimes jests with Feof\xc3\xa1n. Feof\xc3\xa1n replies, half turning round to\nthe prince his handsome face, and, not dropping his hands, makes some\nridiculous motion with the reins which I understand; and on, on, on,\nwith ever wider and wider strides, straining every muscle, and sending\nthe muddy snow over the dasher, off I go! Then there was none of the\nabsurd way that obtains to-day of crying, O! as though the coachman\nwere in pain, and couldn\'t speak. \'G\'long! Look out there![10] G\'long!\nLook out there,\' shouts Feof\xc3\xa1n; and the people clear the way, and stand\ncraning their necks to see the handsome gelding, the handsome coachman,\nand the handsome harm....\n\n"I loved especially to outstrip some racer. When Feof\xc3\xa1n and I would\nsee in the distance some team worthy of our mettle, flying like a\nwhirlwind, we would gradually come nearer and nearer to him. And soon\ntossing the mud over the dasher, I would be even with the passenger,\nand would snort over his head, then even with the saddle, with the\nbell-bow;[11] then I would already see him and hear him behind me,\ngradually getting farther and farther away. But the prince and Feof\xc3\xa1n\nand I, we all kept silent, and made believe that we were merely out\nfor a drive, and by our actions that we did not notice those with slow\nhorses whom we overtook on our way. I loved to race, but I loved also\nto meet a good racer. One wink, sound, glance, and we would be off, and\nwould fly along, each on his own side of the road." ...\n\nHere the gates creaked, and the voices of Nester and Vaska were heard.\n\n\n[Footnote 9: _pushcha\xc3\xaf._]\n\n[Footnote 10: _podi! belegis._]\n\n[Footnote 11: _dug\xc3\xa1._]\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nFIFTH NIGHT.\n\n\nThe weather began to change. The sky was over-cast; and in the morning\nthere was no dew, but it was warm, and the flies were sticky. As soon\nas the herd was driven in, the horses gathered around the piebald, and\nthus he finished his story:--\n\n"The happy days of my life were soon over. I lived so only two years.\nAt the end of the second winter, there happened an event which was most\ndelightful to me, and immediately after came my deepest sorrow. It was\nat Shrove-tide. I took the prince to the races. Atl\xc3\xa1snui and Buich\xc3\xb3k\nalso ran in the race.\n\n"I don\'t know what they were doing in the summer-house; but I know that\nhe came, and ordered Feof\xc3\xa1n to enter the ring. I remember they drove\nme into the ring, stationed me and stationed Atl\xc3\xa1snui. Atl\xc3\xa1snui was in\nracing gear, but I was harnessed in a city sleigh. At the turning stake\nI left him behind. A laugh and a cry of victory greeted my achievement.\nWhen they began to lead me round, a crowd followed after, and a man\noffered the prince five thousand. He only laughed, showing his white\nteeth.\n\n"\'No,\' said he, \'this isn\'t a horse, it\'s a friend. I wouldn\'t sell him\nfor a mountain of gold. Good-day, gentlemen!\'[12]\n\n"He threw open the fur robes, and got in.\n\n"\'To Ostozhenka.\'\n\n"That was where his mistress lived. And we flew....\n\n"It was our last happy day. We reached her home. He called her _his._\nBut she loved some one else, and had gone off with him. The prince\nascertained this at her room. It was five o\'clock; and, not letting\nme be unharnessed, he started in pursuit of her, though she had never\nreally been his. They applied the knout to me, and made me gallop. For\nthe first time, I began to flag, and I am ashamed to say, I wanted to\nrest.\n\n"But suddenly I heard the prince himself shouting in an unnatural\nvoice, \'Hurry up!\'[13] and the knout whistled and cut me; and I dashed\nahead again, my leg hitting against the iron of the dasher. We overtook\nher, after going twenty-five versts. I got him there; but I trembled\nall night, and could not eat any thing. In the morning they gave me\nwater. I drank it, and forever ceased to be the horse that I was. I was\nsick. They tortured me and maimed me,--treated me as men are accustomed\nto do. My hoofs came off. I had abscesses, and my legs grew bent. I\nhad no strength in my chest. Laziness and weakness were everywhere\napparent. I was sent to the horse-dealer. He fed me on carrots and\nother things, and made me something quite unlike my old self, but yet\ncapable of deceiving one who did not know. But there was no strength\nand no swiftness in me.\n\n"Moreover, the horse-dealer tormented me, by coming to my stall when\ncustomers were on hand, and beginning to stir me up, and torture me\nwith the knout, so that it drove me to madness. Then he would wipe the\nbloody foam off the whip, and lead me out.\n\n"An old lady bought me of the dealer. She used to keep coming to Nikola\nYavlenno\xc3\xaf, and she used to whip the coachman. The coachman would come\nand weep in my stall. And I knew that his tears had an agreeable salt\ntaste. Then the old woman chid her overseer,[14] took me into the\ncountry, and sold me to a peddler; then I was fed on wheat, and grew\nsicker still. I was sold to a muzh\xc3\xadk. There I had to plough, had almost\nnothing to eat, and I cut my leg with a ploughshare. I became sick\nagain. A gypsy got possession of me. He tortured me horribly, and at\nlast I was sold to the overseer here. And here I am." ... All were\nsilent. The rain began to fall.\n\n\n[Footnote 12: _do svid\xc3\xa1nya = au revoir._]\n\n[Footnote 13: _valya\xc3\xaf._]\n\n[Footnote 14: _priskashchik._]\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nAs the herd returned home the following evening, they met the\nmaster[15] and a guest. Zhulduiba, leading the way, cast her eyes on\ntwo men\'s figures: one was the young master in a straw hat; the other,\na tall, stout, military man, with wrinkled face. The old mare gazed at\nthe man, and swerving went near to him; the rest, the younger ones,\nwere thrown into some confusion, huddled together, especially when the\nmaster and his guest came directly into the midst of the horses, making\ngestures to each other, and talking.\n\n"Here\'s this one. I bought it of Voy\xc3\xa9\xc3\xafkof,--the dapple-gray horse,"\nsaid the master.\n\n"And that young black mare, with the white legs,--where did you get\nher? Fine one," said the guest. They examined many of the horses as\nthey walked around, or stood on the field. They remarked also the\nchestnut mare.\n\n"That\'s one of the saddle-horses,--the breed of Khrenovsky."\n\nThey quietly gazed at all the horses as they went by. The master\nshouted to Nester; and the old man, hastily digging his heels into the\nsides of the piebald, trotted out. The piebald horse hobbled along,\nlimping on one leg; but his gait was such that it was evident that in\nother circumstances he would not have complained, even if he had been\ncompelled to go in this way, as long as his strength held out, to the\nworld\'s end. He was ready even to go at full gallop, and at first even\nbroke into one.\n\n"I have no hesitation in saying that there isn\'t a better horse in\nRussia than that one," said the master, pointing to one of the mares.\nThe guest corroborated this praise. The master, full of satisfaction,\nwalked up and down, made observations, and told the story and pedigree\nof each of the horses.\n\nIt was apparently somewhat of a bore to the guest to listen to the\nmaster; but he devised questions, to make it seem as if he were\ninterested in it.\n\n"Yes, yes," said he in some confusion.\n\n"Look," said the host, not replying to the questions, "look at\nthose legs, look at the ... She cost me dear, but I shall have a\nthree-year-old from her that\'ll go!"\n\n"Does she trot well?" asked the guest.\n\nThus they scrutinized almost all the horses, and there was nothing more\nto show. And they were silent.\n\n"Well, shall we go?"\n\n"Yes, let us go."\n\nThey went out through the gate. The guest was glad that the exhibition\nwas over, and that he was going home where he would eat, drink, smoke,\nand have a good time. As they went by Nester, who was sitting on the\npiebald and waiting for further orders, the guest struck his big fat\nhand on the horse\'s side.\n\n"Here\'s good blood," said he. "He\'s like the piebald horse, if you\nremember, that I told you about."\n\nThe master perceived that it was not of his horses that the guest was\nspeaking; and he did not listen, but, looking around, continued to gaze\nat his stud.\n\nSuddenly, at his very ear, was heard a dull, weak, senile neigh. It\nwas the piebald horse that began to neigh, but could not finish it.\nBecoming, as it were, confused, he broke short off.\n\nNeither the guest nor the master paid any attention to this neigh,\nbut went home. Kholstom\xc3\xadr had recognized in the wrinkled old man his\nbeloved former master, the once brilliant, handsome, and wealthy\nSierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf.\n\n\n[Footnote 15: _khozhy\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafn_.]\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nThe rain continued to fall. In the paddock it was gloomy, but at the\nmanor-house[16] it was quite the reverse. The luxurious evening meal\nwas spread in the luxurious dining-room. At the table sat master,\nmistress, and the guest who had just arrived.\n\nThe master held in his hand a box of specially fine ten-year-old\ncigars, such as no one else had, according to his story, and proceeded\nto offer them to the guest. The master was a handsome young man of\ntwenty-five, fresh, neatly dressed, smoothly brushed. He was dressed\nin a fresh, loosely-fitting suit of clothes, made in London. On his\nwatch-chain were big expensive charms. His cuff-buttons were of gold,\nlarge, even massive, set with turquoises. His beard was _\xc3\xa0 la Napoleon\nIII._; and his moustaches were waxed, and stood out as though he had\ngot them nowhere else than in Paris.\n\nThe lady wore a silk-muslin dress, brocaded with large variegated\nflowers; on her head, large gold hair-pins in her thick auburn hair,\nwhich was beautiful, though not entirely her own. Her hands were\nadorned with bracelets and rings, all expensive.\n\nThe samovar was silver, the service exquisite. The lackey, magnificent\nin his dress-coat and white vest and necktie, stood like a statue at\nthe door, awaiting orders. The furniture was of bent wood, and bright;\nthe wall-papers dark, with large flowers. Around the table tinkled a\ncunning little dog, with a silver collar bearing an extremely hard\nEnglish name, which neither of them could pronounce because they knew\nnot English.\n\nIn the corner, among the flowers, stood the pianoforte, inlaid with\nmother-of-pearl.[17] Every thing breathed of newness, luxury, and\nrareness. Every thing was extremely good; but it all bore a peculiar\nimpress of profusion, wealth, and an absence of intellectual interests.\n\nThe master was a great lover of racing, strong and hot-headed; one of\nthose whom one meets everywhere, who drive out in sable furs, send\ncostly bouquets to actresses, drink the most expensive wine, of the\nvery latest brand, at the most expensive restaurant, offer prizes in\ntheir own names, and entertain the most expensive....\n\nThe new-comer, Nik\xc3\xadta Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf, was a man of forty years, tall,\nstout, bald, with huge mustaches and side-whiskers. He ought to\nhave been very handsome; but it was evident that he had wasted his\nforces--physical and moral and pecuniary.\n\nHe was so deeply in debt that he was obliged to go into the service so\nas to escape the sponging-house. He had now come to the government city\nas chief of the imperial stud. His influential relations had obtained\nthis for him.\n\nHe was dressed in an army kittel and blue trousers. His kittel and\ntrousers were such as only those who are rich can afford to wear; so\nwith his linen also. His watch was English. His boots had peculiar\nsoles, as thick as a finger.\n\nNik\xc3\xadta Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf had squandered a fortune of two millions, and was\nstill in debt to the amount of one hundred and twenty thousand rubles.\nFrom such a course there always remains a certain momentum of life,\ngiving credit, and the possibility of living almost luxuriously for\nanother ten years.\n\nThe ten years had already passed, and the momentum was finished; and\nit had become hard for him to live. He had already begun to drink too\nmuch; that is, to get fuddled with wine, which had never been the\ncase with him before. Properly speaking, he had never begun and never\nfinished drinking.\n\nMore noticeable in him than all else was the restlessness of his eyes\n(they had begun to wander), and the uncertainty of his intonations and\nmotions. This restlessness was surprising, from the fact that it was\nevidently a new thing in him, because it could be seen that he had been\naccustomed, all his life long, to fear nothing and nobody, and that now\nhe endured severe sufferings from some dread that was thoroughly alien\nto his nature.\n\nThe host and hostess[18] remarked this, exchanged glances, showing that\nthey understood each other, postponed until they should get to bed the\nconsideration of this subject; and, evidently, merely endured poor\nSierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf.\n\nThe sight of the young master\'s happiness humiliated Nik\xc3\xadta, and\ncompelled him to painful envy, as he remembered his own irrevocable\npast.\n\n"You don\'t object to cigars, Marie?" he asked, addressing the lady\nin that peculiar tone, acquired only by practice, full of urbanity\nand friendliness, but not wholly satisfactory,--such as men use who\nare familiar with the society of women not enjoying the dignity of\nwifehood. Not that he could have wished to insult her: on the contrary,\nhe was much more anxious to gain her good-will and that of the host,\nthough he would not for any thing have acknowledged it to himself. But\nhe was already used to talking thus with such women. He knew that she\nwould have been astonished, even affronted, if he had behaved to her\nas toward a lady. Moreover, it was necessary for him to preserve that\npeculiar shade of deference for the acknowledged wife of his friend.\nHe treated such women always with consideration, not because he shared\nthose so-called convictions that are promulgated in newspapers (he\nnever read such trash), about esteem as the prerogative of every man,\nabout the absurdity of marriage, etc., because all well-bred men act\nthus, and he was a well-bred man, though inclined to drink.\n\nHe took a cigar. But his host awkwardly seized a handful of cigars, and\nplaced them before the guest.\n\n"No, just see how good these are! try them."\n\nNik\xc3\xadta pushed away the cigars with his hand, and in his eyes flashed\nsomething like injury and shame.\n\n"Thanks,"--he took out his cigar-case,--"try mine."\n\nThe lady was on the watch. She perceived how it affected him. She began\nhastily to talk with him.\n\n"I am very fond of cigars. I should smoke myself if everybody about did\nnot smoke."\n\nAnd she gave him one of her bright, kindly smiles. He half-smiled in\nreply. Two of his teeth were gone.\n\n"No, take this," continued the host, not heeding. "Those others are\nnot so strong. _Fritz, bringen Sie noch eine Kasten,_" he said, "_dort\nzwei._"\n\nThe German lackey brought another box.\n\n"Do you like these larger ones? They are stronger. This is a very good\nkind. Take them all," he added, continuing to force them upon his guest.\n\nHe was evidently glad that there was some one on whom he could lavish\nhis rarities, and he saw nothing out of the way in it. Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf\nbegan to smoke, and hastened to take up the subject that had been\ndropped.\n\n"How much did you have to go on Atl\xc3\xa1snui?" he asked.\n\n"He cost me dear,--not less than five thousand, but at all events I am\nsecured. Plenty of colts, I tell you!"\n\n"Do they trot?" inquired Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf.\n\n"First-rate. To-day Atl\xc3\xa1snui\'s colt took three prizes: one at Tula, one\nat Moscow, and one at Petersburg. He raced with Voy\xc3\xa9\xc3\xafkof\'s Vor\xc3\xb3nui. The\nrascally jockey made four abatements, and almost put him out of the\nrace."\n\n"He was rather raw; too much Dutch stock in him, I should say," said\nSierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf.\n\n"Well, but the mares are finer ones. I will show you to-morrow. I paid\nthree thousand for Dobruina, two thousand for Laskovaya."\n\nAnd again the host began to enumerate his wealth. The mistress saw that\nthis was hard for Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf, and that he only pretended to listen.\n\n"Won\'t you have some more tea?" asked the hostess.\n\n"I don\'t care for any more," said the host, and he went on with his\nstory. She got up; the host detained her, took her in his arms, and\nkissed her.\n\nSierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf smiled at first, as he looked at them; but his smile\nseemed to them unnatural. When his host got up, and took her in his\narms, and went out with her as far as the _porti\xc3\xa8re,_ his face\nsuddenly changed; he sighed deeply, and an expression of despair took\npossession of his wrinkled face. There was also wrath in it.\n\n"Yes, you said that you bought him of Voy\xc3\xa9\xc3\xafkof," said Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf,\nwith assumed indifference.\n\n\n[Footnote 16: _barski dom._]\n\n[Footnote 17: _incrust\xc3\xa9._]\n\n[Footnote 18: _khozy\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafn_ and _khozy\xc3\xa1\xc3\xafka._]\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nThe host returned, and smiled as he sat down opposite his guest.\nNeither of them spoke.\n\n"Oh, yes! I was speaking of Atl\xc3\xa1snui. I had a great mind to buy the\nmares of Dubovitsky. Nothing but rubbish was left."\n\n"He was _burned_ out," said Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf, and suddenly stood up\nand looked around. He remembered that he owed this ruined man twenty\nthousand rubles; and that, if _burned_ out were said of any one, it\nmight by good rights be said about himself. He began to laugh.\n\nBoth kept silence long. The master was revolving in his mind how he\nmight boast a little before his guest. Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf was cogitating\nhow he might show that he did not consider himself burned out. But the\nthoughts of both moved with difficulty, in spite of the fact that they\ntried to enliven themselves with cigars.\n\n"Well, when shall we have something to drink?" asked the guest of\nhimself.\n\n"At all events, we must have something to drink, else we shall die of\nthe blues," said the host to himself.\n\n"How is it? are you going to stay here long?" asked Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf.\n\n"About a month yet. Shall we have a little lunch? What say you? Fritz,\nis every thing ready?"\n\nThey went back to the dining-room. There, under a hanging lamp, stood\nthe table loaded with candles and very extraordinary things: siphons,\nand bottles with fancy stoppers, extraordinary wine in decanters,\nextraordinary liqueurs and vodka. They drank, sat down, drank again,\nsat down, and tried to talk. Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf grew flushed, and began to\nspeak unreservedly.\n\nThey talked about women: who kept such and such an one; the gypsy, the\nballet-girl, the _soubrette._[19]\n\n"Why, you left Mathieu, didn\'t you?" asked the host.\n\nThis was the mistress who had caused Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf such pain.\n\n"No, she left me. O my friend,[20] how one remembers what one has\nsquandered in life! Now I am glad, fact, when I get a thousand rubles;\nglad, fact, when I get out of everybody\'s way. I cannot in Moscow. Ah!\nwhat\'s to be said!"\n\nThe host was bored to listen to Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf. He wanted to talk\nabout himself,--to brag. But Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf also wanted to talk about\nhimself,--about his glittering past. The host poured out some more\nwine, and waited till he had finished, so as to tell him about his\naffairs,--how he was going to arrange his stud as no one ever had\nbefore; and how Marie loved him, not for his money, but for himself.\n\n"I was going to tell you that in my stud" ... he began. But\nSierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf interrupted him.\n\n"There was a time, I may say," he began, "when I loved, and knew how to\nlive. You were talking just now about racing; please tell me what is\nyour best racer."\n\nThe host was glad of the chance to tell some more about his stud, but\nSierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf again interrupted him.\n\n"Yes, yes," said he. "But the trouble with you breeders is, that you do\nit only for ostentation, and not for pleasure, for life. It wasn\'t so\nwith me. I was telling you this very day that I used to have a piebald\nracer, with just such spots as I saw among your colts. _Okh!_ what a\nhorse he was! You can\'t imagine it: this was in \'42. I had just come\nto Moscow. I went to a dealer, and saw a piebald gelding. All in best\nform. He pleased me. Price? Thousand rubles. He pleased me. I took him,\nand began to ride him. I never had, and you never had and never will\nhave, such a horse. I never knew a better horse, either for gait, or\nstrength, or beauty. You were a lad then. You could not have known, but\nyou may have heard, I suppose. All Moscow knew him."\n\n"Yes, I heard about him," said the host reluctantly; "but I was going\nto tell you about my" ...\n\nSo you heard about him. I bought him just as he was, without pedigree,\nwithout proof; but then I knew Voy\xc3\xa9\xc3\xafkof, and I traced him. He was sired\nby Liubeznu\xc3\xaf I. He was called Kholstom\xc3\xadr.[21] He\'d measure linen for\nyou! On account of his spotting, he was given to the equerry at the\nKhrenovski stud; and he had him gelded, and sold him to the dealer.\nAren\'t any horses like him anymore, friend! _Akh!_ "What a time that\nwas! _Akh!_ vanished youth!" he said, quoting the words of a gypsy\nsong. He began to get wild. "_Ekh!_ that was a golden time! I was\ntwenty-five. I had eighty thousand a year income; then I hadn\'t a gray\nhair; all my teeth like pearls.... Whatever I undertook prospered. And\nyet all came to an end." ...\n\n"Well, you didn\'t have such lively times then," said the host, taking\nadvantage of the interruption. "I tell you that my first horses began\nto run without" ...\n\n"Your horses! Horses were more mettlesome then" ...\n\n"How more mettlesome?"\n\n"Yes, more mettlesome. I remember how one time I was at Moscow at the\nraces. None of my horses were in it. I did not care for racing; but I\nhad blooded horses, General Chaulet, Mahomet. I had my piebald with\nme. My coachman was a splendid young fellow. I liked him. But he was\nrather given to drink, so I drove.--\'Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf,\' said they, \'when\nare you going to get some trotters?\'--\'I don\'t care for your low-bred\nbeasts,[22] the devil take \'em! I have a hackdriver\'s piebald that\'s\nworth all of yours.\'--Yes, but he doesn\'t race.\'--\'Bet you a thousand\nrubles.\' They took me up. He went round in five seconds, won the wager\nof a thousand rubles. But that was nothing. With my blooded horses I\nwent in a tro\xc3\xafka a hundred versts in three hours. All Moscow knew about\nit."\n\nAnd Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf began to brag so fluently and steadily that the host\ncould not get in a word, and sat facing him with dejected countenance.\nOnly, by way of diversion, he would fill up his glass and that of his\ncompanion.\n\nIt began already to grow light, but still they sat there. It became\npainfully tiresome to the host. He got up.\n\n"Sleep,--let\'s go to sleep, then," said Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf, as he got up,\nand went staggering and puffing to the room that had been assigned to\nhim.\n\n.. .. .. .. .. ..\n\n.. .. .. .. .. ..\n\n.. .. .. .. .. ..\n\nThe master of the house rejoined his mistress.\n\n"Oh, he\'s unendurable. He got drunk, and lied faster than he could\ntalk."\n\n"And he made love to me too."\n\n"I fear that he\'s going to borrow of me."\n\nSierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf threw himself on the bed without undressing, and drew a\nlong breath.\n\n"I must have talked a good deal of nonsense," he thought. "Well, it\'s\nall the same. Good wine, but he\'s a big hog. Something cheap about\nhim.[23] And I am a hog myself," he remarked, and laughed aloud. "Well,\nI used to support others: now it\'s my turn. I guess the Winkler girl\nwill help me. I\'ll borrow some money of her. He may come to it. Suppose\nI\'ve got to undress. Can\'t get my boot off. Hey, hey!" he cried; but\nthe man who had been ordered to wait on him had long before gone to bed.\n\nHe sat up, took off his kittel and his vest, and somehow managed to\ncrawl out of his trousers; but it was long before his boots would stir:\nwith his stout belly it was hard work to stoop over. He got one off; he\nstruggled and struggled with the other, got out of breath, and gave it\nup. And so with one leg in the boot he threw himself down, and began to\nsnore, filling the whole room with the odor of wine, tobacco, and vile\nold age.\n\n\n[Footnote 19: _Frantsuzhenka._]\n\n[Footnote 20: _akh, brat_ brother.]\n\n[Footnote 21: _Kholstom\xc3\xadr_ means a cloth measurer: suggesting the\ngreatest distance from linger to linger of the outstretched arms, and\nrapidity in accomplishing the motion.]\n\n[Footnote 22: literally, _muzh\xc3\xadks._]\n\n[Footnote 23: _kup\xc3\xa9sheskoe_, merchant-like.]\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nIf Kholstom\xc3\xadr remembered any thing that night, it was the frolic that\nVaska gave him. He threw over him a blanket, and galloped off. He was\nleft till morning at the door of a tavern, with a muzh\xc3\xadk\'s horse. They\nlicked each other. When it became light he went back to the herd, and\nitched all over.\n\n"Something makes me itch fearfully," he thought.\n\nFive days passed. They brought a veterinary. He said cheerfully,--\n\n"The mange. You\'ll have to dispose of him to the gypsies."\n\n"Better have his throat cut; only have it done to-day."\n\n\nThe morning was calm and clear. The herd had gone to pasture.\nKholstom\xc3\xadr remained behind. A strange man came along; thin, dark,\ndirty, in a kaftan spotted with something black. This was the\nscavenger. He took Kholstom\xc3\xadr by the halter, and without looking at him\nstarted off. The horse followed quietly, not looking round, and, as\nalways, dragging his legs and kicking up the straw with his hind-legs.\n\nAs he went out of the gate, he turned his head toward the well; but the\nscavenger twitched the halter, and said,--\n\n"It\'s not worth while."\n\nThe scavenger, and Vaska who followed, proceeded to a depression behind\nthe brick barn, and stopped, as though there were something peculiar\nin this most ordinary place; and the scavenger, handing the halter to\nVaska, took off his kaftan, rolled up his sleeves, and produced a knife\nand whetstone from his boot-leg.\n\nThe piebald pulled at the halter, and out of sheer _ennui_ tried to\nbite it, but it was too far off. He sighed, and closed his eyes. He\nhung down his lip, showing his worn yellow teeth, and began to drowse,\nlulled by the sound of the knife on the stone. Only his sick and\nswollen leg trembled a little.\n\nSuddenly he perceived that he was grasped by the lower jaw, and that\nhis head was lifted up. He opened his eyes. Two dogs were in front of\nhim. One was snuffing in the direction of the scavenger, the other sat\nlooking at the gelding as though expecting something especially from\nhim. The gelding looked at them, and began to rub his jaw against the\nhand that held him.\n\n"Of course they want to cure me," he said: "let it come!"\n\nAnd the thought had hardly passed through his mind, before they did\nsomething to his throat. It hurt him; he started back, stamped his\nfoot, but restrained himself, and waited for what was to follow....\nWhat followed, was some liquid pouring in a stream down his neck and\nbreast. He drew a deep breath, lifting his sides. And it seemed easier,\nmuch easier, to him.\n\nThe whole burden of his life was taken from him.\n\nHe closed his eyes, and began to droop his head,--no one held it. Then\nhis legs quivered, his whole body swayed. He was not so much terrified\nas he was astonished....\n\nEvery thing was so new. He was astonished; he tried to run ahead, up\nthe hill, ... but instead of this, his legs, moving where he stood,\ninterfered. He began to roll over on his side, and while expecting to\nmake a step he fell forward, and on his left side.\n\nThe scavenger waited till the death-struggle was over, drove away the\ndogs that were creeping nearer, and then seized the horse by the legs,\nturned him over on the back, and, telling Vaska to hold his leg, began\nto take off the hide.\n\n"That was a horse indeed!" said Vaska.\n\n"If he\'d been fatter, it would have been a fine hide," said the\nscavenger.\n\n\nThat evening the herd passed by the hill; and those who were on the\nleft wing saw a red object below them, and around it some dogs busily\nromping, and crows and hawks flying over it. One dog, with his paws\non the carcass, and shaking his head, was growling over what he was\ntearing with his teeth. The brown filly stopped, lifted her head and\nneck, and long sniffed the air. It took force to drive her away.\n\nAt sunrise, in a ravine of the ancient forest, in the bottom of an\novergrown glade, some wolf-whelps were beside themselves with joy.\nThere were five of them,--four about of a size, and one little one with\na head bigger than his body. A lean, hairless she-wolf, her belly with\nhanging dugs almost touching the ground, crept out of the bushes, and\nsat down in front of the wolves. The wolves sat in a semi-circle in\nfront of her. She went to the smallest, and lowering her stumpy tail,\nand bending her nose to the ground, made a few convulsive motions, and\nopening her jaws filled with teeth she struggled, and disgorged a\ngreat piece of horse-flesh.\n\nThe larger whelps made a movement to seize it; but she restrained them\nwith a threatening growl, and let the little one have it all. The\nlittle one, as though in anger, seized the morsel, hiding it under him,\nand began to devour it. Then the she-wolf disgorged for the second, and\nthe third, and in the same way for all five, and finally lay down in\nfront of them to rest.\n\nAt the end of a week there lay behind the brick barn only the great\nskull, and two shoulder-blades; all the rest had disappeared. In the\nsummer a muzh\xc3\xadk who gathered up the bones carried off also the skull\nand shoulder-blades, and put them to use.\n\nThe dead body of Sierpukhovsko\xc3\xaf who had been about in the world, and\nhad eaten and drunken, was buried long after. Neither his skin nor his\nflesh nor his bones were of any use.\n\nAnd just as his dead body, which had been about in the world, had been\na great burden to others for twenty years, so the disposal of this body\nbecame only an additional charge upon men. Long it had been useless\nto every one, long it had been only a burden. But still the dead who\nbury their dead found it expedient to dress this soon-to-be-decaying,\nswollen body, in a fine uniform, in fine boots; to place it in a fine\nnew coffin, with new tassels on the four corners; then to place this\nnew coffin in another, made of lead, and carry it to Moscow; and there\nto dig up the bones of people long buried, and then to lay away this\nmal-odorous body devoured by worms, in its new uniform and polished\nboots, and to cover the whole with earth.\n\n\n\n\n'
