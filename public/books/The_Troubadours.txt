There are three\n    doors: the front door, the door of Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch\'s study, and\n    the door of Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s room. A staircase leads up to the\n    other rooms; behind it is another door leading to the servants\'\n    quarters.\n\n\nSCENE 1.\n\nGREGORY [looks at himself in the glass and arranges his hair, &c.] I\n_am_ sorry about those moustaches of mine! "Moustaches are not becoming\nto a footman," she says! And why? Why, so that any one might see you\'re\na footman,--else my looks might put her darling son to shame. He\'s a\nlikely one! There\'s not much fear of his coming anywhere near me,\nmoustaches or no moustaches! [Smiling into the glass] And what a lot of\n\'em swarm round me. And yet I don\'t care for any of them as much as for\nthat T\xc3\xa1nya. And she only a lady\'s-maid! Ah well, she\'s nicer than any\nyoung lady. [Smiles] She is a duck! [Listening] Ah, here she comes.\n[Smiles] Yes, that\'s her, clattering with her little heels. Oh!\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya, carrying a cloak and boots.\n\nGREGORY. My respects to you, Taty\xc3\xa1na M\xc3\xa1rkovna.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. What are you always looking in the glass for? Do you think\nyourself so good-looking?\n\nGREGORY. Well, and are my looks not agreeable?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. So, so; neither agreeable nor disagreeable, but just betwixt and\nbetween! Why are all those cloaks hanging there?\n\nGREGORY. I am just going to put them away, your ladyship! [Takes down a\nfur cloak and, wrapping it round her, embraces her] I say, T\xc3\xa1nya, I\'ll\ntell you something\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh, get away, do! What do you mean by it? [Pulls herself angrily\naway] Leave me alone, I tell you!\n\nGREGORY [looks cautiously around] Then give me a kiss!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Now, really, what are you bothering for? I\'ll give you such a\nkiss! [Raises her hand to strike].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [off the scene, rings and then shouts] Gregory!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. There now, go! Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch is calling you.\n\nGREGORY. He\'ll wait! He\'s only just opened his eyes! I say, why don\'t\nyou love me?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. What sort of loving have you imagined now? I don\'t love anybody.\n\nGREGORY. That\'s a fib. You love Simon! You have found a nice one to\nlove--a common, dirty-pawed peasant, a butler\'s assistant!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Never mind; such as he is, you are jealous of him!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [off the scene] Gregory!\n\nGREGORY. All in good time.... Jealous indeed! Of what? Why, you have\nonly just begun to get licked into shape, and who are you tying yourself\nup with? Now, wouldn\'t it be altogether a different matter if you loved\nme?... I say, T\xc3\xa1nya\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [angrily and severely] You\'ll get nothing from me, I tell you!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [off the scene] Gregory!!\n\nGREGORY. You\'re mighty particular, ain\'t you?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [off the scene, shouts persistently, monotonously, and\nwith all his might] Gregory! Gregory! Gregory! [T\xc3\xa1nya and Gregory\nlaugh].\n\nGREGORY. You should have seen the girls that have been sweet on me.\n[Bell rings].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well then, go to them, and leave me alone!\n\nGREGORY. You are a silly, now I think of it. I\'m not Simon!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Simon means marriage, and not tomfoolery!\n\n    Enter Porter, carrying a large cardboard box.\n\nPORTER. Good morning!\n\nGREGORY. Good morning! Where are you from?\n\nPORTER. From Bourdey\'s. I\'ve brought a dress, and here\'s a note for the\nlady.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [taking the note] Sit down, and I\'ll take it in. [Exit].\n\n    Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch looks out of the door in shirt-sleeves and\n    slippers.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Gregory!\n\nGREGORY. Yes, sir.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Gregory! Don\'t you hear me call?\n\nGREGORY. I\'ve only just come, sir.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Hot water, and a cup of tea.\n\nGREGORY. Yes, sir; Simon will bring them directly.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. And who is this? Ah, from Bourdier?\n\nPORTER. Yes, sir.\n\n    Exeunt Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch and Gregory. Bell rings. T\xc3\xa1nya runs in at\n    the sound of the bell and opens the front door.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [to Porter] Please wait a little.\n\nPORTER. I am waiting.\n\n    Sah\xc3\xa1tof enters at front door.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I beg your pardon, but the footman has just gone away. This way,\nsir. Allow me, please. [Takes his fur cloak].\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [adjusting his clothes] Is Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch at home? Is he up?\n[Bell rings].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh yes, sir. He\'s been up a long time.\n\n    Doctor enters and looks round for the footman. Sees Sah\xc3\xa1tof and\n    addresses him in an offhand manner.\n\nDOCTOR. Ah, my respects to you!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [looks fixedly at him] The Doctor, I believe?\n\nDOCTOR. And I thought you were abroad! Dropped in to see Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes. And you? Is any one ill?\n\nDOCTOR [laughing] Not exactly ill, but, you know ... It\'s awful with\nthese ladies! Sits up at cards till three every morning, and pulls her\nwaist into the shape of a wine-glass. And the lady is flabby and fat,\nand carries the weight of a good many years on her back.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Is this the way you state your diagnosis to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna? I\nshould hardly think it quite pleases her!\n\nDOCTOR [laughing] Well, it\'s the truth. They do all these tricks--and\nthen come derangements of the digestive organs, pressure on the liver,\nnerves, and all sorts of things, and one has to come and patch them up.\nIt\'s just awful! [Laughs] And you? You are also a spiritualist it seems?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I? No, I am not also a spiritualist.... Good morning! [Is about\nto go, but is stopped by the Doctor].\n\nDOCTOR. No! But I can\'t myself, you know, positively deny the\npossibility of it, when a man like Krougosv\xc3\xa9tlof is connected with it\nall. How can one? Is he not a professor,--a European celebrity? There\nmust be something in it. I should like to see for myself, but I never\nhave the time. I have other things to do.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, yes! Good morning. [Exit, bowing slightly].\n\nDOCTOR [to T\xc3\xa1nya] Is Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna up?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. She\'s in her bedroom, but please come up.\n\n    Doctor goes upstairs.\n\n    Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch enters with a newspaper in his hand.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to Porter] What is it you want?\n\nPORTER. I\'m from Bourdey\'s. I brought a dress and a note, and was told\nto wait.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Ah, from Bourdey\'s! [To T\xc3\xa1nya] Who came in just now?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It was Serg\xc3\xa9y Iv\xc3\xa1nitch Sah\xc3\xa1tof and the Doctor. They stood talking\nhere a bit. It was all about spiritalism.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [correcting her] Spirit_u_alism.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, that\'s just what I said--spiritalism. Have you heard how\nwell it went off last time, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch? [Laughs] There was\nknocks, and things flew about!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. And how do _you_ know?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Miss Elizabeth told me.\n\n    Jacob runs in with a tumbler of tea on a tray.\n\nJACOB [to the Porter] Good morning!\n\nPORTER [disconsolately] Good morning!\n\n    Jacob knocks at Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s door.\n\n    Gregory enters.\n\nGREGORY. Give it here.\n\nJACOB. You didn\'t bring back all yesterday\'s tumblers, nor the tray\nVas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch had. And it\'s me that have to answer for them!\n\nGREGORY. The tray is full of cigars.\n\nJACOB. Well, put them somewhere else. It\'s me who\'s answerable for it.\n\nGREGORY. I\'ll bring it back! I\'ll bring it back!\n\nJACOB. Yes, so you say, but it is not where it ought to be. The other\nday, just as the tea had to be served, it was not to be found.\n\nGREGORY. I\'ll bring it back, I tell you. What a fuss!\n\nJACOB. It\'s easy for you to talk. Here am I serving tea for the third\ntime, and now there\'s the lunch to get ready. One does nothing but rush\nabout the livelong day. Is there any one in the house who has more to do\nthan me? Yet they are never satisfied with me.\n\nGREGORY. Dear me? Who could wish for any one more satisfactory? You\'re\nsuch a fine fellow!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Nobody is good enough for you! You alone\xc2\xa0...\n\nGREGORY [to T\xc3\xa1nya] No one asked your opinion! [Exit].\n\nJACOB. Ah well, I don\'t mind. Taty\xc3\xa1na M\xc3\xa1rkovna, did the mistress say\nanything about yesterday?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. About the lamp, you mean?\n\nJACOB. And how it managed to drop out of my hands, the Lord only knows!\nJust as I began rubbing it, and was going to take hold of it in another\nplace, out it slips and goes all to pieces. It\'s just my luck! It\'s easy\nfor that Gregory Mih\xc3\xa1ylitch to talk--a single man like him! But when one\nhas a family, one has to consider things: they have to be fed. I don\'t\nmind work.... So she didn\'t say anything? The Lord be thanked!... Oh,\nTheodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, have you one spoon or two?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. One. Only one! [Reads newspaper].\n\n    Exit Jacob.\n\n    Bell rings. Enter Gregory (carrying a tray) and the Doorkeeper.\n\nDOORKEEPER [to Gregory] Tell the master some peasants have come from the\nvillage.\n\nGREGORY [pointing to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] Tell the major-domo here, it\'s\nhis business. I have no time. [Exit].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Where are these peasants from?\n\nDOORKEEPER. From Koursk, I think.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [shrieks with delight] It\'s them.... It\'s Simon\'s father come\nabout the land! I\'ll go and meet them! [Runs off].\n\nDOORKEEPER. Well, then, what shall I say to them? Shall they come in\nhere? They say they\'ve come about the land--the master knows, they say.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, they want to purchase some land. All right! But\nhe has a visitor now, so you had better tell them to wait.\n\nDOORKEEPER. Where shall they wait?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Let them wait outside. I\'ll send for them when the\ntime comes. [Exit Doorkeeper]\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya, followed by three Peasants.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. To the right. In here! In here!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I did not want them brought in here!\n\nGREGORY. Forward minx!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, it won\'t matter, they\'ll stand in this\ncorner.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. They\'ll dirty the floor.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. They\'ve scraped their shoes, and I\'ll wipe the floor up\nafterwards. [To Peasants] Here, stand just here.\n\n    Peasants come forward carrying presents tied in cotton\n    handkerchiefs: cake, eggs, and embroidered towels. They look around\n    for an ic\xc3\xb3n before which to cross themselves; not finding one, they\n    cross themselves looking at the staircase.\n\nGREGORY [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch]. There now, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, they say\nPironnet\'s boots are an elegant shape. But those there are ever so much\nbetter. [Pointing to the third Peasant\'s bast shoes].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Why will you always be ridiculing people? [Exit\nGregory].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [rises and goes up to the Peasants] So you are from\nKoursk? And have come to arrange about buying some land?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Just so. We might say, it is for the completion of the\npurchase of the land we have come. How could we announce ourselves to\nthe master?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, yes, I know. You wait a bit and I\'ll go and\ninform him. [Exit].\n\n    The Peasants look around; they are embarrassed where to put their\n    presents.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. There now, couldn\'t we have what d\'you call it? Something\nto present these here things on? To do it in a genteel way, like,--a\nlittle dish or something.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. All right, directly; put them down here for the present. [Puts\nbundles on settle].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. There now,--that respectable gentleman that was here just\nnow,--what might be his station?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. He\'s the master\'s valet.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. I see. So he\'s also in service. And you, now, are you a\nservant too?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I am lady\'s-maid. Do you know, I also come from D\xc3\xa9men! I know\nyou, and you, but I don\'t know him. [Pointing to third Peasant].\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Them two you know, but me you don\'t know?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. You are Ef\xc3\xadm Ant\xc3\xb3nitch.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. And you are Simon\'s father, Zachary Trif\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Right!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. And let me tell you, I\'m M\xc3\xadtry Vl\xc3\xa1sitch Tchil\xc3\xadkin. Now do\nyou know?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Now I shall know you too!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And who may you be?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I am Aks\xc3\xadnya\'s, the soldier\'s wife\'s, orphan.\n\nFIRST AND THIRD PEASANTS [with surprise] Never!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. The proverb says true:\n\n        "Buy a penny pig, put it in the rye,\n         And you\'ll have a wonderful fat porker by-and-by."\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it! She\'s got the resemblance of a duchess!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. That be so truly. Oh Lord!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. [off the scene, rings, and then shouts] Gregory!\nGregory!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Now who\'s that, for example, disturbing himself in such a\nway, if I may say so?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. That\'s the young master.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord! Didn\'t I say we\'d better wait outside until the\ntime comes? [Silence].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Is it _you_, Simon wants to marry?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, has he been writing? [Hides her face in her apron].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. It\'s evident he\'s written! But it\'s a bad business he\'s\nimagined here. I see the lad\'s got spoilt!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [quickly] No, he\'s not at all spoilt! Shall I send him to you?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why send him? All in good time. Where\'s the hurry?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [desperately, behind scene] Gregory! Where the devil\nare you?... [Enters from his room in shirt-sleeves, adjusting his\npince-nez].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Is every one dead?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. He\'s not here, sir.... I\'ll send him to you at once. [Moves\ntowards the back door].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. I could hear you talking, you know. How have these\nscarecrows sprung up here? Eh? What?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. They\'re peasants from the Koursk village, sir. [Peasants bow].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. And who is this? Oh yes, from Bourdier.\n\n    Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch pays no attention to the Peasants\' bow. T\xc3\xa1nya\n    meets Gregory at the doorway and remains on the scene.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [to Gregory] I told you the other boots... I can\'t\nwear these!\n\nGREGORY. Well, the others are also there.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. But where is _there_?\n\nGREGORY. Just in the same place!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. They\'re not!\n\nGREGORY. Well, come and see. [Exeunt Gregory and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch].\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say now, might we not in the meantime just go and wait,\nsay, in some lodging-house or somewhere?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. No, no, wait a little. I\'ll go and bring you some plates to put\nthe presents on. [Exit].\n\n    Enter Sah\xc3\xa1tof and Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, followed by Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\n    The Peasants take up the presents, and pose themselves.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [to Peasants] Presently, presently! Wait a bit!\n[Points to Porter] Who is this?\n\nPORTER. From Bourdey\'s.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Ah, from Bourdier.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [smiling] Well, I don\'t deny it: still you understand that,\nnever having seen it, we, the uninitiated, have some difficulty in\nbelieving.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. You say you find it difficult to believe! We do not\nask for faith; all we demand of you is to investigate! How can I help\nbelieving in this ring? Yet this ring came from there!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. From _there_? What do you mean? From where?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. From the other world. Yes!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [smiling] That\'s very interesting--very interesting!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, supposing we admit that I\'m a man carried away\nby an idea, as you think, and that I am deluding myself. Well, but what\nof Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch Krougosv\xc3\xa9tlof--he is not just an ordinary man,\nbut a distinguished professor, and yet he admits it to be a fact. And\nnot he alone. What of Crookes? What of Wallace?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. But I don\'t deny anything. I only say it is very interesting.\nIt would be interesting to know how Krougosv\xc3\xa9tlof explains it!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. He has a theory of his own. Could you come\nto-night?--he is sure to be here. First we shall have Grossman--you\nknow, the famous thought-reader?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, I have heard of him but have never happened to meet him.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Then you must come! We shall first have Grossman,\nthen Kaptch\xc3\xadtch, and our mediumistic s\xc3\xa9ance.... [To Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch]\nHas the man returned from Kaptch\xc3\xadtch?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Not yet, sir.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Then how am I to know?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Never mind, come in any case! If Kaptch\xc3\xadtch can\'t\ncome we shall find our own medium. M\xc3\xa1rya Ign\xc3\xa1tievna is a medium--not\nsuch a good one as Kaptch\xc3\xadtch, but still\xc2\xa0...\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya enters with plates for the presents, and stands listening.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [smiling] Oh yes, yes. But here is one puzzling point:--how is\nit that the mediums are always of the, so-called, educated class, such\nas Kaptch\xc3\xadtch and M\xc3\xa1rya Ign\xc3\xa1tievna? If there were such a special force,\nwould it not be met with also among the common people--the peasants?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Oh yes, and it is! That is very common. Even here in\nour own house we have a peasant whom we discovered to be a medium. A few\ndays ago we called him in--a sofa had to be moved, during a s\xc3\xa9ance--and\nwe forgot all about him. In all probability he fell asleep. And, fancy,\nafter our s\xc3\xa9ance was over and Kaptch\xc3\xadtch had come to again, we suddenly\nnoticed mediumistic phenomena in another part of the room, near the\npeasant: the table gave a jerk and moved!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [aside] That was when I was getting out from under it!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. It is quite evident he also is a medium. Especially\nas he is very like Home in appearance. You remember Home--a fair-haired\nna\xc3\xafve sort of fellow?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [shrugging his shoulders] Dear me, this is very interesting, you\nknow. I think you should try him.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. So we will! And he is not alone; there are thousands\nof mediums, only we do not know them. Why, only a short time ago a\nbedridden old woman moved a brick wall!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Moved a brick ... a brick wall?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, yes. She was lying in bed, and did not even know\nshe was a medium. She just leant her arm against the wall, and the wall\nmoved!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. And did not cave in?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. And did not cave in.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Very strange! Well then, I\'ll come this evening.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Pray do. We shall have a s\xc3\xa9ance in any case. [Sah\xc3\xa1tof\nputs on his outdoor things, Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch sees him to the door].\n\nPORTER [to T\xc3\xa1nya] Do tell your mistress! Am I to spend the night here?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Wait a little; she\'s going to drive out with the young lady, so\nshe\'ll soon be coming downstairs. [Exit].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [comes up to the Peasants, who bow and offer him their\npresents] That\'s not necessary!\n\nFIRST PEASANT [smiling] Oh, but this-here is our first duty, it is! It\'s\nalso the Commune\'s orders that we should do it!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That\'s always been the proper way.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say no more about it! \'Cause as we are much satisfied....\nAs our parents, let\'s say, served, let\'s say, your parents, so we would\nlike the same with all our hearts ... and not just anyhow! [Bows].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But what is it about? What do you want?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. It\'s to your honour we\'ve come\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Enter Petr\xc3\xadstchef briskly, in fur-lined overcoat.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Is Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch awake yet? [Seeing Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch,\nbows, moving only his head].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. You have come to see my son?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. I? Yes, just to see Vovo for a moment.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Step in, step in.\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef takes off his overcoat and walks in briskly. Exit.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [to Peasants] Well, what is it you want?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Please accept our presents!\n\nFIRST PEASANT [smiling] That\'s to say, the peasants\' offerings.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say no more about it; what\'s the good? We wish you the\nsame as if you were our own father! Say no more about it!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. All right. Here, Theodore, take these.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to Peasants] Give them here. [Takes the presents].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, what is the business?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. We\'ve come to your honour\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I see you have; but what do you want?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. It\'s about making a move towards completing the sale of\nthe land. It comes to this\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Do you mean to buy the land?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. It comes to this ... I mean the buying of\nthe property of the land. The Commune has given us, let\'s say, the power\nof atturning, to enter, let\'s say, as is lawful, through the Government\nbank, with a stamp for the lawful amount.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. You mean that you want to buy the land through the\nland-bank.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. Just as you offered it to us last year.\nIt comes to this, then, the whole sum in full for the buying of the\nproperty of the land is 32,864 roubles.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. That\'s all right, but how about paying up?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. As to the payment, the Commune offers just as it was said\nlast year--to pay in \'stalments, and your receipt of the ready money by\nlawful regulations, 4000 roubles in full.[2]\n\n  [2] The present value of the rouble is rather over two shillings and\n  one penny.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Take 4000 now, and wait for the rest of the money.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [unwrapping a parcel of money] And about this be quite\neasy. We should pawn our own selves rather than do such a thing just\nanyhow say, but in this way, let\'s say, as it ought to be done.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But did I not write and tell you that I should not\nagree to it unless you brought the whole sum?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. It would be more agreeable, but it is not\nin our possibilities, I mean.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well then, the thing can\'t be done!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. The Commune, for example, relied its hopes on that, that\nyou made the offer last year to sell it in easy \'stalments\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. That was last year. I would have agreed to it then,\nbut now I can\'t.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But how\'s that? We\'ve been depending on your\npromise--we\'ve got the papers ready and have collected the money!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Be merciful, master! We\'re short of land; we\'ll say\nnothing about cattle, but even a hen, let\'s say, we\'ve no room to keep.\n[Bows] Don\'t wrong us, master! [Bows].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Of course it\'s quite true, that I agreed last year to\nlet you have the land for payment by instalments, but now circumstances\nare such that it would be inconvenient.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Without this land we cannot live!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. Without land our lives must grow weaker\nand come to a decline.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [bowing] Master, we have so little land, let\'s not talk\nabout the cattle, but even a chicken, let\'s say, we\'ve no room for.\nMaster, be merciful, accept the money, master!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [examining the document] I quite understand, and\nshould like to help you. Wait a little; I will give you an answer in\nhalf-an-hour.... Theodore, say I am engaged and am not to be disturbed.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, sir. [Exit Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch].\n\n    The Peasants look dejected.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Here\'s a go! "Give me the whole sum," he says. And where\nare we to get it from?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If he had not given us hopes, for example. As it is we\nfelt quite insured it would be as was said last year.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord! and I had begun unwrapping the money. [Begins\nwrapping up the bundle of bank-notes again] What are we to do now?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What is your business, then?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Our business, respected sir, depends in this. Last year\nhe made us the offer of our buying the land in \'stalments. The Commune\nentered upon these terms and gave us the powers of atturning, and now\nd\'you see he makes the offering that we should pay the whole in full!\nAnd as it turns out, the business is no ways convenient for us.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What is the whole sum?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. The whole sum in readiness is 4000 roubles, you see.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, what of that? Make an effort and collect more.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Such as it is, it was collected with much effort. We\nhave, so to say, in this sense, not got ammunition enough.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You can\'t get blood out of a stone.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. We\'d be glad with all our hearts, but we have swept even\nthis together, as you might say, with a broom.\n\n    Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch and Petr\xc3\xadstchef appear in the doorway both smoking\n    cigarettes.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. I have told you already I\'ll do my best, so of\ncourse I will do all that is possible! Eh, what?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. You must just understand that if you do not get it, the\ndevil only knows what a mess we shall be in!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. But I\'ve already said I\'ll do my best, and so I will.\nEh, what?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Nothing. I only say, get some at any cost. I will wait.\n\n    Exit into Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s room, closing door.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [waving his arm] It\'s a deuce of a go! [The Peasants\nbow].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [looking at Porter, to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] Why don\'t\nyou attend to this fellow from Bourdier? He hasn\'t come to take lodgings\nwith us, has he? Just look, he is asleep! Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. The note he brought has been sent in, and he has been\ntold to wait until Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna comes down.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [looks at Peasants and notices the money] And what is\nthis? Money? For whom? Is it for us? [To Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] Who are\nthey?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. They are peasants from Koursk. They are buying land.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Has it been sold them?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. No, they have not yet come to any agreement. They are\ntoo stingy.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Eh? Well, we must try and persuade them. [To the\nPeasants] Here, I say, are you buying land? Eh?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. We have made an offering as how we should\nlike to acquire the possession of the land.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Then you should not be so stingy, you know. Just let\nme tell you how necessary land is to peasants! Eh, what? It\'s very\nnecessary, isn\'t it?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. The land appears as the very first and\nforemost necessity to a peasant. That\'s just it.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Then why be so stingy? Just you think what land is!\nWhy, one can sow wheat on it in rows! I tell you, you could get eighty\nbushels of wheat, at a rouble and a half a bushel--that would be 120\nroubles. Eh, what? Or else mint! I tell you, you could collar 400\nroubles off an acre by sowing mint!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. All sorts of producks one could put into\naction if one had the right understanding.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Mint! Decidedly mint! I have learnt about it, you\nknow. It\'s all printed in books. I can show them you. Eh, what?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it, all concerns are clearer to you through\nyour books. That\'s learnedness, of course.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Then pay up and don\'t be stingy. [To Theodore\nIv\xc3\xa1nitch] Where\'s papa?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. He gave orders not to be disturbed just now.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Oh, I suppose he\'s consulting a spirit whether to\nsell the land or not? Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I can\'t say. All I know is that he went away\nundecided about it.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. What d\'you think, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, is he flush of\ncash? Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I don\'t know. I hardly think so. But what does it\nmatter to you? You drew a good sum not more than a week ago.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. But didn\'t I pay for those dogs? And now, you know,\nthere\'s our new Society, and Petr\xc3\xadstchef has been chosen, and I had\nborrowed money from Petr\xc3\xadstchef and must pay the subscription both for\nhim and for myself. Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. And what is this new Society? A Cycling Club?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. No. Just let me tell you. It is quite a new Society.\nIt is a very serious Society, you know. And who do you think is\nPresident? Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What\'s the object of this new Society?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. It is a "Society to Promote the Breeding of Pure-bred\nRussian Hounds." Eh, what? And I\'ll tell you, they\'re having the first\nmeeting and a lunch, to-day. And I\'ve no money. I\'ll go to him and have\na try! [Exit through study door].\n\nFIRST PEASANT [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] And who might he be, respected sir?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [smiles] The young master.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. The heir, so to say. Oh Lord! [puts away the money] I\'d\nbetter hide it meanwhile.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And we were told he was in military service, in the\ncav\'rely, for example.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. No, as an only son he is exempt from military\nservice.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Left for to keep his parents, so to say! That\'s right!\n\nSECOND PEASANT [shaking his head] He\'s the right sort. He\'ll feed them\nfinely!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\n    Enter Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch followed by Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. That\'s always the way. It\'s really surprising! First\nI\'m asked why I have no occupation, and now when I have found a field\nand am occupied, when a Society with serious and noble aims has been\nfounded, I can\'t even have 300 roubles to go on with!...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I tell you I can\'t do it, and I can\'t! I haven\'t got\nit.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Why, you have just sold some land.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. In the first place I have not sold it! And above all,\ndo leave me in peace! Weren\'t you told I was engaged? [Exit, slamming\ndoor].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I told you this was not the right moment.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Well, I say! Here\'s a position to be in! I\'ll go and\nsee mamma--that\'s my only hope. He\'s going crazy over his spiritualism\nand forgets everything else. [Goes upstairs].\n\n    Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch takes newspaper and is just going to sit down,\n    when Betsy and M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna, followed by Gregory, come down\n    the stairs.\n\nBETSY. Is the carriage ready?\n\nGREGORY. Just coming to the door.\n\nBETSY [to M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna] Come along, come along, I know it is he.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. Which he?\n\nBETSY. You know very well whom I mean--Petr\xc3\xadstchef, of course.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. But where is he?\n\nBETSY. Sitting in Vovo\'s room. You\'ll see!\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. And suppose it is not he? [The Peasants and Porter\nbow].\n\nBETSY [to Porter] You brought a dress from Bourdier\'s?\n\nPORTER. Yes, Miss. May I go?\n\nBETSY. Well, I don\'t know. Ask my mother.\n\nPORTER. I don\'t know whose it is, Miss; I was ordered to bring it here\nand receive the money.\n\nBETSY. Well then, wait.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. Is it still that costume for the charade?\n\nBETSY. Yes, a charming costume. But mamma won\'t take it or pay for it.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. But why not?\n\nBETSY. You\'d better ask mamma. She doesn\'t grudge Vovo 500 roubles for\nhis dogs, but 100 is too much for a dress. I can\'t act dressed like a\nscarecrow. [Pointing to Peasants] And who are these?\n\nGREGORY. Peasants who have come to buy some land or other.\n\nBETSY. And I thought they were the beaters. Are you not beaters?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. No, no, lady. We have come to see Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch about\nthe signing into our possession of the title-deeds to some land.\n\nBETSY. Then how is it? Vovo was expecting some beaters who were to come\nto-day. Are you sure you are not the beaters? [The Peasants are silent]\nHow stupid they are! [Goes to Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s door] Vovo? [Laughs].\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. But we met him just now upstairs!\n\nBETSY. Why need you remember that? Vovo, are you there?\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef enters.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Vovo is not here, but I am prepared to fulfil on his behalf\nanything that may be required. How do you do? How do you do, M\xc3\xa1rya\nKonstant\xc3\xadnovna? [Shakes hands long and violently with Betsy, and then\nwith M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. See, it\'s as if he were pumping water!\n\nBETSY. You can\'t replace him,--still you\'re better than nobody. [Laughs]\nWhat are these affairs of yours with Vovo?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. What affairs? Our affairs are fie-nancial, that is, our\nbusiness is fie! It\'s also nancial, and besides it is financial.\n\nBETSY. What does nancial mean?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. What a question! It means nothing, that\'s just the point.\n\nBETSY. No, no, you have missed fire. [Laughs].\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. One can\'t always hit the mark, you know. It\'s something\nlike a lottery. Blanks and blanks again, and at last you win! [Theodore\nIv\xc3\xa1nitch goes into the study].\n\nBETSY. Well, this was blank then; but tell me, were you at the\nMerg\xc3\xa1sofs\' last night?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Not exactly at the _M\xc3\xa8re_ G\xc3\xa1sof\'s, but rather at the _P\xc3\xa8re_\nG\xc3\xa1sof\'s, or better still, at the _Fils_ G\xc3\xa1sof\'s.\n\nBETSY. You can\'t do without puns. It\'s an illness. And were the Gypsies\nthere?[3] [Laughs].\n\n  [3] The Gypsy choirs are very popular in Moscow.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [sings] "On their aprons silken threads, little birds with\ngolden heads!"\xc2\xa0...\n\nBETSY. Happy mortals! And we were yawning at Fofo\'s.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [continues to sing] "And she promised and she swore, She\nwould ope\' her ... her ... her\xc2\xa0..." how does it go on, M\xc3\xa1rya\nKonstant\xc3\xadnovna?\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. "Closet door."\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. How? What? How, M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna?\n\nBETSY. _Cessez, vous devenez impossible!_[4]\n\n  [4] BETSY. Cease! You are becoming quite unbearable!\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. _J\'ai cess\xc3\xa9, j\'ai b\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9, j\'ai d\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9...._[5]\n\n  [5] PETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. I have C said (_ceased_), B said, and D said.\n\nBETSY. I see the only way to rid ourselves of your wit is to make you\nsing! Let us go into Vovo\'s room, his guitar is there. Come, M\xc3\xa1rya\nKonstant\xc3\xadnovna, come! [Exeunt Betsy, M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna, and\nPetr\xc3\xadstchef].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Who be they?\n\nGREGORY. One is our young lady, the other is a girl who teaches her\nmusic.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Administrates learning, so to say. And ain\'t she smart? A\nreg\'lar picture!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why don\'t they marry her? She is old enough, I should\nsay.\n\nGREGORY. Do you think it\'s the same as among you peasants,--marry at\nfifteen?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And that man, for example, is he also in the musitional\nline?\n\nGREGORY [mimicking him] "Musitional" indeed! You don\'t understand\nanything!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. And stupidity, one might say, is our\nignorance.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord! [Gipsy songs and guitar accompaniment are heard\nfrom Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s room].\n\n    Enter Simon, followed by T\xc3\xa1nya, who watches the meeting between\n    father and son.\n\nGREGORY [to Simon] What do you want?\n\nSIMON. I have been to Mr. Kaptch\xc3\xadtch.\n\nGREGORY. Well, and what\'s the answer?\n\nSIMON. He sent word he couldn\'t possibly come to-night.\n\nGREGORY. All right, I\'ll let them know. [Exit].\n\nSIMON [to his father] How d\'you do, father! My respects to Daddy Ef\xc3\xadm\nand Daddy M\xc3\xadtry! How are all at home?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Very well, Simon.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. How d\'you do, lad?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. How d\'you do, sonny?\n\nSIMON [smiles] Well, come along, father, and have some tea.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Wait till we\'ve finished our business. Don\'t you see we\nare not ready yet?\n\nSIMON. Well, I\'ll wait for you by the porch. [Wishes to go away].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [running after him] I say, why didn\'t you tell him anything?\n\nSIMON. How could I before all those people? Give me time, I\'ll tell him\nover our tea. [Exit].\n\n    Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch enters and sits down by the window.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Respected sir, how\'s our business proceeding?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Wait a bit, he\'ll be out presently, he\'s just\nfinishing.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] And how do you know, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, he\nis finishing?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I know that when he has finished questioning, he\nreads the question and answer aloud.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Can one really talk with spirits by means of a saucer?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. It seems so.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But supposing they tell him to sign, will he sign?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Of course he will.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But they do not speak with words?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Oh, yes. By means of the alphabet. He notices at\nwhich letter the saucer stops.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, but at a si-ance?...\n\n    Enter Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, friends, I can\'t do it! I should be very glad\nto, but it is quite impossible. If it were for ready money it would be a\ndifferent matter.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. What more could any one desire? But the\npeople are so inpennycuous--it is quite impossible!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, I can\'t do it, I really can\'t. Here is your\ndocument; I can\'t sign it.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Show some pity, master; be merciful!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. How can you act so? It is doing us a wrong.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Nothing wrong about it, friends. I offered it you in\nsummer, but then you did not agree; and now I can\'t agree to it.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Master, be merciful! How are we to get along? We have so\nlittle land. We\'ll say nothing about the cattle; a hen, let\'s say,\nthere\'s no room to let a hen run about.\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch goes up to the door and stops. Enter, descending\n    the staircase, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna and doctor, followed by Vas\xc3\xadly\n    Leon\xc3\xadditch, who is in a merry and playful mood and is putting some\n    bank-notes into his purse.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [tightly laced, and wearing a bonnet] Then I am to take\nit?\n\nDOCTOR. If the symptoms recur you must certainly take it, but above all,\nyou must behave better. How can you expect thick syrup to pass through a\nthin little hair tube, especially when we squeeze the tube? It\'s\nimpossible; and so it is with the biliary duct. It\'s simple enough.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. All right, all right!\n\nDOCTOR. Yes, "All right, all right," and you go on in the same old way.\nIt won\'t do, madam--it won\'t do. Well, good-bye!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. No, not good-bye, only _au revoir_! For I still expect\nyou to-night. I shall not be able to make up my mind without you.\n\nDOCTOR. All right, if I have time I\'ll pop in. [Exit].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [noticing the Peasants] What\'s this? What? What people are\nthese? [Peasants bow].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. These are peasants from Koursk, come to see Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch about the sale of some land.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I see they are peasants, but who let them in?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch gave the order. He has just been\nspeaking to them about the sale of the land.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What sale? There is no need to sell any. But above all,\nhow can one let in people from the street into the house? One can\'t let\npeople in from the street! One can\'t let people into the house who have\nspent the night heaven knows where!... [Getting more and more excited] I\ndaresay every fold of their clothes is full of microbes--of\nscarlet-fever microbes, of smallpox microbes, of diphtheria microbes!\nWhy, they are from Koursk Government, where there is an epidemic of\ndiphtheria ... Doctor! Doctor! Call the doctor back!\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch goes into his room and shuts the door. Gregory\n    goes to recall the Doctor.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [smokes at the Peasants] Never mind, mamma; if you\nlike I\'ll fumigate them so that all the microbes will go to pot! Eh,\nwhat?\n\n    Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna remains severely silent, awaiting the Doctor\'s return.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [to Peasants] And do you fatten pigs? There\'s a\nfirst-rate business!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. We do go in for the pig-fattening line\nnow and then.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. This kind?... [Grunts like a pig].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Vovo, Vovo, leave off!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Isn\'t it like? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. It\'s very resemblant.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Vovo, leave off, I tell you!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. What\'s it all about?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. I said, we\'d better go to some lodging meanwhile!\n\n    Enter Doctor and Gregory.\n\nDOCTOR. What\'s the matter? What\'s happened?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Why, you\'re always saying I must not get excited. Now,\nhow is it possible to keep calm? I do not see my own sister for two\nmonths, and am careful about any doubtful visitor--and here are people\nfrom Koursk, straight from Koursk, where there is an epidemic of\ndiphtheria, right in my house!\n\nDOCTOR. These good fellows you mean, I suppose?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Of course. Straight from a diphtheric place!\n\nDOCTOR. Well, of course, if they come from an infected place it is rash;\nbut still there is no reason to excite yourself so much about it.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. But don\'t you yourself advise carefulness?\n\nDOCTOR. Of course, of course. Still, why excite yourself?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. How can I help it? Now we shall have to have the house\ncompletely disinfected.\n\nDOCTOR. Oh no! Why completely? That would cost 300 roubles or more.\nI\'ll arrange it cheaply and well for you. Take, to a large bottle of\nwater\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Boiled?\n\nDOCTOR. It\'s all the same. Boiled would be better. To one bottle of\nwater take a tablespoon of salicylic acid, and have everything they have\ncome in contact with washed with the solution. As to the fellows\nthemselves, they must be off, of course. That\'s all. Then you\'re quite\nsafe. And it would do no harm to sprinkle some of the same solution\nthrough a spray--two or three tumblers--you\'ll see how well it will act.\nNo danger whatever!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. T\xc3\xa1nya! Where is T\xc3\xa1nya?\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Did you call, M\'m?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You know that big bottle in my dressing-room?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Out of which we sprinkled the laundress yesterday?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, of course! What other bottle could I mean? Well\nthen, take that bottle and first wash with soap the place where they\nhave been standing, and then with\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, M\'m; I know how.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. And then take the spray ... However, I had better do that\nmyself when I get back.\n\nDOCTOR. Well then, do so, and don\'t be afraid! Well, _au revoir_ till\nthis evening. [Exit].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. And they must be off! Not a trace of them must remain!\nGet out, get out! Go--what are you looking at?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. It\'s because of our stupidity, as we were\ninstructed\xc2\xa0...\n\nGREGORY [pushes the Peasants out] There, there; be off!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Let me have my handkerchief back! [The handkerchief in\nwhich the presents were wrapped].\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord, oh Lord! didn\'t I say--some lodging-house\nmeanwhile!\n\n    Gregory pushes him out. Exeunt Peasants.\n\nPORTER [who has repeatedly tried to say something] Will there be any\nanswer?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Ah, from Bourdier? [Excitedly] None! None! You can take\nit back. I told her I never ordered such a costume, and I will not allow\nmy daughter to wear it!\n\nPORTER. I know nothing about it. I was sent\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Go, go, take it back! I will call myself about it!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [solemnly] Sir Messenger from Bourdier, depart!\n\nPORTER. I might have been told that long ago. I have sat here nearly\nfive hours!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Ambassador from Bourdier, begone!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Cease, please!\n\n    Exit Porter.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Betsy! Where is she? I always have to wait for her.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [shouting at the top of his voice] Betsy! Petr\xc3\xadstchef!\nCome quick, quick, quick! Eh? What?\n\n    Enter Petr\xc3\xadstchef, Betsy, and M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You always keep one waiting!\n\nBETSY. On the contrary, I was waiting for you!\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef bows with his head only, then kisses Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\'s\n    hand.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. How d\'you do! [To Betsy] You always have an answer ready!\n\nBETSY. If you are upset, mamma, I had better not go.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Are we going or not?\n\nBETSY. Well, let us go; it can\'t be helped.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Did you see the man from Bourdier?\n\nBETSY. Yes, and I was very glad. I ordered the costume, and am going to\nwear it when it is paid for.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I am not going to pay for a costume that is indecent!\n\nBETSY. Why has it become indecent? First it was decent, and now you have\na fit of prudery.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Not prudery at all! If the bodice were completely\naltered, then it would do.\n\nBETSY. Mamma, that is quite impossible.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, get dressed. [They sit down. Gregory puts on their\nover-shoes for them].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna, do you notice a vacuum in the\nhall?\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. What is it? [Laughs in anticipation].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Bourdier\'s man has gone! Eh, what? Good, eh? [Laughs\nloudly].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, let us go. [Goes out of the door, but returns at\nonce] T\xc3\xa1nya!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, M\'m?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Don\'t let Frisk catch cold while I am away. If she wants\nto be let out, put on her little yellow cloak. She is not quite well\nto-day.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, M\'m.\n\n    Exeunt Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, Betsy, and Gregory.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Well, have you got it?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Not without trouble, I can tell you! First I rushed\nat the gov\'nor; he began to bellow and turned me out. Off to the\nmater--I got it out of her. It\'s here! [Slaps his breast pocket] If once\nI make up my mind, there\'s no getting away from me. I have a deadly\ngrip! Eh, what? And d\'you know, my wolf-hounds are coming to-day.\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch put on their outdoor things and go\n    out. T\xc3\xa1nya follows.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [alone] Yes, nothing but unpleasantness. How is it\nthey can\'t live in peace? But one must say the new generation are\nnot--the thing. And as to the women\'s dominion!... Why, Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch just now was going to put in a word, but seeing what a frenzy\nshe was in--slammed the door behind him. He is a wonderfully\nkind-hearted man. Yes, wonderfully kind. What\'s this? Here\'s T\xc3\xa1nya\nbringing them back again!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Come in, come in, grand-dads, never mind!\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya and the Peasants.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Why have you brought them back?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, we must do something about their\nbusiness. I shall have to wash the place anyhow.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But the business will not come off, I see that\nalready.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. How could we best put our affair into action, respected\nsir? Your reverence might take a little trouble over it, and we should\ngive you full thankings from the Commune for your trouble.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Do try, honey! We can\'t live! We have so little land.\nTalk of cattle--why, we have no room to keep a hen! [They bow].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I am sorry for you, friends, but I can\'t think of any\nway to help you. I understand your case very well, but he has refused.\nSo what can one do? Besides, the lady is also against it. Well, give me\nyour papers--I\'ll try and see what I can do, but I hardly hope to\nsucceed. [Exit].\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya and the three Peasants sigh.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But tell me, grand-dads, what is it that is wanted?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Why, only that he should put his signature to our\ndocument.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. That the master should sign? Is that all?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Yes, only lay his signature on the deed and take the\nmoney, and there would be an end of the matter.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. He only has to write and sign, as the peasants, let\'s\nsay, desire, so, let\'s say, I also desire. That\'s the whole affair--if\nhe\'d only take it and sign it, it\'s all done.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [considering] He need only sign the paper and it\'s done?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. The whole matter is in dependence on\nthat, and nothing else. Let him sign, and we ask no more.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Just wait and see what Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch will say. If he cannot\npersuade the master, I\'ll try something.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Get round him, will you?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I\'ll try.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Ay, the lass is going to bestir herself. Only get the\nthing settled, and the Commune will bind itself to keep you all your\nlife. See there, now!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If the affair can be put into action, truly we might put\nher in a gold frame.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That goes without saying!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I can\'t promise for certain, but as the saying is: "An attempt is\nno sin, if you try\xc2\xa0..."\n\nFIRST PEASANT. "You may win." That\'s just so.\n\n    Enter Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. No, friends, it\'s no go! He has not done it, and he\nwon\'t do it. Here, take your document. You may go.\n\nFIRST PEASANT [gives T\xc3\xa1nya the paper] Then it\'s on you we pin all our\nreliance, for example.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, yes! You go into the street, and I\'ll run out to you in a\nminute and have a word with you.\n\n    Exeunt Peasants.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, ask the master to come\nout and speak to me for a moment. I have something to say to him.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What next?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I must, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch. Ask him, do; there\'s nothing wrong\nabout it, on my sacred word.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But what do you want with him?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. That\'s a little secret. I will tell you later on, only ask him.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [smiling] I can\'t think what you are up to! All right,\nI\'ll go and ask him. [Exit].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I\'ll do it! Didn\'t he say himself that there is that power in\nSimon? And I know how to manage. No one found me out that time, and now\nI\'ll teach Simon what to do. If it doesn\'t succeed it\'s no great matter.\nAfter all it\'s not a sin.\n\n    Enter Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch followed by Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [smiling] Is this the petitioner? Well, what is your\nbusiness?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s a little secret, Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch; let me tell it you\nalone.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. What is it? Theodore, leave us for a minute.\n\n    Exit Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. As I have grown up and lived in your house, Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch,\nand as I am very grateful to you for everything, I shall open my heart\nto you as to a father. Simon, who is living in your house, wants to\nmarry me.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. So that\'s it!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I open my heart to you as to a father! I have no one to advise\nme, being an orphan.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, and why not? He seems a nice lad.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, that\'s true. He would be all right; there is only one thing\nI have my doubts about. It\'s something about him that I have noticed and\ncan\'t make out ... perhaps it is something bad.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. What is it? Does he drink?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. God forbid! But since I know that there is such a thing as\nspiritalism\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Ah, you know that?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Of course! I understand it very well. Some, of course, through\nignorance, don\'t understand it.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, what then?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I am very much afraid for Simon. It does happen to him.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. What happens to him?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Something of a kind like spiritalism. You ask any of the\nservants. As soon as he gets drowsy at the table, the table begins to\ntremble, and creak like that: _tuke, ... tuke_! All the servants have\nheard it.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Why, it\'s the very thing I was saying to Serg\xc3\xa9y\nIv\xc3\xa1nitch this morning! Yes?...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Or else ... when was it?... Oh yes, last Wednesday. We sat down\nto dinner, and the spoon just jumps into his hand of itself!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Ah, that is interesting! Jumps into his hand? When he\nwas drowsing?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. That I didn\'t notice. I think he was, though.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes?...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. And that\'s what I\'m afraid of, and what I wanted to ask you\nabout. May not some harm come of it? To live one\'s life together, and\nhim having such a thing in him!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [smiling] No, you need not be afraid, there is nothing\nbad in that. It only proves him to be a _medium_--simply a medium. I\nknew him to be a medium before this.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. So that\'s what it is! And I was afraid!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. No, there\'s nothing to be afraid of. [Aside]. That\'s\ncapital! Kaptch\xc3\xadtch can\'t come, so we will test him to-night.... [To\nT\xc3\xa1nya] No, my dear, don\'t be afraid, he will be a good husband and ...\nthat is only a kind of special power, and every one has it, only in some\nit is weaker and in others stronger.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Thank you, sir. Now I shan\'t think any more about it; but I was\nso frightened.... What a thing it is, our want of education!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. No, no, don\'t be frightened... Theodore!\n\n    Enter Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I am going out now. Get everything ready for\nto-night\'s s\xc3\xa9ance.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But Mr. Kaptch\xc3\xadtch is not coming.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. That does not matter. [Puts on overcoat] We shall\nhave a trial s\xc3\xa9ance with our own medium. [Exit. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch goes\nout with him].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [alone] He believes it! He believes it! [Shrieks and jumps with\njoy] He really believes it! Isn\'t it wonderful! [Shrieks] Now I\'ll do\nit, if only Simon has pluck for it!\n\n    Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch returns.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, have you told him your secret?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I\'ll tell you too, only later on.... But I have a favour to ask\nof you too, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes? What is it?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [shyly] You have been a second father to me, and I will open my\nheart before you as before God.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Don\'t beat about the bush, but come straight to the\npoint.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. The point is ... well, the point is, that Simon wants to marry\nme.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Is that it? I thought I noticed\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, why should I hide it? I am an orphan, and you know yourself\nhow matters are in these town establishments. Every one comes bothering;\nthere\'s that Gregory Mih\xc3\xa1ylitch, for instance, he gives me no peace. And\nalso that other one ... you know. They think I have no soul, and am only\nhere for their amusement.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Good girl, that\'s right! Well, what then?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, Simon wrote to his father; and he, his father, sees me\nto-day, and says: "He\'s spoilt"--he means his son. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch\n[bows], take the place of a father to me, speak to the old man,--to\nSimon\'s father! I could take them into the kitchen, and you might come\nin and speak to the old man!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [smiling] Then I am to turn match-maker--am I? Well, I\ncan do that.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, dearest, be a father to me, and I\'ll pray for\nyou all my life long.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. All right, all right, I\'ll come later on. Haven\'t I\npromised? [Takes up newspaper].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. You are a second father to me!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. All right, all right.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Then I\'ll rely on you. [Exit].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [alone, shaking his head] A good affectionate girl. To\nthink that so many like her perish! Get but once into trouble and she\'ll\ngo from hand to hand until she sinks into the mire, and can never be\nfound again! There was that dear little Nataly. She, too, was a good\ngirl, reared and cared for by a mother. [Takes up paper] Well, let\'s see\nwhat tricks Ferdinand is up to in Bulgaria.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n    Evening of the same day. The scene represents the interior of the\n    servants\' kitchen. The Peasants have taken off their outer garments\n    and sit drinking tea at the table, and perspiring. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch\n    is smoking a cigar at the other side of the stage. The discharged\n    Cook is lying on the brick oven, and is unseen during the early part\n    of the scene.\n\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. My advice is, don\'t hinder him! If it\'s his wish and\nhers, in Heaven\'s name let him do it. She is a good, honest girl. Never\nmind her being a bit dressy; she can\'t help that, living in town: she is\na good girl all the same.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, of course, if it is his wish, let him! _He\'ll_\nhave to live with her, not me. But she\'s certainly uncommon spruce.\nHow\'s one to take her into one\'s hut? Why, she\'ll not let her\nmother-in-law so much as pat her on the head.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. That does not depend on the spruceness, but on\ncharacter. If her nature is good, she\'s sure to be docile and\nrespectful.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Ah, well, we\'ll have her if the lad\'s bent on having\nher. After all, it\'s a bad job to live with one as one don\'t care for.\nI\'ll consult my missus, and then may Heaven bless them!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Then let\'s shake hands on it!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, it seems it will have to come off.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Eh, Zachary! fortune\'s a-smiling on you! You\'ve come to\naccomplish a piece of business, and just see what a duchess of a\ndaughter-in-law you\'ve obtained. All that\'s left to be done is to have\na drink on it, and then it will be all in order.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. That\'s not at all necessary. [An awkward silence].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I know something of your way of life too, you know. I\nam even thinking of purchasing a bit of land, building a cottage, and\nworking on the land myself somewhere: maybe in your neighbourhood.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. A very good thing too.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. When one has got the money one can get\nall kinds of pleasure in the country.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say no more about it! Country life, let\'s say, is freer\nin every way, not like the town!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. There now, would you let me join your Commune if I\nsettled among you?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why not? If you stand drink for the Elders, they\'ll\naccept you soon enough!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And if you open a public-house, for example, or an inn,\nwhy, you\'d have such a life you\'d never need to die! You might live like\na king, and no mistake.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, we\'ll see. I should certainly like to have a\nfew quiet years in my old age. Though my life here is good enough, and I\nshould be sorry to leave. Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch is an exceedingly\nkind-hearted man.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. But how about our business? Is it\npossible that he is going to leave it without any termination?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. He\'d do it willingly.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. It seems he\'s afraid of his wife.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. It\'s not that he\'s afraid, but they don\'t hit things\noff together.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. But you should try, father! How are we to live else?\nWe\'ve so little land\xc2\xa0...\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. We\'ll see what comes of T\xc3\xa1nya\'s attempt. She\'s taken\nthe business into her hands now!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [takes a sip of tea] Father, be merciful. We\'ve so little\nland. A hen, let\'s say, we\'ve no room for a hen, let alone the cattle.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. If the business depended on me.... [To Second\nPeasant] Well, friend, so we\'ve done our bit of match-making! It\'s\nagreed then about T\xc3\xa1nya?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. I\'ve given my word, and I\'ll not go back on it without a\ngood reason. If only our business succeeds!\n\n    Enter Servants\' Cook who looks up at the oven, makes a sign, and\n    then begins to speak animatedly to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Just now Simon was called upstairs from the front\nkitchen! The master and that other bald-headed one who calls up spirits\nwith him, ordered him to sit down and take the place of Kaptch\xc3\xadtch!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. You don\'t say so!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Yes, Jacob told T\xc3\xa1nya.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Extraordinary!\n\n    Enter Coachman.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What do you want?\n\nCOACHMAN [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] You may just tell them I never agreed to\nlive with a lot of dogs! Let any one who likes do it, but I will never\nagree to live among dogs!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What dogs?\n\nCOACHMAN. Three dogs have been sent into our room by Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch!\nThey\'ve messed it all over. They\'re whining, and if one comes near them\nthey bite--the devils! They\'d tear you to pieces if you didn\'t mind.\nI\'ve a good mind to take a club and smash their legs for them!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But when did they come?\n\nCOACHMAN. Why, to-day, from the Dog Show; the devil knows what kind they\nare, but they\'re an expensive sort. Are we or the dogs to live in the\ncoachmen\'s quarters? You just go and ask!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, that will never do. I\'ll go and ask about it.\n\nCOACHMAN. They\'d better be brought here to Louk\xc3\xa9rya.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK [angrily] People have to eat here, and you\'d like to lock\ndogs in here! As it is\xc2\xa0...\n\nCOACHMAN. And I\'ve got the liveries, and the sledge-covers and the\nharness there, and they expect things kept clean! Perhaps the porter\'s\nlodge might do.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I must ask Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch.\n\nCOACHMAN [angrily] He\'d better hang the brutes round his neck and lug\nthem about with him! But no fear: he\'d rather ride on horseback himself.\nIt\'s he as spoilt Beauty without rhyme or reason. That was a horse!...\nOh dear! what a life! [Exit, slamming door].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. That\'s not right! Certainly not right! [To Peasants]\nWell then, it\'s time we were saying good-bye, friends.\n\nPEASANTS. Good-bye!\n\n    Exit Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\n    As soon as he is gone a sound of groaning is heard from the top of\n    the oven.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. He\'s sleek, that one; looks like a general.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Rather! Why, he has a room all to himself; he gets his\nwashing, his tea and sugar, and food from the master\'s table.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK [on the oven]. Why shouldn\'t the old beggar live well?\nHe\'s lined his pockets all right!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Who\'s that up there, on the oven?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Oh, it\'s only a man.\n\n    Silence.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, and you too, as I noticed a while since when you\nwere supping, have capital food to eat.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. We can\'t complain. She\'s not mean about the food. We\nhave wheat bread every Sunday, and fish when a holiday happens to be a\nfast-day too, and those who like may eat meat.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And does any one tuck into flesh on fast-days?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Oh, they nearly all do! Only the old coachman--not the\none who was here just now but the old one--and Simon, and I and the\nhousekeeper, fast--all the others eat meat.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And the master himself?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Catch him! Why, I bet he\'s forgotten there is such a\nthing as fasting!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s the gentlefolks\' way: they have got it all out of\ntheir books. \'Cos of their intelex!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Shouldn\'t wonder if they feed on wheat bread every day!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Wheat bread indeed! Much they think of wheat bread! You\nshould see what food they eat. No end of different things!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. In course gentlefolks\' food is of an airial kind.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Airial, of course, but all the same they\'re good at\nstuffing themselves, they are!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Have healthy appekites, so to say.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. \'Cos they always rinse it down! All with sweet wines,\nand spirits, and fizzy liquors. They have a different one to suit every\nkind of food. They eat and rinse it down, and eat and rinse it down,\nthey do.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And so the food\'s floated down in proportion, so to say.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Ah yes, they are good at stuffing! It\'s awful! You see,\nit\'s not just sitting down, eating, then saying grace and going\naway--they\'re always at it!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Like pigs with their feet in the trough! [Peasants\nlaugh].\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. As soon as, by God\'s grace, they have opened their eyes,\nthe samov\xc3\xa1r is brought in--tea, coffee, chocolate. Hardly is the second\nsamov\xc3\xa1r emptied, a third has to be set. Then lunch, then dinner, then\nagain coffee. They\'ve hardly left off, then comes tea, and all sorts of\ntit-bits and sweetmeats--there\'s never an end to it! They even lie in\nbed and eat!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. There now; that\'s good! [Laughs].\n\nFIRST AND SECOND PEASANTS. What are you about?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. If I could only live a single day like that!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But when do they do their work?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Work indeed! What is their work? Cards and piano--that\'s\nall their work. The young lady used to sit down to the piano as soon as\nshe opened her eyes, and off she\'d go! And that other one who lives\nhere, the teacher, stands and waits. "When will the piano be free?" When\none has finished, off rattles the other, and sometimes they\'d put two\npianos near one another and four of \'em would bust out at once. Bust out\nin such a manner, you could hear \'em down here!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Well, and that\'s all the work they do! Piano or cards!\nAs soon as they have met together--cards, wine, smoking, and so on all\nnight long. And as soon as they are up: eating again!\n\n    Enter Simon.\n\nSIMON. Hope you\'re enjoying your tea!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Come and join us.\n\nSIMON [comes up to the table] Thank you kindly. [First Peasant pours out\na cup of tea for him].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Where have you been?\n\nSIMON. Upstairs.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, and what was being done there?\n\nSIMON. Why, I couldn\'t make it out at all! I don\'t know how to explain\nit.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But what was it?\n\nSIMON. I can\'t explain it. They have been trying some kind of strength\nin me. I can\'t make it out. T\xc3\xa1nya says, "Do it, and we\'ll get the land\nfor our peasants; he\'ll sell it them."\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But how is she going to manage it?\n\nSIMON. I can\'t make it out, and she won\'t say. She says, "Do as I tell\nyou," and that\'s all.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But what is it you have to do?\n\nSIMON. Nothing just now. They made me sit down, put out the lights and\ntold me to sleep. And T\xc3\xa1nya had hidden herself there. They didn\'t see\nher, but I did.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why? What for?\n\nSIMON. The Lord only knows--I can\'t make it out.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Naturally it is for the distraction of time.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, it\'s clear you and I can make nothing of it. You\nhad better tell me whether you have taken all your wages yet.\n\nSIMON. No, I\'ve not drawn any. I have twenty-eight roubles to the good,\nI think.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That\'s all right! Well, if God grants that we get the\nland, I\'ll take you home, Simon.\n\nSIMON. With all my heart!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You\'ve got spoilt, I should say. You\'ll not want to\nplough?\n\nSIMON. Plough? Only give me the chance! Plough or mow,--I\'m game. Those\nare things one doesn\'t forget.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. But it don\'t seem very desirous after town life, for\nexample? Eh!\n\nSIMON. It\'s good enough for me. One can live in the country too.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And Daddy M\xc3\xadtry here, is already on the look-out for your\nplace; he\'s hankering after a life of luckshury!\n\nSIMON. Eh, Daddy M\xc3\xadtry, you\'d soon get sick of it. It seems easy enough\nwhen one looks at it, but there\'s a lot of running about that takes it\nout of one.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. You should see one of their balls, Daddy M\xc3\xadtry, then you\nwould be surprised!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Why, do they eat all the time?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. My eye! You should have seen what we had here awhile\nago. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch took me upstairs and I peeped in. The\nladies--awful! Dressed up! Dressed up, bless my heart, and all bare down\nto here, and their arms bare.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Faugh! How beastly!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. I take it the climate allows of that sort of thing!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Well, daddy, so I peeped in. Dear me, what it was like!\nAll of \'em in their natural skins! Would you believe it: old women--our\nmistress, only think, she\'s a grandmother, and even she\'d gone and bared\nher shoulders.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. And what next? The music strikes up, and each man of \'em\nwent up to his own, catches hold of her, and off they go twirling round\nand round!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. The old women too?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Yes, the old ones too.\n\nSIMON. No, the old ones sit still.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Get along,--I\'ve seen it myself!\n\nSIMON. No they don\'t.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK [in a hoarse voice, looking down from the oven] That\'s\nthe Polka-Mazurka. You fools don\'t understand what dancing is. The way\nthey dance\xc2\xa0...\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Shut up, you dancer! And keep quiet--there\'s some one\ncoming.\n\n    Enter Gregory; old Cook hides hurriedly.\n\nGREGORY [to Servants\' Cook] Bring some sour cabbage.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. I am only just up from the cellar, and now I must go\ndown again! Who is it for?\n\nGREGORY. For the young ladies. Be quick, and send it up with Simon. I\ncan\'t wait!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. There now, they tuck into sweetmeats till they are full\nup, and then they crave for sour cabbage!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s to make a clearance.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Of course, and as soon as there is room inside, they\nbegin again! [Takes basin, and exit].\n\nGREGORY [at Peasants] Look at them, how they\'ve established themselves\ndown here! Mind, if the mistress finds it out she\'ll give it you hot,\nlike she did this morning! [Exit, laughing].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it, she did raise a storm that time--awful!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That time it looked as if the master was going to step\nin, but seeing that the missus was about to blow the very roof off the\nhouse, he slams the door. Have your own way, thinks he.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [waving his arm] It\'s the same everywhere. My old woman,\nlet\'s say, she kicks up such a rumpus sometimes--it\'s just awful! Then I\njust get out of the hut. Let her go to Jericho! She\'ll give you one with\nthe poker if you don\'t mind. Oh Lord!\n\n    Jacob enters hurriedly with a prescription.\n\nJACOB. Here, Simon, you run to the chemist\'s and get these powders for\nthe mistress!\n\nSIMON. But master told me not to go out.\n\nJACOB. You\'ve plenty of time; your business won\'t begin till after their\ntea. Hope you are enjoying your tea!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Thanks, come and join us.\n\n    Exit Simon.\n\nJACOB. I haven\'t time. However, I\'ll just have one cup for company\'s\nsake.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And we\'ve just been having a conversation as to how your\nmistress carried on so haughty this morning.\n\nJACOB. Oh, she\'s a reg\'lar fury! So hot-tempered, that she gets quite\nbeside herself. Sometimes she even bursts out crying.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Now, there\'s a thing I wanted to ask you about. What, for\nexample, be these mikerots she was illuding to erewhile? "They\'ve\ninfested the house with mikerots, with mikerots," she says. What is one\nto make of these same mikerots?\n\nJACOB. Mikerogues, you mean! Well, it seems there is such a kind of\nbugs; all illnesses come from them, they say. So she says there are some\nof \'em on you. After you were gone, they washed and washed and sprinkled\nthe place where you had stood. There\'s a kind of physic as kills these\nsame bugs, they say.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then where have we got these bugs on us?\n\nJACOB [drinking his tea] Why, they say they\'re so small that one can\'t\nsee \'em even through a glass.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then how does she know I\'ve got \'em on me? Perhaps\nthere\'s more of that muck on her than on me!\n\nJACOB. There now, you go and ask her!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. I believe it\'s humbug.\n\nJACOB. Of course it\'s bosh. The doctors must invent something, or else\nwhat are they paid for? There\'s one comes to us every day. Comes,--talks\na bit,--and pockets ten roubles!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Nonsense!\n\nJACOB. Why, there\'s one as takes a hundred!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. A hundred? Humbug!\n\nJACOB. A hundred. Humbug, you say? Why, if he has to go out of town,\nhe\'ll not do it for less than a thousand! "Give a thousand," he says,\n"or else you may kick the bucket for what I care!"\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then does he know some charm?\n\nJACOB. I suppose he must. I served at a General\'s outside Moscow once: a\ncross, terrible proud old fellow he was--just awful. Well, this\nGeneral\'s daughter fell ill. They send for that doctor at once. "A\nthousand roubles, then I\'ll come." Well, they agreed, and he came. Then\nthey did something or other he didn\'t like, and he bawled out at the\nGeneral and says, "Is this the way you show your respect for me? Then\nI\'ll not attend her!" And, oh my! The old General forgot all his pride,\nand starts wheedling him in every way not to chuck up the job!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And he got the thousand?\n\nJACOB. Of course!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That\'s easy got money. What wouldn\'t a peasant do with\nsuch a sum!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. And I think it\'s all bosh. That time my foot was\nfestering I had it doctored ever so long. I spent nigh on five roubles\non it,--then I gave up doctoring, and it got all right!\n\n    Discharged Cook on the oven coughs.\n\nJACOB. Ah, the old crony is here again!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Who might that man be?\n\nJACOB. He used to be our master\'s cook. He comes to see Louk\xc3\xa9rya.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Kitchen-master, as one might say. Then, does he live\nhere?\n\nJACOB. No, they won\'t allow that. He\'s here one day, there another. If\nhe\'s got a copper he goes to a dosshouse; but when he has drunk all, he\ncomes here.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. How did he come to this?\n\nJACOB. Simply grew weak. And what a man he used to be--like a gentleman!\nWent about with a gold watch; got forty roubles a month wages. And now\nlook at him! He\'d have starved to death long ago if it hadn\'t been for\nLouk\xc3\xa9rya.\n\n    Enter Servants\' Cook with the sour cabbage.\n\nJACOB [to Servants\' Cook] I see you\'ve got Paul Petr\xc3\xb3vitch here again?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. And where\'s he to go to? Is he to go and freeze?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What liquor does.... Liquor, let\'s say ... [Clicks his\ntongue sympathetically].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Of course. A firm man\'s firm as a rock; a weak man\'s\nweaker than water.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK [gets off the oven with trembling hands and legs]\nLouk\xc3\xa9rya, I say, give us a drop!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. What are you up to? I\'ll give you such a drop!...\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Have you no conscience? I\'m dying! Brothers, a\ncopper\xc2\xa0...\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Get back on the oven, I tell you!\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Half a glass only, cook, for Heaven\'s sake! I say, do\nyou understand? I ask you in the name of Heaven, now!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Come along, here\'s some tea for you.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Tea; what is tea? Weak, sloppy stuff. A little\nv\xc3\xb3dka--just one little drop ... Louk\xc3\xa9rya!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Poor old soul, what agony it is!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You\'d better give him some.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK [gets out a bottle and fills a wine-glass] Here you are;\nyou\'ll get no more.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK [clutches hold of it and drinks, trembling all over]\nLouk\xc3\xa9rya, Cook! I am drinking, and you must understand\xc2\xa0...\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Now then, stop your chatter! Get on to the oven, and let\nnot a breath of you be heard! [The old Cook meekly begins to climb up,\nmuttering something to himself].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. What it is, when a man gives way to his weakness!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it--human weakness.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. That goes without saying.\n\n    The Discharged Cook settles down, muttering all the time. Silence.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. I want to ask you something: that girl of Aks\xc3\xadnya\'s as\ncomes from our village and is living here. How is she? What is she\nlike? How is she living--I mean, does she live honest?\n\nJACOB. She\'s a nice girl; one can say nothing but good of her.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. I\'ll tell you straight, daddy; I know this here\nestablishment out and out, and if you mean to have T\xc3\xa1nya for your son\'s\nwife--be quick about it, before she comes to grief, or else she\'ll not\nescape!\n\nJACOB. Yes, that\'s true. A while ago we had a girl here, Nataly. She was\na good girl too. And she was lost without rhyme or reason. No better\nthan that chap! [Pointing to the old Cook].\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. There\'s enough to dam a mill-pool, with the likes of us,\nas perish! \'Cos why, every one is tempted by the easy life and the good\nfood. And see there,--as soon as one has tasted the good food she goes\nand slips. And once she\'s slipped, they don\'t want her, but get a fresh\none in her place. So it was with dear little Nataly; she also slipped,\nand they turned her out. She had a child and fell ill, and died in the\nhospital last spring. And what a girl she used to be!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord! People are weak; they ought to be pitied.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Those devils pity? No fear! [He hangs his legs down\nfrom the oven] I have stood roasting myself by the kitchen range for\nthirty years, and now that I am not wanted, I may go and die like a\ndog.... Pity indeed!...\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. It\'s the old circumstances.\n\nSECOND PEASANT.\n\n        While they drank and they fed, you were "curly head."\n        When they\'d finished the prog, \'twas "Get out, mangy dog!"\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Much you know. What is "Sautey a la Bongmont"? What is\n"Bavassary"? Oh, the things I could make! Think of it! The Emperor\ntasted my work, and now the devils want me no longer. But I am not going\nto stand it!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Now then, stop that noise, mind.... Get up right into\nthe corner, so that no one can see you, or else Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch or\nsome one may come in, and both you and me\'ll be turned out! [Silence].\n\nJACOB. And do you know my part of the country? I\'m from Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Not know it? Why, it\'s no more\'n ten miles from our\nvillage; not _that_ across the ford! Do you cultivate any land there?\n\nJACOB. My brother does, and I send my wages. Though I live here, I am\ndying for a sight of home.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then An\xc3\xadsim is your brother?\n\nJACOB. Own brother. He lives at the farther end of the village.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Of course, I know; his is the third house.\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya, running.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Jacob, what are you doing, amusing yourself here? She is calling\nyou!\n\nJACOB. I\'m coming; but what\'s up?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Frisk is barking; it\'s hungry. And she\'s scolding you. "How cruel\nhe is," she says. "He\'s no feeling," she says. "It\'s long past Frisk\'s\ndinner-time, and he has not brought her food!" [Laughs].\n\nJACOB [rises to go] Oh, she\'s cross? What\'s going to happen now, I\nwonder?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Here, take the cabbage with you.\n\nJACOB. All right, give it here. [Takes basin, and exit].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Who is going to dine now?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, the dog! It\'s her dog. [Sits down and takes up the tea-pot]\nIs there any more tea? I\'ve brought some. [Puts fresh tea into the\ntea-pot.]\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Dinner for a dog?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, of course! They prepare a special cutlet for her; it must\nnot be too fat. And I do the washing--the dog\'s washing, I mean.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s like that gentleman who had a funeral for his dog.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. What\'s that?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, some one told me he had a dog--I mean the gentleman had a\ndog. And it died. It was winter, and he went in his sledge to bury that\ndog. Well, he buried it, and on the way home he sits and cries--the\ngentleman does. Well, there was such a bitter frost that the coachman\'s\nnose keeps running, and he has to keep wiping it. Let me fill your cup!\n[Fills it] So he keeps wiping his nose, and the gentleman sees it, and\nsays, "What are you crying about?" And the coachman, he says, "Why, sir,\nhow can I help it; is there another dog like him?" [Laughs].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And I daresay he thinks to himself, "If your own self\nwas to kick the bucket I\'d not cry." [Laughs].\n\nDISCHARGED COOK [from up on the oven] That is true; that\'s right!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, the gentleman, he gets home and goes straight to his lady:\n"What a good-hearted man our coachman is; he was crying all the way home\nabout poor Dash. Have him called.... Here, drink this glass of v\xc3\xb3dka,"\nhe says, "and here\'s a rouble as a reward for you." That\'s just like her\nsaying Jacob has no feelings for her dog! [The Peasants laugh].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s the style!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That was a go!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Ay, lassie, but you\'ve set us a-laughing!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [pouring out more tea] Have some more! Yes, it only seems that our\nlife is pleasant; but sometimes it is very disgusting,--clearing up all\ntheir messes! Faugh! It\'s better in the country. [Peasants turn their\ncups upside-down, as a polite sign that they have had enough. T\xc3\xa1nya\npours out more tea] Have some more, Ef\xc3\xadm Ant\xc3\xb3nitch. I\'ll fill your cup,\nM\xc3\xadtry Vl\xc3\xa1sitch.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. All right, fill it, fill it.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, dear, and what progression is our business making?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s getting on\xc2\xa0...\n\n  [Illustration: FRUITS OF CULTURE. ACT II.\n\n  FIRST PEASANT. Well, dear, and what progression is our business making?\n\n  T\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s getting on\xc2\xa0...]\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Simon told us\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [quickly] Did he?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But he could not make us understand.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I can\'t tell you now, but I\'m doing my best--all I can! And I\'ve\ngot your paper here! [Shows the paper hidden under the bib of her apron]\nIf only one thing succeeds.... [Shrieks] Oh, how nice it would be!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Don\'t lose that paper, mind. It has cost money.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Never fear. You only want him to sign it? Is that all?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Why, what else? Let\'s say he\'s signed it, and it\'s done!\n[Turns his cup upside-down] I\'ve had enough.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [aside] He\'ll sign it; you\'ll see he will... Have some more.\n[Pours out tea].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If only you get this business about the sale of the land\nsettled, the Commune would pay your marriage expenses. [Refuses the\ntea].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [pouring out tea] Do have another cup.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. You get it done, and we\'ll arrange your marriage, and I\nmyself, let\'s say, will dance at the wedding. Though I\'ve never danced\nin all my born days, I\'ll dance then!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [laughing] All right, I\'ll be in hopes of it. [Silence].\n\nSECOND PEASANT [examines T\xc3\xa1nya] That\'s all very well, but you\'re not fit\nfor peasant work.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Who? I? Why, don\'t you think me strong enough? You should see\nme lacing up my mistress. There\'s many a peasant couldn\'t tug as hard.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Where do you tug her to?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, there\'s a thing made with bone, like--something like a\nstiff jacket, only up to here! Well, and I pull the strings just as when\nyou saddle a horse--when you ... what d\'ye call it? You know, when you\nspit on your hands!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Tighten the girths, you mean.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, yes, that\'s it. And you know I mustn\'t shove against her\nwith my knee. [Laughs].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why do you pull her in?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. For a reason!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why, is she doing penance?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. No, it\'s for beauty\'s sake!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s to say, you pull in her paunch for appearance\'\nsake.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Sometimes I lace her up so that her eyes are ready to start from\nher head, and she says, "Tighter," till my hands tingle. And you say I\'m\nnot strong! [Peasants laugh and shake their heads].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But here, I\'ve been jabbering. [Runs away, laughing].\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Ah, the lassie has made us laugh!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. She\'s a tidy one!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. She\'s not bad.\n\n    Enter Sah\xc3\xa1tof and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch. Sah\xc3\xa1tof holds a teaspoon in his\n    hand.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Not exactly a dinner, but a _d\xc3\xa9jeuner dinatoire_. And\nfirst-rate it was, I tell you. Ham of sucking-pig, delicious! Roulier\nfeeds one splendidly! I\'ve only just returned. [Sees Peasants] Ah, the\npeasants are here again!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, yes, that\'s all very well, but we came here to hide this\narticle. Where shall we hide it?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Excuse me a moment. [To Servants\' Cook] Where are the\ndogs?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. In the coachman\'s quarters. You can\'t keep dogs in the\nservants\' kitchen!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Ah, in the coachman\'s quarters? All right.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I am waiting.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Excuse me, please. Eh, what? Hide it? I\'ll tell you\nwhat. Let\'s put it into one of the peasants\' pockets. That one. I say,\nwhere\'s your pocket? Eh, what?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What for d\'ye want my pocket? You\'re a good \'un! My\npocket! There\'s money in my pocket!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Where\'s your bag, then?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What for?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. What d\'you mean? That\'s the young master!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [laughs. To Sah\xc3\xa1tof] D\'you know why he\'s so\nfrightened? Shall I tell you? He\'s got a heap of money. Eh, what?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, yes, I see. Well, you talk to them a bit, and I\'ll put it\ninto that bag without being observed, so that they should not notice and\ncould not point it out to him. Talk to them.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. All right! [To Peasants] Well then, old fellows, how\nabout the land? Are you buying it? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. We have made an offering, so to say, with our whole\nheart. But there,--the business don\'t come into action nohow.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. You should not be so stingy! Land is an important\nmatter! I told you about planting mint. Or else tobacco would also do.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. Every kind of producks.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. And you help us, master. Ask your father. Or else how are\nwe to live? There\'s so little land. A fowl, let\'s say, there\'s not\nenough room for a fowl to run about.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [having put the spoon into a bag belonging to the Third Peasant]\n_C\'est fait._ Ready. Come along. [Exit].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. So don\'t be stingy! Eh? Well, good-bye. [Exit].\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Didn\'t I say, come to some lodging-house? Well, supposing\nwe\'d had to give three-pence each, then at least we\'d have been in\npeace. As to here, the Lord be merciful! "Give us the money," he says.\nWhat\'s that for?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. He\'s drunk, I daresay.\n\n    Peasants turn their cups upside-down, rise, and cross themselves.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And d\'you mind what a saying he threw out? Sowing mint!\nOne must know how to understand them, that one must!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Sow mint indeed! He\'d better bend his own back at that\nwork, and then it\'s not mint he\'ll hanker after, no fear! Well, many\nthanks!... And now, good woman, would you tell us where we could lie\ndown to sleep?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. One of you can lie on the oven, and the others on these\nbenches.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Christ save you! [Prays, crossing himself].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If only by God\'s help we get our business settled! [Lies\ndown] Then to-morrow, after dinner, we\'d be off by the train, and on\nTuesday we\'d be home again.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Are you going to put out the light?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Put it out? Oh no! They\'ll keep running down here, first\nfor one thing then another.... You lie down, I\'ll lower it.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. How is one to live, having so little land? Why, this\nyear, I have had to buy corn since Christmas. And the oat-straw is all\nused up. I\'d like to get hold of ten acres, and then I could take Simon\nback.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. You\'re a man with a family. You\'d get the land cultivated\nwithout trouble. If only the business comes off.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. We must pray to the Holy Virgin, maybe she\'ll help us\nout. [Silence, broken by sighs. Then footsteps and voices are heard\noutside. The door opens. Enter Grossman hurriedly, with his eyes\nbandaged, holding Sah\xc3\xa1tof\'s hand, and followed by the Professor and the\nDoctor, the Fat Lady and Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, Betsy and Petr\xc3\xadstchef,\nVas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch and M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna and the\nBaroness, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch and T\xc3\xa1nya].\n\n    Peasants jump up. Grossman comes forward stepping quickly, then\n    stops.\n\nFAT LADY. You need not trouble yourselves; I have undertaken the task of\nobserving, and am strictly fulfilling my duty! Mr. Sah\xc3\xa1tof, are you not\nleading him?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Of course not!\n\nFAT LADY. You must not lead him, but neither must you resist! [To Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch] I know these experiments. I have tried them myself.\nSometimes I used to feel a certain effluence, and as soon as I felt\nit\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. May I beg of you to keep perfect silence?\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, I understand so well! I have experienced it myself. As\nsoon as my attention was diverted I could no longer\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Sh\xc2\xa0...!\n\n    Grossman goes about, searches near the First and Second Peasants,\n    then approaches the Third, and stumbles over a bench.\n\nBARONESS. _Mais dites-moi, on le paye?_[6]\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. _Je ne saurais vous dire._\n\n  [6] BARONESS. But tell me, please, is he paid for this?\n\n  ANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I really do not know.\n\nBARONESS. _Mais c\'est un monsieur?_[7]\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. _Oh, oui!_\n\nBARONESS. _\xc3\x87a tient du miraculeux. N\'est ce pas? Comment est-ce qu\'il\ntrouve?_\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. _Je ne saurais vous dire. Mon mari vous l\'expliquera._\n[Noticing Peasants, turns round, and sees the Servants\' Cook] _Pardon_\n... what is this?\n\n  [7] BARONESS. But he is a gentleman?\n\n  ANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Oh yes!\n\n  BARONESS. It is almost miraculous. Isn\'t it? How does he manage to\n  find things?\n\n  ANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I really can\'t tell you. My husband will explain it to\n  you.... Excuse me....\n\n    Baroness goes up to the group.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Servants\' Cook] Who let the peasants in?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Jacob brought them in.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Who gave Jacob the order?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. I can\'t say. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch has seen them.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Leon\xc3\xadd!\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch does not hear, being absorbed in the search, and\n    says, Sh\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch! What is the meaning of this? Did you\nnot see me disinfecting the whole hall, and now the whole kitchen is\ninfected, all the rye bread, the milk\xc2\xa0...\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I thought there would not be any danger if they came\nhere. The men have come on business. They have far to go, and are from\nour village.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. That\'s the worst of it! They are from the Koursk village,\nwhere people are dying of diphtheria like flies! But the chief thing is,\nI ordered them out of the house!... Did I, or did I not? [Approaches the\nothers that have gathered round the Peasants] Be careful! Don\'t touch\nthem--they are all infected with diphtheria! [No one heeds her, and she\nsteps aside in a dignified manner and stands quietly waiting].\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [sniffs loudly] I don\'t know if it is diphtheria, but there\nis some kind of infection in the air. Don\'t you notice it?\n\nBETSY. Stop your nonsense! Vovo, which bag is it in?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. That one, that one. He is getting near, very near!\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Is it spirits divine, or spirits of wine?\n\nBETSY. Now your cigarette comes in handy for once. Smoke closer, closer\nto me.\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef leans over her and smokes at her.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. He\'s getting near, I tell you. Eh, what?\n\nGROSSMAN [searches excitedly round the Third Peasant] It is here; I feel\nit is!\n\nFAT LADY. Do you feel an effluence? [Grossman stoops and finds the spoon\nin the bag].\n\nALL. Bravo! [General enthusiasm].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Ah! So that\'s where our spoon was. [To Peasants] Then\nthat\'s the sort you are!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What sort? I didn\'t take your spoon! What are you making\nout? I didn\'t take it, and my soul knows nothing about it. I didn\'t take\nit--there! Let him do what he likes. I knew he came here for no good.\n"Where\'s your bag?" says he. I didn\'t take it, the Lord is my witness!\n[Crosses himself] I didn\'t take it!\n\n    The young people group round the Peasant, laughing.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [angrily to his son] Always playing the fool! [To the\nThird Peasant] Never mind, friend! We know you did not take it; it was\nonly an experiment.\n\nGROSSMAN [removes bandage from his eyes, and pretends to be coming to]\nCan I have a little water? [All fuss round him].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Let\'s go straight from here into the coachman\'s\nroom. I\'ve got a bitch there--_\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa2tante_![8] Eh, what?\n\n  [8] Stunning!\n\nBETSY. What a horrid word. Couldn\'t you say dog?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. No. I can\'t say--Betsy is a man, _\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa2tant_. I should\nhave to say young woman; it\'s a parallel case. Eh, what? M\xc3\xa1rya\nKonstant\xc3\xadnovna, isn\'t it true? Good, eh? [Laughs loudly].\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. Well, let us go. [Exeunt M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna,\nBetsy, Petr\xc3\xadstchef, and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch].\n\nFAT LADY [to Grossman] Well? how are you? Have you rested? [Grossman\ndoes not answer. To Sah\xc3\xa1tof] And you, Mr. Sah\xc3\xa1tof, did you feel the\neffluence?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I felt nothing. Yes, it was very fine--very fine. Quite a\nsuccess!\n\nBARONESS. _Admirable! \xc3\x87a ne le fait pas souffrir?_[9]\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. _Pas le moins du monde._\n\n  [9] BARONESS. Capital! Does it not cause him any pain?\n\n  LEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Not the slightest.\n\nPROFESSOR [to Grossman] May I trouble you? [Hands him a thermometer] At\nthe beginning of the experiment it was 37 decimal 2, degrees.[10] [To\nDoctor] That\'s right, I think? Would you mind feeling his pulse? Some\nloss is inevitable.\n\n  [10] He uses a Centigrade thermometer.\n\nDOCTOR [to Grossman] Now then, sir, let\'s have your hand; we\'ll see,\nwe\'ll see. [Takes out his watch, and feels Grossman\'s pulse].\n\nFAT LADY [to Grossman] One moment! The condition you were in could not\nbe called sleep?\n\nGROSSMAN [wearily] It was hypnosis.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. In that case, are we to understand that you hypnotised\nyourself?\n\nGROSSMAN. And why not? An hypnotic state may ensue not only in\nconsequence of association--the sound of the tom-tom, for instance, in\nCharcot\'s method--but by merely entering an hypnogenetic zone.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Granting that, it would still be desirable to define what\nhypnotism is, more exactly?\n\nPROFESSOR. Hypnotism is a phenomenon resulting from the transmutation of\none energy into another.\n\nGROSSMAN. Charcot does not so define it.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. A moment, just a moment! That is your definition, but Li\xc3\xa9bault\ntold me himself\xc2\xa0...\n\nDOCTOR [lets go of Grossman\'s pulse] Ah, that\'s all right; well now, the\ntemperature?\n\nFAT LADY [interrupting] No, allow me! I agree with the Professor. And\nhere\'s the very best proof. After my illness, when I lay insensible, a\ndesire to speak came over me. In general I am of a silent disposition,\nbut then I was overcome by this desire to speak, and I spoke and spoke,\nand I was told that I spoke in such a way that every one was astonished!\n[To Sah\xc3\xa1tof] But I think I interrupted you?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [with dignity] Not at all. Pray continue.\n\nDOCTOR. Pulse 82, and the temperature has risen three-tenths of a\ndegree.\n\nPROFESSOR. There you are! That\'s a proof! That\'s just as it should be.\n[Takes out pocket-book and writes] 82, yes? And 37 and 5. When the\nhypnotic state is induced, it invariably produces a heightened action of\nthe heart.\n\nDOCTOR. I can, as a medical man, bear witness that your prognosis was\njustified by the event.\n\nPROFESSOR [to Sah\xc3\xa1tof] You were saying?...\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I wished to say that Li\xc3\xa9bault told me himself that the hypnotic\nis only one particular psychical state, increasing susceptibility to\nsuggestion.\n\nPROFESSOR. That is so, but still the law of equivalents is the chief\nthing.\n\nGROSSMAN. Moreover, Li\xc3\xa9bault is far from being an authority, while\nCharcot has studied the subject from all sides, and has proved that\nhypnotism produced by a blow, a trauma\xc2\xa0...\n\n    All talking together.\n\n  { SAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, but I don\'t reject Charcot\'s labour. I know him also,\n  { I am only repeating what Li\xc3\xa9bault told me\xc2\xa0...\n  {\n  { GROSSMAN [excitedly] There are 3000 patients in the Salp\xc3\xaatri\xc3\xa8re, and\n  { I have gone through the whole course.\n  {\n  { PROFESSOR. Excuse me, gentlemen, but that is not the point.\n\nFAT LADY [interrupting] One moment, I will explain it to you in two\nwords? When my husband was ill, all the doctors gave him up\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. However, we had better go upstairs again. Baroness,\nthis way!\n\n    Exeunt Grossman, Sah\xc3\xa1tof, Professor, Doctor, the Fat Lady, and\n    Baroness, talking loudly and interrupting each other.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [catching hold of Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch\'s arm] How often have\nI asked you not to interfere in household matters! You think of nothing\nbut your nonsense, and the whole house is on my shoulders. You will\ninfect us all!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. What? How? I don\'t understand what you mean.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. How? Why, people ill of diphtheria sleep in the kitchen,\nwhich is in constant communication with the whole house.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, but I\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What, I?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I know nothing about it.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. It\'s your duty to know, if you are the head of the\nfamily. Such things must not be done.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But I never thought ... I thought\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. It is sickening to listen to you! [Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch\nremains silent].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] Turn them out at once! They are to\nleave my kitchen immediately! It is terrible! No one listens to me; they\ndo it out of spite.... I turn them out from there, and they bring them\nin here! And with my illness\xc2\xa0... [Gets more and more excited, and at\nlast begins to cry] Doctor! Doctor! Peter Petr\xc3\xb3vitch!... He\'s gone\ntoo!... [Exit, sobbing, followed by Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch].\n\n    All stand silent for a long time.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Botheration take them all! If one don\'t mind, the police\nwill be after one here. And I have never been to law in all my born\ndays. Let\'s go to some lodging-house, lads!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to T\xc3\xa1nya] What are we to do?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Never mind, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, let them sleep with the coachman.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. How can we do that? The coachman was complaining as\nit is, that his place is full of dogs.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well then, the porter\'s lodge.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. And supposing it\'s found out?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It won\'t be found out! Don\'t trouble about that, Theodore\nIv\xc3\xa1nitch. How can one turn them out now, at night? They\'ll not find\nanywhere to go to.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, do as you please. Only they must go away from\nhere. [Exit].\n\n    Peasants take their bags.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Oh those damned fiends! It\'s all their fat! Fiends!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. You be quiet there. Thank goodness they didn\'t see you!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well then, daddy, come along to the porter\'s lodge.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, but how about our business? How, for example, about\nthe applience of his hand to the signature? May we be in hopes?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. We\'ll see in an hour\'s time.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You\'ll do the trick?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [laughs] Yes, God willing!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n    Evening of the same day. The small drawing-room in Leon\xc3\xadd\n    Fy\xc3\xb3doritch\'s house, where the s\xc3\xa9ances are always held. Leon\xc3\xadd\n    Fy\xc3\xb3doritch and the Professor.\n\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well then, shall we risk a s\xc3\xa9ance with our new\nmedium?\n\nPROFESSOR. Yes, certainly. He is a powerful medium, there is no doubt\nabout it. And it is especially desirable that the s\xc3\xa9ance should take\nplace to-day with the same people. Grossman will certainly respond to\nthe influence of the mediumistic energy, and then the connection and\nidentity of the different phenomena will be still more evident. You will\nsee then that, if the medium is as strong as he was just now, Grossman\nwill vibrate.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Then I will send for Simon and ask those who wish to\nattend to come in.\n\nPROFESSOR. Yes, all right! I will just jot down a few notes. [Takes out\nhis note-book and writes].\n\n    Enter Sah\xc3\xa1tof.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. They have just settled down to whist in Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\'s\ndrawing-room, and as I am not wanted there--and as I am interested in\nyour s\xc3\xa9ance--I have put in an appearance here. But will there be a\ns\xc3\xa9ance?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, certainly!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. In spite of the absence of Mr. Kaptch\xc3\xadtch\'s mediumistic powers?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. _Vous avez la main heureuse._[11] Fancy, that very\npeasant whom I mentioned to you this morning, turns out to be an\nundoubted medium.\n\n  [11] LEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. You bring good luck.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Dear me! Yes, that is peculiarly interesting!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, we tried a few preliminary experiments with him\njust after dinner.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. So you\'ve had time already to experiment, and to convince\nyourself\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, perfectly! And he turns out to be an\nexceptionally powerful medium.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [incredulously] Dear me!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. It turns out that it has long been noticed in the\nservants\' hall. When he sits down to table, the spoon springs into his\nhand of its own accord! [To the Professor] Had you heard about it?\n\nPROFESSOR. No, I had not heard that detail.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [to the Professor]. But still, you admit the possibility of such\nphenomena?\n\nPROFESSOR. What phenomena?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Well, spiritualistic, mediumistic, and supernatural phenomena\nin general.\n\nPROFESSOR. The question is, what do we consider supernatural? When, not\na living man but a piece of stone attracted a nail to itself, how did\nthe phenomena strike the first observers? As something natural? Or\nsupernatural?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Well, of course; but phenomena such as the magnet attracting\niron always repeat themselves.\n\nPROFESSOR. It is just the same in this case. The phenomenon repeats\nitself and we experiment with it. And not only that, but we apply to the\nphenomena we are investigating the laws common to other phenomena. These\nphenomena seem supernatural only because their causes are attributed to\nthe medium himself. But that is where the mistake lies. The phenomena\nare not caused by the medium, but by psychic energy acting through a\nmedium, and that is a very different thing. The whole matter lies in the\nlaw of equivalents.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, certainly, but\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya, who hides behind the hangings.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Only remember that we cannot reckon on any results\nwith certainty, with this medium any more than with Home or Kaptch\xc3\xadtch.\nWe may not succeed, but on the other hand we may even have perfect\nmaterialisation.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Materialisation even? What do you mean by materialisation?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Why, I mean that some one who is dead--say, your\nfather or your grandfather--may appear, take you by the hand, or give\nyou something; or else some one may suddenly rise into the air, as\nhappened to Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch last time.\n\nPROFESSOR. Of course, of course. But the chief thing is the explanation\nof the phenomena, and the application to them of general laws.\n\n    Enter the Fat Lady.\n\nFAT LADY. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna has allowed me to join you.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Very pleased.\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, how tired Grossman seems! He could scarcely hold his cup.\nDid you notice [to the Professor] how pale he turned at the moment he\napproached the hiding-place? I noticed it at once, and was the first to\nmention it to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nPROFESSOR. Undoubtedly,--loss of vital energy.\n\nFAT LADY. Yes, it\'s just as I say, one should not abuse that sort of\nthing. You know, a hypnotist once suggested to a friend of mine, V\xc3\xa9ra\nK\xc3\xb3nshin (oh, you know her, of course)--well, he suggested that she\nshould leave off smoking,--and her back began to ache!\n\nPROFESSOR [trying to have his say] The temperature and the pulse clearly\nindicate\xc2\xa0...\n\nFAT LADY. One moment! Allow me! Well, I said to her: it\'s better to\nsmoke than to suffer so with one\'s nerves. Of course, smoking is\ninjurious; I should like to give it up myself, but, do what I will, I\ncan\'t! Once I managed not to smoke for a fortnight, but could hold out\nno longer.\n\nPROFESSOR [again trying to speak] Clearly proves\xc2\xa0...\n\nFAT LADY. Yes, no! Allow me, just one word! You say, "loss of strength."\nAnd I was also going to say that, when I travelled with post-horses ...\nthe roads used to be dreadful in those days--you don\'t remember--but I\nhave noticed that all our nervousness comes from railways! I, for\ninstance, can\'t sleep while travelling; I cannot fall asleep to save my\nlife!\n\nPROFESSOR [makes another attempt, which the Fat Lady baffles] The loss\nof strength\xc2\xa0...\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [smiling] Yes; oh yes!\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch rings.\n\nFAT LADY. I am awake one night, and another, and a third, and still I\ncan\'t sleep!\n\n    Enter Gregory.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Please tell Theodore to get everything ready for the\ns\xc3\xa9ance, and send Simon here--Simon, the butler\'s assistant,--do you\nhear?\n\nGREGORY. Yes, sir. [Exit].\n\nPROFESSOR [to Sah\xc3\xa1tof]. The observation of the temperature and the pulse\nhave shown loss of vital energy. The same will happen in consequence of\nthe mediumistic phenomena. The law of the conservation of energy\xc2\xa0...\n\nFAT LADY. Oh yes, yes; I was just going to say that I am very glad that\na simple peasant turns out to be a medium. That\'s very good. I always\ndid say that the Slavophils\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Let\'s go into the drawing-room in the meantime.\n\nFAT LADY. Allow me, just one word! The Slavophils are right; but I\nalways told my husband that one ought never to exaggerate anything! "The\ngolden mean," you know. What is the use of maintaining that the common\npeople are all perfect, when I have myself seen\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Won\'t you come into the drawing-room?\n\nFAT LADY. A boy--that high--who drank! I gave him a scolding at once.\nAnd he was grateful to me afterwards. They are children, and, as I\nalways say, children need both love and severity!\n\n    Exeunt all, all talking together.\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya enters from behind the hangings.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh, if it would only succeed! [Begins fastening some threads].\n\n    Enter Betsy hurriedly.\n\nBETSY. Isn\'t papa here? [Looks inquiringly at T\xc3\xa1nya] What are you doing\nhere?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh, Miss Elizabeth, I have only just come; I only wished ... only\ncame in\xc2\xa0... [Embarrassed].\n\nBETSY. But they are going to have a s\xc3\xa9ance here directly. [Notices T\xc3\xa1nya\ndrawing in the threads, looks at her, and suddenly bursts out laughing]\nT\xc3\xa1nya! Why, it\'s you who do it all? Now don\'t deny it. And last time it\nwas you too? Yes, it was, it was!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Miss Elizabeth, dearest!\n\nBETSY [delighted] Oh, that is a joke! Well, I never. But why do you do\nit?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh miss, dear miss, don\'t betray me!\n\nBETSY. Not for the world! I\'m awfully glad. Only tell me how you manage\nit?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, I just hide, and then, when it\'s all dark, I come out and\ndo it. That\'s how.\n\nBETSY [pointing to threads] And what is this for? You needn\'t tell me. I\nsee; you draw\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Miss Elizabeth, darling! I will confess it, but only to you. I\nused to do it just for fun, but now I mean business.\n\nBETSY. What? How? What business?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, you see, those peasants that came this morning, you saw\nthem. They want to buy some land, and your father won\'t sell it; well,\nand Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, he says it\'s the spirits as forbid him. So I have\nhad a thought as\xc2\xa0...\n\nBETSY. Oh, I see! Well, you are a clever girl! Do it, do it.... But how\nwill you manage it?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, I thought, when they put out the lights, I\'ll at once begin\nknocking and shying things about, touching their heads with the threads,\nand at last I\'ll take the paper about the land and throw it on the\ntable. I\'ve got it here.\n\nBETSY. Well, and then?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, don\'t you see? They will be astonished. The peasants had the\npaper, and now it\'s here. I will teach\xc2\xa0...\n\nBETSY. Why, of course! Simon is the medium to-day!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, I\'ll teach him\xc2\xa0... [Laughs so that she can\'t continue] I\'ll\ntell him to squeeze with his hands any one he can get hold of! Of\ncourse, not your father--he\'d never dare do that--but any one else;\nhe\'ll squeeze till it\'s signed.\n\nBETSY [laughing] But that\'s not the way it is done. Mediums never do\nanything themselves.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh, never mind. It\'s all one; I daresay it\'ll turn out all right.\n\n    Enter Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\n    Exit Betsy, making signs to T\xc3\xa1nya.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Why are you here?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s you I want, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, dear\xc2\xa0...\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, what is it?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. About that affair of mine as I spoke of.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [laughs] I\'ve made the match; yes, I\'ve made the\nmatch. The matter is settled; we have shaken hands on it, only not had a\ndrink on it.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [with a shriek] Never! So it\'s all right?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Don\'t I tell you so? He says, "I shall consult the\nmissus, and then, God willing\xc2\xa0..."\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Is that what he said? [Shrieks] Dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, I\'ll pray\nfor you all the days of my life!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. All right! All right! Now is not the time. I\'ve been\nordered to arrange the room for the s\xc3\xa9ance.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Let me help you. How\'s it to be arranged?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. How? Why, the table in the middle of the\nroom--chairs--the guitar--the accordion. The lamp is not wanted, only\ncandles.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [helps Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch to place the things] Is that right? The\nguitar here, and here the inkstand. [Places it] So?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Can it be true that they\'ll make Simon sit here?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I suppose so; they\'ve done it once.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Wonderful! [Puts on his pince-nez] But is he clean?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. How should I know?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Then, I\'ll tell you what\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Go and take a nail-brush and some Pears\' soap; you\nmay take mine ... and go and cut his claws and scrub his hands as clean\nas possible.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. He can do it himself.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well then, tell him to. And tell him to put on a\nclean shirt as well.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. All right, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch. [Exit].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [sits down in an easy-chair] They\'re educated and\nlearned--Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch now, he\'s a professor--and yet sometimes\none can\'t help doubting very much. The people\'s rude superstitions are\nbeing abolished: hobgoblins, sorcerers, witches.... But if one considers\nit, is not this equally superstitious? How is it possible that the\nsouls of the dead should come and talk, and play the guitar? No! Some\none is fooling them, or they are fooling themselves. And as to this\nbusiness with Simon--it\'s simply incomprehensible. [Looks at an album]\nHere\'s their spiritualistic album. How is it possible to photograph a\nspirit? But here is the likeness of a Turk and Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch sitting\nby.... Extraordinary human weakness!\n\n    Enter Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Is it all ready?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [rising leisurely] Quite ready. [Smiles] Only I don\'t\nknow about your new medium. I hope he won\'t disgrace you, Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. No, I and Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch have tested him. He is\na wonderfully powerful medium!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, I don\'t know. But is he clean enough? I don\'t\nsuppose you have thought of ordering him to wash his hands? It might be\nrather inconvenient.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. His hands? Oh yes! They\'re not clean, you think?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What can you expect? He\'s a peasant, and there will\nbe ladies present, and M\xc3\xa1rya Vas\xc3\xadlevna.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. It will be all right.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. And then I have something to report to you. Timothy,\nthe coachman, complains that he can\'t keep things clean because of the\ndogs.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [arranging the things on the table absent-mindedly]\nWhat dogs?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. The three hounds that came for Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\nto-day.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [vexed] Tell Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna! She can do as she likes\nabout it. I have no time.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But you know her weakness\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. \'Tis just as she likes, let her do as she pleases.\nAs for him,--one never gets anything but unpleasantness from him.\nBesides, I am busy.\n\n    Enter Simon, smiling; he has a sleeveless peasant\'s coat on.\n\nSIMON. I was ordered to come.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, it\'s all right. Let me see your hands. That will\ndo, that will do very well! Well then, my good fellow, you must do just\nas you did before,--sit down, and give way to your mood. But don\'t think\nat all.\n\nSIMON. Why should I think? The more one thinks, the worse it is.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Just so, just so, exactly! The less conscious one is,\nthe greater is the power. Don\'t think, but give in to your mood. If you\nwish to sleep, sleep; if you wish to walk, walk. Do you understand?\n\nSIMON. How could one help understanding? It\'s simple enough.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But above all, don\'t be frightened. Because you might\nbe surprised yourself. You must understand that just as we live here, so\na whole world of invisible spirits live here also.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [improving on what Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch has said]\nInvisible feelings, do you understand?\n\nSIMON [laughs] How can one help understanding! It\'s very plain as you\nput it.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. You may rise up in the air, or something of the kind,\nbut don\'t be frightened.\n\nSIMON. Why should I be frightened? That won\'t matter at all.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well then, I\'ll go and call them all.... Is\neverything ready?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I think so.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But the slates?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. They are downstairs. I\'ll bring them. [Exit].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. All right then. So don\'t be afraid, but be at your\nease.\n\nSIMON. Had I not better take off my coat? One would be more easy like.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Your coat? Oh no. Don\'t take that off. [Exit].\n\nSIMON. She tells me to do the same again, and she will again shy things\nabout. How isn\'t she afraid?\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya in her stockings and in a dress of the colour of the\n    wall-paper. Simon laughs.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Shsh!... They\'ll hear! There, stick these matches on your fingers\nas before. [Sticks them on] Well, do you remember everything?\n\nSIMON [bending his fingers in, one by one] First of all, wet the matches\nand wave my hands about, that\'s one. Then make my teeth chatter, like\nthis ... that\'s two. But I\'ve forgotten the third thing.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. And it\'s the third as is the chief thing. Don\'t forget as soon as\nthe paper falls on the table--I shall ring the little bell--then you do\nlike this.... Spread your arms out far and catch hold of some one,\nwhoever it is as sits nearest, and catch hold of him. And then squeeze!\n[Laughs] Whether it\'s a gentleman or a lady, it\'s all one; you just\nsqueeze \'em, and don\'t let \'em go,--as if it were in your sleep, and\nchatter with your teeth, or else howl like this. [Howls sotto-voce] And\nwhen I begin to play on the guitar, then stretch yourself as if you were\nwaking up, you know.... Will you remember everything?\n\nSIMON. Yes, I\'ll remember, but it is too funny.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But mind you don\'t laugh. Still, it won\'t matter much if you do\nlaugh; they\'d think it was in your sleep. Only take care you don\'t\nreally fall asleep when they put out the lights.\n\nSIMON. No fear, I\'ll pinch my ears.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well then Sim darling, only mind do as I tell you, and don\'t get\nfrightened. He\'ll sign the paper, see if he don\'t! They\'re coming!\n\n    Gets under the sofa.\n\n    Enter Grossman and the Professor, Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch and the Fat\n    Lady, the Doctor, Sah\xc3\xa1tof and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna. Simon stands near the\n    door.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Please come in, all you doubters! Though we have a\nnew and accidentally discovered medium, I expect very important\nphenomena to-night.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. That\'s very, very interesting.\n\nFAT LADY [pointing to Simon] _Mais il est tr\xc3\xa8s bien!_[12]\n\n  [12] FAT LADY. But he looks quite nice.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, as a butler\'s assistant, but hardly\xc2\xa0...\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Wives never have any faith in their husbands\' work. You don\'t\nbelieve in anything of this kind?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Of course not. Kaptch\xc3\xadtch, it is true, has something\nexceptional about him, but Heaven knows what all this is about!\n\nFAT LADY. No, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, permit me, you can\'t decide it in such a\nway. Before I was married, I once had a remarkable dream. Dreams, you\nknow, are often such that you don\'t know where they begin and where they\nend; it was just such a dream that I\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Enter Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch and Petr\xc3\xadstchef.\n\nFAT LADY. And much was revealed to me by that dream. Nowadays the young\npeople [points to Petr\xc3\xadstchef and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch] deny everything.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. But look here, you know--now I, for instance, never\ndeny anything! Eh, what?\n\n    Betsy and M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna enter, and begin talking to\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef.\n\nFAT LADY. And how can one deny the supernatural? They say it is\nunreasonable. But what if one\'s reason is stupid; what then? There now,\non Garden Street, you know ... why, well, it appeared every evening! My\nhusband\'s brother--what do you call him? Not _beau-fr\xc3\xa8re_--what\'s the\nother name for it?--I never can remember the names of these different\nrelationships--well, he went there three nights running, and still he\nsaw nothing; so I said to him\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, who is going to stay here?\n\nFAT LADY. I! I!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Doctor] Do you mean to say you are going to stay?\n\nDOCTOR. Yes; I must see, if only once, what it is that Alex\xc3\xa9y\nVlad\xc3\xadmiritch has discovered in it. How can we deny anything without\nproofs?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Then I am to take it to-night for certain?\n\nDOCTOR. Take what?... Oh, the powder. Yes, it would perhaps be better.\nYes, yes, take it.... However, I shall come upstairs again.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes please, do. [Loud] When it is over, _mesdames et\nmessieurs_, I shall expect you to come to me upstairs to rest from your\nemotions, and then we will finish our rubber.\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, certainly.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, thanks!\n\n    Exit Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nBETSY [to Petr\xc3\xadstchef] You must stay, I tell you. I promise you\nsomething extraordinary. Will you bet?\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. But you don\'t believe in it?\n\nBETSY. To-day I do.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA [to Petr\xc3\xadstchef] And do you believe?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. "I can\'t believe, I cannot trust a heart for falsehood\nframed." Still, if Elizabeth Leon\xc3\xaddovna commands\xc2\xa0...\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Let us stay, M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna. Eh, what? I shall\ninvent something _\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa2tant_.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. No, you mustn\'t make me laugh. You know I can\'t\nrestrain myself.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [loud] I remain!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [severely] But I beg those who remain not to joke\nabout it. It is a serious matter.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Do you hear? Well then, let\'s stay. Vovo, sit here, and\ndon\'t be too shy.\n\nBETSY. Yes, it\'s all very well for you to laugh; but just wait till you\nsee what will happen.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Oh, but supposing it\'s true? Won\'t it be a go! Eh,\nwhat?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [trembles] Oh, I\'m afraid, I\'m afraid! M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna,\nI\'m afraid! My tootsies tremble.\n\nBETSY [laughing] Not so loud.\n\n    All sit down.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Take your seats, take your seats. Simon, sit down!\n\nSIMON. Yes, sir. [Sits down on the edge of the chair].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Sit properly.\n\nPROFESSOR. Sit straight in the middle of the chair, and quite at your\nease. [Arranges Simon on his chair].\n\n    Betsy, M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch laugh.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [raising his voice] I beg those who are going to\nremain here not to behave frivolously, but to regard this matter\nseriously, or bad results might follow. Do you hear, Vovo! If you can\'t\nbe quiet, go away!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Quite quiet! [Hides behind Fat Lady].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch, will you mesmerise him?\n\nPROFESSOR. No; why should I do it when Ant\xc3\xb3n Bor\xc3\xadsitch is here? He has\nhad far more practice and has more power in that department than I....\nAnt\xc3\xb3n Bor\xc3\xadsitch!\n\nGROSSMAN. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not, strictly speaking, a\nspiritualist. I have only studied hypnotism. It is true I have studied\nhypnotism in all its known manifestations; but what is called\nspiritualism, is entirely unknown to me. When a subject is thrown into a\ntrance, I may expect the hypnotic phenomena known to me: lethargy,\nabulia, an\xc3\xa6sthesia, analgesia, catalepsy, and every kind of\nsusceptibility to suggestion. Here it is not these but other phenomena\nwe expect to observe. Therefore it would be well to know of what kind\nare the phenomena we expect to witness, and what is their scientific\nsignificance.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I thoroughly agree with Mr. Grossman. Such an explanation would\nbe very interesting.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I think Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch will not refuse to give\nus a short explanation.\n\nPROFESSOR. Why not? I can give an explanation if it is desired. [To the\nDoctor] Will you kindly note his temperature and pulse? My explanation\nmust, of necessity, be cursory and brief.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, please; briefly, quite briefly.\n\nDOCTOR. All right. [Takes out thermometer] Now then, my lad\xc2\xa0... [Places\nthe thermometer].\n\nSIMON. Yes, sir!\n\nPROFESSOR [rising and addressing the Fat Lady--then reseating himself]\nLadies and gentlemen! The phenomenon we are investigating to-night is\nregarded, on the one hand, as something new; and, on the other, as\nsomething transcending the limits of natural conditions. Neither view is\ncorrect. This phenomenon is not new but is as old as the world; and it\nis not supernatural but is subject to the eternal laws that govern all\nthat exists. This phenomenon has been usually defined as "intercourse\nwith the spirit world." That definition is inexact. Under such a\ndefinition the spirit world is contrasted with the material world. But\nthis is erroneous; there is no such contrast! Both worlds are so closely\nconnected that it is impossible to draw a line of demarcation,\nseparating the one from the other. We say, matter is composed of\nmolecules\xc2\xa0...\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Prosy matter! [Whispering and laughter].\n\nPROFESSOR [pauses, then continues] Molecules are composed of atoms, but\nthe atoms, having no extension, are in reality nothing but the points\nof application of forces. Strictly speaking, not of forces but of\nenergy, that same energy which is as much a unity and just as\nindestructible as matter. But matter, though one, has many different\naspects, and the same is true of energy. Till recently only four forms\nof energy, convertible into one another, have been known to us: energies\nknown as the dynamic, the thermal, the electric, and the chemic. But\nthese four aspects of energy are far from exhausting all the varieties\nof its manifestation. The forms in which energy may manifest itself are\nvery diverse, and it is one of these new and as yet but little known\nphases of energy, that we are investigating to-night. I refer to\nmediumistic energy.\n\n    Renewed whispering and laughter among the young people.\n\nPROFESSOR [stops and casts a severe look round] Mediumistic energy has\nbeen known to mankind for ages: prophecy, presentiments, visions and so\non, are nothing but manifestations of mediumistic energy. The\nmanifestations produced by it have, I say, been known to mankind for\nages. But the energy itself has not been recognised as such till quite\nrecently--not till that medium, the vibrations of which cause the\nmanifestations of mediumistic energy, was recognised. In the same way\nthat the phenomena of light were inexplicable until the existence of an\nimponderable substance--an ether--was recognised, so mediumistic\nphenomena seemed mysterious until the now fully established fact was\nrecognised, that between the particles of ether there exists another\nstill more rarified imponderable substance not subject to the law of the\nthree dimensions\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Renewed laughter, whispers, and giggling.\n\nPROFESSOR [again looks round severely] And just as mathematical\ncalculations have irrefutably proved the existence of imponderable ether\nwhich gives rise to the phenomena of light and electricity, so the\nsuccessive investigations of the ingenious Hermann, of Schmidt, and of\nJoseph Schmatzhofen, have confirmed beyond a doubt the existence of a\nsubstance which fills the universe and may be called spiritual ether.\n\nFAT LADY. Ah, now I understand. I am so grateful\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, but Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch, could you not ...\ncondense it a little?\n\nPROFESSOR [not heeding the remark] And so, as I have just had the honour\nof mentioning to you, a succession of strictly scientific experiments\nhave made plain to us the laws of mediumistic phenomena. These\nexperiments have proved that, when certain individuals are plunged into\na hypnotic state (a state differing from ordinary sleep only by the fact\nthat man\'s physiological activity is not lowered by the hypnotic\ninfluence but, on the contrary, is always heightened--as we have\nrecently witnessed) when, I say, any individual is plunged into such a\nstate, this always produces certain perturbations in the spiritual\nether--perturbations quite similar to those produced by plunging a solid\nbody into liquid matter. These perturbations are what we call\nmediumistic phenomena\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Laughter, and whispers.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. That is quite comprehensible and correct; but if, as you are\nkind enough to inform us, the plunging of the medium into a trance\nproduces perturbations of the spiritual ether, allow me to ask why (as\nis usually supposed to be the case in spiritualistic s\xc3\xa9ances) these\nperturbations result in an activity on the part of the souls of dead\npeople?\n\nPROFESSOR. It is because the molecules of this spiritual ether are\nnothing but the souls of the living, the dead, and the unborn, and any\nvibration of the spiritual ether must inevitably cause a certain\nvibration of its atoms. These atoms are nothing but human souls, which\nenter into communication with one another by means of these movements.\n\nFAT LADY [to Sah\xc3\xa1tof] What is it that puzzles you? It is so simple....\nThank you so, so much!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I think everything has now been explained, and that\nwe may commence.\n\nDOCTOR. The fellow is in a perfectly normal condition: temperature 37\ndecimal 2, pulse 74.\n\nPROFESSOR [takes out his pocket-book and notes this down] What I have\njust had the honour of explaining will be confirmed by the fact, which\nwe shall presently have an opportunity of observing, that after the\nmedium has been thrown into a trance his temperature and pulse will\ninevitably rise, just as occurs in cases of hypnotism.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, yes. But excuse me a moment. I should like to\nreply to Serg\xc3\xa9y Iv\xc3\xa1nitch\'s question: How do we know we are in\ncommunication with the souls of the dead? We know it because the spirit\nthat appears, plainly tells us--as simply as I am speaking to you--who\nhe is, and why he has come, and whether all is well with him! At our\nlast s\xc3\xa9ance a Spaniard, Don Castillos, came to us, and he told us\neverything. He told us who he was, and when he died, and that he was\nsuffering for having taken part in the Inquisition. He even told us what\nwas happening to him at the very time that he was speaking to us,\nnamely, that at the very time he was talking to us he had to be born\nagain on earth, and, therefore, could not continue his conversation with\nus.... But you\'ll see for yourselves\xc2\xa0...\n\nFAT LADY [interrupting] Oh, how interesting! Perhaps the Spaniard was\nborn in one of our houses and is a baby now!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Quite possibly.\n\nPROFESSOR. I think it is time we began.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I was only going to say\xc2\xa0...\n\nPROFESSOR. It is getting late.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Very well. Then we will commence. Ant\xc3\xb3n Bor\xc3\xadsitch, be\nso good as to hypnotise the medium.\n\nGROSSMAN. What method would you like me to use? There are several\nmethods. There is Braid\'s system, there is the Egyptian symbol, and\nthere is Charcot\'s system.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [to the Professor] I think it is quite immaterial.\n\nPROFESSOR. Quite.\n\nGROSSMAN. Then I will make use of my own method, which I showed in\nOdessa.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. If you please!\n\n    Grossman waves his arms above Simon. Simon closes his eyes and\n    stretches himself.\n\nGROSSMAN [looking closely at him] He is falling asleep! He is asleep! A\nremarkably rapid occurrence of hypnosis. The subject has evidently\nalready reached a state of an\xc3\xa6sthesia. He is remarkable,--an unusually\nimpressionable subject, and might be subjected to interesting\nexperiments!... [Sits down, rises, sits down again] Now one might run a\nneedle into his arm. If you like\xc2\xa0...\n\nPROFESSOR [to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] Do you notice how the medium\'s trance\nacts on Grossman? He is beginning to vibrate.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, yes ... can the lights be extinguished now?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. But why is darkness necessary?\n\nPROFESSOR. Darkness? Because it is a condition of the manifestation of\nmediumistic energy, just as a given temperature is a condition necessary\nfor certain manifestations of chemical or dynamic energy.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But not always. Manifestations have been observed by\nme, and by many others, both by candlelight and daylight.\n\nPROFESSOR [interrupting] May the lights be put out?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, certainly. [Puts out candles] Ladies and\ngentlemen! attention, if you please.\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya gets from under the sofa and takes hold of a thread tied to a\n    chandelier.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. I like that Spaniard! Just in the midst of a\nconversation--off he goes head downwards ... as the French say: _piquer\nune t\xc3\xaate_.[13]\n\n  [13] To take a header.\n\nBETSY. You just wait a bit, and see what will happen!\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. I have only one fear, and that is that Vovo may be moved by\nthe spirit to grunt like a pig!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Would you like me to? I will\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Gentlemen! Silence, if you please!\n\n    Silence. Simon licks the matches on his fingers and rubs his\n    knuckles with them.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. A light! Do you see the light?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. A light? Yes, yes, I see; but allow me\xc2\xa0...\n\nFAT LADY. Where? Where? Oh dear, I did not see it! Ah, there it is.\nOh!...\n\nPROFESSOR [whispers to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, and points to Grossman, who is\nmoving] Do you notice how he vibrates? It is the dual influence. [The\nlight appears again].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [to the Professor] It must be he--you know!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Who?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. A Greek, Nicholas. It is his light. Don\'t you think\nso, Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Who is this Greek, Nicholas?\n\nPROFESSOR. A certain Greek, who was a monk at Constantinople under\nConstantine and who has been visiting us lately.\n\nFAT LADY. Where is he? Where is he? I don\'t see him.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. He is not yet visible ... Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch, he is\nparticularly well disposed towards you. You question him.\n\nPROFESSOR [in a peculiar voice] Nicholas! Is that you?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya raps twice on the wall.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [joyfully] It is he! It is he!\n\nFAT LADY. Oh dear! Oh! I shall go away!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Why do you suppose it is he?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Why, the two knocks. It is an affirmative answer;\nelse all would have been silence.\n\n    Silence. Suppressed giggling in the young people\'s corner. T\xc3\xa1nya\n    throws a lampshade, pencil and penwiper upon the table.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [whispers] Do you notice, gentlemen, here is a\nlamp-shade, and something else--a pencil!... Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch, it is\na pencil!\n\nPROFESSOR. All right, all right! I am watching both him and Grossman!\n\n    Grossman rises and feels the things that have fallen on the table.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Excuse me, excuse me! I should like to see whether it is not\nthe medium who is doing it all himself?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Do you think so? Well, sit by him and hold his hands.\nBut you may be sure he is asleep.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [approaches. T\xc3\xa1nya lets a thread touch his head. He is\nfrightened, and stoops]. Ye ... ye ... yes! Strange, very strange!\n[Takes hold of Simon\'s elbow. Simon howls].\n\nPROFESSOR [to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] Do you notice the effect of Grossman\'s\npresence? It is a new phenomenon--I must note it\xc2\xa0... [Runs out to note\nit down, and returns again].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes.... But we cannot leave Nicholas without an\nanswer. We must begin\xc2\xa0...\n\nGROSSMAN [rises, approaches Simon and raises and lowers his arm] It\nwould be interesting to produce contraction! The subject is in profound\nhypnosis.\n\nPROFESSOR [to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] Do you see? Do you see?\n\nGROSSMAN. If you like\xc2\xa0...\n\nDOCTOR. Now then, my dear sir, leave the management to Alex\xc3\xa9y\nVlad\xc3\xadmiritch, the affair is turning out serious.\n\nPROFESSOR. Leave him alone, he [referring to Grossman] is talking in his\nsleep!\n\nFAT LADY. How glad I now am that I resolved to be present! It is\nfrightening, but all the same I am glad, for I always said to my\nhusband\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Silence, if you please.\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya draws a thread over the Fat Lady\'s head.\n\nFAT LADY. Aie!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. What? What is it?\n\nFAT LADY. He took hold of my hair!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [whispers] Never mind, don\'t be afraid, give him your\nhand. His hand will be cold, but I like it.\n\nFAT LADY [hides her hands] Not for the world!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, it is strange, very strange!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. He is here and is seeking for intercourse. Who wishes\nto put a question to him?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I should like to put a question, if I may.\n\nPROFESSOR. Please do.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Do I believe or not?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya knocks twice.\n\nPROFESSOR. The answer is affirmative.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Allow me to ask again. Have I a ten rouble note in my pocket?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya knocks several times and passes a thread over Sah\xc3\xa1tof\'s head.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Ah! [Seizes the thread and breaks it].\n\nPROFESSOR. I should ask those present not to ask indefinite or trivial\nquestions. It is unpleasant to _him_!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. No, but allow me! Here I have a thread in my hand!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. A thread? Hold it fast; that happens often, and not\nonly threads but sometimes even silk cords--very ancient ones!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. No--but where did this thread come from?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya throws a cushion at him.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Wait a bit; wait! Something soft has hit me on the head. Light\na candle--there is something\xc2\xa0...\n\nPROFESSOR. We beg of you not to interrupt the manifestations.\n\nFAT LADY. For goodness\' sake don\'t interrupt! I should also like to ask\nsomething. May I?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, if you like.\n\nFAT LADY. I should like to ask about my digestion. May I? I want to know\nwhat to take: aconite or belladonna?\n\n    Silence, whispers among the young people; suddenly Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\n    begins to cry like a baby: "ou-a, ou-a!" [Laughter.] Holding their\n    mouths and noses, the girls and Petr\xc3\xadstchef run away bursting with\n    laughter.\n\nFAT LADY. Ah, that must be the monk who\'s been born again!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [beside himself with anger, whispers] One gets nothing\nbut tomfoolery from you! If you don\'t know how to behave decently, go\naway!\n\n    Exit Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch. Darkness and silence.\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, what a pity! Now one can\'t ask any more! He is born!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Not at all. It is only Vovo\'s nonsense. But _he_ is\nhere. Ask him.\n\nPROFESSOR. That often happens. These jokes and ridicule are quite usual\noccurrences. I expect _he_ is still here. But we may ask. Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch, will you?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. No, you, if you please. This has upset me. So\nunpleasant! Such want of tact!...\n\nPROFESSOR. Very well.... Nicholas, are you here?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya raps twice and rings. Simon roars, spreads his arms out,\n    seizes Sah\xc3\xa1tof and the Professor--squeezing them.\n\nPROFESSOR. What an unexpected phenomenon! The medium himself reacted\nupon! This never happened before! Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, will you watch? It\nis difficult for me to do so. He squeezes me so! Mind you observe\nGrossman! This needs the very greatest attention!\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya throws the peasants\' paper on the table.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Something has fallen upon the table.\n\nPROFESSOR. See what it is!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Paper! A folded paper!\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya throws a travelling inkstand on the table.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. An inkstand!\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya throws a pen.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. A pen!\n\n    Simon roars and squeezes.\n\nPROFESSOR [crushed] Wait a bit, wait: a totally new manifestation! The\naction proceeding not from the mediumistic energy produced, but from the\nmedium himself! However, open the inkstand, and put the pen on the\ntable, and _he_ will write!\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya goes behind Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch and strikes him on the head with\n    the guitar.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. He has struck me on the head! [Examining table] The\npen is not writing yet and the paper remains folded.\n\nPROFESSOR. See what the paper is, and quickly; evidently the dual\ninfluence--his and Grossman\'s--has produced a perturbation!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [goes out and returns at once] Extraordinary! This\npaper is an agreement with some peasants that I refused to sign this\nmorning and returned to the peasants. Probably _he_ wants me to sign it?\n\nPROFESSOR. Of course! Of course! But ask him.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Nicholas, do you wish\xc2\xa0...\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya knocks twice.\n\nPROFESSOR. Do you hear? It is quite evident!\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch takes the paper and pen and goes out. T\xc3\xa1nya\n    knocks, plays on the guitar and the accordion, and then creeps under\n    the sofa. Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch returns. Simon stretches himself and\n    coughs.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. He is waking up. We can light the candles.\n\nPROFESSOR [hurriedly] Doctor, Doctor, please, his pulse and temperature!\nYou will see that a rise of both will be apparent.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [lights the candles] Well, what do you gentlemen who\nwere sceptical think of it now?\n\nDOCTOR [goes up to Simon and places thermometer] Now then my lad. Well,\nhave you had a nap? There, put that in there, and give me your hand.\n[Looks at his watch].\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [shrugging his shoulders] I must admit that all that has\noccurred cannot have been done by the medium. But the thread?... I\nshould like the thread explained.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. A thread! A thread! We have been witnessing\nmanifestations more important than a thread.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I don\'t know. At all events, _je r\xc3\xa9serve mon opinion_.\n\nFAT LADY [to Sah\xc3\xa1tof] Oh no, how can you say: "_je r\xc3\xa9serve mon\nopinion?_" And the infant with the little wings? Didn\'t you see? At\nfirst I thought it was only an illusion, but afterwards it became\nclearer and clearer, like a live\xc2\xa0...\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I can only speak of what I have seen. I did not see\nthat--nothing of the kind.\n\nFAT LADY. You don\'t mean to say so? Why, it was quite plainly visible!\nAnd to the left there was a monk clothed in black bending over it\xc2\xa0...\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [moves away. Aside] What exaggeration!\n\nFAT LADY [addressing the Doctor] You must have seen it! It rose up from\nyour side.\n\n    Doctor goes on counting pulse without heeding her.\n\nFAT LADY [to Grossman] And that light, the light around it, especially\naround its little face! And the expression so mild and tender, something\nso heavenly! [Smiles tenderly herself].\n\nGROSSMAN. I saw phosphorescent light, and objects changed their places,\nbut I saw nothing more than that.\n\nFAT LADY. Don\'t tell me! You don\'t mean it! It is simply that you\nscientists of Charcot\'s school do not believe in a life beyond the\ngrave! As for me, no one could now make me disbelieve in a future\nlife--no one in the world!\n\n    Grossman moves away from her.\n\nFAT LADY. No, no, whatever you may say, this is one of the happiest\nmoments of my life! When I heard Sarasate play, and now.... Yes! [No one\nlistens to her. She goes up to Simon] Now tell me, my friend, what did\nyou feel? Was it very trying?\n\nSIMON [laughs] Yes, ma\'m, just so.\n\nFAT LADY. Still not unendurable?\n\nSIMON. Just so, ma\'m. [To Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] Am I to go?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, you may go.\n\nDOCTOR [to the Professor] The pulse is the same, but the temperature is\nlower.\n\nPROFESSOR. Lower! [Considers awhile, then suddenly divines the\nconclusion] It had to be so--it had to descend! The dual influence\ncrossing had to produce some kind of reflex action. Yes, that\'s it!\n\n    Exeunt, all talking at once.\n\n  { LEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I\'m only sorry we had no complete\n  { materialisation. But still.... Come, gentlemen, let us go to the\n  { drawing-room?\n  {\n  { FAT LADY. What specially struck me was when he flapped his wings,\n  { and one saw how he rose!\n  {\n  { GROSSMAN [to Sah\xc3\xa1tof] If we had kept to hypnotism, we might have\n  { produced a thorough state of epilepsy. The success might have been\n  { complete!\n  {\n  { SAH\xc3\x81TOF. It is very interesting, but not entirely convincing. That\n  { is all I can say.\n\n    Enter Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [with paper in his hand] Ah, Theodore, what a\nremarkable s\xc3\xa9ance we have had! It turns out that the peasants must have\nthe land on their own terms.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Dear me!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, indeed. [Showing paper] Fancy, this paper that I\nreturned to them, suddenly appeared on the table! I have signed it.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. How did it get there?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, it did get there! [Exit, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch\nfollows him out].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [gets from under the sofa and laughs] Oh dear, oh dear! Well, I\ndid get a fright when he got hold of the thread! [Shrieks] Well, anyhow,\nit\'s all right--he has signed it!\n\n    Enter Gregory.\n\nGREGORY. So it was you that was fooling them?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. What business is it of yours?\n\nGREGORY. And do you think the missis will be pleased with you for it?\nNo, you bet; you\'re caught now! I\'ll tell them what tricks you\'re up to,\nif you don\'t let me have my way!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. And you\'ll not get your way, and you\'ll not do me any harm!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n    The same scene as in Act I. The next day. Two liveried footmen,\n    Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch and Gregory.\n\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN [with grey whiskers] Yours is the third house to-day.\nThank goodness that all the at-homes are in this direction. Yours used\nto be on Thursdays.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, we changed to Saturday so as to be on the same\nday as the Gol\xc3\xb3vkins and Grade von Grabes\xc2\xa0...\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. The Stcherb\xc3\xa1kofs do the thing well. There\'s refreshments\nfor the footmen every time they\'ve a ball.\n\n    The two Princesses, mother and daughter, come down the stairs\n    accompanied by Betsy. The old Princess looks in her note-book and at\n    her watch, and sits down on the settle. Gregory puts on her\n    overshoes.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. Now, do come. Because, if you refuse, and Dodo refuses,\nthe whole thing will be spoilt.\n\nBETSY. I don\'t know. I must certainly go to the Sho\xc3\xbabins. And then there\nis the rehearsal.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. You\'ll have plenty of time. Do, please. _Ne nous fais\npas faux bond._[14] F\xc3\xa9dya and Koko will come.\n\n  [14] Do not disappoint us.\n\nBETSY. _J\'en ai par-dessus la t\xc3\xaate de votre Koko._[15]\n\n  [15] BETSY. I have more than enough of your Koko.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. I thought I should see him here. _Ordinairement il est\nd\'une exactitude\xc2\xa0..._[16]\n\n  [16] YOUNG PRINCESS. ... He is usually so very punctual\xc2\xa0...\n\nBETSY. He is sure to come.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. When I see you together, it always seems to me that he\nhas either just proposed or is just going to propose.\n\nBETSY. Yes, I don\'t suppose it can be avoided. I shall have to go\nthrough with it. And it is so unpleasant!\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. Poor Koko! He is head over ears in love.\n\nBETSY. _Cessez, les gens!_[17]\n\n  [17] BETSY. Cease; mind the servants!\n\n    Young Princess sits down, talking in whispers. Gregory puts on her\n    overshoes.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. Well then, good-bye till this evening.\n\nBETSY. I\'ll try to come.\n\nOLD PRINCESS. Then tell your papa that I don\'t believe in anything of\nthe kind, but will come to see his new medium. Only he must let me know\nwhen. Good afternoon, _ma toute belle_. [Kisses Betsy, and exit,\nfollowed by her daughter. Betsy goes upstairs].\n\nGREGORY. I don\'t like putting on an old woman\'s overshoes for her; she\ncan\'t stoop, can\'t see her shoe for her stomach, and keeps poking her\nfoot in the wrong place. It\'s different with a young one; it\'s pleasant\nto take her foot in one\'s hand.\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. Hear him! Making distinctions!\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. It\'s not for us footmen to make such distinctions.\n\nGREGORY. Why shouldn\'t one make distinctions; are we not men? It\'s they\nthink we don\'t understand! Just now they were deep in their talk, then\nthey look at me, and at once it\'s "lay zhon!"\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. And what\'s that?\n\nGREGORY. Oh, that means, "Don\'t talk, they understand!" It\'s the same at\ntable. But I understand! You say, there\'s a difference? I say there is\nnone.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. There is a great difference for those who understand.\n\nGREGORY. There is none at all. To-day I am a footman, and to-morrow I\nmay be living no worse than they are. Has it never happened that they\'ve\nmarried footmen? I\'ll go and have a smoke. [Exit].\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. That\'s a bold young man you\'ve got.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. A worthless fellow, not fit for service. He used to\nbe an office boy and has got spoilt. I advised them not to take him, but\nthe mistress liked him. He looks well on the carriage when they drive\nout.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. I should like to send him to our Count; he\'d put him in\nhis place! Oh, he don\'t like those scatterbrains. "If you\'re a footman,\nbe a footman and fulfil your calling." Such pride is not befitting.\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef comes running downstairs, and takes out a cigarette.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [deep in thought] Let\'s see, my second is the same as my\nfirst. Echo, a-co, co-coa. [Enter Koko Kl\xc3\xadngen, wearing his pince-nez]\nKo-ko, co-coa. Cocoa tin, where do you spring from?\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. From the Stcherb\xc3\xa1kofs. You are always playing the fool\xc2\xa0...\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. No, listen to my charade. My first is the same as my\nsecond, my third may be cracked, my whole is like your pate.\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. I give it up. I\'ve no time.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Where else are you going?\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. Where? Of course to the \xc3\x8dvins, to practise for the\nconcert. Then to the Sho\xc3\xbabins, and then to the rehearsal. You\'ll be\nthere too, won\'t you?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Most certainly. At the re-her-Sall and also at the\nre-her-Sarah. Why, at first I was a savage, and now I am both a savage\nand a general.\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. How did yesterday\'s s\xc3\xa9ance go off?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Screamingly funny! There was a peasant, and above all, it\nwas all in the dark. Vovo cried like an infant, the Professor defined,\nand M\xc3\xa1rya Vas\xc3\xadlevna refined. Such a lark! You ought to have been there.\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. I\'m afraid, _mon cher_. You have a way of getting off with\na jest, but I always feel that if I say a word, they\'ll construe it into\na proposal. _Et \xc3\xa7a ne m\'arrange pas du tout, du tout. Mais du tout, du\ntout!_[18]\n\n  [18] And that won\'t suit me at all, at all! Not at all, at all!\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Instead of a proposal, make a proposition, and receive a\nsentence! Well, I shall go in to Vovo\'s. If you\'ll call for me, we can\ngo to the re-her-Sarah together.\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. I can\'t think how you can be friends with such a fool. He\nis so stupid,--a regular blockhead!\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. And I am fond of him. I love Vovo, but ... "with a love so\nstrange, ne\'er towards him the path untrod shall be"\xc2\xa0... [Exit into\nVovo\'s room].\n\n    Betsy comes down with a Lady. Koko bows significantly to Betsy.\n\nBETSY [shaking Koko\'s hand without turning towards him. To Lady] You are\nacquainted?\n\nLADY. No.\n\nBETSY. Baron Kl\xc3\xadngen.... Why were you not here last night?\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. I could not come, I was engaged.\n\nBETSY. What a pity, it was so interesting! [Laughs] You should have seen\nwhat manifestations we had! Well, how is our charade getting on?\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. Oh, the verses for _mon second_ are ready. Nick composed\nthe verses, and I the music.\n\nBETSY. What are they? What are they? Do tell me!\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. Wait a minute; how does it go?... Oh, the knight sings:\n\n        "Oh, _naught_ so beautiful as nature:\n         The _Nautilus_ sails by.\n         Oh, _naughty_ lass, oh, _naughty_ lass!\n         Oh, _nought_, oh _nought_! Oh fie!"\n\nLADY. I see, my second is "nought," and what is my first?\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. My first is _Aero_, the name of a girl savage.\n\nBETSY. _Aero_, you see, is a savage who wished to devour the object of\nher love. [Laughs] She goes about lamenting, and sings--\n\n        "My appetite,"\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN [interrupts]--\n\n        "How can I fight,"\xc2\xa0...\n\nBETSY [chimes in]--\n\n        "Some one to chew I long.\n         I seeking go\xc2\xa0..."\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN--\n\n        "But even so\xc2\xa0..."\n\nBETSY--\n\n        "No one to chew can find."\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN--\n\n        "A raft sails by,"\n\nBETSY--\n\n        "It cometh nigh;\n         Two generals upon it\xc2\xa0..."\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN--\n\n        "Two generals are we:\n         By fate\'s hard decree,\n         To this island we flee."\n\nAnd then, the refrain--\n\n        "By fate\'s hard decree,\n         To this island we flee."\n\nLADY. _Charmant!_\n\nBETSY. But just think how silly!\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. Yes, that\'s the charm of it!\n\nLADY. And who is to be Aero?\n\nBETSY. I am. And I have had a costume made, but mamma says it\'s "not\ndecent." And it is not a bit less decent than a ball dress. [To Theodore\nIv\xc3\xa1nitch] Is Bourdier\'s man here?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, he is waiting in the kitchen.\n\nLADY. Well, and how will you represent Aeronaut?\n\nBETSY. Oh, you\'ll see. I don\'t want to spoil the pleasure for you. _Au\nrevoir._\n\nLADY. Good-bye! [They bow. Exit Lady].\n\nBETSY [to Koko Kl\xc3\xadngen] Come up to mamma.\n\n    Betsy and Koko go upstairs. Jacob enters from servants\' quarters,\n    carrying a tray with teacups, cakes, &c., and goes panting across\n    the stage.\n\nJACOB [to the Footmen] How d\'you do? How d\'you do? [Footmen bow].\n\nJACOB [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] Couldn\'t you tell Gregory to help a bit!\nI\'m ready to drop.... [Exit up the stairs].\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. That is a hard-working chap you\'ve got there.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, a good fellow. But there now--he doesn\'t satisfy\nthe mistress, she says his appearance is ungainly. And now they\'ve gone\nand told tales about him for letting some peasants into the kitchen\nyesterday. It is a bad look-out: they may dismiss him. And he is a good\nfellow.\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. What peasants were they?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Peasants that had come from our Koursk village to buy\nsome land. It was night, and they were our fellow-countrymen, one of\nthem the father of the butler\'s assistant. Well, so they were asked into\nthe kitchen. It so happened that there was thought-reading going on.\nSomething was hidden in the kitchen, and all the gentlefolk came down,\nand the mistress saw the peasants. There was such a row! "How is this,"\nshe says; "these people may be infected, and they are let into the\nkitchen!" ... She is terribly afraid of this infection.\n\n    Enter Gregory.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Gregory, you go and help Jacob. I\'ll stay here. He\ncan\'t manage alone.\n\nGREGORY. He\'s awkward, that\'s why he can\'t manage. [Exit].\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. And what is this new mania they have got? This\ninfection!... So yours also is afraid of it?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. She fears it worse than fire! Our chief business,\nnowadays, is fumigating, washing, and sprinkling.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. I see. That\'s why there is such a stuffy smell here.\n[With animation] I don\'t know what we\'re coming to with these infection\nnotions. It\'s just detestable! They seem to have forgotten the Lord.\nThere\'s our master\'s sister, Princess Mosol\xc3\xb3va, her daughter was dying\nand, will you believe it, neither father nor mother would come near her!\nSo she died without their having taken leave of her. And the daughter\ncried, and called them to say good-bye--but they didn\'t go! The doctor\nhad discovered some infection or other! And yet their own maid and a\ntrained nurse were with her, and nothing happened to them; they\'re still\nalive!\n\n    Enter Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch and Petr\xc3\xadstchef from Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s\n    room, smoking cigarettes.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Come along then, only I must take Koko--Cocoanut, with me.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Your Koko is a regular dolt; I can\'t bear him. A\nhare-brained fellow, a regular gad-about! Without any kind of\noccupation, eternally loafing around! Eh, what?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Well, anyhow, wait a bit, I must say good-bye.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. All right. And I will go and look at my dogs in the\ncoachman\'s room. I\'ve got a dog there that\'s so savage, the coachman\nsaid, he nearly ate him.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Who ate whom? Did the coachman really eat the dog?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. You are always at it! [Puts on outdoor things and\ngoes out].\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [thoughtfully] Ma-kin-tosh, Co-co-tin.... Let\'s see. [Goes\nupstairs].\n\n    Jacob runs across the stage.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What\'s the matter?\n\nJACOB. There is no more thin bread and butter. I said\xc2\xa0... [Exit].\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. And then our master\'s little son fell ill, and they sent\nhim at once to an hotel with his nurse, and there he died without his\nmother.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. They don\'t seem to fear sin! _I_ think you cannot escape\nfrom God anywhere.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. That\'s what I think.\n\n    Jacob runs upstairs with bread and butter.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. One should consider too, that if we are to be afraid of\neverybody like that, we\'d better shut ourselves up within four walls, as\nin a prison, and stick there!\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya; she bows to the Footmen.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Good afternoon.\n\n    Footmen bow.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, I have a word to say to you.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, what?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. The peasants have come again, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch\xc2\xa0...\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well? I gave the paper to Simon.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I have given them the paper. They were that grateful! I can\'t say\nhow! Now they only ask you to take the money.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But where are they?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Here, by the porch.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. All right, I\'ll tell the master.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I have another request to you, dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What now?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, don\'t you see, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, I can\'t remain here any\nlonger. Ask them to let me go.\n\n    Enter Jacob, running.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to Jacob] What d\'you want?\n\nJACOB. Another samov\xc3\xa1r, and oranges.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Ask the housekeeper.\n\n    Exit Jacob.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to T\xc3\xa1nya] How is that?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, don\'t you see, my position is such\xc2\xa0...\n\nJACOB [runs in] There are not enough oranges.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Serve up as many as you\'ve got [Exit Jacob]. Now\'s\nnot the time! Just see what a bustle we are in.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But you know yourself, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, there is no end to this\nbustle; one might wait for ever--you know yourself--and my affair is for\nlife.... Dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, you have done me a good turn, be a\nfather to me now, choose the right moment and tell her, or else she\'ll\nget angry and won\'t let me have my passport.[19]\n\n  [19] Employers have charge of the servants\' passports, and in this way\n  have a hold on them in case of misconduct.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Where\'s the hurry?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, it\'s all settled now.... And I could go\nto my godmother\'s and get ready, and then after Easter we\'d get\nmarried.[20] Do tell her, dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch!\n\n  [20] See footnote, p. 28. It is customary for peasants to marry just\n  after Easter, but when spring has come and the field work begun, no\n  marriages take place among them till autumn.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Go away--this is not the place.\n\n    An elderly Gentleman comes downstairs, puts on overcoat, and goes\n    out followed by the Second Footman.\n\n    Exit T\xc3\xa1nya. Enter Jacob.\n\nJACOB. Just fancy, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, it\'s too bad! She wants to\ndischarge me now! She says, "You break everything, and forget Frisk, and\nyou let the peasants into the kitchen against my orders!" And you know\nvery well that I knew nothing about it. Taty\xc3\xa1na told me, "Take them into\nthe kitchen"; how could I tell whose order it was?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Did the mistress speak to you?\n\nJACOB. She\'s just spoken. Do speak up for me, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch! You\nsee, my people in the country are only just getting on their feet, and\nsuppose I lose my place, when shall I get another? Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch,\ndo, please!\n\n    Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna comes down with the old Countess, whom she is seeing\n    off. The Countess has false teeth and hair. The First Footman helps\n    the Countess into her outdoor things.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Oh, most certainly, of course! I am so deeply touched.\n\nCOUNTESS. If it were not for my illness, I should come oftener to see\nyou.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You should really consult Peter Petr\xc3\xb3vitch. He is rough,\nbut nobody can soothe one as he does. He is so clear, so simple.\n\nCOUNTESS. Oh no, I shall keep to the one I am used to.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Pray, take care of yourself.\n\nCOUNTESS. _Merci, mille fois merci._[21]\n\n  [21] COUNTESS. Thank you (for your hospitality), a thousand thanks.\n\n    Gregory, dishevelled and excited, jumps out from the servants\'\n    quarters. Simon appears behind him in the doorway.\n\nSIMON. You\'d better leave her alone!\n\nGREGORY. You rascal! I\'ll teach you how to fight, you scamp, you!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What do you mean? Do you think you are in a public-house?\n\nGREGORY. This coarse peasant makes life impossible for me.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [provoked] You\'ve lost your senses. Don\'t you see? [To\nCountess] _Merci, mille fois merci. A mardi!_[22]\n\n  [22] ANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Thank you (for coming to see us), a thousand\n  thanks. Till next Tuesday!\n\n    Exeunt Countess and First Footman.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Gregory] What is the meaning of this?\n\nGREGORY. Though I do occupy the position of a footman, still I won\'t\nallow every peasant to hit me; I have my pride too.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Why, what has happened?\n\nGREGORY. Why, this Simon of yours has got so brave, sitting with the\ngentlemen, that he wants to fight!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Why? What for?\n\nGREGORY. Heaven only knows!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Simon] What is the meaning of it?\n\nSIMON. Why does he bother her?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What has happened?\n\nSIMON [smiles] Well, you see, he is always catching hold of T\xc3\xa1nya, the\nlady\'s-maid, and she won\'t have it. Well, so I just moved him aside a\nbit, just so, with my hand.\n\nGREGORY. A nice little bit! He\'s almost caved my ribs in, and has torn\nmy dress-coat, and he says, "The same power as came over me yesterday\ncomes on me again," and he begins to squeeze me.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Simon] How dare you fight in my house?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. May I explain it to you, ma\'am? I must tell you Simon\nis not indifferent to T\xc3\xa1nya, and is engaged to her. And Gregory--one\nmust admit the truth--does not behave properly, nor honestly, to her.\nWell, so I suppose Simon got angry with him.\n\nGREGORY. Not at all! It is all his spite, because I have discovered\ntheir trickery.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What trickery?\n\nGREGORY. Why, at the s\xc3\xa9ance. All those things, last night,--it was not\nSimon but T\xc3\xa1nya who did them! I saw her getting out from under the sofa\nwith my own eyes.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What is that? From under the sofa?\n\nGREGORY. I give you my word of honour. And it was she who threw the\npaper on the table. If it had not been for her the paper would not have\nbeen signed, nor the land sold to the peasants.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. And you saw it yourself?\n\nGREGORY. With my own eyes. Shall I call her? She\'ll not deny it.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, call her.\n\n    Exit Gregory.\n\n    Noise behind the scenes. The voice of the Doorkeeper, "No, no, you\n    cannot." Doorkeeper is seen at the front door, the three Peasants\n    rush in past him, the Second Peasant first; the Third one stumbles,\n    falls on his nose, and catches hold of it.\n\nDOORKEEPER. You must not go in!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Where\'s the harm? We are not doing anything wrong. We\nonly wish to pay the money!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it; as by laying on the signature the affair\nis come to a conclusion, we only wish to make payment with thanks.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Wait a bit with your thanks. It was all done by fraud! It\nis not settled yet. Not sold yet.... Leon\xc3\xadd.... Call Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch.\n[Exit Doorkeeper].\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch enters, but, seeing his wife and the Peasants,\n    wishes to retreat.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. No, no, come here, please! I told you the land must not\nbe sold on credit, and everybody told you so, but you let yourself be\ndeceived like the veriest blockhead.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. How? I don\'t understand who is deceiving?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! You have grey hair,\nand you let yourself be deceived and laughed at like a silly boy. You\ngrudge your son some three hundred roubles which his social position\ndemands, and let yourself be tricked of thousands--like a fool!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Now come, Annette, try to be calm.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. We are only come about the acceptation of the sum, for\nexample\xc2\xa0...\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [taking out the money] Let us finish the matter, for\nChrist\'s sake!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Wait, wait!\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya and Gregory.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [angrily] You were in the small drawing-room during the\ns\xc3\xa9ance last night?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya looks round at Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, and\n    Simon, and sighs.\n\nGREGORY. It\'s no use beating about the bush; I saw you myself\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Tell me, were you there? I know all about it, so you\'d\nbetter confess! I\'ll not do anything to you. I only want to expose him\n[pointing to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] your master.... Did you throw the paper\non the table?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I don\'t know how to answer. Only one thing,--let me go home.\n\n    Enter Betsy unobserved.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] There, you see! You are being made\na fool of.\n\n  [Illustration: FRUITS OF CULTURE. ACT IV.\n\n  ANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. There, you see! You are being made a fool of.]\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Let me go home, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. No, my dear! You may have caused us a loss of thousands\nof roubles. Land has been sold that ought not to be sold!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Let me go, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. No; you\'ll have to answer for it! Such tricks won\'t do.\nWe\'ll have you up before the Justice of the Peace!\n\nBETSY [comes forward] Let her go, mamma. Or, if you wish to have her\ntried, you must have me tried too! She and I did it together.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, of course, if _you_ have a hand in anything, what\ncan one expect but the very worst results!\n\n    Enter the Professor.\n\nPROFESSOR. How do you do, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna? How do you do, Miss Betsy?\nLeon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, I have brought you a report of the Thirteenth\nCongress of Spiritualists at Chicago. An amazing speech by Schmidt!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Oh, that is interesting!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I will tell you something much more interesting! It turns\nout that both you and my husband were fooled by this girl! Betsy takes\nit on herself, but that is only to annoy me. It was an illiterate\npeasant girl who fooled you, and you believed it all. There were no\nmediumistic phenomena last night; it was she [pointing to T\xc3\xa1nya] who did\nit!\n\nPROFESSOR [taking off his overcoat] What do you mean?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I mean that it was she who, in the dark, played on the\nguitar and beat my husband on the head and performed all your idiotic\ntricks--and she has just confessed!\n\nPROFESSOR [smiling] What does that prove?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. It proves that your mediumism is--tomfoolery; that\'s what\nit proves!\n\nPROFESSOR. Because this young girl wished to deceive, we are to conclude\nthat mediumism is "tomfoolery," as you are pleased to express it?\n[Smiles] A curious conclusion! Very possibly this young girl may have\nwished to deceive: that often occurs. She may even have done something;\nbut then, what she did--_she_ did. But the manifestations of mediumistic\nenergy still remain manifestations of _mediumistic_ energy! It is even\nvery probable that what this young girl did, evoked (and so to say\nsolicited) the manifestation of mediumistic energy,--giving it a\ndefinite form.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Another lecture!\n\nPROFESSOR [sternly] You say, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, that this girl, and perhaps\nthis dear young lady also, did something; but the light we all saw, and,\nin the first case the fall, and in the second the rise of temperature,\nand Grossman\'s excitement and vibration--were those things also done by\nthis girl? And these are facts, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, facts! No! Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna, there are things which must be investigated and fully\nunderstood before they can be talked about, things too serious, too\nserious\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. And the child that M\xc3\xa1rya Vas\xc3\xadlevna distinctly saw?\nWhy, I saw it too.... That could not have been done by this girl.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You think yourself wise, but you are--a fool.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, I\'m going.... Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch, will you\ncome? [Exit into his study].\n\nPROFESSOR [shrugging his shoulders, follows] Oh, how far, how far, we\nstill lag behind Western Europe!\n\n    Enter Jacob.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [following Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch with her eyes] He has been\ntricked like a fool, and he sees nothing! [To Jacob] What do you want?\n\nJACOB. How many persons am I to lay the table for?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. For how many?... Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch! Let him give up the\nsilver plate to you. Be off, at once! It is all his fault! This man will\nbring me to my grave. Last night he nearly starved the dog that had done\nhim no harm! And, as if that were not enough, he lets the infected\npeasants into the kitchen, and now they are here again! It is all his\nfault! Be off at once! Discharge him, discharge him! [To Simon] And you,\nhorrid peasant, if you dare to have rows in my house again, I\'ll teach\nyou!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. All right, if he is a horrid peasant there\'s no good\nkeeping him; you\'d better discharge him too, and there\'s an end of it.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [while listening to him looks at Third Peasant] Only look!\nWhy, he has a rash on his nose--a rash! He is ill; he is a hotbed of\ninfection!! Did I not give orders, yesterday, that they were not to be\nallowed into the house, and here they are again? Drive them out!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Then are we not to accept their money?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Their money? Oh yes, take their money; but they must be\nturned out at once, especially this one! He is quite rotten!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. That\'s not just, lady. God\'s my witness, it\'s not just!\nYou\'d better ask my old woman, let\'s say, whether I am rotten! I\'m clear\nas crystal, let\'s say.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. He talks!... Off, off with him! It\'s all to spite me!...\nOh, I can\'t bear it, I can\'t!... Send for the doctor! [Runs away,\nsobbing. Exit also Jacob and Gregory].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [to Betsy] Miss Elizabeth, darling, what am I to do now?\n\nBETSY. Never mind, you go with them and I\'ll arrange it all. [Exit].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, your reverence, how about the reception of the sum\nnow?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Let us settle up, and go.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [fumbling with the packet of bank-notes] Had I known, I\'d\nnot have come for the world. It\'s worse than a fever!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to Doorkeeper] Show them into my room. There\'s a\ncounting-board there. I\'ll receive their money. Now go.\n\nDOORKEEPER. Come along.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. And it\'s T\xc3\xa1nya you have to thank for it. But for her\nyou\'d not have had the land.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. As she made the proposal, so she put it\ninto effect.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. She\'s made men of us. Else what were we? We had so little\nland, no room to let a hen out, let\'s say, not to mention the cattle.\nGood-bye, dear! When you get to the village, come to us and eat honey.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Let me get home and I\'ll start brewing the beer for the\nwedding! You will come?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, I\'ll come, I\'ll come! [Shrieks] Simon, this is fine, isn\'t\nit? [Exeunt Peasants].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, T\xc3\xa1nya, when you have your house I\'ll come to\nvisit you. Will you welcome me?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, just the same as we would our own father!\n[Embraces and kisses him].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n                      END OF "FRUITS OF CULTURE."\n\n\n\n\n[ Transcriber\'s Note:\n\n  The following is a list of corrections made to the original.

A staircase leads up to the\n    other rooms; behind it is another door leading to the servants\'\n    quarters.\n\n\nSCENE 1.\n\nGREGORY [looks at himself in the glass and arranges his hair, &c.] I\n_am_ sorry about those moustaches of mine! "Moustaches are not becoming\nto a footman," she says! And why? Why, so that any one might see you\'re\na footman,--else my looks might put her darling son to shame. He\'s a\nlikely one! There\'s not much fear of his coming anywhere near me,\nmoustaches or no moustaches! [Smiling into the glass] And what a lot of\n\'em swarm round me. And yet I don\'t care for any of them as much as for\nthat T\xc3\xa1nya. And she only a lady\'s-maid! Ah well, she\'s nicer than any\nyoung lady. [Smiles] She is a duck! [Listening] Ah, here she comes.\n[Smiles] Yes, that\'s her, clattering with her little heels. Oh!\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya, carrying a cloak and boots.\n\nGREGORY. My respects to you, Taty\xc3\xa1na M\xc3\xa1rkovna.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. What are you always looking in the glass for? Do you think\nyourself so good-looking?\n\nGREGORY. Well, and are my looks not agreeable?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. So, so; neither agreeable nor disagreeable, but just betwixt and\nbetween! Why are all those cloaks hanging there?\n\nGREGORY. I am just going to put them away, your ladyship! [Takes down a\nfur cloak and, wrapping it round her, embraces her] I say, T\xc3\xa1nya, I\'ll\ntell you something\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh, get away, do! What do you mean by it? [Pulls herself angrily\naway] Leave me alone, I tell you!\n\nGREGORY [looks cautiously around] Then give me a kiss!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Now, really, what are you bothering for? I\'ll give you such a\nkiss! [Raises her hand to strike].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [off the scene, rings and then shouts] Gregory!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. There now, go! Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch is calling you.\n\nGREGORY. He\'ll wait! He\'s only just opened his eyes! I say, why don\'t\nyou love me?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. What sort of loving have you imagined now? I don\'t love anybody.\n\nGREGORY. That\'s a fib. You love Simon! You have found a nice one to\nlove--a common, dirty-pawed peasant, a butler\'s assistant!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Never mind; such as he is, you are jealous of him!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [off the scene] Gregory!\n\nGREGORY. All in good time.... Jealous indeed! Of what? Why, you have\nonly just begun to get licked into shape, and who are you tying yourself\nup with? Now, wouldn\'t it be altogether a different matter if you loved\nme?... I say, T\xc3\xa1nya\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [angrily and severely] You\'ll get nothing from me, I tell you!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [off the scene] Gregory!!\n\nGREGORY. You\'re mighty particular, ain\'t you?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [off the scene, shouts persistently, monotonously, and\nwith all his might] Gregory! Gregory! Gregory! [T\xc3\xa1nya and Gregory\nlaugh].\n\nGREGORY. You should have seen the girls that have been sweet on me.\n[Bell rings].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well then, go to them, and leave me alone!\n\nGREGORY. You are a silly, now I think of it. I\'m not Simon!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Simon means marriage, and not tomfoolery!\n\n    Enter Porter, carrying a large cardboard box.\n\nPORTER. Good morning!\n\nGREGORY. Good morning! Where are you from?\n\nPORTER. From Bourdey\'s. I\'ve brought a dress, and here\'s a note for the\nlady.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [taking the note] Sit down, and I\'ll take it in. [Exit].\n\n    Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch looks out of the door in shirt-sleeves and\n    slippers.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Gregory!\n\nGREGORY. Yes, sir.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Gregory! Don\'t you hear me call?\n\nGREGORY. I\'ve only just come, sir.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Hot water, and a cup of tea.\n\nGREGORY. Yes, sir; Simon will bring them directly.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. And who is this? Ah, from Bourdier?\n\nPORTER. Yes, sir.\n\n    Exeunt Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch and Gregory. Bell rings. T\xc3\xa1nya runs in at\n    the sound of the bell and opens the front door.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [to Porter] Please wait a little.\n\nPORTER. I am waiting.\n\n    Sah\xc3\xa1tof enters at front door.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I beg your pardon, but the footman has just gone away. This way,\nsir. Allow me, please. [Takes his fur cloak].\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [adjusting his clothes] Is Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch at home? Is he up?\n[Bell rings].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh yes, sir. He\'s been up a long time.\n\n    Doctor enters and looks round for the footman. Sees Sah\xc3\xa1tof and\n    addresses him in an offhand manner.\n\nDOCTOR. Ah, my respects to you!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [looks fixedly at him] The Doctor, I believe?\n\nDOCTOR. And I thought you were abroad! Dropped in to see Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes. And you? Is any one ill?\n\nDOCTOR [laughing] Not exactly ill, but, you know ... It\'s awful with\nthese ladies! Sits up at cards till three every morning, and pulls her\nwaist into the shape of a wine-glass. And the lady is flabby and fat,\nand carries the weight of a good many years on her back.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Is this the way you state your diagnosis to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna? I\nshould hardly think it quite pleases her!\n\nDOCTOR [laughing] Well, it\'s the truth. They do all these tricks--and\nthen come derangements of the digestive organs, pressure on the liver,\nnerves, and all sorts of things, and one has to come and patch them up.\nIt\'s just awful! [Laughs] And you? You are also a spiritualist it seems?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I? No, I am not also a spiritualist.... Good morning! [Is about\nto go, but is stopped by the Doctor].\n\nDOCTOR. No! But I can\'t myself, you know, positively deny the\npossibility of it, when a man like Krougosv\xc3\xa9tlof is connected with it\nall. How can one? Is he not a professor,--a European celebrity? There\nmust be something in it. I should like to see for myself, but I never\nhave the time. I have other things to do.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, yes! Good morning. [Exit, bowing slightly].\n\nDOCTOR [to T\xc3\xa1nya] Is Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna up?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. She\'s in her bedroom, but please come up.\n\n    Doctor goes upstairs.\n\n    Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch enters with a newspaper in his hand.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to Porter] What is it you want?\n\nPORTER. I\'m from Bourdey\'s. I brought a dress and a note, and was told\nto wait.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Ah, from Bourdey\'s! [To T\xc3\xa1nya] Who came in just now?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It was Serg\xc3\xa9y Iv\xc3\xa1nitch Sah\xc3\xa1tof and the Doctor. They stood talking\nhere a bit. It was all about spiritalism.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [correcting her] Spirit_u_alism.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, that\'s just what I said--spiritalism. Have you heard how\nwell it went off last time, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch? [Laughs] There was\nknocks, and things flew about!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. And how do _you_ know?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Miss Elizabeth told me.\n\n    Jacob runs in with a tumbler of tea on a tray.\n\nJACOB [to the Porter] Good morning!\n\nPORTER [disconsolately] Good morning!\n\n    Jacob knocks at Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s door.\n\n    Gregory enters.\n\nGREGORY. Give it here.\n\nJACOB. You didn\'t bring back all yesterday\'s tumblers, nor the tray\nVas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch had. And it\'s me that have to answer for them!\n\nGREGORY. The tray is full of cigars.\n\nJACOB. Well, put them somewhere else. It\'s me who\'s answerable for it.\n\nGREGORY. I\'ll bring it back! I\'ll bring it back!\n\nJACOB. Yes, so you say, but it is not where it ought to be. The other\nday, just as the tea had to be served, it was not to be found.\n\nGREGORY. I\'ll bring it back, I tell you. What a fuss!\n\nJACOB. It\'s easy for you to talk. Here am I serving tea for the third\ntime, and now there\'s the lunch to get ready. One does nothing but rush\nabout the livelong day. Is there any one in the house who has more to do\nthan me? Yet they are never satisfied with me.\n\nGREGORY. Dear me? Who could wish for any one more satisfactory? You\'re\nsuch a fine fellow!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Nobody is good enough for you! You alone\xc2\xa0...\n\nGREGORY [to T\xc3\xa1nya] No one asked your opinion! [Exit].\n\nJACOB. Ah well, I don\'t mind. Taty\xc3\xa1na M\xc3\xa1rkovna, did the mistress say\nanything about yesterday?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. About the lamp, you mean?\n\nJACOB. And how it managed to drop out of my hands, the Lord only knows!\nJust as I began rubbing it, and was going to take hold of it in another\nplace, out it slips and goes all to pieces. It\'s just my luck! It\'s easy\nfor that Gregory Mih\xc3\xa1ylitch to talk--a single man like him! But when one\nhas a family, one has to consider things: they have to be fed. I don\'t\nmind work.... So she didn\'t say anything? The Lord be thanked!... Oh,\nTheodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, have you one spoon or two?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. One. Only one! [Reads newspaper].\n\n    Exit Jacob.\n\n    Bell rings. Enter Gregory (carrying a tray) and the Doorkeeper.\n\nDOORKEEPER [to Gregory] Tell the master some peasants have come from the\nvillage.\n\nGREGORY [pointing to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] Tell the major-domo here, it\'s\nhis business. I have no time. [Exit].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Where are these peasants from?\n\nDOORKEEPER. From Koursk, I think.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [shrieks with delight] It\'s them.... It\'s Simon\'s father come\nabout the land! I\'ll go and meet them! [Runs off].\n\nDOORKEEPER. Well, then, what shall I say to them? Shall they come in\nhere? They say they\'ve come about the land--the master knows, they say.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, they want to purchase some land. All right! But\nhe has a visitor now, so you had better tell them to wait.\n\nDOORKEEPER. Where shall they wait?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Let them wait outside. I\'ll send for them when the\ntime comes. [Exit Doorkeeper]\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya, followed by three Peasants.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. To the right. In here! In here!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I did not want them brought in here!\n\nGREGORY. Forward minx!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, it won\'t matter, they\'ll stand in this\ncorner.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. They\'ll dirty the floor.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. They\'ve scraped their shoes, and I\'ll wipe the floor up\nafterwards. [To Peasants] Here, stand just here.\n\n    Peasants come forward carrying presents tied in cotton\n    handkerchiefs: cake, eggs, and embroidered towels. They look around\n    for an ic\xc3\xb3n before which to cross themselves; not finding one, they\n    cross themselves looking at the staircase.\n\nGREGORY [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch]. There now, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, they say\nPironnet\'s boots are an elegant shape. But those there are ever so much\nbetter. [Pointing to the third Peasant\'s bast shoes].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Why will you always be ridiculing people? [Exit\nGregory].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [rises and goes up to the Peasants] So you are from\nKoursk? And have come to arrange about buying some land?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Just so. We might say, it is for the completion of the\npurchase of the land we have come. How could we announce ourselves to\nthe master?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, yes, I know. You wait a bit and I\'ll go and\ninform him. [Exit].\n\n    The Peasants look around; they are embarrassed where to put their\n    presents.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. There now, couldn\'t we have what d\'you call it? Something\nto present these here things on? To do it in a genteel way, like,--a\nlittle dish or something.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. All right, directly; put them down here for the present. [Puts\nbundles on settle].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. There now,--that respectable gentleman that was here just\nnow,--what might be his station?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. He\'s the master\'s valet.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. I see. So he\'s also in service. And you, now, are you a\nservant too?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I am lady\'s-maid. Do you know, I also come from D\xc3\xa9men! I know\nyou, and you, but I don\'t know him. [Pointing to third Peasant].\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Them two you know, but me you don\'t know?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. You are Ef\xc3\xadm Ant\xc3\xb3nitch.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. And you are Simon\'s father, Zachary Trif\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Right!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. And let me tell you, I\'m M\xc3\xadtry Vl\xc3\xa1sitch Tchil\xc3\xadkin. Now do\nyou know?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Now I shall know you too!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And who may you be?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I am Aks\xc3\xadnya\'s, the soldier\'s wife\'s, orphan.\n\nFIRST AND THIRD PEASANTS [with surprise] Never!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. The proverb says true:\n\n        "Buy a penny pig, put it in the rye,\n         And you\'ll have a wonderful fat porker by-and-by."\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it! She\'s got the resemblance of a duchess!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. That be so truly. Oh Lord!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. [off the scene, rings, and then shouts] Gregory!\nGregory!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Now who\'s that, for example, disturbing himself in such a\nway, if I may say so?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. That\'s the young master.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord! Didn\'t I say we\'d better wait outside until the\ntime comes? [Silence].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Is it _you_, Simon wants to marry?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, has he been writing? [Hides her face in her apron].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. It\'s evident he\'s written! But it\'s a bad business he\'s\nimagined here. I see the lad\'s got spoilt!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [quickly] No, he\'s not at all spoilt! Shall I send him to you?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why send him? All in good time. Where\'s the hurry?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [desperately, behind scene] Gregory! Where the devil\nare you?... [Enters from his room in shirt-sleeves, adjusting his\npince-nez].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Is every one dead?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. He\'s not here, sir.... I\'ll send him to you at once. [Moves\ntowards the back door].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. I could hear you talking, you know. How have these\nscarecrows sprung up here? Eh? What?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. They\'re peasants from the Koursk village, sir. [Peasants bow].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. And who is this? Oh yes, from Bourdier.\n\n    Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch pays no attention to the Peasants\' bow. T\xc3\xa1nya\n    meets Gregory at the doorway and remains on the scene.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [to Gregory] I told you the other boots... I can\'t\nwear these!\n\nGREGORY. Well, the others are also there.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. But where is _there_?\n\nGREGORY. Just in the same place!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. They\'re not!\n\nGREGORY. Well, come and see. [Exeunt Gregory and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch].\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say now, might we not in the meantime just go and wait,\nsay, in some lodging-house or somewhere?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. No, no, wait a little. I\'ll go and bring you some plates to put\nthe presents on. [Exit].\n\n    Enter Sah\xc3\xa1tof and Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, followed by Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\n    The Peasants take up the presents, and pose themselves.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [to Peasants] Presently, presently! Wait a bit!\n[Points to Porter] Who is this?\n\nPORTER. From Bourdey\'s.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Ah, from Bourdier.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [smiling] Well, I don\'t deny it: still you understand that,\nnever having seen it, we, the uninitiated, have some difficulty in\nbelieving.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. You say you find it difficult to believe! We do not\nask for faith; all we demand of you is to investigate! How can I help\nbelieving in this ring? Yet this ring came from there!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. From _there_? What do you mean? From where?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. From the other world. Yes!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [smiling] That\'s very interesting--very interesting!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, supposing we admit that I\'m a man carried away\nby an idea, as you think, and that I am deluding myself. Well, but what\nof Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch Krougosv\xc3\xa9tlof--he is not just an ordinary man,\nbut a distinguished professor, and yet he admits it to be a fact. And\nnot he alone. What of Crookes? What of Wallace?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. But I don\'t deny anything. I only say it is very interesting.\nIt would be interesting to know how Krougosv\xc3\xa9tlof explains it!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. He has a theory of his own. Could you come\nto-night?--he is sure to be here. First we shall have Grossman--you\nknow, the famous thought-reader?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, I have heard of him but have never happened to meet him.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Then you must come! We shall first have Grossman,\nthen Kaptch\xc3\xadtch, and our mediumistic s\xc3\xa9ance.... [To Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch]\nHas the man returned from Kaptch\xc3\xadtch?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Not yet, sir.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Then how am I to know?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Never mind, come in any case! If Kaptch\xc3\xadtch can\'t\ncome we shall find our own medium. M\xc3\xa1rya Ign\xc3\xa1tievna is a medium--not\nsuch a good one as Kaptch\xc3\xadtch, but still\xc2\xa0...\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya enters with plates for the presents, and stands listening.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [smiling] Oh yes, yes. But here is one puzzling point:--how is\nit that the mediums are always of the, so-called, educated class, such\nas Kaptch\xc3\xadtch and M\xc3\xa1rya Ign\xc3\xa1tievna? If there were such a special force,\nwould it not be met with also among the common people--the peasants?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Oh yes, and it is! That is very common. Even here in\nour own house we have a peasant whom we discovered to be a medium. A few\ndays ago we called him in--a sofa had to be moved, during a s\xc3\xa9ance--and\nwe forgot all about him. In all probability he fell asleep. And, fancy,\nafter our s\xc3\xa9ance was over and Kaptch\xc3\xadtch had come to again, we suddenly\nnoticed mediumistic phenomena in another part of the room, near the\npeasant: the table gave a jerk and moved!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [aside] That was when I was getting out from under it!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. It is quite evident he also is a medium. Especially\nas he is very like Home in appearance. You remember Home--a fair-haired\nna\xc3\xafve sort of fellow?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [shrugging his shoulders] Dear me, this is very interesting, you\nknow. I think you should try him.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. So we will! And he is not alone; there are thousands\nof mediums, only we do not know them. Why, only a short time ago a\nbedridden old woman moved a brick wall!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Moved a brick ... a brick wall?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, yes. She was lying in bed, and did not even know\nshe was a medium. She just leant her arm against the wall, and the wall\nmoved!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. And did not cave in?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. And did not cave in.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Very strange! Well then, I\'ll come this evening.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Pray do. We shall have a s\xc3\xa9ance in any case. [Sah\xc3\xa1tof\nputs on his outdoor things, Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch sees him to the door].\n\nPORTER [to T\xc3\xa1nya] Do tell your mistress! Am I to spend the night here?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Wait a little; she\'s going to drive out with the young lady, so\nshe\'ll soon be coming downstairs. [Exit].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [comes up to the Peasants, who bow and offer him their\npresents] That\'s not necessary!\n\nFIRST PEASANT [smiling] Oh, but this-here is our first duty, it is! It\'s\nalso the Commune\'s orders that we should do it!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That\'s always been the proper way.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say no more about it! \'Cause as we are much satisfied....\nAs our parents, let\'s say, served, let\'s say, your parents, so we would\nlike the same with all our hearts ... and not just anyhow! [Bows].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But what is it about? What do you want?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. It\'s to your honour we\'ve come\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Enter Petr\xc3\xadstchef briskly, in fur-lined overcoat.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Is Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch awake yet? [Seeing Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch,\nbows, moving only his head].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. You have come to see my son?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. I? Yes, just to see Vovo for a moment.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Step in, step in.\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef takes off his overcoat and walks in briskly. Exit.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [to Peasants] Well, what is it you want?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Please accept our presents!\n\nFIRST PEASANT [smiling] That\'s to say, the peasants\' offerings.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say no more about it; what\'s the good? We wish you the\nsame as if you were our own father! Say no more about it!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. All right. Here, Theodore, take these.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to Peasants] Give them here. [Takes the presents].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, what is the business?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. We\'ve come to your honour\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I see you have; but what do you want?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. It\'s about making a move towards completing the sale of\nthe land. It comes to this\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Do you mean to buy the land?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. It comes to this ... I mean the buying of\nthe property of the land. The Commune has given us, let\'s say, the power\nof atturning, to enter, let\'s say, as is lawful, through the Government\nbank, with a stamp for the lawful amount.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. You mean that you want to buy the land through the\nland-bank.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. Just as you offered it to us last year.\nIt comes to this, then, the whole sum in full for the buying of the\nproperty of the land is 32,864 roubles.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. That\'s all right, but how about paying up?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. As to the payment, the Commune offers just as it was said\nlast year--to pay in \'stalments, and your receipt of the ready money by\nlawful regulations, 4000 roubles in full.[2]\n\n  [2] The present value of the rouble is rather over two shillings and\n  one penny.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Take 4000 now, and wait for the rest of the money.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [unwrapping a parcel of money] And about this be quite\neasy. We should pawn our own selves rather than do such a thing just\nanyhow say, but in this way, let\'s say, as it ought to be done.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But did I not write and tell you that I should not\nagree to it unless you brought the whole sum?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. It would be more agreeable, but it is not\nin our possibilities, I mean.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well then, the thing can\'t be done!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. The Commune, for example, relied its hopes on that, that\nyou made the offer last year to sell it in easy \'stalments\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. That was last year. I would have agreed to it then,\nbut now I can\'t.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But how\'s that? We\'ve been depending on your\npromise--we\'ve got the papers ready and have collected the money!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Be merciful, master! We\'re short of land; we\'ll say\nnothing about cattle, but even a hen, let\'s say, we\'ve no room to keep.\n[Bows] Don\'t wrong us, master! [Bows].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Of course it\'s quite true, that I agreed last year to\nlet you have the land for payment by instalments, but now circumstances\nare such that it would be inconvenient.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Without this land we cannot live!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. Without land our lives must grow weaker\nand come to a decline.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [bowing] Master, we have so little land, let\'s not talk\nabout the cattle, but even a chicken, let\'s say, we\'ve no room for.\nMaster, be merciful, accept the money, master!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [examining the document] I quite understand, and\nshould like to help you. Wait a little; I will give you an answer in\nhalf-an-hour.... Theodore, say I am engaged and am not to be disturbed.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, sir. [Exit Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch].\n\n    The Peasants look dejected.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Here\'s a go! "Give me the whole sum," he says. And where\nare we to get it from?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If he had not given us hopes, for example. As it is we\nfelt quite insured it would be as was said last year.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord! and I had begun unwrapping the money. [Begins\nwrapping up the bundle of bank-notes again] What are we to do now?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What is your business, then?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Our business, respected sir, depends in this. Last year\nhe made us the offer of our buying the land in \'stalments. The Commune\nentered upon these terms and gave us the powers of atturning, and now\nd\'you see he makes the offering that we should pay the whole in full!\nAnd as it turns out, the business is no ways convenient for us.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What is the whole sum?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. The whole sum in readiness is 4000 roubles, you see.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, what of that? Make an effort and collect more.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Such as it is, it was collected with much effort. We\nhave, so to say, in this sense, not got ammunition enough.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You can\'t get blood out of a stone.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. We\'d be glad with all our hearts, but we have swept even\nthis together, as you might say, with a broom.\n\n    Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch and Petr\xc3\xadstchef appear in the doorway both smoking\n    cigarettes.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. I have told you already I\'ll do my best, so of\ncourse I will do all that is possible! Eh, what?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. You must just understand that if you do not get it, the\ndevil only knows what a mess we shall be in!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. But I\'ve already said I\'ll do my best, and so I will.\nEh, what?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Nothing. I only say, get some at any cost. I will wait.\n\n    Exit into Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s room, closing door.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [waving his arm] It\'s a deuce of a go! [The Peasants\nbow].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [looking at Porter, to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] Why don\'t\nyou attend to this fellow from Bourdier? He hasn\'t come to take lodgings\nwith us, has he? Just look, he is asleep! Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. The note he brought has been sent in, and he has been\ntold to wait until Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna comes down.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [looks at Peasants and notices the money] And what is\nthis? Money? For whom? Is it for us? [To Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] Who are\nthey?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. They are peasants from Koursk. They are buying land.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Has it been sold them?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. No, they have not yet come to any agreement. They are\ntoo stingy.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Eh? Well, we must try and persuade them. [To the\nPeasants] Here, I say, are you buying land? Eh?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. We have made an offering as how we should\nlike to acquire the possession of the land.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Then you should not be so stingy, you know. Just let\nme tell you how necessary land is to peasants! Eh, what? It\'s very\nnecessary, isn\'t it?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. The land appears as the very first and\nforemost necessity to a peasant. That\'s just it.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Then why be so stingy? Just you think what land is!\nWhy, one can sow wheat on it in rows! I tell you, you could get eighty\nbushels of wheat, at a rouble and a half a bushel--that would be 120\nroubles. Eh, what? Or else mint! I tell you, you could collar 400\nroubles off an acre by sowing mint!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. All sorts of producks one could put into\naction if one had the right understanding.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Mint! Decidedly mint! I have learnt about it, you\nknow. It\'s all printed in books. I can show them you. Eh, what?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it, all concerns are clearer to you through\nyour books. That\'s learnedness, of course.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Then pay up and don\'t be stingy. [To Theodore\nIv\xc3\xa1nitch] Where\'s papa?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. He gave orders not to be disturbed just now.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Oh, I suppose he\'s consulting a spirit whether to\nsell the land or not? Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I can\'t say. All I know is that he went away\nundecided about it.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. What d\'you think, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, is he flush of\ncash? Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I don\'t know. I hardly think so. But what does it\nmatter to you? You drew a good sum not more than a week ago.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. But didn\'t I pay for those dogs? And now, you know,\nthere\'s our new Society, and Petr\xc3\xadstchef has been chosen, and I had\nborrowed money from Petr\xc3\xadstchef and must pay the subscription both for\nhim and for myself. Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. And what is this new Society? A Cycling Club?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. No. Just let me tell you. It is quite a new Society.\nIt is a very serious Society, you know. And who do you think is\nPresident? Eh, what?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What\'s the object of this new Society?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. It is a "Society to Promote the Breeding of Pure-bred\nRussian Hounds." Eh, what? And I\'ll tell you, they\'re having the first\nmeeting and a lunch, to-day. And I\'ve no money. I\'ll go to him and have\na try! [Exit through study door].\n\nFIRST PEASANT [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] And who might he be, respected sir?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [smiles] The young master.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. The heir, so to say. Oh Lord! [puts away the money] I\'d\nbetter hide it meanwhile.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And we were told he was in military service, in the\ncav\'rely, for example.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. No, as an only son he is exempt from military\nservice.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Left for to keep his parents, so to say! That\'s right!\n\nSECOND PEASANT [shaking his head] He\'s the right sort. He\'ll feed them\nfinely!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\n    Enter Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch followed by Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. That\'s always the way. It\'s really surprising! First\nI\'m asked why I have no occupation, and now when I have found a field\nand am occupied, when a Society with serious and noble aims has been\nfounded, I can\'t even have 300 roubles to go on with!...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I tell you I can\'t do it, and I can\'t! I haven\'t got\nit.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Why, you have just sold some land.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. In the first place I have not sold it! And above all,\ndo leave me in peace! Weren\'t you told I was engaged? [Exit, slamming\ndoor].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I told you this was not the right moment.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Well, I say! Here\'s a position to be in! I\'ll go and\nsee mamma--that\'s my only hope. He\'s going crazy over his spiritualism\nand forgets everything else. [Goes upstairs].\n\n    Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch takes newspaper and is just going to sit down,\n    when Betsy and M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna, followed by Gregory, come down\n    the stairs.\n\nBETSY. Is the carriage ready?\n\nGREGORY. Just coming to the door.\n\nBETSY [to M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna] Come along, come along, I know it is he.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. Which he?\n\nBETSY. You know very well whom I mean--Petr\xc3\xadstchef, of course.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. But where is he?\n\nBETSY. Sitting in Vovo\'s room. You\'ll see!\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. And suppose it is not he? [The Peasants and Porter\nbow].\n\nBETSY [to Porter] You brought a dress from Bourdier\'s?\n\nPORTER. Yes, Miss. May I go?\n\nBETSY. Well, I don\'t know. Ask my mother.\n\nPORTER. I don\'t know whose it is, Miss; I was ordered to bring it here\nand receive the money.\n\nBETSY. Well then, wait.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. Is it still that costume for the charade?\n\nBETSY. Yes, a charming costume. But mamma won\'t take it or pay for it.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. But why not?\n\nBETSY. You\'d better ask mamma. She doesn\'t grudge Vovo 500 roubles for\nhis dogs, but 100 is too much for a dress. I can\'t act dressed like a\nscarecrow. [Pointing to Peasants] And who are these?\n\nGREGORY. Peasants who have come to buy some land or other.\n\nBETSY. And I thought they were the beaters. Are you not beaters?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. No, no, lady. We have come to see Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch about\nthe signing into our possession of the title-deeds to some land.\n\nBETSY. Then how is it? Vovo was expecting some beaters who were to come\nto-day. Are you sure you are not the beaters? [The Peasants are silent]\nHow stupid they are! [Goes to Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s door] Vovo? [Laughs].\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. But we met him just now upstairs!\n\nBETSY. Why need you remember that? Vovo, are you there?\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef enters.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Vovo is not here, but I am prepared to fulfil on his behalf\nanything that may be required. How do you do? How do you do, M\xc3\xa1rya\nKonstant\xc3\xadnovna? [Shakes hands long and violently with Betsy, and then\nwith M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. See, it\'s as if he were pumping water!\n\nBETSY. You can\'t replace him,--still you\'re better than nobody. [Laughs]\nWhat are these affairs of yours with Vovo?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. What affairs? Our affairs are fie-nancial, that is, our\nbusiness is fie! It\'s also nancial, and besides it is financial.\n\nBETSY. What does nancial mean?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. What a question! It means nothing, that\'s just the point.\n\nBETSY. No, no, you have missed fire. [Laughs].\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. One can\'t always hit the mark, you know. It\'s something\nlike a lottery. Blanks and blanks again, and at last you win! [Theodore\nIv\xc3\xa1nitch goes into the study].\n\nBETSY. Well, this was blank then; but tell me, were you at the\nMerg\xc3\xa1sofs\' last night?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Not exactly at the _M\xc3\xa8re_ G\xc3\xa1sof\'s, but rather at the _P\xc3\xa8re_\nG\xc3\xa1sof\'s, or better still, at the _Fils_ G\xc3\xa1sof\'s.\n\nBETSY. You can\'t do without puns. It\'s an illness. And were the Gypsies\nthere?[3] [Laughs].\n\n  [3] The Gypsy choirs are very popular in Moscow.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [sings] "On their aprons silken threads, little birds with\ngolden heads!"\xc2\xa0...\n\nBETSY. Happy mortals! And we were yawning at Fofo\'s.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [continues to sing] "And she promised and she swore, She\nwould ope\' her ... her ... her\xc2\xa0..." how does it go on, M\xc3\xa1rya\nKonstant\xc3\xadnovna?\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. "Closet door."\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. How? What? How, M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna?\n\nBETSY. _Cessez, vous devenez impossible!_[4]\n\n  [4] BETSY. Cease! You are becoming quite unbearable!\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. _J\'ai cess\xc3\xa9, j\'ai b\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9, j\'ai d\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9...._[5]\n\n  [5] PETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. I have C said (_ceased_), B said, and D said.\n\nBETSY. I see the only way to rid ourselves of your wit is to make you\nsing! Let us go into Vovo\'s room, his guitar is there. Come, M\xc3\xa1rya\nKonstant\xc3\xadnovna, come! [Exeunt Betsy, M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna, and\nPetr\xc3\xadstchef].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Who be they?\n\nGREGORY. One is our young lady, the other is a girl who teaches her\nmusic.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Administrates learning, so to say. And ain\'t she smart? A\nreg\'lar picture!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why don\'t they marry her? She is old enough, I should\nsay.\n\nGREGORY. Do you think it\'s the same as among you peasants,--marry at\nfifteen?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And that man, for example, is he also in the musitional\nline?\n\nGREGORY [mimicking him] "Musitional" indeed! You don\'t understand\nanything!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. And stupidity, one might say, is our\nignorance.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord! [Gipsy songs and guitar accompaniment are heard\nfrom Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s room].\n\n    Enter Simon, followed by T\xc3\xa1nya, who watches the meeting between\n    father and son.\n\nGREGORY [to Simon] What do you want?\n\nSIMON. I have been to Mr. Kaptch\xc3\xadtch.\n\nGREGORY. Well, and what\'s the answer?\n\nSIMON. He sent word he couldn\'t possibly come to-night.\n\nGREGORY. All right, I\'ll let them know. [Exit].\n\nSIMON [to his father] How d\'you do, father! My respects to Daddy Ef\xc3\xadm\nand Daddy M\xc3\xadtry! How are all at home?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Very well, Simon.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. How d\'you do, lad?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. How d\'you do, sonny?\n\nSIMON [smiles] Well, come along, father, and have some tea.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Wait till we\'ve finished our business. Don\'t you see we\nare not ready yet?\n\nSIMON. Well, I\'ll wait for you by the porch. [Wishes to go away].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [running after him] I say, why didn\'t you tell him anything?\n\nSIMON. How could I before all those people? Give me time, I\'ll tell him\nover our tea. [Exit].\n\n    Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch enters and sits down by the window.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Respected sir, how\'s our business proceeding?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Wait a bit, he\'ll be out presently, he\'s just\nfinishing.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] And how do you know, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, he\nis finishing?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I know that when he has finished questioning, he\nreads the question and answer aloud.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Can one really talk with spirits by means of a saucer?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. It seems so.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But supposing they tell him to sign, will he sign?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Of course he will.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But they do not speak with words?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Oh, yes. By means of the alphabet. He notices at\nwhich letter the saucer stops.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, but at a si-ance?...\n\n    Enter Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, friends, I can\'t do it! I should be very glad\nto, but it is quite impossible. If it were for ready money it would be a\ndifferent matter.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. What more could any one desire? But the\npeople are so inpennycuous--it is quite impossible!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, I can\'t do it, I really can\'t. Here is your\ndocument; I can\'t sign it.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Show some pity, master; be merciful!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. How can you act so? It is doing us a wrong.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Nothing wrong about it, friends. I offered it you in\nsummer, but then you did not agree; and now I can\'t agree to it.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Master, be merciful! How are we to get along? We have so\nlittle land. We\'ll say nothing about the cattle; a hen, let\'s say,\nthere\'s no room to let a hen run about.\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch goes up to the door and stops. Enter, descending\n    the staircase, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna and doctor, followed by Vas\xc3\xadly\n    Leon\xc3\xadditch, who is in a merry and playful mood and is putting some\n    bank-notes into his purse.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [tightly laced, and wearing a bonnet] Then I am to take\nit?\n\nDOCTOR. If the symptoms recur you must certainly take it, but above all,\nyou must behave better. How can you expect thick syrup to pass through a\nthin little hair tube, especially when we squeeze the tube? It\'s\nimpossible; and so it is with the biliary duct. It\'s simple enough.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. All right, all right!\n\nDOCTOR. Yes, "All right, all right," and you go on in the same old way.\nIt won\'t do, madam--it won\'t do. Well, good-bye!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. No, not good-bye, only _au revoir_! For I still expect\nyou to-night. I shall not be able to make up my mind without you.\n\nDOCTOR. All right, if I have time I\'ll pop in. [Exit].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [noticing the Peasants] What\'s this? What? What people are\nthese? [Peasants bow].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. These are peasants from Koursk, come to see Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch about the sale of some land.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I see they are peasants, but who let them in?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch gave the order. He has just been\nspeaking to them about the sale of the land.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What sale? There is no need to sell any. But above all,\nhow can one let in people from the street into the house? One can\'t let\npeople in from the street! One can\'t let people into the house who have\nspent the night heaven knows where!... [Getting more and more excited] I\ndaresay every fold of their clothes is full of microbes--of\nscarlet-fever microbes, of smallpox microbes, of diphtheria microbes!\nWhy, they are from Koursk Government, where there is an epidemic of\ndiphtheria ... Doctor! Doctor! Call the doctor back!\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch goes into his room and shuts the door. Gregory\n    goes to recall the Doctor.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [smokes at the Peasants] Never mind, mamma; if you\nlike I\'ll fumigate them so that all the microbes will go to pot! Eh,\nwhat?\n\n    Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna remains severely silent, awaiting the Doctor\'s return.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [to Peasants] And do you fatten pigs? There\'s a\nfirst-rate business!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. We do go in for the pig-fattening line\nnow and then.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. This kind?... [Grunts like a pig].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Vovo, Vovo, leave off!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Isn\'t it like? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. It\'s very resemblant.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Vovo, leave off, I tell you!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. What\'s it all about?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. I said, we\'d better go to some lodging meanwhile!\n\n    Enter Doctor and Gregory.\n\nDOCTOR. What\'s the matter? What\'s happened?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Why, you\'re always saying I must not get excited. Now,\nhow is it possible to keep calm? I do not see my own sister for two\nmonths, and am careful about any doubtful visitor--and here are people\nfrom Koursk, straight from Koursk, where there is an epidemic of\ndiphtheria, right in my house!\n\nDOCTOR. These good fellows you mean, I suppose?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Of course. Straight from a diphtheric place!\n\nDOCTOR. Well, of course, if they come from an infected place it is rash;\nbut still there is no reason to excite yourself so much about it.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. But don\'t you yourself advise carefulness?\n\nDOCTOR. Of course, of course. Still, why excite yourself?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. How can I help it? Now we shall have to have the house\ncompletely disinfected.\n\nDOCTOR. Oh no! Why completely? That would cost 300 roubles or more.\nI\'ll arrange it cheaply and well for you. Take, to a large bottle of\nwater\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Boiled?\n\nDOCTOR. It\'s all the same. Boiled would be better. To one bottle of\nwater take a tablespoon of salicylic acid, and have everything they have\ncome in contact with washed with the solution. As to the fellows\nthemselves, they must be off, of course. That\'s all. Then you\'re quite\nsafe. And it would do no harm to sprinkle some of the same solution\nthrough a spray--two or three tumblers--you\'ll see how well it will act.\nNo danger whatever!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. T\xc3\xa1nya! Where is T\xc3\xa1nya?\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Did you call, M\'m?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You know that big bottle in my dressing-room?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Out of which we sprinkled the laundress yesterday?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, of course! What other bottle could I mean? Well\nthen, take that bottle and first wash with soap the place where they\nhave been standing, and then with\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, M\'m; I know how.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. And then take the spray ... However, I had better do that\nmyself when I get back.\n\nDOCTOR. Well then, do so, and don\'t be afraid! Well, _au revoir_ till\nthis evening. [Exit].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. And they must be off! Not a trace of them must remain!\nGet out, get out! Go--what are you looking at?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. It\'s because of our stupidity, as we were\ninstructed\xc2\xa0...\n\nGREGORY [pushes the Peasants out] There, there; be off!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Let me have my handkerchief back! [The handkerchief in\nwhich the presents were wrapped].\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord, oh Lord! didn\'t I say--some lodging-house\nmeanwhile!\n\n    Gregory pushes him out. Exeunt Peasants.\n\nPORTER [who has repeatedly tried to say something] Will there be any\nanswer?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Ah, from Bourdier? [Excitedly] None! None! You can take\nit back. I told her I never ordered such a costume, and I will not allow\nmy daughter to wear it!\n\nPORTER. I know nothing about it. I was sent\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Go, go, take it back! I will call myself about it!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [solemnly] Sir Messenger from Bourdier, depart!\n\nPORTER. I might have been told that long ago. I have sat here nearly\nfive hours!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Ambassador from Bourdier, begone!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Cease, please!\n\n    Exit Porter.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Betsy! Where is she? I always have to wait for her.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [shouting at the top of his voice] Betsy! Petr\xc3\xadstchef!\nCome quick, quick, quick! Eh? What?\n\n    Enter Petr\xc3\xadstchef, Betsy, and M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You always keep one waiting!\n\nBETSY. On the contrary, I was waiting for you!\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef bows with his head only, then kisses Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\'s\n    hand.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. How d\'you do! [To Betsy] You always have an answer ready!\n\nBETSY. If you are upset, mamma, I had better not go.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Are we going or not?\n\nBETSY. Well, let us go; it can\'t be helped.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Did you see the man from Bourdier?\n\nBETSY. Yes, and I was very glad. I ordered the costume, and am going to\nwear it when it is paid for.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I am not going to pay for a costume that is indecent!\n\nBETSY. Why has it become indecent? First it was decent, and now you have\na fit of prudery.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Not prudery at all! If the bodice were completely\naltered, then it would do.\n\nBETSY. Mamma, that is quite impossible.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, get dressed. [They sit down. Gregory puts on their\nover-shoes for them].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna, do you notice a vacuum in the\nhall?\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. What is it? [Laughs in anticipation].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Bourdier\'s man has gone! Eh, what? Good, eh? [Laughs\nloudly].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, let us go. [Goes out of the door, but returns at\nonce] T\xc3\xa1nya!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, M\'m?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Don\'t let Frisk catch cold while I am away. If she wants\nto be let out, put on her little yellow cloak. She is not quite well\nto-day.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, M\'m.\n\n    Exeunt Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, Betsy, and Gregory.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Well, have you got it?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Not without trouble, I can tell you! First I rushed\nat the gov\'nor; he began to bellow and turned me out. Off to the\nmater--I got it out of her. It\'s here! [Slaps his breast pocket] If once\nI make up my mind, there\'s no getting away from me. I have a deadly\ngrip! Eh, what? And d\'you know, my wolf-hounds are coming to-day.\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch put on their outdoor things and go\n    out. T\xc3\xa1nya follows.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [alone] Yes, nothing but unpleasantness. How is it\nthey can\'t live in peace? But one must say the new generation are\nnot--the thing. And as to the women\'s dominion!... Why, Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch just now was going to put in a word, but seeing what a frenzy\nshe was in--slammed the door behind him. He is a wonderfully\nkind-hearted man. Yes, wonderfully kind. What\'s this? Here\'s T\xc3\xa1nya\nbringing them back again!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Come in, come in, grand-dads, never mind!\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya and the Peasants.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Why have you brought them back?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, we must do something about their\nbusiness. I shall have to wash the place anyhow.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But the business will not come off, I see that\nalready.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. How could we best put our affair into action, respected\nsir? Your reverence might take a little trouble over it, and we should\ngive you full thankings from the Commune for your trouble.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Do try, honey! We can\'t live! We have so little land.\nTalk of cattle--why, we have no room to keep a hen! [They bow].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I am sorry for you, friends, but I can\'t think of any\nway to help you. I understand your case very well, but he has refused.\nSo what can one do? Besides, the lady is also against it. Well, give me\nyour papers--I\'ll try and see what I can do, but I hardly hope to\nsucceed. [Exit].\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya and the three Peasants sigh.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But tell me, grand-dads, what is it that is wanted?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Why, only that he should put his signature to our\ndocument.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. That the master should sign? Is that all?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Yes, only lay his signature on the deed and take the\nmoney, and there would be an end of the matter.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. He only has to write and sign, as the peasants, let\'s\nsay, desire, so, let\'s say, I also desire. That\'s the whole affair--if\nhe\'d only take it and sign it, it\'s all done.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [considering] He need only sign the paper and it\'s done?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just so. The whole matter is in dependence on\nthat, and nothing else. Let him sign, and we ask no more.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Just wait and see what Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch will say. If he cannot\npersuade the master, I\'ll try something.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Get round him, will you?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I\'ll try.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Ay, the lass is going to bestir herself. Only get the\nthing settled, and the Commune will bind itself to keep you all your\nlife. See there, now!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If the affair can be put into action, truly we might put\nher in a gold frame.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That goes without saying!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I can\'t promise for certain, but as the saying is: "An attempt is\nno sin, if you try\xc2\xa0..."\n\nFIRST PEASANT. "You may win." That\'s just so.\n\n    Enter Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. No, friends, it\'s no go! He has not done it, and he\nwon\'t do it. Here, take your document. You may go.\n\nFIRST PEASANT [gives T\xc3\xa1nya the paper] Then it\'s on you we pin all our\nreliance, for example.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, yes! You go into the street, and I\'ll run out to you in a\nminute and have a word with you.\n\n    Exeunt Peasants.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, ask the master to come\nout and speak to me for a moment. I have something to say to him.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What next?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I must, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch. Ask him, do; there\'s nothing wrong\nabout it, on my sacred word.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But what do you want with him?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. That\'s a little secret. I will tell you later on, only ask him.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [smiling] I can\'t think what you are up to! All right,\nI\'ll go and ask him. [Exit].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I\'ll do it! Didn\'t he say himself that there is that power in\nSimon? And I know how to manage. No one found me out that time, and now\nI\'ll teach Simon what to do. If it doesn\'t succeed it\'s no great matter.\nAfter all it\'s not a sin.\n\n    Enter Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch followed by Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [smiling] Is this the petitioner? Well, what is your\nbusiness?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s a little secret, Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch; let me tell it you\nalone.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. What is it? Theodore, leave us for a minute.\n\n    Exit Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. As I have grown up and lived in your house, Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch,\nand as I am very grateful to you for everything, I shall open my heart\nto you as to a father. Simon, who is living in your house, wants to\nmarry me.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. So that\'s it!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I open my heart to you as to a father! I have no one to advise\nme, being an orphan.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, and why not? He seems a nice lad.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, that\'s true. He would be all right; there is only one thing\nI have my doubts about. It\'s something about him that I have noticed and\ncan\'t make out ... perhaps it is something bad.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. What is it? Does he drink?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. God forbid! But since I know that there is such a thing as\nspiritalism\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Ah, you know that?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Of course! I understand it very well. Some, of course, through\nignorance, don\'t understand it.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, what then?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I am very much afraid for Simon. It does happen to him.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. What happens to him?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Something of a kind like spiritalism. You ask any of the\nservants. As soon as he gets drowsy at the table, the table begins to\ntremble, and creak like that: _tuke, ... tuke_! All the servants have\nheard it.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Why, it\'s the very thing I was saying to Serg\xc3\xa9y\nIv\xc3\xa1nitch this morning! Yes?...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Or else ... when was it?... Oh yes, last Wednesday. We sat down\nto dinner, and the spoon just jumps into his hand of itself!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Ah, that is interesting! Jumps into his hand? When he\nwas drowsing?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. That I didn\'t notice. I think he was, though.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes?...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. And that\'s what I\'m afraid of, and what I wanted to ask you\nabout. May not some harm come of it? To live one\'s life together, and\nhim having such a thing in him!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [smiling] No, you need not be afraid, there is nothing\nbad in that. It only proves him to be a _medium_--simply a medium. I\nknew him to be a medium before this.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. So that\'s what it is! And I was afraid!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. No, there\'s nothing to be afraid of. [Aside]. That\'s\ncapital! Kaptch\xc3\xadtch can\'t come, so we will test him to-night.... [To\nT\xc3\xa1nya] No, my dear, don\'t be afraid, he will be a good husband and ...\nthat is only a kind of special power, and every one has it, only in some\nit is weaker and in others stronger.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Thank you, sir. Now I shan\'t think any more about it; but I was\nso frightened.... What a thing it is, our want of education!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. No, no, don\'t be frightened... Theodore!\n\n    Enter Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I am going out now. Get everything ready for\nto-night\'s s\xc3\xa9ance.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But Mr. Kaptch\xc3\xadtch is not coming.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. That does not matter. [Puts on overcoat] We shall\nhave a trial s\xc3\xa9ance with our own medium. [Exit. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch goes\nout with him].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [alone] He believes it! He believes it! [Shrieks and jumps with\njoy] He really believes it! Isn\'t it wonderful! [Shrieks] Now I\'ll do\nit, if only Simon has pluck for it!\n\n    Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch returns.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, have you told him your secret?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I\'ll tell you too, only later on.... But I have a favour to ask\nof you too, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes? What is it?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [shyly] You have been a second father to me, and I will open my\nheart before you as before God.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Don\'t beat about the bush, but come straight to the\npoint.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. The point is ... well, the point is, that Simon wants to marry\nme.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Is that it? I thought I noticed\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, why should I hide it? I am an orphan, and you know yourself\nhow matters are in these town establishments. Every one comes bothering;\nthere\'s that Gregory Mih\xc3\xa1ylitch, for instance, he gives me no peace. And\nalso that other one ... you know. They think I have no soul, and am only\nhere for their amusement.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Good girl, that\'s right! Well, what then?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, Simon wrote to his father; and he, his father, sees me\nto-day, and says: "He\'s spoilt"--he means his son. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch\n[bows], take the place of a father to me, speak to the old man,--to\nSimon\'s father! I could take them into the kitchen, and you might come\nin and speak to the old man!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [smiling] Then I am to turn match-maker--am I? Well, I\ncan do that.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, dearest, be a father to me, and I\'ll pray for\nyou all my life long.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. All right, all right, I\'ll come later on. Haven\'t I\npromised? [Takes up newspaper].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. You are a second father to me!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. All right, all right.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Then I\'ll rely on you. [Exit].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [alone, shaking his head] A good affectionate girl. To\nthink that so many like her perish! Get but once into trouble and she\'ll\ngo from hand to hand until she sinks into the mire, and can never be\nfound again! There was that dear little Nataly. She, too, was a good\ngirl, reared and cared for by a mother. [Takes up paper] Well, let\'s see\nwhat tricks Ferdinand is up to in Bulgaria.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n    Evening of the same day. The scene represents the interior of the\n    servants\' kitchen. The Peasants have taken off their outer garments\n    and sit drinking tea at the table, and perspiring. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch\n    is smoking a cigar at the other side of the stage. The discharged\n    Cook is lying on the brick oven, and is unseen during the early part\n    of the scene.\n\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. My advice is, don\'t hinder him! If it\'s his wish and\nhers, in Heaven\'s name let him do it. She is a good, honest girl. Never\nmind her being a bit dressy; she can\'t help that, living in town: she is\na good girl all the same.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, of course, if it is his wish, let him! _He\'ll_\nhave to live with her, not me. But she\'s certainly uncommon spruce.\nHow\'s one to take her into one\'s hut? Why, she\'ll not let her\nmother-in-law so much as pat her on the head.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. That does not depend on the spruceness, but on\ncharacter. If her nature is good, she\'s sure to be docile and\nrespectful.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Ah, well, we\'ll have her if the lad\'s bent on having\nher. After all, it\'s a bad job to live with one as one don\'t care for.\nI\'ll consult my missus, and then may Heaven bless them!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Then let\'s shake hands on it!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, it seems it will have to come off.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Eh, Zachary! fortune\'s a-smiling on you! You\'ve come to\naccomplish a piece of business, and just see what a duchess of a\ndaughter-in-law you\'ve obtained. All that\'s left to be done is to have\na drink on it, and then it will be all in order.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. That\'s not at all necessary. [An awkward silence].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I know something of your way of life too, you know. I\nam even thinking of purchasing a bit of land, building a cottage, and\nworking on the land myself somewhere: maybe in your neighbourhood.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. A very good thing too.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. When one has got the money one can get\nall kinds of pleasure in the country.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Say no more about it! Country life, let\'s say, is freer\nin every way, not like the town!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. There now, would you let me join your Commune if I\nsettled among you?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why not? If you stand drink for the Elders, they\'ll\naccept you soon enough!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And if you open a public-house, for example, or an inn,\nwhy, you\'d have such a life you\'d never need to die! You might live like\na king, and no mistake.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, we\'ll see. I should certainly like to have a\nfew quiet years in my old age. Though my life here is good enough, and I\nshould be sorry to leave. Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch is an exceedingly\nkind-hearted man.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. But how about our business? Is it\npossible that he is going to leave it without any termination?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. He\'d do it willingly.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. It seems he\'s afraid of his wife.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. It\'s not that he\'s afraid, but they don\'t hit things\noff together.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. But you should try, father! How are we to live else?\nWe\'ve so little land\xc2\xa0...\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. We\'ll see what comes of T\xc3\xa1nya\'s attempt. She\'s taken\nthe business into her hands now!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [takes a sip of tea] Father, be merciful. We\'ve so little\nland. A hen, let\'s say, we\'ve no room for a hen, let alone the cattle.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. If the business depended on me.... [To Second\nPeasant] Well, friend, so we\'ve done our bit of match-making! It\'s\nagreed then about T\xc3\xa1nya?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. I\'ve given my word, and I\'ll not go back on it without a\ngood reason. If only our business succeeds!\n\n    Enter Servants\' Cook who looks up at the oven, makes a sign, and\n    then begins to speak animatedly to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Just now Simon was called upstairs from the front\nkitchen! The master and that other bald-headed one who calls up spirits\nwith him, ordered him to sit down and take the place of Kaptch\xc3\xadtch!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. You don\'t say so!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Yes, Jacob told T\xc3\xa1nya.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Extraordinary!\n\n    Enter Coachman.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What do you want?\n\nCOACHMAN [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] You may just tell them I never agreed to\nlive with a lot of dogs! Let any one who likes do it, but I will never\nagree to live among dogs!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What dogs?\n\nCOACHMAN. Three dogs have been sent into our room by Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch!\nThey\'ve messed it all over. They\'re whining, and if one comes near them\nthey bite--the devils! They\'d tear you to pieces if you didn\'t mind.\nI\'ve a good mind to take a club and smash their legs for them!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But when did they come?\n\nCOACHMAN. Why, to-day, from the Dog Show; the devil knows what kind they\nare, but they\'re an expensive sort. Are we or the dogs to live in the\ncoachmen\'s quarters? You just go and ask!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, that will never do. I\'ll go and ask about it.\n\nCOACHMAN. They\'d better be brought here to Louk\xc3\xa9rya.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK [angrily] People have to eat here, and you\'d like to lock\ndogs in here! As it is\xc2\xa0...\n\nCOACHMAN. And I\'ve got the liveries, and the sledge-covers and the\nharness there, and they expect things kept clean! Perhaps the porter\'s\nlodge might do.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I must ask Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch.\n\nCOACHMAN [angrily] He\'d better hang the brutes round his neck and lug\nthem about with him! But no fear: he\'d rather ride on horseback himself.\nIt\'s he as spoilt Beauty without rhyme or reason. That was a horse!...\nOh dear! what a life! [Exit, slamming door].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. That\'s not right! Certainly not right! [To Peasants]\nWell then, it\'s time we were saying good-bye, friends.\n\nPEASANTS. Good-bye!\n\n    Exit Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\n    As soon as he is gone a sound of groaning is heard from the top of\n    the oven.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. He\'s sleek, that one; looks like a general.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Rather! Why, he has a room all to himself; he gets his\nwashing, his tea and sugar, and food from the master\'s table.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK [on the oven]. Why shouldn\'t the old beggar live well?\nHe\'s lined his pockets all right!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Who\'s that up there, on the oven?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Oh, it\'s only a man.\n\n    Silence.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, and you too, as I noticed a while since when you\nwere supping, have capital food to eat.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. We can\'t complain. She\'s not mean about the food. We\nhave wheat bread every Sunday, and fish when a holiday happens to be a\nfast-day too, and those who like may eat meat.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And does any one tuck into flesh on fast-days?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Oh, they nearly all do! Only the old coachman--not the\none who was here just now but the old one--and Simon, and I and the\nhousekeeper, fast--all the others eat meat.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And the master himself?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Catch him! Why, I bet he\'s forgotten there is such a\nthing as fasting!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s the gentlefolks\' way: they have got it all out of\ntheir books. \'Cos of their intelex!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Shouldn\'t wonder if they feed on wheat bread every day!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Wheat bread indeed! Much they think of wheat bread! You\nshould see what food they eat. No end of different things!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. In course gentlefolks\' food is of an airial kind.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Airial, of course, but all the same they\'re good at\nstuffing themselves, they are!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Have healthy appekites, so to say.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. \'Cos they always rinse it down! All with sweet wines,\nand spirits, and fizzy liquors. They have a different one to suit every\nkind of food. They eat and rinse it down, and eat and rinse it down,\nthey do.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And so the food\'s floated down in proportion, so to say.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Ah yes, they are good at stuffing! It\'s awful! You see,\nit\'s not just sitting down, eating, then saying grace and going\naway--they\'re always at it!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Like pigs with their feet in the trough! [Peasants\nlaugh].\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. As soon as, by God\'s grace, they have opened their eyes,\nthe samov\xc3\xa1r is brought in--tea, coffee, chocolate. Hardly is the second\nsamov\xc3\xa1r emptied, a third has to be set. Then lunch, then dinner, then\nagain coffee. They\'ve hardly left off, then comes tea, and all sorts of\ntit-bits and sweetmeats--there\'s never an end to it! They even lie in\nbed and eat!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. There now; that\'s good! [Laughs].\n\nFIRST AND SECOND PEASANTS. What are you about?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. If I could only live a single day like that!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But when do they do their work?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Work indeed! What is their work? Cards and piano--that\'s\nall their work. The young lady used to sit down to the piano as soon as\nshe opened her eyes, and off she\'d go! And that other one who lives\nhere, the teacher, stands and waits. "When will the piano be free?" When\none has finished, off rattles the other, and sometimes they\'d put two\npianos near one another and four of \'em would bust out at once. Bust out\nin such a manner, you could hear \'em down here!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Well, and that\'s all the work they do! Piano or cards!\nAs soon as they have met together--cards, wine, smoking, and so on all\nnight long. And as soon as they are up: eating again!\n\n    Enter Simon.\n\nSIMON. Hope you\'re enjoying your tea!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Come and join us.\n\nSIMON [comes up to the table] Thank you kindly. [First Peasant pours out\na cup of tea for him].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Where have you been?\n\nSIMON. Upstairs.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, and what was being done there?\n\nSIMON. Why, I couldn\'t make it out at all! I don\'t know how to explain\nit.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But what was it?\n\nSIMON. I can\'t explain it. They have been trying some kind of strength\nin me. I can\'t make it out. T\xc3\xa1nya says, "Do it, and we\'ll get the land\nfor our peasants; he\'ll sell it them."\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But how is she going to manage it?\n\nSIMON. I can\'t make it out, and she won\'t say. She says, "Do as I tell\nyou," and that\'s all.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But what is it you have to do?\n\nSIMON. Nothing just now. They made me sit down, put out the lights and\ntold me to sleep. And T\xc3\xa1nya had hidden herself there. They didn\'t see\nher, but I did.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why? What for?\n\nSIMON. The Lord only knows--I can\'t make it out.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Naturally it is for the distraction of time.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Well, it\'s clear you and I can make nothing of it. You\nhad better tell me whether you have taken all your wages yet.\n\nSIMON. No, I\'ve not drawn any. I have twenty-eight roubles to the good,\nI think.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That\'s all right! Well, if God grants that we get the\nland, I\'ll take you home, Simon.\n\nSIMON. With all my heart!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You\'ve got spoilt, I should say. You\'ll not want to\nplough?\n\nSIMON. Plough? Only give me the chance! Plough or mow,--I\'m game. Those\nare things one doesn\'t forget.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. But it don\'t seem very desirous after town life, for\nexample? Eh!\n\nSIMON. It\'s good enough for me. One can live in the country too.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And Daddy M\xc3\xadtry here, is already on the look-out for your\nplace; he\'s hankering after a life of luckshury!\n\nSIMON. Eh, Daddy M\xc3\xadtry, you\'d soon get sick of it. It seems easy enough\nwhen one looks at it, but there\'s a lot of running about that takes it\nout of one.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. You should see one of their balls, Daddy M\xc3\xadtry, then you\nwould be surprised!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Why, do they eat all the time?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. My eye! You should have seen what we had here awhile\nago. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch took me upstairs and I peeped in. The\nladies--awful! Dressed up! Dressed up, bless my heart, and all bare down\nto here, and their arms bare.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Faugh! How beastly!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. I take it the climate allows of that sort of thing!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Well, daddy, so I peeped in. Dear me, what it was like!\nAll of \'em in their natural skins! Would you believe it: old women--our\nmistress, only think, she\'s a grandmother, and even she\'d gone and bared\nher shoulders.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. And what next? The music strikes up, and each man of \'em\nwent up to his own, catches hold of her, and off they go twirling round\nand round!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. The old women too?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Yes, the old ones too.\n\nSIMON. No, the old ones sit still.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Get along,--I\'ve seen it myself!\n\nSIMON. No they don\'t.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK [in a hoarse voice, looking down from the oven] That\'s\nthe Polka-Mazurka. You fools don\'t understand what dancing is. The way\nthey dance\xc2\xa0...\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Shut up, you dancer! And keep quiet--there\'s some one\ncoming.\n\n    Enter Gregory; old Cook hides hurriedly.\n\nGREGORY [to Servants\' Cook] Bring some sour cabbage.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. I am only just up from the cellar, and now I must go\ndown again! Who is it for?\n\nGREGORY. For the young ladies. Be quick, and send it up with Simon. I\ncan\'t wait!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. There now, they tuck into sweetmeats till they are full\nup, and then they crave for sour cabbage!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s to make a clearance.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Of course, and as soon as there is room inside, they\nbegin again! [Takes basin, and exit].\n\nGREGORY [at Peasants] Look at them, how they\'ve established themselves\ndown here! Mind, if the mistress finds it out she\'ll give it you hot,\nlike she did this morning! [Exit, laughing].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it, she did raise a storm that time--awful!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That time it looked as if the master was going to step\nin, but seeing that the missus was about to blow the very roof off the\nhouse, he slams the door. Have your own way, thinks he.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [waving his arm] It\'s the same everywhere. My old woman,\nlet\'s say, she kicks up such a rumpus sometimes--it\'s just awful! Then I\njust get out of the hut. Let her go to Jericho! She\'ll give you one with\nthe poker if you don\'t mind. Oh Lord!\n\n    Jacob enters hurriedly with a prescription.\n\nJACOB. Here, Simon, you run to the chemist\'s and get these powders for\nthe mistress!\n\nSIMON. But master told me not to go out.\n\nJACOB. You\'ve plenty of time; your business won\'t begin till after their\ntea. Hope you are enjoying your tea!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Thanks, come and join us.\n\n    Exit Simon.\n\nJACOB. I haven\'t time. However, I\'ll just have one cup for company\'s\nsake.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And we\'ve just been having a conversation as to how your\nmistress carried on so haughty this morning.\n\nJACOB. Oh, she\'s a reg\'lar fury! So hot-tempered, that she gets quite\nbeside herself. Sometimes she even bursts out crying.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Now, there\'s a thing I wanted to ask you about. What, for\nexample, be these mikerots she was illuding to erewhile? "They\'ve\ninfested the house with mikerots, with mikerots," she says. What is one\nto make of these same mikerots?\n\nJACOB. Mikerogues, you mean! Well, it seems there is such a kind of\nbugs; all illnesses come from them, they say. So she says there are some\nof \'em on you. After you were gone, they washed and washed and sprinkled\nthe place where you had stood. There\'s a kind of physic as kills these\nsame bugs, they say.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then where have we got these bugs on us?\n\nJACOB [drinking his tea] Why, they say they\'re so small that one can\'t\nsee \'em even through a glass.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then how does she know I\'ve got \'em on me? Perhaps\nthere\'s more of that muck on her than on me!\n\nJACOB. There now, you go and ask her!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. I believe it\'s humbug.\n\nJACOB. Of course it\'s bosh. The doctors must invent something, or else\nwhat are they paid for? There\'s one comes to us every day. Comes,--talks\na bit,--and pockets ten roubles!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Nonsense!\n\nJACOB. Why, there\'s one as takes a hundred!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. A hundred? Humbug!\n\nJACOB. A hundred. Humbug, you say? Why, if he has to go out of town,\nhe\'ll not do it for less than a thousand! "Give a thousand," he says,\n"or else you may kick the bucket for what I care!"\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then does he know some charm?\n\nJACOB. I suppose he must. I served at a General\'s outside Moscow once: a\ncross, terrible proud old fellow he was--just awful. Well, this\nGeneral\'s daughter fell ill. They send for that doctor at once. "A\nthousand roubles, then I\'ll come." Well, they agreed, and he came. Then\nthey did something or other he didn\'t like, and he bawled out at the\nGeneral and says, "Is this the way you show your respect for me? Then\nI\'ll not attend her!" And, oh my! The old General forgot all his pride,\nand starts wheedling him in every way not to chuck up the job!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And he got the thousand?\n\nJACOB. Of course!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That\'s easy got money. What wouldn\'t a peasant do with\nsuch a sum!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. And I think it\'s all bosh. That time my foot was\nfestering I had it doctored ever so long. I spent nigh on five roubles\non it,--then I gave up doctoring, and it got all right!\n\n    Discharged Cook on the oven coughs.\n\nJACOB. Ah, the old crony is here again!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Who might that man be?\n\nJACOB. He used to be our master\'s cook. He comes to see Louk\xc3\xa9rya.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Kitchen-master, as one might say. Then, does he live\nhere?\n\nJACOB. No, they won\'t allow that. He\'s here one day, there another. If\nhe\'s got a copper he goes to a dosshouse; but when he has drunk all, he\ncomes here.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. How did he come to this?\n\nJACOB. Simply grew weak. And what a man he used to be--like a gentleman!\nWent about with a gold watch; got forty roubles a month wages. And now\nlook at him! He\'d have starved to death long ago if it hadn\'t been for\nLouk\xc3\xa9rya.\n\n    Enter Servants\' Cook with the sour cabbage.\n\nJACOB [to Servants\' Cook] I see you\'ve got Paul Petr\xc3\xb3vitch here again?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. And where\'s he to go to? Is he to go and freeze?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What liquor does.... Liquor, let\'s say ... [Clicks his\ntongue sympathetically].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Of course. A firm man\'s firm as a rock; a weak man\'s\nweaker than water.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK [gets off the oven with trembling hands and legs]\nLouk\xc3\xa9rya, I say, give us a drop!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. What are you up to? I\'ll give you such a drop!...\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Have you no conscience? I\'m dying! Brothers, a\ncopper\xc2\xa0...\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Get back on the oven, I tell you!\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Half a glass only, cook, for Heaven\'s sake! I say, do\nyou understand? I ask you in the name of Heaven, now!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Come along, here\'s some tea for you.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Tea; what is tea? Weak, sloppy stuff. A little\nv\xc3\xb3dka--just one little drop ... Louk\xc3\xa9rya!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Poor old soul, what agony it is!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You\'d better give him some.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK [gets out a bottle and fills a wine-glass] Here you are;\nyou\'ll get no more.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK [clutches hold of it and drinks, trembling all over]\nLouk\xc3\xa9rya, Cook! I am drinking, and you must understand\xc2\xa0...\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Now then, stop your chatter! Get on to the oven, and let\nnot a breath of you be heard! [The old Cook meekly begins to climb up,\nmuttering something to himself].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. What it is, when a man gives way to his weakness!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it--human weakness.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. That goes without saying.\n\n    The Discharged Cook settles down, muttering all the time. Silence.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. I want to ask you something: that girl of Aks\xc3\xadnya\'s as\ncomes from our village and is living here. How is she? What is she\nlike? How is she living--I mean, does she live honest?\n\nJACOB. She\'s a nice girl; one can say nothing but good of her.\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. I\'ll tell you straight, daddy; I know this here\nestablishment out and out, and if you mean to have T\xc3\xa1nya for your son\'s\nwife--be quick about it, before she comes to grief, or else she\'ll not\nescape!\n\nJACOB. Yes, that\'s true. A while ago we had a girl here, Nataly. She was\na good girl too. And she was lost without rhyme or reason. No better\nthan that chap! [Pointing to the old Cook].\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. There\'s enough to dam a mill-pool, with the likes of us,\nas perish! \'Cos why, every one is tempted by the easy life and the good\nfood. And see there,--as soon as one has tasted the good food she goes\nand slips. And once she\'s slipped, they don\'t want her, but get a fresh\none in her place. So it was with dear little Nataly; she also slipped,\nand they turned her out. She had a child and fell ill, and died in the\nhospital last spring. And what a girl she used to be!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord! People are weak; they ought to be pitied.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Those devils pity? No fear! [He hangs his legs down\nfrom the oven] I have stood roasting myself by the kitchen range for\nthirty years, and now that I am not wanted, I may go and die like a\ndog.... Pity indeed!...\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. It\'s the old circumstances.\n\nSECOND PEASANT.\n\n        While they drank and they fed, you were "curly head."\n        When they\'d finished the prog, \'twas "Get out, mangy dog!"\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Much you know. What is "Sautey a la Bongmont"? What is\n"Bavassary"? Oh, the things I could make! Think of it! The Emperor\ntasted my work, and now the devils want me no longer. But I am not going\nto stand it!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Now then, stop that noise, mind.... Get up right into\nthe corner, so that no one can see you, or else Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch or\nsome one may come in, and both you and me\'ll be turned out! [Silence].\n\nJACOB. And do you know my part of the country? I\'m from Voznes\xc3\xa9nsky.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Not know it? Why, it\'s no more\'n ten miles from our\nvillage; not _that_ across the ford! Do you cultivate any land there?\n\nJACOB. My brother does, and I send my wages. Though I live here, I am\ndying for a sight of home.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Then An\xc3\xadsim is your brother?\n\nJACOB. Own brother. He lives at the farther end of the village.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Of course, I know; his is the third house.\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya, running.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Jacob, what are you doing, amusing yourself here? She is calling\nyou!\n\nJACOB. I\'m coming; but what\'s up?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Frisk is barking; it\'s hungry. And she\'s scolding you. "How cruel\nhe is," she says. "He\'s no feeling," she says. "It\'s long past Frisk\'s\ndinner-time, and he has not brought her food!" [Laughs].\n\nJACOB [rises to go] Oh, she\'s cross? What\'s going to happen now, I\nwonder?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Here, take the cabbage with you.\n\nJACOB. All right, give it here. [Takes basin, and exit].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Who is going to dine now?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, the dog! It\'s her dog. [Sits down and takes up the tea-pot]\nIs there any more tea? I\'ve brought some. [Puts fresh tea into the\ntea-pot.]\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Dinner for a dog?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, of course! They prepare a special cutlet for her; it must\nnot be too fat. And I do the washing--the dog\'s washing, I mean.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Oh Lord!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s like that gentleman who had a funeral for his dog.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. What\'s that?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, some one told me he had a dog--I mean the gentleman had a\ndog. And it died. It was winter, and he went in his sledge to bury that\ndog. Well, he buried it, and on the way home he sits and cries--the\ngentleman does. Well, there was such a bitter frost that the coachman\'s\nnose keeps running, and he has to keep wiping it. Let me fill your cup!\n[Fills it] So he keeps wiping his nose, and the gentleman sees it, and\nsays, "What are you crying about?" And the coachman, he says, "Why, sir,\nhow can I help it; is there another dog like him?" [Laughs].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. And I daresay he thinks to himself, "If your own self\nwas to kick the bucket I\'d not cry." [Laughs].\n\nDISCHARGED COOK [from up on the oven] That is true; that\'s right!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, the gentleman, he gets home and goes straight to his lady:\n"What a good-hearted man our coachman is; he was crying all the way home\nabout poor Dash. Have him called.... Here, drink this glass of v\xc3\xb3dka,"\nhe says, "and here\'s a rouble as a reward for you." That\'s just like her\nsaying Jacob has no feelings for her dog! [The Peasants laugh].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s the style!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. That was a go!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Ay, lassie, but you\'ve set us a-laughing!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [pouring out more tea] Have some more! Yes, it only seems that our\nlife is pleasant; but sometimes it is very disgusting,--clearing up all\ntheir messes! Faugh! It\'s better in the country. [Peasants turn their\ncups upside-down, as a polite sign that they have had enough. T\xc3\xa1nya\npours out more tea] Have some more, Ef\xc3\xadm Ant\xc3\xb3nitch. I\'ll fill your cup,\nM\xc3\xadtry Vl\xc3\xa1sitch.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. All right, fill it, fill it.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, dear, and what progression is our business making?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s getting on\xc2\xa0...\n\n  [Illustration: FRUITS OF CULTURE. ACT II.\n\n  FIRST PEASANT. Well, dear, and what progression is our business making?\n\n  T\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s getting on\xc2\xa0...]\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Simon told us\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [quickly] Did he?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. But he could not make us understand.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I can\'t tell you now, but I\'m doing my best--all I can! And I\'ve\ngot your paper here! [Shows the paper hidden under the bib of her apron]\nIf only one thing succeeds.... [Shrieks] Oh, how nice it would be!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Don\'t lose that paper, mind. It has cost money.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Never fear. You only want him to sign it? Is that all?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Why, what else? Let\'s say he\'s signed it, and it\'s done!\n[Turns his cup upside-down] I\'ve had enough.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [aside] He\'ll sign it; you\'ll see he will... Have some more.\n[Pours out tea].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If only you get this business about the sale of the land\nsettled, the Commune would pay your marriage expenses. [Refuses the\ntea].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [pouring out tea] Do have another cup.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. You get it done, and we\'ll arrange your marriage, and I\nmyself, let\'s say, will dance at the wedding. Though I\'ve never danced\nin all my born days, I\'ll dance then!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [laughing] All right, I\'ll be in hopes of it. [Silence].\n\nSECOND PEASANT [examines T\xc3\xa1nya] That\'s all very well, but you\'re not fit\nfor peasant work.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Who? I? Why, don\'t you think me strong enough? You should see\nme lacing up my mistress. There\'s many a peasant couldn\'t tug as hard.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Where do you tug her to?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, there\'s a thing made with bone, like--something like a\nstiff jacket, only up to here! Well, and I pull the strings just as when\nyou saddle a horse--when you ... what d\'ye call it? You know, when you\nspit on your hands!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Tighten the girths, you mean.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, yes, that\'s it. And you know I mustn\'t shove against her\nwith my knee. [Laughs].\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why do you pull her in?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. For a reason!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Why, is she doing penance?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. No, it\'s for beauty\'s sake!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s to say, you pull in her paunch for appearance\'\nsake.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Sometimes I lace her up so that her eyes are ready to start from\nher head, and she says, "Tighter," till my hands tingle. And you say I\'m\nnot strong! [Peasants laugh and shake their heads].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But here, I\'ve been jabbering. [Runs away, laughing].\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Ah, the lassie has made us laugh!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. She\'s a tidy one!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. She\'s not bad.\n\n    Enter Sah\xc3\xa1tof and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch. Sah\xc3\xa1tof holds a teaspoon in his\n    hand.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Not exactly a dinner, but a _d\xc3\xa9jeuner dinatoire_. And\nfirst-rate it was, I tell you. Ham of sucking-pig, delicious! Roulier\nfeeds one splendidly! I\'ve only just returned. [Sees Peasants] Ah, the\npeasants are here again!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, yes, that\'s all very well, but we came here to hide this\narticle. Where shall we hide it?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Excuse me a moment. [To Servants\' Cook] Where are the\ndogs?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. In the coachman\'s quarters. You can\'t keep dogs in the\nservants\' kitchen!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Ah, in the coachman\'s quarters? All right.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I am waiting.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Excuse me, please. Eh, what? Hide it? I\'ll tell you\nwhat. Let\'s put it into one of the peasants\' pockets. That one. I say,\nwhere\'s your pocket? Eh, what?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What for d\'ye want my pocket? You\'re a good \'un! My\npocket! There\'s money in my pocket!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Where\'s your bag, then?\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What for?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. What d\'you mean? That\'s the young master!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [laughs. To Sah\xc3\xa1tof] D\'you know why he\'s so\nfrightened? Shall I tell you? He\'s got a heap of money. Eh, what?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, yes, I see. Well, you talk to them a bit, and I\'ll put it\ninto that bag without being observed, so that they should not notice and\ncould not point it out to him. Talk to them.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. All right! [To Peasants] Well then, old fellows, how\nabout the land? Are you buying it? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST PEASANT. We have made an offering, so to say, with our whole\nheart. But there,--the business don\'t come into action nohow.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. You should not be so stingy! Land is an important\nmatter! I told you about planting mint. Or else tobacco would also do.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. Every kind of producks.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. And you help us, master. Ask your father. Or else how are\nwe to live? There\'s so little land. A fowl, let\'s say, there\'s not\nenough room for a fowl to run about.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [having put the spoon into a bag belonging to the Third Peasant]\n_C\'est fait._ Ready. Come along. [Exit].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. So don\'t be stingy! Eh? Well, good-bye. [Exit].\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Didn\'t I say, come to some lodging-house? Well, supposing\nwe\'d had to give three-pence each, then at least we\'d have been in\npeace. As to here, the Lord be merciful! "Give us the money," he says.\nWhat\'s that for?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. He\'s drunk, I daresay.\n\n    Peasants turn their cups upside-down, rise, and cross themselves.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. And d\'you mind what a saying he threw out? Sowing mint!\nOne must know how to understand them, that one must!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Sow mint indeed! He\'d better bend his own back at that\nwork, and then it\'s not mint he\'ll hanker after, no fear! Well, many\nthanks!... And now, good woman, would you tell us where we could lie\ndown to sleep?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. One of you can lie on the oven, and the others on these\nbenches.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Christ save you! [Prays, crossing himself].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. If only by God\'s help we get our business settled! [Lies\ndown] Then to-morrow, after dinner, we\'d be off by the train, and on\nTuesday we\'d be home again.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Are you going to put out the light?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Put it out? Oh no! They\'ll keep running down here, first\nfor one thing then another.... You lie down, I\'ll lower it.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. How is one to live, having so little land? Why, this\nyear, I have had to buy corn since Christmas. And the oat-straw is all\nused up. I\'d like to get hold of ten acres, and then I could take Simon\nback.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. You\'re a man with a family. You\'d get the land cultivated\nwithout trouble. If only the business comes off.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. We must pray to the Holy Virgin, maybe she\'ll help us\nout. [Silence, broken by sighs. Then footsteps and voices are heard\noutside. The door opens. Enter Grossman hurriedly, with his eyes\nbandaged, holding Sah\xc3\xa1tof\'s hand, and followed by the Professor and the\nDoctor, the Fat Lady and Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, Betsy and Petr\xc3\xadstchef,\nVas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch and M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna and the\nBaroness, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch and T\xc3\xa1nya].\n\n    Peasants jump up. Grossman comes forward stepping quickly, then\n    stops.\n\nFAT LADY. You need not trouble yourselves; I have undertaken the task of\nobserving, and am strictly fulfilling my duty! Mr. Sah\xc3\xa1tof, are you not\nleading him?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Of course not!\n\nFAT LADY. You must not lead him, but neither must you resist! [To Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch] I know these experiments. I have tried them myself.\nSometimes I used to feel a certain effluence, and as soon as I felt\nit\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. May I beg of you to keep perfect silence?\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, I understand so well! I have experienced it myself. As\nsoon as my attention was diverted I could no longer\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Sh\xc2\xa0...!\n\n    Grossman goes about, searches near the First and Second Peasants,\n    then approaches the Third, and stumbles over a bench.\n\nBARONESS. _Mais dites-moi, on le paye?_[6]\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. _Je ne saurais vous dire._\n\n  [6] BARONESS. But tell me, please, is he paid for this?\n\n  ANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I really do not know.\n\nBARONESS. _Mais c\'est un monsieur?_[7]\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. _Oh, oui!_\n\nBARONESS. _\xc3\x87a tient du miraculeux. N\'est ce pas? Comment est-ce qu\'il\ntrouve?_\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. _Je ne saurais vous dire. Mon mari vous l\'expliquera._\n[Noticing Peasants, turns round, and sees the Servants\' Cook] _Pardon_\n... what is this?\n\n  [7] BARONESS. But he is a gentleman?\n\n  ANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Oh yes!\n\n  BARONESS. It is almost miraculous. Isn\'t it? How does he manage to\n  find things?\n\n  ANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I really can\'t tell you. My husband will explain it to\n  you.... Excuse me....\n\n    Baroness goes up to the group.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Servants\' Cook] Who let the peasants in?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. Jacob brought them in.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Who gave Jacob the order?\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. I can\'t say. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch has seen them.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Leon\xc3\xadd!\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch does not hear, being absorbed in the search, and\n    says, Sh\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch! What is the meaning of this? Did you\nnot see me disinfecting the whole hall, and now the whole kitchen is\ninfected, all the rye bread, the milk\xc2\xa0...\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I thought there would not be any danger if they came\nhere. The men have come on business. They have far to go, and are from\nour village.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. That\'s the worst of it! They are from the Koursk village,\nwhere people are dying of diphtheria like flies! But the chief thing is,\nI ordered them out of the house!... Did I, or did I not? [Approaches the\nothers that have gathered round the Peasants] Be careful! Don\'t touch\nthem--they are all infected with diphtheria! [No one heeds her, and she\nsteps aside in a dignified manner and stands quietly waiting].\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [sniffs loudly] I don\'t know if it is diphtheria, but there\nis some kind of infection in the air. Don\'t you notice it?\n\nBETSY. Stop your nonsense! Vovo, which bag is it in?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. That one, that one. He is getting near, very near!\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Is it spirits divine, or spirits of wine?\n\nBETSY. Now your cigarette comes in handy for once. Smoke closer, closer\nto me.\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef leans over her and smokes at her.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. He\'s getting near, I tell you. Eh, what?\n\nGROSSMAN [searches excitedly round the Third Peasant] It is here; I feel\nit is!\n\nFAT LADY. Do you feel an effluence? [Grossman stoops and finds the spoon\nin the bag].\n\nALL. Bravo! [General enthusiasm].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Ah! So that\'s where our spoon was. [To Peasants] Then\nthat\'s the sort you are!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. What sort? I didn\'t take your spoon! What are you making\nout? I didn\'t take it, and my soul knows nothing about it. I didn\'t take\nit--there! Let him do what he likes. I knew he came here for no good.\n"Where\'s your bag?" says he. I didn\'t take it, the Lord is my witness!\n[Crosses himself] I didn\'t take it!\n\n    The young people group round the Peasant, laughing.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [angrily to his son] Always playing the fool! [To the\nThird Peasant] Never mind, friend! We know you did not take it; it was\nonly an experiment.\n\nGROSSMAN [removes bandage from his eyes, and pretends to be coming to]\nCan I have a little water? [All fuss round him].\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Let\'s go straight from here into the coachman\'s\nroom. I\'ve got a bitch there--_\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa2tante_![8] Eh, what?\n\n  [8] Stunning!\n\nBETSY. What a horrid word. Couldn\'t you say dog?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. No. I can\'t say--Betsy is a man, _\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa2tant_. I should\nhave to say young woman; it\'s a parallel case. Eh, what? M\xc3\xa1rya\nKonstant\xc3\xadnovna, isn\'t it true? Good, eh? [Laughs loudly].\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. Well, let us go. [Exeunt M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna,\nBetsy, Petr\xc3\xadstchef, and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch].\n\nFAT LADY [to Grossman] Well? how are you? Have you rested? [Grossman\ndoes not answer. To Sah\xc3\xa1tof] And you, Mr. Sah\xc3\xa1tof, did you feel the\neffluence?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I felt nothing. Yes, it was very fine--very fine. Quite a\nsuccess!\n\nBARONESS. _Admirable! \xc3\x87a ne le fait pas souffrir?_[9]\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. _Pas le moins du monde._\n\n  [9] BARONESS. Capital! Does it not cause him any pain?\n\n  LEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Not the slightest.\n\nPROFESSOR [to Grossman] May I trouble you? [Hands him a thermometer] At\nthe beginning of the experiment it was 37 decimal 2, degrees.[10] [To\nDoctor] That\'s right, I think? Would you mind feeling his pulse? Some\nloss is inevitable.\n\n  [10] He uses a Centigrade thermometer.\n\nDOCTOR [to Grossman] Now then, sir, let\'s have your hand; we\'ll see,\nwe\'ll see. [Takes out his watch, and feels Grossman\'s pulse].\n\nFAT LADY [to Grossman] One moment! The condition you were in could not\nbe called sleep?\n\nGROSSMAN [wearily] It was hypnosis.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. In that case, are we to understand that you hypnotised\nyourself?\n\nGROSSMAN. And why not? An hypnotic state may ensue not only in\nconsequence of association--the sound of the tom-tom, for instance, in\nCharcot\'s method--but by merely entering an hypnogenetic zone.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Granting that, it would still be desirable to define what\nhypnotism is, more exactly?\n\nPROFESSOR. Hypnotism is a phenomenon resulting from the transmutation of\none energy into another.\n\nGROSSMAN. Charcot does not so define it.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. A moment, just a moment! That is your definition, but Li\xc3\xa9bault\ntold me himself\xc2\xa0...\n\nDOCTOR [lets go of Grossman\'s pulse] Ah, that\'s all right; well now, the\ntemperature?\n\nFAT LADY [interrupting] No, allow me! I agree with the Professor. And\nhere\'s the very best proof. After my illness, when I lay insensible, a\ndesire to speak came over me. In general I am of a silent disposition,\nbut then I was overcome by this desire to speak, and I spoke and spoke,\nand I was told that I spoke in such a way that every one was astonished!\n[To Sah\xc3\xa1tof] But I think I interrupted you?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [with dignity] Not at all. Pray continue.\n\nDOCTOR. Pulse 82, and the temperature has risen three-tenths of a\ndegree.\n\nPROFESSOR. There you are! That\'s a proof! That\'s just as it should be.\n[Takes out pocket-book and writes] 82, yes? And 37 and 5. When the\nhypnotic state is induced, it invariably produces a heightened action of\nthe heart.\n\nDOCTOR. I can, as a medical man, bear witness that your prognosis was\njustified by the event.\n\nPROFESSOR [to Sah\xc3\xa1tof] You were saying?...\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I wished to say that Li\xc3\xa9bault told me himself that the hypnotic\nis only one particular psychical state, increasing susceptibility to\nsuggestion.\n\nPROFESSOR. That is so, but still the law of equivalents is the chief\nthing.\n\nGROSSMAN. Moreover, Li\xc3\xa9bault is far from being an authority, while\nCharcot has studied the subject from all sides, and has proved that\nhypnotism produced by a blow, a trauma\xc2\xa0...\n\n    All talking together.\n\n  { SAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, but I don\'t reject Charcot\'s labour. I know him also,\n  { I am only repeating what Li\xc3\xa9bault told me\xc2\xa0...\n  {\n  { GROSSMAN [excitedly] There are 3000 patients in the Salp\xc3\xaatri\xc3\xa8re, and\n  { I have gone through the whole course.\n  {\n  { PROFESSOR. Excuse me, gentlemen, but that is not the point.\n\nFAT LADY [interrupting] One moment, I will explain it to you in two\nwords? When my husband was ill, all the doctors gave him up\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. However, we had better go upstairs again. Baroness,\nthis way!\n\n    Exeunt Grossman, Sah\xc3\xa1tof, Professor, Doctor, the Fat Lady, and\n    Baroness, talking loudly and interrupting each other.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [catching hold of Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch\'s arm] How often have\nI asked you not to interfere in household matters! You think of nothing\nbut your nonsense, and the whole house is on my shoulders. You will\ninfect us all!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. What? How? I don\'t understand what you mean.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. How? Why, people ill of diphtheria sleep in the kitchen,\nwhich is in constant communication with the whole house.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, but I\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What, I?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I know nothing about it.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. It\'s your duty to know, if you are the head of the\nfamily. Such things must not be done.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But I never thought ... I thought\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. It is sickening to listen to you! [Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch\nremains silent].\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] Turn them out at once! They are to\nleave my kitchen immediately! It is terrible! No one listens to me; they\ndo it out of spite.... I turn them out from there, and they bring them\nin here! And with my illness\xc2\xa0... [Gets more and more excited, and at\nlast begins to cry] Doctor! Doctor! Peter Petr\xc3\xb3vitch!... He\'s gone\ntoo!... [Exit, sobbing, followed by Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch].\n\n    All stand silent for a long time.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. Botheration take them all! If one don\'t mind, the police\nwill be after one here. And I have never been to law in all my born\ndays. Let\'s go to some lodging-house, lads!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to T\xc3\xa1nya] What are we to do?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Never mind, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, let them sleep with the coachman.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. How can we do that? The coachman was complaining as\nit is, that his place is full of dogs.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well then, the porter\'s lodge.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. And supposing it\'s found out?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It won\'t be found out! Don\'t trouble about that, Theodore\nIv\xc3\xa1nitch. How can one turn them out now, at night? They\'ll not find\nanywhere to go to.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, do as you please. Only they must go away from\nhere. [Exit].\n\n    Peasants take their bags.\n\nDISCHARGED COOK. Oh those damned fiends! It\'s all their fat! Fiends!\n\nSERVANTS\' COOK. You be quiet there. Thank goodness they didn\'t see you!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well then, daddy, come along to the porter\'s lodge.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, but how about our business? How, for example, about\nthe applience of his hand to the signature? May we be in hopes?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. We\'ll see in an hour\'s time.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. You\'ll do the trick?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [laughs] Yes, God willing!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n    Evening of the same day. The small drawing-room in Leon\xc3\xadd\n    Fy\xc3\xb3doritch\'s house, where the s\xc3\xa9ances are always held. Leon\xc3\xadd\n    Fy\xc3\xb3doritch and the Professor.\n\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well then, shall we risk a s\xc3\xa9ance with our new\nmedium?\n\nPROFESSOR. Yes, certainly. He is a powerful medium, there is no doubt\nabout it. And it is especially desirable that the s\xc3\xa9ance should take\nplace to-day with the same people. Grossman will certainly respond to\nthe influence of the mediumistic energy, and then the connection and\nidentity of the different phenomena will be still more evident. You will\nsee then that, if the medium is as strong as he was just now, Grossman\nwill vibrate.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Then I will send for Simon and ask those who wish to\nattend to come in.\n\nPROFESSOR. Yes, all right! I will just jot down a few notes. [Takes out\nhis note-book and writes].\n\n    Enter Sah\xc3\xa1tof.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. They have just settled down to whist in Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna\'s\ndrawing-room, and as I am not wanted there--and as I am interested in\nyour s\xc3\xa9ance--I have put in an appearance here. But will there be a\ns\xc3\xa9ance?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, certainly!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. In spite of the absence of Mr. Kaptch\xc3\xadtch\'s mediumistic powers?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. _Vous avez la main heureuse._[11] Fancy, that very\npeasant whom I mentioned to you this morning, turns out to be an\nundoubted medium.\n\n  [11] LEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. You bring good luck.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Dear me! Yes, that is peculiarly interesting!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, we tried a few preliminary experiments with him\njust after dinner.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. So you\'ve had time already to experiment, and to convince\nyourself\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, perfectly! And he turns out to be an\nexceptionally powerful medium.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [incredulously] Dear me!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. It turns out that it has long been noticed in the\nservants\' hall. When he sits down to table, the spoon springs into his\nhand of its own accord! [To the Professor] Had you heard about it?\n\nPROFESSOR. No, I had not heard that detail.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [to the Professor]. But still, you admit the possibility of such\nphenomena?\n\nPROFESSOR. What phenomena?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Well, spiritualistic, mediumistic, and supernatural phenomena\nin general.\n\nPROFESSOR. The question is, what do we consider supernatural? When, not\na living man but a piece of stone attracted a nail to itself, how did\nthe phenomena strike the first observers? As something natural? Or\nsupernatural?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Well, of course; but phenomena such as the magnet attracting\niron always repeat themselves.\n\nPROFESSOR. It is just the same in this case. The phenomenon repeats\nitself and we experiment with it. And not only that, but we apply to the\nphenomena we are investigating the laws common to other phenomena. These\nphenomena seem supernatural only because their causes are attributed to\nthe medium himself. But that is where the mistake lies. The phenomena\nare not caused by the medium, but by psychic energy acting through a\nmedium, and that is a very different thing. The whole matter lies in the\nlaw of equivalents.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, certainly, but\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya, who hides behind the hangings.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Only remember that we cannot reckon on any results\nwith certainty, with this medium any more than with Home or Kaptch\xc3\xadtch.\nWe may not succeed, but on the other hand we may even have perfect\nmaterialisation.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Materialisation even? What do you mean by materialisation?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Why, I mean that some one who is dead--say, your\nfather or your grandfather--may appear, take you by the hand, or give\nyou something; or else some one may suddenly rise into the air, as\nhappened to Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch last time.\n\nPROFESSOR. Of course, of course. But the chief thing is the explanation\nof the phenomena, and the application to them of general laws.\n\n    Enter the Fat Lady.\n\nFAT LADY. Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna has allowed me to join you.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Very pleased.\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, how tired Grossman seems! He could scarcely hold his cup.\nDid you notice [to the Professor] how pale he turned at the moment he\napproached the hiding-place? I noticed it at once, and was the first to\nmention it to Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nPROFESSOR. Undoubtedly,--loss of vital energy.\n\nFAT LADY. Yes, it\'s just as I say, one should not abuse that sort of\nthing. You know, a hypnotist once suggested to a friend of mine, V\xc3\xa9ra\nK\xc3\xb3nshin (oh, you know her, of course)--well, he suggested that she\nshould leave off smoking,--and her back began to ache!\n\nPROFESSOR [trying to have his say] The temperature and the pulse clearly\nindicate\xc2\xa0...\n\nFAT LADY. One moment! Allow me! Well, I said to her: it\'s better to\nsmoke than to suffer so with one\'s nerves. Of course, smoking is\ninjurious; I should like to give it up myself, but, do what I will, I\ncan\'t! Once I managed not to smoke for a fortnight, but could hold out\nno longer.\n\nPROFESSOR [again trying to speak] Clearly proves\xc2\xa0...\n\nFAT LADY. Yes, no! Allow me, just one word! You say, "loss of strength."\nAnd I was also going to say that, when I travelled with post-horses ...\nthe roads used to be dreadful in those days--you don\'t remember--but I\nhave noticed that all our nervousness comes from railways! I, for\ninstance, can\'t sleep while travelling; I cannot fall asleep to save my\nlife!\n\nPROFESSOR [makes another attempt, which the Fat Lady baffles] The loss\nof strength\xc2\xa0...\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [smiling] Yes; oh yes!\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch rings.\n\nFAT LADY. I am awake one night, and another, and a third, and still I\ncan\'t sleep!\n\n    Enter Gregory.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Please tell Theodore to get everything ready for the\ns\xc3\xa9ance, and send Simon here--Simon, the butler\'s assistant,--do you\nhear?\n\nGREGORY. Yes, sir. [Exit].\n\nPROFESSOR [to Sah\xc3\xa1tof]. The observation of the temperature and the pulse\nhave shown loss of vital energy. The same will happen in consequence of\nthe mediumistic phenomena. The law of the conservation of energy\xc2\xa0...\n\nFAT LADY. Oh yes, yes; I was just going to say that I am very glad that\na simple peasant turns out to be a medium. That\'s very good. I always\ndid say that the Slavophils\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Let\'s go into the drawing-room in the meantime.\n\nFAT LADY. Allow me, just one word! The Slavophils are right; but I\nalways told my husband that one ought never to exaggerate anything! "The\ngolden mean," you know. What is the use of maintaining that the common\npeople are all perfect, when I have myself seen\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Won\'t you come into the drawing-room?\n\nFAT LADY. A boy--that high--who drank! I gave him a scolding at once.\nAnd he was grateful to me afterwards. They are children, and, as I\nalways say, children need both love and severity!\n\n    Exeunt all, all talking together.\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya enters from behind the hangings.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh, if it would only succeed! [Begins fastening some threads].\n\n    Enter Betsy hurriedly.\n\nBETSY. Isn\'t papa here? [Looks inquiringly at T\xc3\xa1nya] What are you doing\nhere?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh, Miss Elizabeth, I have only just come; I only wished ... only\ncame in\xc2\xa0... [Embarrassed].\n\nBETSY. But they are going to have a s\xc3\xa9ance here directly. [Notices T\xc3\xa1nya\ndrawing in the threads, looks at her, and suddenly bursts out laughing]\nT\xc3\xa1nya! Why, it\'s you who do it all? Now don\'t deny it. And last time it\nwas you too? Yes, it was, it was!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Miss Elizabeth, dearest!\n\nBETSY [delighted] Oh, that is a joke! Well, I never. But why do you do\nit?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh miss, dear miss, don\'t betray me!\n\nBETSY. Not for the world! I\'m awfully glad. Only tell me how you manage\nit?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, I just hide, and then, when it\'s all dark, I come out and\ndo it. That\'s how.\n\nBETSY [pointing to threads] And what is this for? You needn\'t tell me. I\nsee; you draw\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Miss Elizabeth, darling! I will confess it, but only to you. I\nused to do it just for fun, but now I mean business.\n\nBETSY. What? How? What business?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, you see, those peasants that came this morning, you saw\nthem. They want to buy some land, and your father won\'t sell it; well,\nand Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, he says it\'s the spirits as forbid him. So I have\nhad a thought as\xc2\xa0...\n\nBETSY. Oh, I see! Well, you are a clever girl! Do it, do it.... But how\nwill you manage it?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, I thought, when they put out the lights, I\'ll at once begin\nknocking and shying things about, touching their heads with the threads,\nand at last I\'ll take the paper about the land and throw it on the\ntable. I\'ve got it here.\n\nBETSY. Well, and then?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, don\'t you see? They will be astonished. The peasants had the\npaper, and now it\'s here. I will teach\xc2\xa0...\n\nBETSY. Why, of course! Simon is the medium to-day!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well, I\'ll teach him\xc2\xa0... [Laughs so that she can\'t continue] I\'ll\ntell him to squeeze with his hands any one he can get hold of! Of\ncourse, not your father--he\'d never dare do that--but any one else;\nhe\'ll squeeze till it\'s signed.\n\nBETSY [laughing] But that\'s not the way it is done. Mediums never do\nanything themselves.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Oh, never mind. It\'s all one; I daresay it\'ll turn out all right.\n\n    Enter Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\n    Exit Betsy, making signs to T\xc3\xa1nya.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Why are you here?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. It\'s you I want, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, dear\xc2\xa0...\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, what is it?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. About that affair of mine as I spoke of.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [laughs] I\'ve made the match; yes, I\'ve made the\nmatch. The matter is settled; we have shaken hands on it, only not had a\ndrink on it.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [with a shriek] Never! So it\'s all right?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Don\'t I tell you so? He says, "I shall consult the\nmissus, and then, God willing\xc2\xa0..."\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Is that what he said? [Shrieks] Dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, I\'ll pray\nfor you all the days of my life!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. All right! All right! Now is not the time. I\'ve been\nordered to arrange the room for the s\xc3\xa9ance.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Let me help you. How\'s it to be arranged?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. How? Why, the table in the middle of the\nroom--chairs--the guitar--the accordion. The lamp is not wanted, only\ncandles.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [helps Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch to place the things] Is that right? The\nguitar here, and here the inkstand. [Places it] So?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Can it be true that they\'ll make Simon sit here?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I suppose so; they\'ve done it once.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Wonderful! [Puts on his pince-nez] But is he clean?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. How should I know?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Then, I\'ll tell you what\xc2\xa0...\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Go and take a nail-brush and some Pears\' soap; you\nmay take mine ... and go and cut his claws and scrub his hands as clean\nas possible.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. He can do it himself.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well then, tell him to. And tell him to put on a\nclean shirt as well.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. All right, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch. [Exit].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [sits down in an easy-chair] They\'re educated and\nlearned--Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch now, he\'s a professor--and yet sometimes\none can\'t help doubting very much. The people\'s rude superstitions are\nbeing abolished: hobgoblins, sorcerers, witches.... But if one considers\nit, is not this equally superstitious? How is it possible that the\nsouls of the dead should come and talk, and play the guitar? No! Some\none is fooling them, or they are fooling themselves. And as to this\nbusiness with Simon--it\'s simply incomprehensible. [Looks at an album]\nHere\'s their spiritualistic album. How is it possible to photograph a\nspirit? But here is the likeness of a Turk and Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch sitting\nby.... Extraordinary human weakness!\n\n    Enter Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Is it all ready?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [rising leisurely] Quite ready. [Smiles] Only I don\'t\nknow about your new medium. I hope he won\'t disgrace you, Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. No, I and Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch have tested him. He is\na wonderfully powerful medium!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, I don\'t know. But is he clean enough? I don\'t\nsuppose you have thought of ordering him to wash his hands? It might be\nrather inconvenient.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. His hands? Oh yes! They\'re not clean, you think?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What can you expect? He\'s a peasant, and there will\nbe ladies present, and M\xc3\xa1rya Vas\xc3\xadlevna.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. It will be all right.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. And then I have something to report to you. Timothy,\nthe coachman, complains that he can\'t keep things clean because of the\ndogs.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [arranging the things on the table absent-mindedly]\nWhat dogs?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. The three hounds that came for Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\nto-day.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [vexed] Tell Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna! She can do as she likes\nabout it. I have no time.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But you know her weakness\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. \'Tis just as she likes, let her do as she pleases.\nAs for him,--one never gets anything but unpleasantness from him.\nBesides, I am busy.\n\n    Enter Simon, smiling; he has a sleeveless peasant\'s coat on.\n\nSIMON. I was ordered to come.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, it\'s all right. Let me see your hands. That will\ndo, that will do very well! Well then, my good fellow, you must do just\nas you did before,--sit down, and give way to your mood. But don\'t think\nat all.\n\nSIMON. Why should I think? The more one thinks, the worse it is.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Just so, just so, exactly! The less conscious one is,\nthe greater is the power. Don\'t think, but give in to your mood. If you\nwish to sleep, sleep; if you wish to walk, walk. Do you understand?\n\nSIMON. How could one help understanding? It\'s simple enough.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But above all, don\'t be frightened. Because you might\nbe surprised yourself. You must understand that just as we live here, so\na whole world of invisible spirits live here also.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [improving on what Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch has said]\nInvisible feelings, do you understand?\n\nSIMON [laughs] How can one help understanding! It\'s very plain as you\nput it.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. You may rise up in the air, or something of the kind,\nbut don\'t be frightened.\n\nSIMON. Why should I be frightened? That won\'t matter at all.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well then, I\'ll go and call them all.... Is\neverything ready?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. I think so.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But the slates?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. They are downstairs. I\'ll bring them. [Exit].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. All right then. So don\'t be afraid, but be at your\nease.\n\nSIMON. Had I not better take off my coat? One would be more easy like.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Your coat? Oh no. Don\'t take that off. [Exit].\n\nSIMON. She tells me to do the same again, and she will again shy things\nabout. How isn\'t she afraid?\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya in her stockings and in a dress of the colour of the\n    wall-paper. Simon laughs.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Shsh!... They\'ll hear! There, stick these matches on your fingers\nas before. [Sticks them on] Well, do you remember everything?\n\nSIMON [bending his fingers in, one by one] First of all, wet the matches\nand wave my hands about, that\'s one. Then make my teeth chatter, like\nthis ... that\'s two. But I\'ve forgotten the third thing.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. And it\'s the third as is the chief thing. Don\'t forget as soon as\nthe paper falls on the table--I shall ring the little bell--then you do\nlike this.... Spread your arms out far and catch hold of some one,\nwhoever it is as sits nearest, and catch hold of him. And then squeeze!\n[Laughs] Whether it\'s a gentleman or a lady, it\'s all one; you just\nsqueeze \'em, and don\'t let \'em go,--as if it were in your sleep, and\nchatter with your teeth, or else howl like this. [Howls sotto-voce] And\nwhen I begin to play on the guitar, then stretch yourself as if you were\nwaking up, you know.... Will you remember everything?\n\nSIMON. Yes, I\'ll remember, but it is too funny.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But mind you don\'t laugh. Still, it won\'t matter much if you do\nlaugh; they\'d think it was in your sleep. Only take care you don\'t\nreally fall asleep when they put out the lights.\n\nSIMON. No fear, I\'ll pinch my ears.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Well then Sim darling, only mind do as I tell you, and don\'t get\nfrightened. He\'ll sign the paper, see if he don\'t! They\'re coming!\n\n    Gets under the sofa.\n\n    Enter Grossman and the Professor, Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch and the Fat\n    Lady, the Doctor, Sah\xc3\xa1tof and Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna. Simon stands near the\n    door.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Please come in, all you doubters! Though we have a\nnew and accidentally discovered medium, I expect very important\nphenomena to-night.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. That\'s very, very interesting.\n\nFAT LADY [pointing to Simon] _Mais il est tr\xc3\xa8s bien!_[12]\n\n  [12] FAT LADY. But he looks quite nice.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, as a butler\'s assistant, but hardly\xc2\xa0...\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Wives never have any faith in their husbands\' work. You don\'t\nbelieve in anything of this kind?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Of course not. Kaptch\xc3\xadtch, it is true, has something\nexceptional about him, but Heaven knows what all this is about!\n\nFAT LADY. No, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, permit me, you can\'t decide it in such a\nway. Before I was married, I once had a remarkable dream. Dreams, you\nknow, are often such that you don\'t know where they begin and where they\nend; it was just such a dream that I\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Enter Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch and Petr\xc3\xadstchef.\n\nFAT LADY. And much was revealed to me by that dream. Nowadays the young\npeople [points to Petr\xc3\xadstchef and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch] deny everything.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. But look here, you know--now I, for instance, never\ndeny anything! Eh, what?\n\n    Betsy and M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna enter, and begin talking to\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef.\n\nFAT LADY. And how can one deny the supernatural? They say it is\nunreasonable. But what if one\'s reason is stupid; what then? There now,\non Garden Street, you know ... why, well, it appeared every evening! My\nhusband\'s brother--what do you call him? Not _beau-fr\xc3\xa8re_--what\'s the\nother name for it?--I never can remember the names of these different\nrelationships--well, he went there three nights running, and still he\nsaw nothing; so I said to him\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, who is going to stay here?\n\nFAT LADY. I! I!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Doctor] Do you mean to say you are going to stay?\n\nDOCTOR. Yes; I must see, if only once, what it is that Alex\xc3\xa9y\nVlad\xc3\xadmiritch has discovered in it. How can we deny anything without\nproofs?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Then I am to take it to-night for certain?\n\nDOCTOR. Take what?... Oh, the powder. Yes, it would perhaps be better.\nYes, yes, take it.... However, I shall come upstairs again.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes please, do. [Loud] When it is over, _mesdames et\nmessieurs_, I shall expect you to come to me upstairs to rest from your\nemotions, and then we will finish our rubber.\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, certainly.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, thanks!\n\n    Exit Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\n\nBETSY [to Petr\xc3\xadstchef] You must stay, I tell you. I promise you\nsomething extraordinary. Will you bet?\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. But you don\'t believe in it?\n\nBETSY. To-day I do.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA [to Petr\xc3\xadstchef] And do you believe?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. "I can\'t believe, I cannot trust a heart for falsehood\nframed." Still, if Elizabeth Leon\xc3\xaddovna commands\xc2\xa0...\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Let us stay, M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna. Eh, what? I shall\ninvent something _\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa2tant_.\n\nM\xc3\x81RYA KONSTANT\xc3\x8dNOVNA. No, you mustn\'t make me laugh. You know I can\'t\nrestrain myself.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH [loud] I remain!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [severely] But I beg those who remain not to joke\nabout it. It is a serious matter.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Do you hear? Well then, let\'s stay. Vovo, sit here, and\ndon\'t be too shy.\n\nBETSY. Yes, it\'s all very well for you to laugh; but just wait till you\nsee what will happen.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Oh, but supposing it\'s true? Won\'t it be a go! Eh,\nwhat?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [trembles] Oh, I\'m afraid, I\'m afraid! M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna,\nI\'m afraid! My tootsies tremble.\n\nBETSY [laughing] Not so loud.\n\n    All sit down.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Take your seats, take your seats. Simon, sit down!\n\nSIMON. Yes, sir. [Sits down on the edge of the chair].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Sit properly.\n\nPROFESSOR. Sit straight in the middle of the chair, and quite at your\nease. [Arranges Simon on his chair].\n\n    Betsy, M\xc3\xa1rya Konstant\xc3\xadnovna and Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch laugh.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [raising his voice] I beg those who are going to\nremain here not to behave frivolously, but to regard this matter\nseriously, or bad results might follow. Do you hear, Vovo! If you can\'t\nbe quiet, go away!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Quite quiet! [Hides behind Fat Lady].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch, will you mesmerise him?\n\nPROFESSOR. No; why should I do it when Ant\xc3\xb3n Bor\xc3\xadsitch is here? He has\nhad far more practice and has more power in that department than I....\nAnt\xc3\xb3n Bor\xc3\xadsitch!\n\nGROSSMAN. Ladies and gentlemen, I am not, strictly speaking, a\nspiritualist. I have only studied hypnotism. It is true I have studied\nhypnotism in all its known manifestations; but what is called\nspiritualism, is entirely unknown to me. When a subject is thrown into a\ntrance, I may expect the hypnotic phenomena known to me: lethargy,\nabulia, an\xc3\xa6sthesia, analgesia, catalepsy, and every kind of\nsusceptibility to suggestion. Here it is not these but other phenomena\nwe expect to observe. Therefore it would be well to know of what kind\nare the phenomena we expect to witness, and what is their scientific\nsignificance.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I thoroughly agree with Mr. Grossman. Such an explanation would\nbe very interesting.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I think Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch will not refuse to give\nus a short explanation.\n\nPROFESSOR. Why not? I can give an explanation if it is desired. [To the\nDoctor] Will you kindly note his temperature and pulse? My explanation\nmust, of necessity, be cursory and brief.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, please; briefly, quite briefly.\n\nDOCTOR. All right. [Takes out thermometer] Now then, my lad\xc2\xa0... [Places\nthe thermometer].\n\nSIMON. Yes, sir!\n\nPROFESSOR [rising and addressing the Fat Lady--then reseating himself]\nLadies and gentlemen! The phenomenon we are investigating to-night is\nregarded, on the one hand, as something new; and, on the other, as\nsomething transcending the limits of natural conditions. Neither view is\ncorrect. This phenomenon is not new but is as old as the world; and it\nis not supernatural but is subject to the eternal laws that govern all\nthat exists. This phenomenon has been usually defined as "intercourse\nwith the spirit world." That definition is inexact. Under such a\ndefinition the spirit world is contrasted with the material world. But\nthis is erroneous; there is no such contrast! Both worlds are so closely\nconnected that it is impossible to draw a line of demarcation,\nseparating the one from the other. We say, matter is composed of\nmolecules\xc2\xa0...\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Prosy matter! [Whispering and laughter].\n\nPROFESSOR [pauses, then continues] Molecules are composed of atoms, but\nthe atoms, having no extension, are in reality nothing but the points\nof application of forces. Strictly speaking, not of forces but of\nenergy, that same energy which is as much a unity and just as\nindestructible as matter. But matter, though one, has many different\naspects, and the same is true of energy. Till recently only four forms\nof energy, convertible into one another, have been known to us: energies\nknown as the dynamic, the thermal, the electric, and the chemic. But\nthese four aspects of energy are far from exhausting all the varieties\nof its manifestation. The forms in which energy may manifest itself are\nvery diverse, and it is one of these new and as yet but little known\nphases of energy, that we are investigating to-night. I refer to\nmediumistic energy.\n\n    Renewed whispering and laughter among the young people.\n\nPROFESSOR [stops and casts a severe look round] Mediumistic energy has\nbeen known to mankind for ages: prophecy, presentiments, visions and so\non, are nothing but manifestations of mediumistic energy. The\nmanifestations produced by it have, I say, been known to mankind for\nages. But the energy itself has not been recognised as such till quite\nrecently--not till that medium, the vibrations of which cause the\nmanifestations of mediumistic energy, was recognised. In the same way\nthat the phenomena of light were inexplicable until the existence of an\nimponderable substance--an ether--was recognised, so mediumistic\nphenomena seemed mysterious until the now fully established fact was\nrecognised, that between the particles of ether there exists another\nstill more rarified imponderable substance not subject to the law of the\nthree dimensions\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Renewed laughter, whispers, and giggling.\n\nPROFESSOR [again looks round severely] And just as mathematical\ncalculations have irrefutably proved the existence of imponderable ether\nwhich gives rise to the phenomena of light and electricity, so the\nsuccessive investigations of the ingenious Hermann, of Schmidt, and of\nJoseph Schmatzhofen, have confirmed beyond a doubt the existence of a\nsubstance which fills the universe and may be called spiritual ether.\n\nFAT LADY. Ah, now I understand. I am so grateful\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, but Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch, could you not ...\ncondense it a little?\n\nPROFESSOR [not heeding the remark] And so, as I have just had the honour\nof mentioning to you, a succession of strictly scientific experiments\nhave made plain to us the laws of mediumistic phenomena. These\nexperiments have proved that, when certain individuals are plunged into\na hypnotic state (a state differing from ordinary sleep only by the fact\nthat man\'s physiological activity is not lowered by the hypnotic\ninfluence but, on the contrary, is always heightened--as we have\nrecently witnessed) when, I say, any individual is plunged into such a\nstate, this always produces certain perturbations in the spiritual\nether--perturbations quite similar to those produced by plunging a solid\nbody into liquid matter. These perturbations are what we call\nmediumistic phenomena\xc2\xa0...\n\n    Laughter, and whispers.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. That is quite comprehensible and correct; but if, as you are\nkind enough to inform us, the plunging of the medium into a trance\nproduces perturbations of the spiritual ether, allow me to ask why (as\nis usually supposed to be the case in spiritualistic s\xc3\xa9ances) these\nperturbations result in an activity on the part of the souls of dead\npeople?\n\nPROFESSOR. It is because the molecules of this spiritual ether are\nnothing but the souls of the living, the dead, and the unborn, and any\nvibration of the spiritual ether must inevitably cause a certain\nvibration of its atoms. These atoms are nothing but human souls, which\nenter into communication with one another by means of these movements.\n\nFAT LADY [to Sah\xc3\xa1tof] What is it that puzzles you? It is so simple....\nThank you so, so much!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I think everything has now been explained, and that\nwe may commence.\n\nDOCTOR. The fellow is in a perfectly normal condition: temperature 37\ndecimal 2, pulse 74.\n\nPROFESSOR [takes out his pocket-book and notes this down] What I have\njust had the honour of explaining will be confirmed by the fact, which\nwe shall presently have an opportunity of observing, that after the\nmedium has been thrown into a trance his temperature and pulse will\ninevitably rise, just as occurs in cases of hypnotism.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, yes. But excuse me a moment. I should like to\nreply to Serg\xc3\xa9y Iv\xc3\xa1nitch\'s question: How do we know we are in\ncommunication with the souls of the dead? We know it because the spirit\nthat appears, plainly tells us--as simply as I am speaking to you--who\nhe is, and why he has come, and whether all is well with him! At our\nlast s\xc3\xa9ance a Spaniard, Don Castillos, came to us, and he told us\neverything. He told us who he was, and when he died, and that he was\nsuffering for having taken part in the Inquisition. He even told us what\nwas happening to him at the very time that he was speaking to us,\nnamely, that at the very time he was talking to us he had to be born\nagain on earth, and, therefore, could not continue his conversation with\nus.... But you\'ll see for yourselves\xc2\xa0...\n\nFAT LADY [interrupting] Oh, how interesting! Perhaps the Spaniard was\nborn in one of our houses and is a baby now!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Quite possibly.\n\nPROFESSOR. I think it is time we began.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I was only going to say\xc2\xa0...\n\nPROFESSOR. It is getting late.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Very well. Then we will commence. Ant\xc3\xb3n Bor\xc3\xadsitch, be\nso good as to hypnotise the medium.\n\nGROSSMAN. What method would you like me to use? There are several\nmethods. There is Braid\'s system, there is the Egyptian symbol, and\nthere is Charcot\'s system.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [to the Professor] I think it is quite immaterial.\n\nPROFESSOR. Quite.\n\nGROSSMAN. Then I will make use of my own method, which I showed in\nOdessa.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. If you please!\n\n    Grossman waves his arms above Simon. Simon closes his eyes and\n    stretches himself.\n\nGROSSMAN [looking closely at him] He is falling asleep! He is asleep! A\nremarkably rapid occurrence of hypnosis. The subject has evidently\nalready reached a state of an\xc3\xa6sthesia. He is remarkable,--an unusually\nimpressionable subject, and might be subjected to interesting\nexperiments!... [Sits down, rises, sits down again] Now one might run a\nneedle into his arm. If you like\xc2\xa0...\n\nPROFESSOR [to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] Do you notice how the medium\'s trance\nacts on Grossman? He is beginning to vibrate.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, yes ... can the lights be extinguished now?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. But why is darkness necessary?\n\nPROFESSOR. Darkness? Because it is a condition of the manifestation of\nmediumistic energy, just as a given temperature is a condition necessary\nfor certain manifestations of chemical or dynamic energy.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. But not always. Manifestations have been observed by\nme, and by many others, both by candlelight and daylight.\n\nPROFESSOR [interrupting] May the lights be put out?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, certainly. [Puts out candles] Ladies and\ngentlemen! attention, if you please.\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya gets from under the sofa and takes hold of a thread tied to a\n    chandelier.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. I like that Spaniard! Just in the midst of a\nconversation--off he goes head downwards ... as the French say: _piquer\nune t\xc3\xaate_.[13]\n\n  [13] To take a header.\n\nBETSY. You just wait a bit, and see what will happen!\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. I have only one fear, and that is that Vovo may be moved by\nthe spirit to grunt like a pig!\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Would you like me to? I will\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Gentlemen! Silence, if you please!\n\n    Silence. Simon licks the matches on his fingers and rubs his\n    knuckles with them.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. A light! Do you see the light?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. A light? Yes, yes, I see; but allow me\xc2\xa0...\n\nFAT LADY. Where? Where? Oh dear, I did not see it! Ah, there it is.\nOh!...\n\nPROFESSOR [whispers to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, and points to Grossman, who is\nmoving] Do you notice how he vibrates? It is the dual influence. [The\nlight appears again].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [to the Professor] It must be he--you know!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Who?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. A Greek, Nicholas. It is his light. Don\'t you think\nso, Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Who is this Greek, Nicholas?\n\nPROFESSOR. A certain Greek, who was a monk at Constantinople under\nConstantine and who has been visiting us lately.\n\nFAT LADY. Where is he? Where is he? I don\'t see him.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. He is not yet visible ... Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch, he is\nparticularly well disposed towards you. You question him.\n\nPROFESSOR [in a peculiar voice] Nicholas! Is that you?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya raps twice on the wall.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [joyfully] It is he! It is he!\n\nFAT LADY. Oh dear! Oh! I shall go away!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Why do you suppose it is he?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Why, the two knocks. It is an affirmative answer;\nelse all would have been silence.\n\n    Silence. Suppressed giggling in the young people\'s corner. T\xc3\xa1nya\n    throws a lampshade, pencil and penwiper upon the table.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [whispers] Do you notice, gentlemen, here is a\nlamp-shade, and something else--a pencil!... Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch, it is\na pencil!\n\nPROFESSOR. All right, all right! I am watching both him and Grossman!\n\n    Grossman rises and feels the things that have fallen on the table.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Excuse me, excuse me! I should like to see whether it is not\nthe medium who is doing it all himself?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Do you think so? Well, sit by him and hold his hands.\nBut you may be sure he is asleep.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [approaches. T\xc3\xa1nya lets a thread touch his head. He is\nfrightened, and stoops]. Ye ... ye ... yes! Strange, very strange!\n[Takes hold of Simon\'s elbow. Simon howls].\n\nPROFESSOR [to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] Do you notice the effect of Grossman\'s\npresence? It is a new phenomenon--I must note it\xc2\xa0... [Runs out to note\nit down, and returns again].\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes.... But we cannot leave Nicholas without an\nanswer. We must begin\xc2\xa0...\n\nGROSSMAN [rises, approaches Simon and raises and lowers his arm] It\nwould be interesting to produce contraction! The subject is in profound\nhypnosis.\n\nPROFESSOR [to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] Do you see? Do you see?\n\nGROSSMAN. If you like\xc2\xa0...\n\nDOCTOR. Now then, my dear sir, leave the management to Alex\xc3\xa9y\nVlad\xc3\xadmiritch, the affair is turning out serious.\n\nPROFESSOR. Leave him alone, he [referring to Grossman] is talking in his\nsleep!\n\nFAT LADY. How glad I now am that I resolved to be present! It is\nfrightening, but all the same I am glad, for I always said to my\nhusband\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Silence, if you please.\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya draws a thread over the Fat Lady\'s head.\n\nFAT LADY. Aie!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. What? What is it?\n\nFAT LADY. He took hold of my hair!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [whispers] Never mind, don\'t be afraid, give him your\nhand. His hand will be cold, but I like it.\n\nFAT LADY [hides her hands] Not for the world!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Yes, it is strange, very strange!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. He is here and is seeking for intercourse. Who wishes\nto put a question to him?\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I should like to put a question, if I may.\n\nPROFESSOR. Please do.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Do I believe or not?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya knocks twice.\n\nPROFESSOR. The answer is affirmative.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Allow me to ask again. Have I a ten rouble note in my pocket?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya knocks several times and passes a thread over Sah\xc3\xa1tof\'s head.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Ah! [Seizes the thread and breaks it].\n\nPROFESSOR. I should ask those present not to ask indefinite or trivial\nquestions. It is unpleasant to _him_!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. No, but allow me! Here I have a thread in my hand!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. A thread? Hold it fast; that happens often, and not\nonly threads but sometimes even silk cords--very ancient ones!\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. No--but where did this thread come from?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya throws a cushion at him.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. Wait a bit; wait! Something soft has hit me on the head. Light\na candle--there is something\xc2\xa0...\n\nPROFESSOR. We beg of you not to interrupt the manifestations.\n\nFAT LADY. For goodness\' sake don\'t interrupt! I should also like to ask\nsomething. May I?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, if you like.\n\nFAT LADY. I should like to ask about my digestion. May I? I want to know\nwhat to take: aconite or belladonna?\n\n    Silence, whispers among the young people; suddenly Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\n    begins to cry like a baby: "ou-a, ou-a!" [Laughter.] Holding their\n    mouths and noses, the girls and Petr\xc3\xadstchef run away bursting with\n    laughter.\n\nFAT LADY. Ah, that must be the monk who\'s been born again!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [beside himself with anger, whispers] One gets nothing\nbut tomfoolery from you! If you don\'t know how to behave decently, go\naway!\n\n    Exit Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch. Darkness and silence.\n\nFAT LADY. Oh, what a pity! Now one can\'t ask any more! He is born!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Not at all. It is only Vovo\'s nonsense. But _he_ is\nhere. Ask him.\n\nPROFESSOR. That often happens. These jokes and ridicule are quite usual\noccurrences. I expect _he_ is still here. But we may ask. Leon\xc3\xadd\nFy\xc3\xb3doritch, will you?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. No, you, if you please. This has upset me. So\nunpleasant! Such want of tact!...\n\nPROFESSOR. Very well.... Nicholas, are you here?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya raps twice and rings. Simon roars, spreads his arms out,\n    seizes Sah\xc3\xa1tof and the Professor--squeezing them.\n\nPROFESSOR. What an unexpected phenomenon! The medium himself reacted\nupon! This never happened before! Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, will you watch? It\nis difficult for me to do so. He squeezes me so! Mind you observe\nGrossman! This needs the very greatest attention!\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya throws the peasants\' paper on the table.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Something has fallen upon the table.\n\nPROFESSOR. See what it is!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Paper! A folded paper!\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya throws a travelling inkstand on the table.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. An inkstand!\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya throws a pen.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. A pen!\n\n    Simon roars and squeezes.\n\nPROFESSOR [crushed] Wait a bit, wait: a totally new manifestation! The\naction proceeding not from the mediumistic energy produced, but from the\nmedium himself! However, open the inkstand, and put the pen on the\ntable, and _he_ will write!\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya goes behind Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch and strikes him on the head with\n    the guitar.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. He has struck me on the head! [Examining table] The\npen is not writing yet and the paper remains folded.\n\nPROFESSOR. See what the paper is, and quickly; evidently the dual\ninfluence--his and Grossman\'s--has produced a perturbation!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [goes out and returns at once] Extraordinary! This\npaper is an agreement with some peasants that I refused to sign this\nmorning and returned to the peasants. Probably _he_ wants me to sign it?\n\nPROFESSOR. Of course! Of course! But ask him.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Nicholas, do you wish\xc2\xa0...\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya knocks twice.\n\nPROFESSOR. Do you hear? It is quite evident!\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch takes the paper and pen and goes out. T\xc3\xa1nya\n    knocks, plays on the guitar and the accordion, and then creeps under\n    the sofa. Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch returns. Simon stretches himself and\n    coughs.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. He is waking up. We can light the candles.\n\nPROFESSOR [hurriedly] Doctor, Doctor, please, his pulse and temperature!\nYou will see that a rise of both will be apparent.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [lights the candles] Well, what do you gentlemen who\nwere sceptical think of it now?\n\nDOCTOR [goes up to Simon and places thermometer] Now then my lad. Well,\nhave you had a nap? There, put that in there, and give me your hand.\n[Looks at his watch].\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [shrugging his shoulders] I must admit that all that has\noccurred cannot have been done by the medium. But the thread?... I\nshould like the thread explained.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. A thread! A thread! We have been witnessing\nmanifestations more important than a thread.\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I don\'t know. At all events, _je r\xc3\xa9serve mon opinion_.\n\nFAT LADY [to Sah\xc3\xa1tof] Oh no, how can you say: "_je r\xc3\xa9serve mon\nopinion?_" And the infant with the little wings? Didn\'t you see? At\nfirst I thought it was only an illusion, but afterwards it became\nclearer and clearer, like a live\xc2\xa0...\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF. I can only speak of what I have seen. I did not see\nthat--nothing of the kind.\n\nFAT LADY. You don\'t mean to say so? Why, it was quite plainly visible!\nAnd to the left there was a monk clothed in black bending over it\xc2\xa0...\n\nSAH\xc3\x81TOF [moves away. Aside] What exaggeration!\n\nFAT LADY [addressing the Doctor] You must have seen it! It rose up from\nyour side.\n\n    Doctor goes on counting pulse without heeding her.\n\nFAT LADY [to Grossman] And that light, the light around it, especially\naround its little face! And the expression so mild and tender, something\nso heavenly! [Smiles tenderly herself].\n\nGROSSMAN. I saw phosphorescent light, and objects changed their places,\nbut I saw nothing more than that.\n\nFAT LADY. Don\'t tell me! You don\'t mean it! It is simply that you\nscientists of Charcot\'s school do not believe in a life beyond the\ngrave! As for me, no one could now make me disbelieve in a future\nlife--no one in the world!\n\n    Grossman moves away from her.\n\nFAT LADY. No, no, whatever you may say, this is one of the happiest\nmoments of my life! When I heard Sarasate play, and now.... Yes! [No one\nlistens to her. She goes up to Simon] Now tell me, my friend, what did\nyou feel? Was it very trying?\n\nSIMON [laughs] Yes, ma\'m, just so.\n\nFAT LADY. Still not unendurable?\n\nSIMON. Just so, ma\'m. [To Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] Am I to go?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, you may go.\n\nDOCTOR [to the Professor] The pulse is the same, but the temperature is\nlower.\n\nPROFESSOR. Lower! [Considers awhile, then suddenly divines the\nconclusion] It had to be so--it had to descend! The dual influence\ncrossing had to produce some kind of reflex action. Yes, that\'s it!\n\n    Exeunt, all talking at once.\n\n  { LEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. I\'m only sorry we had no complete\n  { materialisation. But still.... Come, gentlemen, let us go to the\n  { drawing-room?\n  {\n  { FAT LADY. What specially struck me was when he flapped his wings,\n  { and one saw how he rose!\n  {\n  { GROSSMAN [to Sah\xc3\xa1tof] If we had kept to hypnotism, we might have\n  { produced a thorough state of epilepsy. The success might have been\n  { complete!\n  {\n  { SAH\xc3\x81TOF. It is very interesting, but not entirely convincing. That\n  { is all I can say.\n\n    Enter Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH [with paper in his hand] Ah, Theodore, what a\nremarkable s\xc3\xa9ance we have had! It turns out that the peasants must have\nthe land on their own terms.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Dear me!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Yes, indeed. [Showing paper] Fancy, this paper that I\nreturned to them, suddenly appeared on the table! I have signed it.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. How did it get there?\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, it did get there! [Exit, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch\nfollows him out].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [gets from under the sofa and laughs] Oh dear, oh dear! Well, I\ndid get a fright when he got hold of the thread! [Shrieks] Well, anyhow,\nit\'s all right--he has signed it!\n\n    Enter Gregory.\n\nGREGORY. So it was you that was fooling them?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. What business is it of yours?\n\nGREGORY. And do you think the missis will be pleased with you for it?\nNo, you bet; you\'re caught now! I\'ll tell them what tricks you\'re up to,\nif you don\'t let me have my way!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. And you\'ll not get your way, and you\'ll not do me any harm!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n    The same scene as in Act I. The next day. Two liveried footmen,\n    Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch and Gregory.\n\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN [with grey whiskers] Yours is the third house to-day.\nThank goodness that all the at-homes are in this direction. Yours used\nto be on Thursdays.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, we changed to Saturday so as to be on the same\nday as the Gol\xc3\xb3vkins and Grade von Grabes\xc2\xa0...\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. The Stcherb\xc3\xa1kofs do the thing well. There\'s refreshments\nfor the footmen every time they\'ve a ball.\n\n    The two Princesses, mother and daughter, come down the stairs\n    accompanied by Betsy. The old Princess looks in her note-book and at\n    her watch, and sits down on the settle. Gregory puts on her\n    overshoes.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. Now, do come. Because, if you refuse, and Dodo refuses,\nthe whole thing will be spoilt.\n\nBETSY. I don\'t know. I must certainly go to the Sho\xc3\xbabins. And then there\nis the rehearsal.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. You\'ll have plenty of time. Do, please. _Ne nous fais\npas faux bond._[14] F\xc3\xa9dya and Koko will come.\n\n  [14] Do not disappoint us.\n\nBETSY. _J\'en ai par-dessus la t\xc3\xaate de votre Koko._[15]\n\n  [15] BETSY. I have more than enough of your Koko.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. I thought I should see him here. _Ordinairement il est\nd\'une exactitude\xc2\xa0..._[16]\n\n  [16] YOUNG PRINCESS. ... He is usually so very punctual\xc2\xa0...\n\nBETSY. He is sure to come.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. When I see you together, it always seems to me that he\nhas either just proposed or is just going to propose.\n\nBETSY. Yes, I don\'t suppose it can be avoided. I shall have to go\nthrough with it. And it is so unpleasant!\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. Poor Koko! He is head over ears in love.\n\nBETSY. _Cessez, les gens!_[17]\n\n  [17] BETSY. Cease; mind the servants!\n\n    Young Princess sits down, talking in whispers. Gregory puts on her\n    overshoes.\n\nYOUNG PRINCESS. Well then, good-bye till this evening.\n\nBETSY. I\'ll try to come.\n\nOLD PRINCESS. Then tell your papa that I don\'t believe in anything of\nthe kind, but will come to see his new medium. Only he must let me know\nwhen. Good afternoon, _ma toute belle_. [Kisses Betsy, and exit,\nfollowed by her daughter. Betsy goes upstairs].\n\nGREGORY. I don\'t like putting on an old woman\'s overshoes for her; she\ncan\'t stoop, can\'t see her shoe for her stomach, and keeps poking her\nfoot in the wrong place. It\'s different with a young one; it\'s pleasant\nto take her foot in one\'s hand.\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. Hear him! Making distinctions!\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. It\'s not for us footmen to make such distinctions.\n\nGREGORY. Why shouldn\'t one make distinctions; are we not men? It\'s they\nthink we don\'t understand! Just now they were deep in their talk, then\nthey look at me, and at once it\'s "lay zhon!"\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. And what\'s that?\n\nGREGORY. Oh, that means, "Don\'t talk, they understand!" It\'s the same at\ntable. But I understand! You say, there\'s a difference? I say there is\nnone.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. There is a great difference for those who understand.\n\nGREGORY. There is none at all. To-day I am a footman, and to-morrow I\nmay be living no worse than they are. Has it never happened that they\'ve\nmarried footmen? I\'ll go and have a smoke. [Exit].\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. That\'s a bold young man you\'ve got.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. A worthless fellow, not fit for service. He used to\nbe an office boy and has got spoilt. I advised them not to take him, but\nthe mistress liked him. He looks well on the carriage when they drive\nout.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. I should like to send him to our Count; he\'d put him in\nhis place! Oh, he don\'t like those scatterbrains. "If you\'re a footman,\nbe a footman and fulfil your calling." Such pride is not befitting.\n\n    Petr\xc3\xadstchef comes running downstairs, and takes out a cigarette.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [deep in thought] Let\'s see, my second is the same as my\nfirst. Echo, a-co, co-coa. [Enter Koko Kl\xc3\xadngen, wearing his pince-nez]\nKo-ko, co-coa. Cocoa tin, where do you spring from?\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. From the Stcherb\xc3\xa1kofs. You are always playing the fool\xc2\xa0...\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. No, listen to my charade. My first is the same as my\nsecond, my third may be cracked, my whole is like your pate.\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. I give it up. I\'ve no time.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Where else are you going?\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. Where? Of course to the \xc3\x8dvins, to practise for the\nconcert. Then to the Sho\xc3\xbabins, and then to the rehearsal. You\'ll be\nthere too, won\'t you?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Most certainly. At the re-her-Sall and also at the\nre-her-Sarah. Why, at first I was a savage, and now I am both a savage\nand a general.\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. How did yesterday\'s s\xc3\xa9ance go off?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Screamingly funny! There was a peasant, and above all, it\nwas all in the dark. Vovo cried like an infant, the Professor defined,\nand M\xc3\xa1rya Vas\xc3\xadlevna refined. Such a lark! You ought to have been there.\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. I\'m afraid, _mon cher_. You have a way of getting off with\na jest, but I always feel that if I say a word, they\'ll construe it into\na proposal. _Et \xc3\xa7a ne m\'arrange pas du tout, du tout. Mais du tout, du\ntout!_[18]\n\n  [18] And that won\'t suit me at all, at all! Not at all, at all!\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Instead of a proposal, make a proposition, and receive a\nsentence! Well, I shall go in to Vovo\'s. If you\'ll call for me, we can\ngo to the re-her-Sarah together.\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. I can\'t think how you can be friends with such a fool. He\nis so stupid,--a regular blockhead!\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. And I am fond of him. I love Vovo, but ... "with a love so\nstrange, ne\'er towards him the path untrod shall be"\xc2\xa0... [Exit into\nVovo\'s room].\n\n    Betsy comes down with a Lady. Koko bows significantly to Betsy.\n\nBETSY [shaking Koko\'s hand without turning towards him. To Lady] You are\nacquainted?\n\nLADY. No.\n\nBETSY. Baron Kl\xc3\xadngen.... Why were you not here last night?\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. I could not come, I was engaged.\n\nBETSY. What a pity, it was so interesting! [Laughs] You should have seen\nwhat manifestations we had! Well, how is our charade getting on?\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. Oh, the verses for _mon second_ are ready. Nick composed\nthe verses, and I the music.\n\nBETSY. What are they? What are they? Do tell me!\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. Wait a minute; how does it go?... Oh, the knight sings:\n\n        "Oh, _naught_ so beautiful as nature:\n         The _Nautilus_ sails by.\n         Oh, _naughty_ lass, oh, _naughty_ lass!\n         Oh, _nought_, oh _nought_! Oh fie!"\n\nLADY. I see, my second is "nought," and what is my first?\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. My first is _Aero_, the name of a girl savage.\n\nBETSY. _Aero_, you see, is a savage who wished to devour the object of\nher love. [Laughs] She goes about lamenting, and sings--\n\n        "My appetite,"\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN [interrupts]--\n\n        "How can I fight,"\xc2\xa0...\n\nBETSY [chimes in]--\n\n        "Some one to chew I long.\n         I seeking go\xc2\xa0..."\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN--\n\n        "But even so\xc2\xa0..."\n\nBETSY--\n\n        "No one to chew can find."\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN--\n\n        "A raft sails by,"\n\nBETSY--\n\n        "It cometh nigh;\n         Two generals upon it\xc2\xa0..."\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN--\n\n        "Two generals are we:\n         By fate\'s hard decree,\n         To this island we flee."\n\nAnd then, the refrain--\n\n        "By fate\'s hard decree,\n         To this island we flee."\n\nLADY. _Charmant!_\n\nBETSY. But just think how silly!\n\nKOKO KL\xc3\x8dNGEN. Yes, that\'s the charm of it!\n\nLADY. And who is to be Aero?\n\nBETSY. I am. And I have had a costume made, but mamma says it\'s "not\ndecent." And it is not a bit less decent than a ball dress. [To Theodore\nIv\xc3\xa1nitch] Is Bourdier\'s man here?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, he is waiting in the kitchen.\n\nLADY. Well, and how will you represent Aeronaut?\n\nBETSY. Oh, you\'ll see. I don\'t want to spoil the pleasure for you. _Au\nrevoir._\n\nLADY. Good-bye! [They bow. Exit Lady].\n\nBETSY [to Koko Kl\xc3\xadngen] Come up to mamma.\n\n    Betsy and Koko go upstairs. Jacob enters from servants\' quarters,\n    carrying a tray with teacups, cakes, &c., and goes panting across\n    the stage.\n\nJACOB [to the Footmen] How d\'you do? How d\'you do? [Footmen bow].\n\nJACOB [to Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch] Couldn\'t you tell Gregory to help a bit!\nI\'m ready to drop.... [Exit up the stairs].\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. That is a hard-working chap you\'ve got there.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Yes, a good fellow. But there now--he doesn\'t satisfy\nthe mistress, she says his appearance is ungainly. And now they\'ve gone\nand told tales about him for letting some peasants into the kitchen\nyesterday. It is a bad look-out: they may dismiss him. And he is a good\nfellow.\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. What peasants were they?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Peasants that had come from our Koursk village to buy\nsome land. It was night, and they were our fellow-countrymen, one of\nthem the father of the butler\'s assistant. Well, so they were asked into\nthe kitchen. It so happened that there was thought-reading going on.\nSomething was hidden in the kitchen, and all the gentlefolk came down,\nand the mistress saw the peasants. There was such a row! "How is this,"\nshe says; "these people may be infected, and they are let into the\nkitchen!" ... She is terribly afraid of this infection.\n\n    Enter Gregory.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Gregory, you go and help Jacob. I\'ll stay here. He\ncan\'t manage alone.\n\nGREGORY. He\'s awkward, that\'s why he can\'t manage. [Exit].\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. And what is this new mania they have got? This\ninfection!... So yours also is afraid of it?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. She fears it worse than fire! Our chief business,\nnowadays, is fumigating, washing, and sprinkling.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. I see. That\'s why there is such a stuffy smell here.\n[With animation] I don\'t know what we\'re coming to with these infection\nnotions. It\'s just detestable! They seem to have forgotten the Lord.\nThere\'s our master\'s sister, Princess Mosol\xc3\xb3va, her daughter was dying\nand, will you believe it, neither father nor mother would come near her!\nSo she died without their having taken leave of her. And the daughter\ncried, and called them to say good-bye--but they didn\'t go! The doctor\nhad discovered some infection or other! And yet their own maid and a\ntrained nurse were with her, and nothing happened to them; they\'re still\nalive!\n\n    Enter Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch and Petr\xc3\xadstchef from Vas\xc3\xadly Leon\xc3\xadditch\'s\n    room, smoking cigarettes.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Come along then, only I must take Koko--Cocoanut, with me.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. Your Koko is a regular dolt; I can\'t bear him. A\nhare-brained fellow, a regular gad-about! Without any kind of\noccupation, eternally loafing around! Eh, what?\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Well, anyhow, wait a bit, I must say good-bye.\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. All right. And I will go and look at my dogs in the\ncoachman\'s room. I\'ve got a dog there that\'s so savage, the coachman\nsaid, he nearly ate him.\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF. Who ate whom? Did the coachman really eat the dog?\n\nVAS\xc3\x8dLY LEON\xc3\x8dDITCH. You are always at it! [Puts on outdoor things and\ngoes out].\n\nPETR\xc3\x8dSTCHEF [thoughtfully] Ma-kin-tosh, Co-co-tin.... Let\'s see. [Goes\nupstairs].\n\n    Jacob runs across the stage.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What\'s the matter?\n\nJACOB. There is no more thin bread and butter. I said\xc2\xa0... [Exit].\n\nSECOND FOOTMAN. And then our master\'s little son fell ill, and they sent\nhim at once to an hotel with his nurse, and there he died without his\nmother.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. They don\'t seem to fear sin! _I_ think you cannot escape\nfrom God anywhere.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. That\'s what I think.\n\n    Jacob runs upstairs with bread and butter.\n\nFIRST FOOTMAN. One should consider too, that if we are to be afraid of\neverybody like that, we\'d better shut ourselves up within four walls, as\nin a prison, and stick there!\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya; she bows to the Footmen.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Good afternoon.\n\n    Footmen bow.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, I have a word to say to you.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, what?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. The peasants have come again, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch\xc2\xa0...\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well? I gave the paper to Simon.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I have given them the paper. They were that grateful! I can\'t say\nhow! Now they only ask you to take the money.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. But where are they?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Here, by the porch.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. All right, I\'ll tell the master.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I have another request to you, dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. What now?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, don\'t you see, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, I can\'t remain here any\nlonger. Ask them to let me go.\n\n    Enter Jacob, running.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to Jacob] What d\'you want?\n\nJACOB. Another samov\xc3\xa1r, and oranges.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Ask the housekeeper.\n\n    Exit Jacob.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to T\xc3\xa1nya] How is that?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, don\'t you see, my position is such\xc2\xa0...\n\nJACOB [runs in] There are not enough oranges.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Serve up as many as you\'ve got [Exit Jacob]. Now\'s\nnot the time! Just see what a bustle we are in.\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. But you know yourself, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, there is no end to this\nbustle; one might wait for ever--you know yourself--and my affair is for\nlife.... Dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, you have done me a good turn, be a\nfather to me now, choose the right moment and tell her, or else she\'ll\nget angry and won\'t let me have my passport.[19]\n\n  [19] Employers have charge of the servants\' passports, and in this way\n  have a hold on them in case of misconduct.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Where\'s the hurry?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Why, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, it\'s all settled now.... And I could go\nto my godmother\'s and get ready, and then after Easter we\'d get\nmarried.[20] Do tell her, dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch!\n\n  [20] See footnote, p. 28. It is customary for peasants to marry just\n  after Easter, but when spring has come and the field work begun, no\n  marriages take place among them till autumn.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Go away--this is not the place.\n\n    An elderly Gentleman comes downstairs, puts on overcoat, and goes\n    out followed by the Second Footman.\n\n    Exit T\xc3\xa1nya. Enter Jacob.\n\nJACOB. Just fancy, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, it\'s too bad! She wants to\ndischarge me now! She says, "You break everything, and forget Frisk, and\nyou let the peasants into the kitchen against my orders!" And you know\nvery well that I knew nothing about it. Taty\xc3\xa1na told me, "Take them into\nthe kitchen"; how could I tell whose order it was?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Did the mistress speak to you?\n\nJACOB. She\'s just spoken. Do speak up for me, Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch! You\nsee, my people in the country are only just getting on their feet, and\nsuppose I lose my place, when shall I get another? Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch,\ndo, please!\n\n    Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna comes down with the old Countess, whom she is seeing\n    off. The Countess has false teeth and hair. The First Footman helps\n    the Countess into her outdoor things.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Oh, most certainly, of course! I am so deeply touched.\n\nCOUNTESS. If it were not for my illness, I should come oftener to see\nyou.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You should really consult Peter Petr\xc3\xb3vitch. He is rough,\nbut nobody can soothe one as he does. He is so clear, so simple.\n\nCOUNTESS. Oh no, I shall keep to the one I am used to.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Pray, take care of yourself.\n\nCOUNTESS. _Merci, mille fois merci._[21]\n\n  [21] COUNTESS. Thank you (for your hospitality), a thousand thanks.\n\n    Gregory, dishevelled and excited, jumps out from the servants\'\n    quarters. Simon appears behind him in the doorway.\n\nSIMON. You\'d better leave her alone!\n\nGREGORY. You rascal! I\'ll teach you how to fight, you scamp, you!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What do you mean? Do you think you are in a public-house?\n\nGREGORY. This coarse peasant makes life impossible for me.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [provoked] You\'ve lost your senses. Don\'t you see? [To\nCountess] _Merci, mille fois merci. A mardi!_[22]\n\n  [22] ANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Thank you (for coming to see us), a thousand\n  thanks. Till next Tuesday!\n\n    Exeunt Countess and First Footman.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Gregory] What is the meaning of this?\n\nGREGORY. Though I do occupy the position of a footman, still I won\'t\nallow every peasant to hit me; I have my pride too.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Why, what has happened?\n\nGREGORY. Why, this Simon of yours has got so brave, sitting with the\ngentlemen, that he wants to fight!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Why? What for?\n\nGREGORY. Heaven only knows!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Simon] What is the meaning of it?\n\nSIMON. Why does he bother her?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What has happened?\n\nSIMON [smiles] Well, you see, he is always catching hold of T\xc3\xa1nya, the\nlady\'s-maid, and she won\'t have it. Well, so I just moved him aside a\nbit, just so, with my hand.\n\nGREGORY. A nice little bit! He\'s almost caved my ribs in, and has torn\nmy dress-coat, and he says, "The same power as came over me yesterday\ncomes on me again," and he begins to squeeze me.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Simon] How dare you fight in my house?\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. May I explain it to you, ma\'am? I must tell you Simon\nis not indifferent to T\xc3\xa1nya, and is engaged to her. And Gregory--one\nmust admit the truth--does not behave properly, nor honestly, to her.\nWell, so I suppose Simon got angry with him.\n\nGREGORY. Not at all! It is all his spite, because I have discovered\ntheir trickery.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What trickery?\n\nGREGORY. Why, at the s\xc3\xa9ance. All those things, last night,--it was not\nSimon but T\xc3\xa1nya who did them! I saw her getting out from under the sofa\nwith my own eyes.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. What is that? From under the sofa?\n\nGREGORY. I give you my word of honour. And it was she who threw the\npaper on the table. If it had not been for her the paper would not have\nbeen signed, nor the land sold to the peasants.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. And you saw it yourself?\n\nGREGORY. With my own eyes. Shall I call her? She\'ll not deny it.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Yes, call her.\n\n    Exit Gregory.\n\n    Noise behind the scenes. The voice of the Doorkeeper, "No, no, you\n    cannot." Doorkeeper is seen at the front door, the three Peasants\n    rush in past him, the Second Peasant first; the Third one stumbles,\n    falls on his nose, and catches hold of it.\n\nDOORKEEPER. You must not go in!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Where\'s the harm? We are not doing anything wrong. We\nonly wish to pay the money!\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it; as by laying on the signature the affair\nis come to a conclusion, we only wish to make payment with thanks.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Wait a bit with your thanks. It was all done by fraud! It\nis not settled yet. Not sold yet.... Leon\xc3\xadd.... Call Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch.\n[Exit Doorkeeper].\n\n    Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch enters, but, seeing his wife and the Peasants,\n    wishes to retreat.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. No, no, come here, please! I told you the land must not\nbe sold on credit, and everybody told you so, but you let yourself be\ndeceived like the veriest blockhead.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. How? I don\'t understand who is deceiving?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! You have grey hair,\nand you let yourself be deceived and laughed at like a silly boy. You\ngrudge your son some three hundred roubles which his social position\ndemands, and let yourself be tricked of thousands--like a fool!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Now come, Annette, try to be calm.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. We are only come about the acceptation of the sum, for\nexample\xc2\xa0...\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [taking out the money] Let us finish the matter, for\nChrist\'s sake!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Wait, wait!\n\n    Enter T\xc3\xa1nya and Gregory.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [angrily] You were in the small drawing-room during the\ns\xc3\xa9ance last night?\n\n    T\xc3\xa1nya looks round at Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, and\n    Simon, and sighs.\n\nGREGORY. It\'s no use beating about the bush; I saw you myself\xc2\xa0...\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Tell me, were you there? I know all about it, so you\'d\nbetter confess! I\'ll not do anything to you. I only want to expose him\n[pointing to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] your master.... Did you throw the paper\non the table?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. I don\'t know how to answer. Only one thing,--let me go home.\n\n    Enter Betsy unobserved.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [to Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch] There, you see! You are being made\na fool of.\n\n  [Illustration: FRUITS OF CULTURE. ACT IV.\n\n  ANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. There, you see! You are being made a fool of.]\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Let me go home, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. No, my dear! You may have caused us a loss of thousands\nof roubles. Land has been sold that ought not to be sold!\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Let me go, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. No; you\'ll have to answer for it! Such tricks won\'t do.\nWe\'ll have you up before the Justice of the Peace!\n\nBETSY [comes forward] Let her go, mamma. Or, if you wish to have her\ntried, you must have me tried too! She and I did it together.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Well, of course, if _you_ have a hand in anything, what\ncan one expect but the very worst results!\n\n    Enter the Professor.\n\nPROFESSOR. How do you do, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna? How do you do, Miss Betsy?\nLeon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch, I have brought you a report of the Thirteenth\nCongress of Spiritualists at Chicago. An amazing speech by Schmidt!\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Oh, that is interesting!\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I will tell you something much more interesting! It turns\nout that both you and my husband were fooled by this girl! Betsy takes\nit on herself, but that is only to annoy me. It was an illiterate\npeasant girl who fooled you, and you believed it all. There were no\nmediumistic phenomena last night; it was she [pointing to T\xc3\xa1nya] who did\nit!\n\nPROFESSOR [taking off his overcoat] What do you mean?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. I mean that it was she who, in the dark, played on the\nguitar and beat my husband on the head and performed all your idiotic\ntricks--and she has just confessed!\n\nPROFESSOR [smiling] What does that prove?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. It proves that your mediumism is--tomfoolery; that\'s what\nit proves!\n\nPROFESSOR. Because this young girl wished to deceive, we are to conclude\nthat mediumism is "tomfoolery," as you are pleased to express it?\n[Smiles] A curious conclusion! Very possibly this young girl may have\nwished to deceive: that often occurs. She may even have done something;\nbut then, what she did--_she_ did. But the manifestations of mediumistic\nenergy still remain manifestations of _mediumistic_ energy! It is even\nvery probable that what this young girl did, evoked (and so to say\nsolicited) the manifestation of mediumistic energy,--giving it a\ndefinite form.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Another lecture!\n\nPROFESSOR [sternly] You say, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, that this girl, and perhaps\nthis dear young lady also, did something; but the light we all saw, and,\nin the first case the fall, and in the second the rise of temperature,\nand Grossman\'s excitement and vibration--were those things also done by\nthis girl? And these are facts, Anna P\xc3\xa1vlovna, facts! No! Anna\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna, there are things which must be investigated and fully\nunderstood before they can be talked about, things too serious, too\nserious\xc2\xa0...\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. And the child that M\xc3\xa1rya Vas\xc3\xadlevna distinctly saw?\nWhy, I saw it too.... That could not have been done by this girl.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. You think yourself wise, but you are--a fool.\n\nLEON\xc3\x8dD FY\xc3\x93DORITCH. Well, I\'m going.... Alex\xc3\xa9y Vlad\xc3\xadmiritch, will you\ncome? [Exit into his study].\n\nPROFESSOR [shrugging his shoulders, follows] Oh, how far, how far, we\nstill lag behind Western Europe!\n\n    Enter Jacob.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [following Leon\xc3\xadd Fy\xc3\xb3doritch with her eyes] He has been\ntricked like a fool, and he sees nothing! [To Jacob] What do you want?\n\nJACOB. How many persons am I to lay the table for?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. For how many?... Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch! Let him give up the\nsilver plate to you. Be off, at once! It is all his fault! This man will\nbring me to my grave. Last night he nearly starved the dog that had done\nhim no harm! And, as if that were not enough, he lets the infected\npeasants into the kitchen, and now they are here again! It is all his\nfault! Be off at once! Discharge him, discharge him! [To Simon] And you,\nhorrid peasant, if you dare to have rows in my house again, I\'ll teach\nyou!\n\nSECOND PEASANT. All right, if he is a horrid peasant there\'s no good\nkeeping him; you\'d better discharge him too, and there\'s an end of it.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA [while listening to him looks at Third Peasant] Only look!\nWhy, he has a rash on his nose--a rash! He is ill; he is a hotbed of\ninfection!! Did I not give orders, yesterday, that they were not to be\nallowed into the house, and here they are again? Drive them out!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Then are we not to accept their money?\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. Their money? Oh yes, take their money; but they must be\nturned out at once, especially this one! He is quite rotten!\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. That\'s not just, lady. God\'s my witness, it\'s not just!\nYou\'d better ask my old woman, let\'s say, whether I am rotten! I\'m clear\nas crystal, let\'s say.\n\nANNA P\xc3\x81VLOVNA. He talks!... Off, off with him! It\'s all to spite me!...\nOh, I can\'t bear it, I can\'t!... Send for the doctor! [Runs away,\nsobbing. Exit also Jacob and Gregory].\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA [to Betsy] Miss Elizabeth, darling, what am I to do now?\n\nBETSY. Never mind, you go with them and I\'ll arrange it all. [Exit].\n\nFIRST PEASANT. Well, your reverence, how about the reception of the sum\nnow?\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Let us settle up, and go.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT [fumbling with the packet of bank-notes] Had I known, I\'d\nnot have come for the world. It\'s worse than a fever!\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH [to Doorkeeper] Show them into my room. There\'s a\ncounting-board there. I\'ll receive their money. Now go.\n\nDOORKEEPER. Come along.\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. And it\'s T\xc3\xa1nya you have to thank for it. But for her\nyou\'d not have had the land.\n\nFIRST PEASANT. That\'s just it. As she made the proposal, so she put it\ninto effect.\n\nTHIRD PEASANT. She\'s made men of us. Else what were we? We had so little\nland, no room to let a hen out, let\'s say, not to mention the cattle.\nGood-bye, dear! When you get to the village, come to us and eat honey.\n\nSECOND PEASANT. Let me get home and I\'ll start brewing the beer for the\nwedding! You will come?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Yes, I\'ll come, I\'ll come! [Shrieks] Simon, this is fine, isn\'t\nit? [Exeunt Peasants].\n\nTHEODORE IV\xc3\x81NITCH. Well, T\xc3\xa1nya, when you have your house I\'ll come to\nvisit you. Will you welcome me?\n\nT\xc3\x81NYA. Dear Theodore Iv\xc3\xa1nitch, just the same as we would our own father!\n[Embraces and kisses him].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n                      END OF "FRUITS OF CULTURE."\n\n\n\n\n[ Transcriber\'s Note:\n\n  The following is a list of corrections made to the original.
