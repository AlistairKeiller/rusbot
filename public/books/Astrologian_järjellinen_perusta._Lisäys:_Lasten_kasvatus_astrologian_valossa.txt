The top of it outside is flat, so that more than one\nperson can lie on it.\n\n\n\n\n                         THE POWER OF DARKNESS\n\n\n\n\nACT I\n\n    The Act takes place in autumn in a large village. The Scene\n    represents Peter\'s roomy hut. Peter is sitting on a wooden bench,\n    mending a horse-collar. An\xc3\xadsya and Akoul\xc3\xadna are spinning, and\n    singing a part-song.\n\n\nPETER [looking out of the window] The horses have got loose again. If we\ndon\'t look out they\'ll be killing the colt. Nik\xc3\xadta! Hey, Nik\xc3\xadta! Is the\nfellow deaf? [Listens. To the women] Shut up, one can\'t hear anything.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [from outside] What?\n\nPETER. Drive the horses in.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. We\'ll drive \'em in. All in good time.\n\nPETER [shaking his head] Ah, these labourers! If I were well, I\'d not\nkeep one on no account. There\'s nothing but bother with \'em. [Rises and\nsits down again] Nik\xc3\xadta!... It\'s no good shouting. One of you\'d better\ngo. Go, Ako\xc3\xbal, drive \'em in.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. What? The horses?\n\nPETER. What else?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. All right. [Exit].\n\nPETER. Ah, but he\'s a loafer, that lad ... no good at all. Won\'t stir a\nfinger if he can help it.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. You\'re so mighty brisk yourself. When you\'re not sprawling on\nthe top of the oven you\'re squatting on the bench. To goad others to\nwork is all you\'re fit for.\n\nPETER. If one weren\'t to goad you on a bit, one\'d have no roof left\nover one\'s head before the year\'s out. Oh what people!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. You go shoving a dozen jobs on to one\'s shoulders, and then do\nnothing but scold. It\'s easy to lie on the oven and give orders.\n\nPETER [sighing] Oh, if \'twere not for this sickness that\'s got hold of\nme, I\'d not keep him on another day.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [off the scene] Gee up, gee, woo. [A colt neighs, the stamping\nof horses\' feet and the creaking of the gate are heard].\n\nPETER. Bragging, that\'s what he\'s good at. I\'d like to sack him, I would\nindeed.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [mimicking him] "Like to sack him." You buckle to yourself, and\nthen talk.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [enters] It\'s all I could do to drive \'em in. That piebald\nalways will ...\n\nPETER. And where\'s Nik\xc3\xadta?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Where\'s Nik\xc3\xadta? Why, standing out there in the street.\n\nPETER. What\'s he standing there for?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. What\'s he standing there for? He stands there jabbering.\n\nPETER. One can\'t get any sense out of her! Who\'s he jabbering with?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [does not hear] Eh, what?\n\n    Peter waves her off. She sits down to her spinning.\n\nNAN [running in to her mother] Nik\xc3\xadta\'s father and mother have come.\nThey\'re going to take him away. It\'s true!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Nonsense!\n\nNAN. Yes. Blest if they\'re not! [Laughing] I was just going by, and\nNik\xc3\xadta, he says, "Good-bye, Anna Petr\xc3\xb3vna," he says, "you must come and\ndance at my wedding. I\'m leaving you," he says, and laughs.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [to her husband] There now. Much he cares. You see, he wants to\nleave of himself. "Sack him" indeed!\n\nPETER. Well, let him go. Just as if I couldn\'t find somebody else.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And what about the money he\'s had in advance?\n\n    Nan stands listening at the door for awhile, and then exit.\n\nPETER [frowning] The money? Well, he can work it off in summer, anyhow.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Well, of course you\'ll be glad if he goes and you\'ve not got to\nfeed him. It\'s only me as\'ll have to work like a horse all the winter.\nThat lass of yours isn\'t over fond of work either. And you\'ll be lying\nup on the oven. I know you.\n\nPETER. What\'s the good of wearing out one\'s tongue before one has the\nhang of the matter?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. The yard\'s full of cattle. You\'ve not sold the cow, and have\nkept all the sheep for the winter: feeding and watering \'em alone takes\nall one\'s time, and you want to sack the labourer. But I tell you\nstraight, I\'m not going to do a man\'s work! I\'ll go and lie on the top\nof the oven same as you, and let everything go to pot! You may do what\nyou like.\n\nPETER [to Akoul\xc3\xadna] Go and see about the feeding, will you? it\'s time.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. The feeding? All right. [Puts on a coat and takes a rope].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'m not going to work for you. You go and work yourself. I\'ve\nhad enough of it, so there!\n\nPETER. That\'ll do. What are you raving about? Like a sheep with the\nstaggers!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. You\'re a crazy cur, you are! One gets neither work nor pleasure\nfrom you. Eating your fill, that\'s all you do, you palsied cur, you!\n\nPETER [spits and puts on coat] Faugh! The Lord have mercy! I\'d better go\nmyself and see what\'s up. [Exit].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [after him] Scurvy long-nosed devil!\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. What are you swearing at dad for?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Hold your noise, you idiot!\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [going to the door] I know why you\'re swearing at him. You\'re\nan idiot yourself, you bitch. I\'m not afraid of you.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What do you mean? [Jumps up and looks round for something to hit\nher with] Mind, or I\'ll give you one with the poker.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [opening the door] Bitch! devil! that\'s what you are! Devil!\nbitch! bitch! devil! [Runs off].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [ponders] "Come and dance at my wedding!" What new plan is this?\nMarry? Mind, Nik\xc3\xadta, if that\'s your intention, I\'ll go and ... No, I\ncan\'t live without him. I won\'t let him go.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [enters, looks round, and seeing An\xc3\xadsya alone approaches quickly.\nIn a low tone] Here\'s a go; I\'m in a regular fix! That governor of mine\nwants to take me away,--tells me I\'m to come home. Says quite straight\nI\'m to marry and live at home.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Well, go and marry! What\'s that to me?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Is that it? Why, here am I reckoning how best to consider\nmatters, and just hear her! She tells me to go and marry. Why\'s that?\n[Winking] Has she forgotten?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Yes, go and marry! What do I care?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What are you spitting for? Just see, she won\'t even let me\nstroke her.... What\'s the matter?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. This! That you want to play me false.... If you do,--why, I\ndon\'t want you either. So now you know!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. That\'ll do, An\xc3\xadsya. Do you think I\'ll forget you? Never while I\nlive! I\'ll not play you false, that\'s flat. I\'ve been thinking that\nsupposing they do go and make me marry, I\'d still come back to you. If\nonly he don\'t make me live at home.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Much need I\'ll have of you, once you\'re married.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. There\'s a go now. How is it possible to go against one\'s\nfather\'s will?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Yes, I daresay, shove it all on your father. You know it\'s your\nown doing. You\'ve long been plotting with that slut of yours, Mar\xc3\xadna.\nIt\'s she has put you up to it. She didn\'t come here for nothing t\'other\nday.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Mar\xc3\xadna? What\'s she to me? Much I care about her!... Plenty of\nthem buzzing around.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Then what has made your father come here? It\'s you have told him\nto. You\'ve gone and deceived me. [Cries].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. An\xc3\xadsya, do you believe in a God or not? I never so much as\ndreamt of it. I know nothing at all about it. I never even dreamt of\nit--that\'s flat! My old dad has got it all out of his own pate.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. If you don\'t wish it yourself who can force you? He can\'t drive\nyou like an ass.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Well, I reckon it\'s not possible to go against one\'s parent. But\nit\'s not by my wish.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Don\'t you budge, that\'s all about it!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. There was a fellow wouldn\'t budge, and the village elder gave\nhim such a hiding.... That\'s what it might come to! I\'ve no great wish\nfor that sort of thing. They say it touches one up....\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Shut up with your nonsense. Nik\xc3\xadta, listen to me: if you marry\nthat Mar\xc3\xadna I don\'t know what I won\'t do to myself.... I shall lay hands\non myself! I have sinned, I have gone against the law, but I can\'t go\nback now. If you go away I\'ll ...\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Why should I go? Had I wanted to go--I should have gone long\nago. There was Iv\xc3\xa1n Semy\xc3\xb3nitch t\'other day--offered me a place as his\ncoachman.... Only fancy what a life that would have been! But I did not\ngo. Because, I reckon, I am good enough for any one. Now if you did not\nlove me it would be a different matter.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Yes, and that\'s what you should remember. My old man will die\none of these fine days, I\'m thinking; then we could cover our sin, make\nit all right and lawful, and then you\'ll be master here.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Where\'s the good of making plans? What do I care? I work as hard\nas if I were doing it for myself. My master loves me, and his missus\nloves me. And if the wenches run after me, it\'s not my fault, that\'s\nflat.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And you\'ll love me?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [embracing her] There, as you have ever been in my heart ...\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [enters, and crosses herself a long time before the ic\xc3\xb3n.\nNik\xc3\xadta and An\xc3\xadsya step apart] What I saw I didn\'t perceive, what I heard\nI didn\'t hearken to. Playing with the lass, eh? Well,--even a calf will\nplay. Why shouldn\'t one have some fun when one\'s young? But your master\nis out in the yard a-calling you, sonnie.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I only came to get the axe.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. I know, sonnie, I know; them sort of axes are mostly to be\nfound where the women are.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [stooping to pick up axe] I say, mother, is it true you want me\nto marry? As I reckon, that\'s quite unnecessary. Besides, I\'ve got no\nwish that way.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Eh, honey! why should you marry? Go on as you are. It\'s all\nthe old man. You\'d better go, sonnie, we can talk these matters over\nwithout you.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. It\'s a queer go! One moment I\'m to be married, the next, not. I\ncan\'t make head or tail of it. [Exit].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What\'s it all about then? Do you really wish him to get married?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Eh, why should he marry, my jewel? It\'s all nonsense, all my\nold man\'s drivel. "Marry, marry." But he\'s reckoning without his host.\nYou know the saying, "From oats and hay, why should horses stray?" When\nyou\'ve enough and to spare, why look elsewhere? And so in this case.\n[Winks] Don\'t I see which way the wind blows?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Where\'s the good of my pretending to you, Mother Matry\xc3\xb3na? You\nknow all about it. I have sinned. I love your son.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Dear me, here\'s news! D\'you think Mother Matry\xc3\xb3na didn\'t know?\nEh, lassie,--Mother Matry\xc3\xb3na\'s been ground, and ground again, ground\nfine! This much I can tell you, my jewel: Mother Matry\xc3\xb3na can see\nthrough a brick wall three feet thick. I know it all, my jewel! I know\nwhat young wives need sleeping draughts for, so I\'ve brought some along.\n[Unties a knot in her handkerchief and brings out paper-packets] As much\nas is wanted, I see, and what\'s not wanted I neither see nor perceive!\nThere! Mother Matry\xc3\xb3na has also been young. I had to know a thing or two\nto live with my old fool. I know seventy-and-seven dodges. But I see\nyour old man\'s quite seedy, quite seedy! How\'s one to live with such as\nhim? Why, if you pricked him with a hay-fork it wouldn\'t fetch blood.\nSee if you don\'t bury him before the spring. Then you\'ll need some one\nin the house. Well, what\'s wrong with my son? He\'ll do as well as\nanother. Then where\'s the advantage of my taking him away from a good\nplace? Am I my child\'s enemy?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh, if only he does not go away.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. He won\'t go away, birdie. It\'s all nonsense. You know my old\nman. His wits are always wool-gathering; yet sometimes he takes a thing\ninto his pate, and it\'s as if it were wedged in, you can\'t knock it out\nwith a hammer.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And what started this business?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well, you see, my jewel, you yourself know what a fellow with\nwomen the lad is,--and he\'s handsome too, though I say it as shouldn\'t.\nWell, you know, he was living at the railway, and they had an orphan\nwench there to cook for them. Well, that same wench took to running\nafter him.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Mar\xc3\xadna?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Yes, the plague seize her! Whether anything happened or not,\nanyhow something got to my old man\'s ears. Maybe he heard from the\nneighbours, maybe she\'s been and blabbed ...\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Well, she is a bold hussy!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. So my old man--the old blockhead--off he goes: "Marry, marry,"\nhe says, "he must marry her and cover the sin," he says. "We must take\nthe lad home," he says, "and he shall marry," he says. Well, I did my\nbest to make him change his mind, but, dear me, no. So, all right,\nthinks I,--I\'ll try another dodge. One always has to entice them fools\nin this way, just pretend to be of their mind, and when it comes to the\npoint one goes and turns it all one\'s own way. You know, a woman has\ntime to think seventy-and-seven thoughts while falling off the oven, so\nhow\'s such as he to see through it? "Well, yes," says I, "it would be a\ngood job,--only we must consider well beforehand. Why not go and see our\nson, and talk it over with Peter Ign\xc3\xa1titch and hear what he has to say?"\nSo here we are.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh dear, oh dear, how will it all end? Supposing his father just\norders him to marry her?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Orders, indeed. Chuck his orders to the dogs! Don\'t you worry;\nthat affair will never come off. I\'ll go to your old man myself, and\nsift and strain this matter clear--there will be none of it left. I have\ncome here only for the look of the thing. A very likely thing! Here\'s my\nson living in happiness and expecting happiness, and I\'ll go and match\nhim with a slut! No fear, I\'m not a fool!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And she--this Mar\xc3\xadna--came dangling after him here! Mother,\nwould you believe, when they said he was going to marry, it was as if a\nknife had gone right through my heart. I thought he cared for her.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Oh, my jewel! Why, you don\'t think him such a fool, that he\nshould go and care for a homeless baggage like that? Nik\xc3\xadta is a\nsensible fellow, you see. He knows whom to love. So don\'t you go and\nfret, my jewel. We\'ll not take him away, and we won\'t marry him. No,\nwe\'ll let him stay on, if you\'ll only oblige us with a little money.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. All I know is, that I could not live if Nik\xc3\xadta went away.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Naturally, when one\'s young it\'s no easy matter! You, a wench\nin full bloom, to be living with the dregs of a man like that husband of\nyours.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Mother Matry\xc3\xb3na, would you believe it? I\'m that sick of him,\nthat sick of this long-nosed cur of mine, I can hardly bear to look at\nhim.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Yes, I see, it\'s one of them cases. Just look here, [looks\nround and whispers] I\'ve been to see that old man, you know--he\'s given\nme simples of two kinds. This, you see, is a sleeping draught. "Just\ngive him one of these powders," he says, "and he\'ll sleep so sound you\nmight jump on him!" And this here, "This is that kind of simple," he\nsays, "that if you give one some of it to drink it has no smell\nwhatever, but its strength is very great. There are seven doses here, a\npinch at a time. Give him seven pinches," he says, "and she won\'t have\nfar to look for freedom," he says.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. O-o-oh! What\'s that?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. "No sign whatever," he says. He\'s taken a rouble for it.\n"Can\'t sell it for less," he says. Because it\'s no easy matter to get\n\'em, you know. I paid him, dearie, out of my own money. If she takes\nthem, thinks I, it\'s all right; if she don\'t, I can let old Michael\'s\ndaughter have them.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. O-o-oh! But mayn\'t some evil come of them? I\'m frightened!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. What evil, my jewel? If your old man was hale and hearty,\n\'twould be a different matter, but he\'s neither alive nor dead as it is.\nHe\'s not for this world. Such things often happen.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. O-o-oh, my poor head! I\'m afeared, Mother Matry\xc3\xb3na, lest some\nevil come of them. No. That won\'t do.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Just as you like. I might even return them to him.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And are they to be used in the same way as the others? Mixed in\nwater?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Better in tea, he says. "You can\'t notice anything," he says,\n"no smell nor nothing." He\'s a cute old fellow too.\n\n  [Illustration: THE POWER OF DARKNESS. ACT I.\n\n  MATRY\xc3\x93NA GIVES AN\xc3\x8dSYA THE POWDERS.]\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. [taking the powder] O-oh, my poor head! Could I have ever\nthought of such a thing if my life were not a very hell?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. You\'ll not forget that rouble? I promised to take it to the\nold man. He\'s had some trouble, too.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Of course? [Goes to her box and hides the powders].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. And now, my jewel, keep it as close as you can, so that no one\nshould find it out. Heaven defend that it should happen, but _if_ any\none notices it, tell \'em it\'s for the black-beetles. [Takes the rouble]\nIt\'s also used for beetles. [Stops short].\n\n    Enter Ak\xc3\xadm, who crosses himself in front of the ic\xc3\xb3n, and then\n    Peter, who sits down.\n\nPETER. Well then, how\'s it to be, Daddy Ak\xc3\xadm?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. As it\'s best, Peter Ign\xc3\xa1titch, as it\'s best ... I mean--as it\'s\nbest. \'Cos why? I\'m afeared of what d\'you call \'ems, some tomfoolery,\nyou know. I\'d like to, what d\'you call it ... to start, you know, start\nthe lad honest, I mean. But supposing you\'d rather, what d\'you call it,\nwe might, I mean, what\'s name? As it\'s best ...\n\nPETER. All right. All right. Sit down and let\'s talk it over. [Ak\xc3\xadm sits\ndown] Well then, what\'s it all about? You want him to marry?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. As to marrying, he might bide a while, Peter Ign\xc3\xa1titch. You\nknow our poverty, Peter Ign\xc3\xa1titch. What\'s he to marry on? We\'ve hardly\nenough to eat ourselves. How can he marry then?...\n\nPETER. You must consider what will be best.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Where\'s the hurry for him to get married? Marriage is not that\nsort of thing, it\'s not like ripe raspberries that drop off if not\npicked in time.\n\nPETER. If he were to get married, \'twould be a good thing in a way.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. We\'d like to ... what d\'you call it? \'Cos why, you see. I\'ve what\nd\'you call it ... a job. I mean, I\'ve found a paying job in town, you\nknow.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. And a fine job too--cleaning out cesspools. The other day when\nhe came home, I could do nothing but spew and spew. Faugh!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. It\'s true, at first it does seem what d\'you call it ... knocks one\nclean over, you know,--the smell, I mean. But one gets used to it, and\nthen it\'s nothing, no worse than malt grain, and then it\'s, what d\'you\ncall it, ... pays, pays, I mean. And as to the smell being, what d\'you\ncall it, it\'s not for the likes of us to complain. And one changes one\'s\nclothes. So we\'d like to take what\'s his name ... Nik\xc3\xadta I mean, home.\nLet him manage things at home while I, what d\'you call it,--earn\nsomething in town.\n\nPETER. You want to keep your son at home? Yes, that would be well: but\nhow about the money he has had in advance?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. That\'s it, that\'s it! It\'s just as you say, Ign\xc3\xa1titch, it\'s just\nwhat d\'you call it. \'Cos why? If you go into service, it\'s as good as if\nyou had sold yourself, they say. That will be all right. I mean he may\nstay and serve his time, only he must, what d\'you call it, get married.\nI mean--so: you let him off for a little while, that he may, what d\'you\ncall it?\n\nPETER. Yes, we could manage that.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Ah, but it\'s not yet settled between ourselves, Peter\nIgn\xc3\xa1titch. I\'ll speak to you as I would before God, and you may judge\nbetween my old man and me. He goes on harping on that marriage. But just\nask--who it is he wants him to marry. If it were a girl of the right\nsort now-- I am not my child\'s enemy, but the wench is not honest.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. No, that\'s wrong! Wrong, I say. \'Cos why? She, that same\ngirl--it\'s my son as has offended, offended the girl I mean.\n\nPETER. How offended?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. That\'s how. She\'s what d\'you call it, with him, with my son,\nNik\xc3\xadta. With Nik\xc3\xadta, what d\'you call it, I mean.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. You wait a bit, my tongue runs smoother--let me tell it. You\nknow, this lad of ours lived at the railway before he came to you. There\nwas a girl there as kept dangling after him. A girl of no account, you\nknow, her name\'s Mar\xc3\xadna. She used to cook for the men. So now this same\ngirl accuses our son, Nik\xc3\xadta, that he, so to say, deceived her.\n\nPETER. Well, there\'s nothing good in that.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. But she\'s no honest girl herself; she runs after the fellows\nlike a common slut.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. There you are again, old woman, and it\'s not at all what d\'you\ncall it, it\'s all not what d\'you call it, I mean ...\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. There now, that\'s all the sense one gets from my old\nowl--"what d\'you call it, what d\'you call it," and he doesn\'t know\nhimself what he means. Peter Ign\xc3\xa1titch, don\'t listen to me, but go\nyourself and ask any one you like about the girl, everybody will say the\nsame. She\'s just a homeless good-for-nothing.\n\nPETER. You know, Daddy Ak\xc3\xadm, if that\'s how things are, there\'s no reason\nfor him to marry her. A daughter-in-law\'s not like a shoe, you can\'t\nkick her off.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [excitedly] It\'s false, old woman, it\'s what d\'you call it, false;\nI mean, about the girl; false! \'Cos why? The lass is a good lass, a very\ngood lass, you know. I\'m sorry, sorry for the lassie, I mean.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. It\'s an old saying: "For the wide world old Miriam grieves,\nand at home without bread her children she leaves." He\'s sorry for the\ngirl, but not sorry for his own son! Sling her round your neck and carry\nher about with you! That\'s enough of such empty cackle!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. No, it\'s not empty.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. There, don\'t interrupt, let me have my say.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [interrupts] No, not empty! I mean, you twist things your own way,\nabout the lass or about yourself. Twist them, I mean, to make it better\nfor yourself; but God, what d\'you call it, turns them His way. That\'s\nhow it is.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Eh! One only wears out one\'s tongue with you.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. The lass is hard-working and spruce, and keeps everything round\nherself ... what d\'you call it. And in our poverty, you know, it\'s a\npair of hands, I mean; and the wedding needn\'t cost much. But the chief\nthing\'s the offence, the offence to the lass, and she\'s a what d\'you\ncall it, an orphan, you know; that\'s what she is, and there\'s the\noffence.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Eh! they\'ll all tell you a tale of that sort ...\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Daddy Ak\xc3\xadm, you\'d better listen to us women; we can tell you a\nthing or two.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. And God, how about God? Isn\'t she a human being, the lass? A what\nd\'you call it,--also a human being I mean, before God. And how do you\nlook at it?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Eh!... started off again?...\n\nPETER. Wait a bit, Daddy Ak\xc3\xadm. One can\'t believe all these girls say,\neither. The lad\'s alive, and not far away; send for him, and find out\nstraight from him if it\'s true. He won\'t wish to lose his soul. Go and\ncall the fellow, [An\xc3\xadsya rises] and tell him his father wants him. [Exit\nAn\xc3\xadsya].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. That\'s right, dear friend; you\'ve cleared the way clean, as\nwith water. Yes, let the lad speak for himself. Nowadays, you know,\nthey\'ll not let you force a son to marry; one must first of all ask the\nlad. He\'ll never consent to marry her and disgrace himself, not for all\nthe world. To my thinking, it\'s best he should go on living with you and\nserving you as his master. And we need not take him home for the summer\neither; we can hire a help. If you would only give us ten roubles now,\nwe\'ll let him stay on.\n\nPETER. All in good time. First let us settle one thing before we start\nanother.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. You see, Peter Ign\xc3\xa1titch, I speak. \'Cos why? you know how it\nhappens. We try to fix things up as seems best for ourselves, you know;\nand as to God, we what d\'you call it, we forget Him. We think it\'s best\nso, turn it our own way, and lo! we\'ve got into a fix, you know. We\nthink it will be best, I mean; and lo! it turns out much worse--without\nGod, I mean.\n\nPETER. Of course one must not forget God.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. It turns out worse! But when it\'s the right way--God\'s way--it\nwhat d\'you call it, it gives one joy; seems pleasant, I mean. So I\nreckon, you see, get him, the lad, I mean, get him to marry her, to keep\nhim from sin, I mean, and let him what d\'you call it at home, as it\'s\nlawful, I mean, while I go and get the job in town. The work is of the\nright sort--it\'s payin\', I mean. And in God\'s sight it\'s what d\'you call\nit--it\'s best, I mean. Ain\'t she an orphan? Here, for example, a year\nago some fellows went and took timber from the steward,--thought they\'d\ndo the steward, you know. Yes, they did the steward, but they couldn\'t\nwhat d\'you call it--do God, I mean. Well, and so ...\n\n    Enter Nik\xc3\xadta and Nan.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. You called me? [Sits down and takes out his tobacco-pouch].\n\nPETER [in a low, reproachful voice] What are you thinking about--have\nyou no manners? Your father is going to speak to you, and you sit down\nand fool about with tobacco. Come, get up!\n\n    Nik\xc3\xadta rises, leans carelessly with his elbow on the table, and\n    smiles.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. It seems there\'s a complaint, you know, about you, Nik\xc3\xadta--a\ncomplaint, I mean, a complaint.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Who\'s been complaining?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Complaining? It\'s a maid, an orphan maid, complaining, I mean.\nIt\'s her, you know--a complaint against you, from Mar\xc3\xadna, I mean.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [laughs] Well, that\'s a good one. What\'s the complaint? And who\'s\ntold you--she herself?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. It\'s I am asking you, and you must now, what d\'you call it, give\nme an answer. Have you got mixed up with the lass, I mean--mixed up, you\nknow?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I don\'t know what you mean. What\'s up?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Foolin\', I mean, what d\'you call it? foolin\'. Have you been\nfoolin\' with her, I mean?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Never mind what\'s been! Of course one does have some fun with a\ncook now and then to while away the time. One plays the concertina and\ngets her to dance. What of that?\n\nPETER. Don\'t shuffle, Nik\xc3\xadta, but answer your father straight out.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [solemnly] You can hide it from men but not from God, Nik\xc3\xadta. You,\nwhat d\'you call it--think, I mean, and don\'t tell lies. She\'s an orphan;\nso, you see, any one is free to insult her. An orphan, you see. So you\nshould say what\'s rightest.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. But what if I have nothing to say? I have told you\neverything--because there isn\'t anything to tell, that\'s flat! [Getting\nexcited] She can go and say anything about me, same as if she was\nspeaking of one as is dead. Why don\'t she say anything about F\xc3\xa9dka\nMik\xc3\xadshin? Besides, how\'s this, that one mayn\'t even have a bit of fun\nnowadays? And as for her, well, she\'s free to say anything she likes.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Ah, Nik\xc3\xadta, mind! A lie will out. Did anything happen?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [aside] How he sticks to it; it\'s too bad. [To Ak\xc3\xadm] I tell you,\nI know nothing more. There\'s been nothing between us. [Angrily] By God!\nand may I never leave this spot [crosses himself] if I know anything\nabout it. [Silence. Then still more excitedly] Why! have you been\nthinking of getting me to marry her? What do you mean by it?--it\'s a\nconfounded shame. Besides, nowadays you\'ve got no such rights as to\nforce a fellow to marry. That\'s plain enough. Besides, haven\'t I sworn I\nknow nothing about it?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [to her husband] There now, that\'s just like your silly pate,\nto believe all they tell you. He\'s gone and put the lad to shame all for\nnothing. The best thing is to let him live as he is living, with his\nmaster. His master will help us in our present need, and give us ten\nroubles, and when the time comes ...\n\nPETER. Well, Daddy Ak\xc3\xadm, how\'s it to be?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [looks at his son, clicking his tongue disapprovingly] Mind,\nNik\xc3\xadta, the tears of one that\'s been wronged never, what d\'you call\nit--never fall beside the mark but always on, what\'s name--the head of\nthe man as did the wrong. So mind, don\'t what d\'you call it.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [sits down] What\'s there to mind? mind yourself.\n\nNAN [aside] I must run and tell mother. [Exit].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [to Peter] That\'s always the way with this old mumbler of mine,\nPeter Ign\xc3\xa1titch. Once he\'s got anything wedged in his pate there\'s no\nknocking it out. We\'ve gone and troubled you all for nothing. The lad\ncan go on living as he has been. Keep him; he\'s your servant.\n\nPETER. Well, Daddy Ak\xc3\xadm, what do you say?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Why, the lad\'s his own master, if only he what d\'you call it.... I\nonly wish that, what d\'you call it, I mean.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. You don\'t know yourself what you\'re jawing about. The lad\nhimself has no wish to leave. Besides, what do we want with him at home?\nWe can manage without him.\n\nPETER. Only one thing, Daddy Ak\xc3\xadm--if you are thinking of taking him\nback in summer, I don\'t want him here for the winter. If he is to stay\nat all, it must be for the whole year.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. And it\'s for a year he\'ll bind himself. If we want help when\nthe press of work comes, we can hire help, and the lad shall remain with\nyou. Only give us ten roubles now....\n\nPETER. Well then, is it to be for another year?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. [sighing] Yes, it seems, it what d\'you call it ... if it\'s so, I\nmean, it seems that it must be what d\'you call it.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. For a year, counting from St. Dim\xc3\xadtry\'s day. We know you\'ll\npay him fair wages. But give us ten roubles now. Help us out of our\ndifficulties. [Gets up and bows to Peter].\n\n    Enter Nan and An\xc3\xadsya. The latter sits down at one side.\n\nPETER. Well, if that\'s settled we might step across to the inn and have\na drink. Come, Daddy Ak\xc3\xadm, what do you say to a glass of v\xc3\xb3dka?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. No, I never drink that sort of thing.\n\nPETER. Well, you\'ll have some tea?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Ah, tea! yes, I do sin that way. Yes, tea\'s the thing.\n\nPETER. And the women will also have some tea. Come. And you, Nik\xc3\xadta, go\nand drive the sheep in and clear away the straw.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. All right. [Exeunt all but Nik\xc3\xadta. Nik\xc3\xadta lights a cigarette. It\ngrows darker] Just see how they bother one. Want a fellow to tell \'em\nhow he larks about with the wenches! It would take long to tell \'em all\nthose stories--"Marry her," he says. Marry them all! One would have a\ngood lot of wives! And what need have I to marry? Am as good as married\nnow! There\'s many a chap as envies me. Yet how strange it felt when I\ncrossed myself before the ic\xc3\xb3n. It was just as if some one shoved me.\nThe whole web fell to pieces at once. They say it\'s frightening to swear\nwhat\'s not true. That\'s all humbug. It\'s all talk, that is. It\'s simple\nenough.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [enters with a rope, which she puts down. She takes off her\noutdoor things and goes into closet] You might at least have got a\nlight.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What, to look at you? I can see you well enough without.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Oh, bother you!\n\n    Nan enters and whispers to Nik\xc3\xadta.\n\nNAN. Nik\xc3\xadta, there\'s a person wants you. There is!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What person?\n\nNAN. Mar\xc3\xadna from the railway; she\'s out there, round the corner.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Nonsense!\n\nNAN. Blest if she isn\'t!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What does she want?\n\nNAN. She wants you to come out. She says, "I only want to say a word to\nNik\xc3\xadta." I began asking, but she won\'t tell, but only says, "Is it true\nhe\'s leaving you?" And I say, "No, only his father wanted to take him\naway and get him to marry, but he won\'t, and is going to stay with us\nanother year." And she says, "For goodness\' sake send him out to me. I\nmust see him," she says, "I must say a word to him somehow." She\'s been\nwaiting a long time. Why don\'t you go?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Bother her! What should I go for?\n\nNAN. She says, "If he don\'t come, I\'ll go into the hut to him." Blest if\nshe didn\'t say she\'d come in!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Not likely. She\'ll wait a bit and then go away.\n\nNAN. "Or is it," she says, "that they want him to marry Akoul\xc3\xadna?"\n\n    Re-enter Akoul\xc3\xadna, passing near Nik\xc3\xadta to take her distaff.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Marry whom to Akoul\xc3\xadna?\n\nNAN. Why, Nik\xc3\xadta.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. A likely thing! Who says it?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [looks at her and laughs] It seems people do say it. Would you\nmarry me, Akoul\xc3\xadna?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Who, you? Perhaps I might have afore, but I won\'t now.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. And why not now?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. \'Cos you wouldn\'t love me.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Why not?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. \'Cos you\'d be forbidden to. [Laughs].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Who\'d forbid it?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Who? My step-mother. She does nothing but grumble, and is\nalways staring at you.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [laughing] Just hear her! Ain\'t she cute?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Who? Me? What\'s there to be cute about? Am I blind? She\'s been\nrowing and rowing at dad all day. The fat-muzzled witch! [Goes into\ncloset].\n\nNAN [looking out of the window] Look, Nik\xc3\xadta, she\'s coming! I\'m blest if\nshe isn\'t! I\'ll go away. [Exit].\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA [enters] What are you doing with me?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Doing? I\'m not doing anything.\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. You mean to desert me.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [gets up angrily] What does this look like, your coming here?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. Oh, Nik\xc3\xadta!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Well, you are strange! What have you come for?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. Nik\xc3\xadta!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. That\'s my name. What do you want with Nik\xc3\xadta? Well, what next?\nGo away, I tell you!\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. I see, you do want to throw me over.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Well, and what\'s there to remember? You yourself don\'t know.\nWhen you stood out there round the corner and sent Nan for me, and I\ndidn\'t come, wasn\'t it plain enough that you\'re not wanted? It seems\npretty simple. So there--go!\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. Not wanted! So now I\'m not wanted! I believed you when you said\nyou would love me. And now that you\'ve ruined me, I\'m not wanted.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Where\'s the good of talking? This is quite improper. You\'ve been\ntelling tales to father. Now, do go away, will you?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. You know yourself I never loved any one but you. Whether you\nmarried me or not, I\'d not have been angry. I\'ve done you no wrong, then\nwhy have you left off caring for me? Why?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Where\'s the use of baying at the moon? You go away. Goodness me!\nwhat a duffer!\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. It\'s not that you deceived me when you promised to marry me that\nhurts, but that you\'ve left off loving. No, it\'s not that you\'ve stopped\nloving me either, but that you\'ve changed me for another, that\'s what\nhurts. I know who it is!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [comes up to her viciously] Eh! what\'s the good of talking to the\nlikes of you, that won\'t listen to reason? Be off, or you\'ll drive me to\ndo something you\'ll be sorry for.\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. What, will you strike me, then? Well then, strike me! What are\nyou turning away for? Ah, Nik\xc3\xadta!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Supposing some one came in. Of course, it\'s quite improper. And\nwhat\'s the good of talking?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. So this is the end of it! What has been has flown. You want me\nto forget it? Well then, Nik\xc3\xadta, listen. I kept my maiden honour as the\napple of my eye. You have ruined me for nothing, you have deceived me.\nYou have no pity on a fatherless and motherless girl! [Weeping] You have\ndeserted, you have killed me, but I bear you no malice. God forgive you!\nIf you find a better one you\'ll forget me, if a worse one you\'ll remember\nme. Yes, you will remember, Nik\xc3\xadta! Good-bye, then, if it is to be. Oh,\nhow I loved you! Good-bye for the last time. [Takes his head in her\nhands and tries to kiss him].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [tossing his head back] I\'m not going to talk with the likes of\nyou. If you won\'t go away I will, and you may stay here by yourself.\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA [screams] You are a brute. [In the doorway] God will give you no\njoy. [Exit, crying].\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [comes out of closet] You\'re a dog, Nik\xc3\xadta!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What\'s up?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. What a cry she gave! [Cries].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What\'s up with you?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. What\'s up? You\'ve hurt her so. That\'s the way you\'ll hurt me\nalso. You\'re a dog. [Exit into closet].\n\n    Silence.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Here\'s a fine muddle. I\'m as sweet as honey on the lasses, but\nwhen a fellow\'s sinned with \'em it\'s a bad look-out!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n    The scene represents the village street. To the left the outside of\n    Peter\'s hut, built of logs, with a porch in the middle; to the right\n    of the hut the gates and a corner of the yard buildings. An\xc3\xadsya is\n    beating hemp in the street near the corner of the yard. Six months\n    have elapsed since the First Act.\n\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [stops and listens] Mumbling something again. He\'s probably got\noff the stove.\n\n    Akoul\xc3\xadna enters, carrying two pails on a yoke.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. He\'s calling. You go and see what he wants, kicking up such a\nrow.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Why don\'t you go?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Go, I tell you! [Exit Akoul\xc3\xadna into hut] He\'s bothering me to\ndeath. Won\'t let out where the money is, and that\'s all about it. He was\nout in the passage the other day. He must have been hiding it there.\nNow, I don\'t know myself where it is. Thank goodness he\'s afraid of\nparting with it, so that at least it will stay in the house. If only I\ncould manage to find it. He hadn\'t it on him yesterday. Now I don\'t know\nwhere it can be. He has quite worn the life out of me.\n\n    Enter Akoul\xc3\xadna, tying her kerchief over her head.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Where are you off to?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Where? Why, he\'s told me to go for Aunt Martha. "Fetch my\nsister," he says. "I am going to die," he says. "I have a word to say to\nher."\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [aside] Asking for his sister? Oh my poor head! Sure he wants to\ngive it her. What shall I do? Oh! [To Akoul\xc3\xadna] Don\'t go! Where are you\noff to?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. To call Aunt.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Don\'t go I tell you, I\'ll go myself. You go and take the clothes\nto the river to rinse. Else you\'ll not have finished by the evening.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. But he told me to go.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. You go and do as you\'re bid. I tell you I\'ll fetch Martha\nmyself. Take the shirts off the fence.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. The shirts? But maybe you\'ll not go. He\'s given the order.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Didn\'t I say I\'d go? Where\'s Nan?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Nan? Minding the calves.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Send her here. I dare say they\'ll not run away. [Akoul\xc3\xadna\ncollects the clothes, and exit].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. If one doesn\'t go he\'ll scold. If one goes he\'ll give the money\nto his sister. All my trouble will be wasted. I don\'t myself know what\nI\'m to do. My poor head\'s splitting. [Continues to work].\n\n    Enter Matry\xc3\xb3na, with a stick and a bundle, in outdoor clothes.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. May the Lord help you, honey.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [looks round, stops working, and claps her hands with joy] Well,\nI never expected this! Mother Matry\xc3\xb3na, God has sent the right guest at\nthe right time.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well, how are things?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Ah, I\'m driven well-nigh crazy. It\'s awful!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well, still alive, I hear?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh, don\'t talk about it. He doesn\'t live and doesn\'t die!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. But the money--has he given it to anybody?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. He\'s just sending for his sister Martha--probably about the\nmoney.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well, naturally! But hasn\'t he given it to any one else?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. To no one. I watch like a hawk.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. And where is it?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. He doesn\'t let out. And I can\'t find out in any way. He hides it\nnow here, now there, and I can\'t do anything because of Akoul\xc3\xadna. Idiot\nthough she is, she keeps watch, and is always about. Oh my poor head!\nI\'m bothered to death.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Oh, my jewel, if he gives the money to any one but you, you\'ll\nnever cease regretting it as long as you live! They\'ll turn you out of\nhouse and home without anything. You\'ve been worriting, and worriting\nall your life with one you don\'t love, and will have to go a-begging\nwhen you are a widow.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. No need to tell me, mother. My heart\'s that weary, and I don\'t\nknow what to do. No one to get a bit of advice from. I told Nik\xc3\xadta, but\nhe\'s frightened of the job. The only thing he did was to tell me\nyesterday it was hidden under the floor.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well, and did you look there?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I couldn\'t. The old man himself was in the room. I notice that\nsometimes he carries it about on him, and sometimes he hides it.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. But you, my lass, must remember that if once he gives you the\nslip there\'s no getting it right again! [Whispering] Well, and did you\ngive him the strong tea?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh! oh!... [About to answer, but sees neighbour and stops].\n\n    The neighbour (a woman) passes the hut, and listens to a call from\n    within.\n\nNEIGHBOUR [to An\xc3\xadsya] I say, An\xc3\xadsya! Eh, An\xc3\xadsya! There\'s your old man\ncalling, I think.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. That\'s the way he always coughs,--just as if he were screaming.\nHe\'s getting very bad.\n\nNEIGHBOUR [approaches Matry\xc3\xb3na] How do you do, granny? Have you come\nfar?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Straight from home, dear. Come to see my son. Brought him\nsome shirts--can\'t help thinking of these things, you see, when it\'s\none\'s own child.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Yes, that\'s always so. [To An\xc3\xadsya] And I was thinking of\nbeginning to bleach the linen, but it is a bit early, no one has begun\nyet.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Where\'s the hurry?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well, and has he had communion?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh dear yes, the priest was here yesterday.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. I had a look at him yesterday. Dearie me! one wonders his\nbody and soul keep together. And, O Lord, the other day he seemed just\nat his last gasp, so that they laid him under the holy ic\xc3\xb3ns.[1] They\nstarted lamenting and got ready to lay him out.\n\n  [1] It is customary to place a dying person under the ic\xc3\xb3n. One or\n  more ic\xc3\xb3ns hang in the hut of each Orthodox peasant.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. He came to, and creeps about again.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well, and is he to have extreme unction?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. The neighbours advise it. If he lives till to-morrow we\'ll send\nfor the priest.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Oh, An\xc3\xadsya dear, I should think your heart must be heavy. As\nthe saying goes, "Not he is sick that\'s ill in bed, but he that sits and\nwaits in dread."\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Yes, if it were only over one way or other!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Yes, that\'s true, dying for a year, it\'s no joke. You\'re\nbound hand and foot like that.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Ah, but a widow\'s lot is also bitter. It\'s all right as long\nas one\'s young, but who\'ll care for you when you\'re old? Oh yes, old age\nis not pleasure. Just look at me. I\'ve not walked very far, and yet am\nso footsore I don\'t know how to stand. Where\'s my son?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Ploughing. But you come in and we\'ll get the samov\xc3\xa1r ready; the\ntea\'ll set you up again.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [sitting down] Yes, it\'s true, I\'m quite done up, my dears. As\nto extreme unction, that\'s absolutely necessary. Besides, they say it\'s\ngood for the soul.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Yes, we\'ll send to-morrow.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Yes, you had better. And we\'ve had a wedding down in our\nparts.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. What, in spring?[2]\n\n  [2] Peasant weddings are usually in autumn. They are forbidden in\n  Lent, and soon after Easter the peasants become too busy to marry till\n  harvest is over.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Ah, now if it were a poor man, then, as the saying is, it\'s\nalways unseasonable for a poor man to marry. But it\'s Simon Matv\xc3\xa9yitch,\nhe\'s married that Mar\xc3\xadna.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What luck for her!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. He\'s a widower. I suppose there are children?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Four of \'em. What decent girl would have him! Well, so he\'s\ntaken her, and she\'s glad. You see, the vessel was not sound, so the\nwine trickled out.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Oh my! And what do people say to it? And he, a rich peasant!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. They are living well enough so far.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Yes, it\'s true enough. Who wants to marry where there are\nchildren? There now, there\'s our Michael. He\'s such a fellow, dear me ...\n\nPEASANT\'S VOICE. Hullo, M\xc3\xa1vra. Where the devil are you? Go and drive the\ncow in.\n\n    Exit Neighbour.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [while the Neighbour is within hearing speaks in her ordinary\nvoice] Yes, lass, thank goodness, she\'s married. At any rate my old fool\nwon\'t go bothering about Nik\xc3\xadta. Now [suddenly changing her tone], she\'s\ngone! [Whispers] I say, did you give him the tea?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Don\'t speak about it. He\'d better die of himself. It\'s no\nuse--he doesn\'t die, and I have only taken a sin on my soul. O-oh, my\nhead, my head! Oh, why did you give me those powders?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. What of the powders? The sleeping powders, lass,--why not give\nthem? No evil can come of them.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I am not talking of the sleeping ones, but the others, the white\nones.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well, honey, those powders are medicinal.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [sighs] I know, yet it\'s frightening. Though he\'s worried me to\ndeath.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well, and did you use many?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I gave two doses.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Was anything noticeable?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I had a taste of the tea myself--just a little bitter. And he\ndrank them with the tea and says, "Even tea disgusts me," and I say,\n"Everything tastes bitter when one\'s sick." But I felt that scared,\nmother.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Don\'t go thinking about it. The more one thinks the worse it\nis.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I wish you\'d never given them to me and led me into sin. When I\nthink of it something seems to tear my heart. Oh dear, why did you give\nthem to me?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. What do you mean, honey? Lord help you! Why are you turning it\non to me? Mind, lass, don\'t go twisting matters from the sick on to the\nhealthy. If anything were to happen, I stand aside! I know nothing! I\'m\naware of nothing! I\'ll kiss the cross on it; I never gave you any kind\nof powders, never saw any, never heard of any, and never knew there were\nsuch powders. You think about yourself, lass. Why, we were talking about\nyou the other day. "Poor thing, what torture she endures. The\nstep-daughter an idiot; the old man rotten, sucking her life-blood. What\nwouldn\'t one be ready to do in such a case!"\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'m not going to deny it. A life such as mine could make one do\nworse than that. It could make you hang yourself or throttle him. Is\nthis a life?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. That\'s just it. There\'s no time to stand gaping; the money\nmust be found one way or other, and then he must have his tea.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. O-oh, my head, my head! I can\'t think what to do. I am so\nfrightened; he\'d better die of himself. I don\'t want to have it on my\nsoul.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [viciously] And why doesn\'t he show the money? Does he mean to\ntake it along with him? Is no one to have it? Is that right? God forbid\nsuch a sum should be lost all for nothing. Isn\'t that a sin? What\'s he\ndoing? Is he worth considering?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I don\'t know anything. He\'s worried me to death.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. What is it you don\'t know? The business is clear. If you make\na slip now, you\'ll repent it all your life. He\'ll give the money to his\nsister and you\'ll be left without.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. O-oh dear! Yes, and he did send for her--I must go.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. You wait a bit and light the samov\xc3\xa1r first. We\'ll give him\nsome tea and search him together--we\'ll find it, no fear.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh dear, oh dear; supposing something were to happen.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. What now? What\'s the good of waiting? Do you want the money to\nslip from your hand when it\'s just in sight? You go and do as I say.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Well, I\'ll go and light the samov\xc3\xa1r.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Go, honey, do the business so as not to regret it afterwards.\nThat\'s right! [An\xc3\xadsya turns to go. Matry\xc3\xb3na calls her back].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Just a word. Don\'t tell Nik\xc3\xadta about the business. He\'s silly.\nGod forbid he should find out about the powders. The Lord only knows\nwhat he would do. He\'s so tender-hearted. D\'you know, he usen\'t to be\nable to kill a chicken. Don\'t tell him. \'Twould be a fine go, he\nwouldn\'t understand things. [Stops horror-struck as Peter appears in the\ndoorway].\n\nPETER [holding on to the wall, creeps out into the porch and calls with\na faint voice] How\'s it one can\'t make you hear? Oh, oh, An\xc3\xadsya! Who\'s\nthere? [Drops on the bench].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [steps from behind the corner] Why have you come out? You should\nhave stayed where you were lying.\n\nPETER. Has the girl gone for Martha? It\'s very hard.... Oh, if only\ndeath would come quicker!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. She had no time. I sent her to the river. Wait a bit, I\'ll go\nmyself when I\'m ready.\n\nPETER. Send Nan. Where\'s she? Oh, I\'m that bad! Oh, death\'s at hand!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'ve sent for her already.\n\nPETER. Oh dear! Then where is she?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Where\'s she got to, the plague seize her!\n\nPETER. Oh, dear! I can\'t bear it. All my inside\'s on fire. It\'s as if a\ngimlet were boring me. Why have you left me as if I were a dog?... no\none to give me a drink.... Oh ... send Nan to me.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Here she is. Nan, go to father.\n\n    Nan runs in. An\xc3\xadsya goes behind the corner of the house.\n\nPETER. Go you. Oh ... to Aunt Martha, tell her father wants her; say\nshe\'s to come, I want her.\n\nNAN. All right.\n\nPETER. Wait a bit. Tell her she\'s to come quick. Tell her I\'m dying.\nO-oh!\n\nNAN. I\'ll just get my shawl and be off. [Runs off].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [winking] Now then, mind and look sharp, lass. Go into the hut,\nhunt about everywhere, like a dog that\'s hunting for fleas: look under\neverything, and I\'ll search him.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [to Matry\xc3\xb3na] I feel a bit bolder, somehow, now you\'re here.\n[Goes up to porch. To Peter] Hadn\'t I better light the samov\xc3\xa1r? Here\'s\nMother Matry\xc3\xb3na come to see her son; you\'ll have a cup of tea with her?\n\nPETER. Well then, light it. [An\xc3\xadsya goes into the house. Matry\xc3\xb3na comes\nup to the porch].\n\nPETER. How do you do?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [bowing] How d\'you do, my benefactor; how d\'you do, my precious\n... still ill, I see. And my old man, he\'s that sorry! "Go," says he,\n"see how he\'s getting on." He sends his respects to you. [Bows again].\n\nPETER. I\'m dying.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Ah yes, Peter Ign\xc3\xa1titch, now I look at you I see, as the\nsaying has it, "Sickness lives where men live." You\'ve shrivelled,\nshrivelled, all to nothing, poor dear, now I come to look at you. Seems\nillness does not add to good looks.\n\nPETER. My last hour has come.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Oh well, Peter Ign\xc3\xa1titch, it\'s God\'s will you know, you\'ve had\ncommunion, and you\'ll have unction, God willing. Your missus is a wise\nwoman, the Lord be thanked; she\'ll give you a good burial, and have\nprayers said for your soul, all most respectable! And my son, he\'ll look\nafter things meanwhile.\n\nPETER. There\'ll be no one to manage things! She\'s not steady. Has her\nhead full of folly--why, I know all about it, I know. And my girl is\nsilly and young. I\'ve got the homestead together, and there\'s no one to\nattend to things. One can\'t help feeling it. [Whimpers].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Why, if it\'s money, or something, you can leave orders.\n\nPETER [to An\xc3\xadsya inside the house] Has Nan gone?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [aside] There now, he\'s remembered!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [from inside] She went then and there. Come inside, won\'t you?\nI\'ll help you in.\n\nPETER. Let me sit here a bit for the last time. The air\'s so stuffy\ninside. Oh, how bad I feel! Oh, my heart\'s burning.... Oh, if death\nwould only come.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. If God don\'t take a soul, the soul can\'t go out. Death and\nlife are in God\'s will, Peter Ign\xc3\xa1titch. You can\'t be sure of death\neither. Maybe you\'ll recover yet. There was a man in our village just\nlike that, at the very point of death ...\n\nPETER. No, I feel I shall die to-day, I feel it. [Leans back and shuts\nhis eyes].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [enters] Well now, are you coming in or not? You do keep one\nwaiting. Peter! eh, Peter!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [steps aside and beckons to An\xc3\xadsya with her finger] Well?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [comes down the porch steps] Not there.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. But have you searched everywhere? Under the floor?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. No, it\'s not there either. In the shed perhaps; he was rummaging\nthere yesterday.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Go, search, search for all you\'re worth. Go all over\neverywhere, as if you licked with your tongue! But I see he\'ll die this\nvery day, his nails are turning blue and his face looks earthy. Is the\nsamov\xc3\xa1r ready?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Just on the boil.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [comes from the other side, if possible on horseback, up to the\ngate, and does not see Peter. To Matry\xc3\xb3na] How d\'you do, mother, is all\nwell at home?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. The Lord be thanked, we\'re all alive and have a crust to bite.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Well, and how\'s master?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Hush, there he sits. [Points to porch].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Well, let him sit. What\'s it to me?\n\nPETER [opens his eyes] Nik\xc3\xadta, I say, Nik\xc3\xadta, come here! [Nik\xc3\xadta\napproaches. An\xc3\xadsya and Matry\xc3\xb3na whisper together].\n\nPETER. Why have you come back so early?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I\'ve finished ploughing.\n\nPETER. Have you done the strip beyond the bridge?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. It\'s too far to go there.\n\nPETER. Too far? From here it\'s still farther. You\'ll have to go on\npurpose now. You might have made one job of it. [An\xc3\xadsya, without showing\nherself, stands and listens].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [approaches] Oh, sonnie, why don\'t you take more pains for your\nmaster? Your master is ill and depends on you; you should serve him as\nyou would your own father, straining every muscle just as I always tell\nyou to.\n\nPETER. Well then--o-oh!... Get out the seed potatoes, and the women will\ngo and sort them.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [aside] No fear, I\'m not going. He\'s again sending every one\naway; he must have the money on him now, and wants to hide it somewhere.\n\nPETER. Else ... o-oh! when the time comes for planting, they\'ll all be\nrotten. Oh, I can\'t stand it! [Rises].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [runs up into the porch and holds Peter up] Shall I help you\ninto the hut?\n\nPETER. Help me in. [Stops] Nik\xc3\xadta!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [angrily] What now?\n\nPETER. I shan\'t see you again ... I\'ll die to-day.... Forgive me,[3] for\nChrist\'s sake, forgive me if I have ever sinned against you ... If I\nhave sinned in word or deed ... There\'s been all sorts of things.\nForgive me!\n\n  [3] A formal request for forgiveness is customary among Russians, but\n  it is often no mere formality. Nik\xc3\xadta\'s first reply is evasive; his\n  second reply, "God will forgive you," is the correct one sanctioned by\n  custom.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What\'s there to forgive? I\'m a sinner myself.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Ah, sonnie, have some feeling.\n\nPETER. Forgive me, for Christ\'s sake. [Weeps].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [snivels] God will forgive you, Daddy Peter. I have no cause to\ncomplain of you. You\'ve never done me any wrong. You forgive me; maybe\nI\'ve sinned worse against you. [Weeps].\n\n    Peter goes in whimpering, Matry\xc3\xb3na supporting him.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh, my poor head! It\'s not without some reason he\'s hit on that.\n[Approaches Nik\xc3\xadta] Why did you say the money was under the floor? It\'s\nnot there.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [does not answer, but cries] I have never had anything bad from\nhim, nothing but good, and what have I gone and done!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Enough now! Where\'s the money?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [angrily] How should I know? Go and look for it yourself!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What\'s made you so tender?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I am sorry for him,--that sorry. How he cried! Oh dear!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Look at him,--seized with pity! He has found someone to pity\ntoo! He\'s been treating you like a dog, and even just now was giving\norders to have you turned out of the house. You\'d better show me some\npity!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What are you to be pitied for?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. If he dies, and the money\'s been hidden away ...\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. No fear, he\'ll not hide it ...\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh, Nik\xc3\xadta darling! he\'s sent for his sister, and wants to give\nit to her. It will be a bad lookout for us. How are we going to live, if\nhe gives her the money? They\'ll turn me out of the house! You try and\nmanage somehow! You said he went to the shed last night.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I saw him coming from there, but where he\'s shoved it to, who\ncan tell?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh, my poor head! I\'ll go and have a look there. [Nik\xc3\xadta steps\naside].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [comes out of the hut and down the steps of the porch to An\xc3\xadsya\nand Nik\xc3\xadta] Don\'t go anywhere. He\'s got the money on him. I felt it on a\nstring round his neck.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh my head, my head!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. If you don\'t keep wide awake now, then you may whistle for it.\nIf his sister comes--then good-bye to it!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. That\'s true. She\'ll come and he\'ll give it her. What\'s to be\ndone? Oh my poor head!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. What is to be done? Why, look here; the samov\xc3\xa1r is boiling, go\nand make the tea and pour him out a cup, and then [whispers] put in all\nthat\'s left in the paper. When he\'s drunk the cup, then just take it.\nHe\'ll not tell, no fear.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh! I\'m afeared!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Don\'t be talking now, but look alive, and I\'ll keep his sister\noff if need be. Mind, don\'t make a blunder! Get hold of the money and\nbring it here, and Nik\xc3\xadta will hide it.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh my head, my head! I don\'t know how I\'m going to ...\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Don\'t talk about it I tell you, do as I bid you. Nik\xc3\xadta!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What is it?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. You stay here--sit down--in case something is wanted.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [waves his hand] Oh these women, what won\'t they be up to? Muddle\none up completely. Bother them! I\'ll really go and fetch out the\npotatoes.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [catches him by the arm] Stay here, I tell you.\n\n    Nan enters.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Well?\n\nNAN. She was down in her daughter\'s vegetable plot--she\'s coming.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Coming! What shall we do?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. There\'s plenty of time if you do as I tell you.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I don\'t know what to do; I know nothing, my brain\'s all in a\nwhirl. Nan! Go, daughter, and see to the calves, they\'ll have run away,\nI\'m afraid.... Oh dear, I haven\'t the courage.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Go on! I should think the samov\xc3\xa1r\'s boiling over.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh my head, my poor head! [Exit].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [approaches Nik\xc3\xadta] Now then, sonnie. [Sits down beside him]\nYour affairs must also be thought about, and not left anyhow.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What affairs?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Why, this affair--how you\'re to live your life.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. How to live my life? Others live, and I shall live!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. The old man will probably die to-day.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Well, if he dies, God give him rest! What\'s that to me?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [keeps looking towards the porch while she speaks] Eh, sonnie!\nThose that are alive have to think about living. One needs plenty of\nsense in these matters, honey. What do you think? I\'ve tramped all over\nthe place after your affairs, I\'ve got quite footsore bothering about\nmatters. And you must not forget me when the time comes.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. And what\'s it you\'ve been bothering about?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. About your affairs, about your future. If you don\'t take\ntrouble in good time you\'ll get nothing. You know Iv\xc3\xa1n Mos\xc3\xa9itch? Well,\nI\'ve been to him too. I went there the other day. I had something else\nto settle, you know. Well, so I sat and chatted awhile and then came to\nthe point. "Tell me, Iv\xc3\xa1n Mos\xc3\xa9itch," says I, "how\'s one to manage an\naffair of this kind? Supposing," says I, "a peasant as is a widower\nmarried a second wife, and supposing all the children he has is a\ndaughter by the first wife, and a daughter by the second. Then," says I,\n"when that peasant dies, could an outsider get hold of the homestead by\nmarrying the widow? Could he," says I, "give both the daughters in\nmarriage and remain master of the house himself?" "Yes, he could," says\nhe, "but," says he, "it would mean a deal of trouble; still the thing\ncould be managed by means of money, but if there\'s no money it\'s no good\ntrying."\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [laughs] That goes without saying, only fork out the money. Who\ndoes not want money?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well then, honey, so I spoke out plainly about the affair. And\nhe says, "First and foremost, your son will have to get himself on the\nregister of that village--that will cost something. The elders will have\nto be treated. And they, you see, they\'ll sign. Everything," says he,\n"must be done sensibly." Look, [unwraps her kerchief and takes out a\npaper] he\'s written out this paper; just read it, you\'re a scholar, you\nknow. [Nik\xc3\xadta reads].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. This paper\'s only a decision for the elders to sign. There\'s no\ngreat wisdom needed for that.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. But you just hear what Iv\xc3\xa1n Mos\xc3\xa9itch bids us do. "Above all,"\nhe says, "mind and don\'t let the money slip away, dame. If she don\'t get\nhold of the money," he says, "they\'ll not let her do it. Money\'s the\ngreat thing!" So look out, sonnie, things are coming to a head.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What\'s that to me? The money\'s hers--so let her look out.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Ah, sonnie, how you look at it! How can a woman manage such\naffairs? Even if she does get the money, is she capable of arranging it\nall? One knows what a woman is! You\'re a man anyhow. You can hide it,\nand all that. You see, you\'ve after all got more sense, in case of\nanything happening.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Oh, your woman\'s notions are all so inexpedient!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Why inexpedient? You just collar the money, and the woman\'s in\nyour hands. And then should she ever turn snappish you\'d be able to\ntighten the reins!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Bother you all,--I\'m going.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [quite pale, runs out of the hut and round the corner to\nMatry\xc3\xb3na] So it was, it was on him! Here it is! [Shows that she has\nsomething under her apron].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Give it to Nik\xc3\xadta, he\'ll hide it. Nik\xc3\xadta, take it and hide it\nsomewhere.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. All right, give here!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. O-oh, my poor head! No, I\'d better do it myself. [Goes towards\nthe gate].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [seizing her by the arm] Where are you going to? You\'ll be\nmissed. There\'s the sister coming; give it him; he knows what to do. Eh,\nyou blockhead!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [stops irresolutely] Oh, my head, my head!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Well, give it here. I\'ll shove it away somewhere.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Where will you shove it to?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [laughing] Why, are you afraid?\n\n    Enter Akoul\xc3\xadna, carrying clothes from the wash.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. O-oh, my poor head! [Gives the money] Mind, Nik\xc3\xadta.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What are you afraid of? I\'ll hide it so that I\'ll not be able to\nfind it myself. [Exit].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [stands in terror] Oh dear, and supposing he ...\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Well, is he dead?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Yes, he seems dead. He did not move when I took it.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Go in, there\'s Akoul\xc3\xadna.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Well there, I\'ve done the sin and he has the money....\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Have done and go in! There\'s Martha coming!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. There now, I\'ve trusted him. What\'s going to happen now? [Exit].\n\nMARTHA [enters from one side, Akoul\xc3\xadna enters from the other. To\nAkoul\xc3\xadna] I should have come before, but I was at my daughter\'s. Well,\nhow\'s the old man? Is he dying?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [puts down the clothes] Don\'t know, I\'ve been to the river.\n\nMARTHA [pointing to Matry\xc3\xb3na] Who\'s that?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. I\'m from Zo\xc3\xbaevo. I\'m Nik\xc3\xadta\'s mother from Zo\xc3\xbaevo, my dearie.\nGood afternoon to you. He\'s withering, withering away, poor dear--your\nbrother, I mean. He came out himself. "Send for my sister," he said,\n"because," said he ... Dear me, why, I do believe, he\'s dead!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [runs out screaming. Clings to a post, and begins wailing][4] Oh,\noh, ah! who-o-o-m have you left me to, why-y-y have you dese-e-e-e-rted\nme--a miserable widow ... to live my life alone ... Why have you closed\nyour bright eyes ...\n\n  [4] Loud public wailing of this kind is customary, and considered\n  indispensable, among the peasants.\n\n    Enter Neighbour. Matry\xc3\xb3na and Neighbour catch hold of An\xc3\xadsya under\n    the arms to support her. Akoul\xc3\xadna and Martha go into the hut. A\n    crowd assembles.\n\nA VOICE IN THE CROWD. Send for the old women to lay out the body.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [rolls up her sleeves] Is there any water in the copper? But I\ndaresay the samov\xc3\xa1r is still hot. I\'ll also go and help a bit.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n    The same hut. Winter. Nine months have passed since Act II. An\xc3\xadsya,\n    plainly dressed, sits before a loom weaving. Nan is on the oven.\n\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [an old labourer, enters, and slowly takes off his outdoor\nthings] Oh Lord, have mercy! Well, hasn\'t the master come home yet?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Nik\xc3\xadta isn\'t back from town, is he?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. No.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Must have been on the spree. Oh Lord!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Have you finished in the stackyard?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What d\'you think? Got it all as it should be, and covered\neverything with straw! I don\'t like doing things by halves! Oh Lord!\nholy Nicholas! [Picks at the corns on his hands] But it\'s time he was\nback.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What need has he to hurry? He\'s got money. Merry-making with\nthat girl, I daresay ...\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Why shouldn\'t one make merry if one has the money? And why did\nAkoul\xc3\xadna go to town?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. You\'d better ask her. How do I know what the devil took her\nthere!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What! to town? There\'s all sorts of things to be got in town\nif one\'s got the means. Oh Lord!\n\nNAN. Mother, I heard myself. "I\'ll get you a little shawl," he says,\nblest if he didn\'t; "you shall choose it yourself," he says. And she got\nherself up so fine; she put on her velveteen coat and the French shawl.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Really, a girl\'s modesty reaches only to the door. Step over the\nthreshold and it\'s forgotten. She is a shameless creature.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Oh my! What\'s the use of being ashamed? While there\'s plenty\nof money make merry. Oh Lord! It is too soon to have supper, eh? [An\xc3\xadsya\ndoes not answer] I\'ll go and get warm meanwhile. [Climbs on the stove]\nOh Lord! Blessed Virgin Mother! holy Nicholas!\n\nNEIGHBOUR [enters] Seems your goodman\'s not back yet?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. No.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. It\'s time he was. Hasn\'t he perhaps stopped at our inn? My\nsister, Thekla, says there\'s heaps of sledges standing there as have\ncome from the town.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Nan! Nan, I say!\n\nNAN. Yes?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. You run to the inn and see! Mayhap, being drunk, he\'s gone\nthere.\n\nNAN [jumps down from the oven and dresses] All right.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. And he\'s taken Akoul\xc3\xadna with him?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Else he\'d not have had any need of going. It\'s because of her\nhe\'s unearthed all the business there. "Must go to the bank," he says;\n"it\'s time to receive the payments," he says. But it\'s all her fooling.\n\nNEIGHBOUR [shakes her head] It\'s a bad look-out. [Silence].\n\nNAN [at the door] And if he\'s there, what am I to say?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. You only see if he\'s there.\n\nNAN. All right. I\'ll be back in a winking. [Long silence].\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [roars] Oh Lord! merciful Nicholas!\n\nNEIGHBOUR [starting] Oh, how he scared me? Who is it?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Why, M\xc3\xadtritch, our labourer.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Oh dear, oh dear, what a fright he did give me! I had quite\nforgotten. But tell me, dear, I\'ve heard someone\'s been wooing\nAkoul\xc3\xadna?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [gets up from the loom and sits down by the table] There was some\none from D\xc3\xa9dlovo; but it seems the affair\'s got wind there too. They\nmade a start, and then stopped; so the thing fell through. Of course,\nwho\'d care to?\n\nNEIGHBOUR. And the Lizoun\xc3\xb3fs from Zo\xc3\xbaevo?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. They made some steps too, but it didn\'t come off either. They\nwon\'t even see us.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Yet it\'s time she was married.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Time and more than time! Ah, my dear, I\'m that impatient to get\nher out of the house; but the matter does not come off. He does not wish\nit, nor she either. He\'s not yet had enough of his beauty, you see.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Eh, eh, eh, what doings! Only think of it. Why, he\'s her\nstep-father!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Ah, friend, they\'ve taken me in completely. They\'ve done me so\nfine it\'s beyond saying. I, fool that I was, noticed nothing, suspected\nnothing, and so I married him. I guessed nothing, but they already\nunderstood one another.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Oh dear, what goings on!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. So it went on from bad to worse, and I see they begin hiding\nfrom me. Ah, friend, I was that sick--that sick of my life! It\'s not as\nif I didn\'t love him.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. That goes without saying.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Ah, how hard it is to bear such treatment from him! Oh, how it\nhurts!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Yes, and I\'ve heard say he\'s becoming too free with his\nfists?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And that too! There was a time when he was gentle when he\'d had\na drop. He used to hit out before, but of me he was always fond! But now\nwhen he\'s in a temper he goes for me and is ready to trample me under\nhis feet. The other day he got both hands entangled in my hair so that I\ncould hardly get away. And the girl\'s worse than a serpent; it\'s a\nwonder the earth bears such furies.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Ah, ah, my dear, now I look at you, you are a sufferer! To\nsuffer like that is no joke. To have given shelter to a beggar, and he\nto lead you such a dance! Why don\'t you pull in the reins?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Ah, but my dear, if it weren\'t for my heart! Him as is gone was\nstern enough, still I could twist him about any way I liked; but with\nthis one I can do nothing. As soon as I see him all my anger goes. I\nhaven\'t a grain of courage before him; I go about like a drowned hen.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Ah, neighbour, you must be under a spell. I\'ve heard that\nMatry\xc3\xb3na goes in for that sort of thing. It must be her.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Yes, dear; I think so myself sometimes. Gracious me, how hurt I\nfeel at times! I\'d like to tear him to pieces. But when I set eyes on\nhim, my heart won\'t go against him.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. It\'s plain you\'re bewitched. It don\'t take long to blight a\nbody. There now, when I look at you, what you have dwindled to!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Growing a regular spindle-shanks. And just look at that fool\nAkoul\xc3\xadna. Wasn\'t the girl a regular untidy slattern, and just look at\nher now! Where has it all come from? Yes, he has fitted her out. She\'s\ngrown so smart, so puffed up, just like a bubble that\'s ready to burst.\nAnd, though she\'s a fool, she\'s got it into her head, "I\'m the\nmistress," she says; "the house is mine; it\'s me father wanted him to\nmarry." And she\'s that vicious! Lord help us, when she gets into a rage\nshe\'s ready to tear the thatch off the house.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Oh dear, what a life yours is, now I come to look at you. And\nyet there\'s people envying you: "They\'re rich," they say; but it seems\nthat gold don\'t keep tears from falling.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Much reason for envy indeed! And the riches, too, will soon be\nmade ducks and drakes of. Dear me, how he squanders money!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. But how\'s it, dear, you\'ve been so simple to give up the\nmoney? It\'s yours.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Ah, if you knew all! The thing is that I\'ve made one little\nmistake.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Well, if I were you, I\'d go straight and have the law of him.\nThe money\'s yours; how dare he squander it? There\'s no such rights.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. They don\'t pay heed to that nowadays.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Ah, my dear, now I come to look at you, you\'ve got that weak.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Yes, quite weak, dear, quite weak. He\'s got me into a regular\nfix. I don\'t myself know anything. Oh, my poor head!\n\nNEIGHBOUR [listening] There\'s someone coming, I think. [The door opens\nand Ak\xc3\xadm enters].\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [crosses himself, knocks the snow off his feet, and takes off his\ncoat] Peace be to this house! How do you do? Are you well, daughter?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. How d\'you do, father? Do you come straight from home?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. I\'ve been a-thinking, I\'ll go and see what\'s name, go to see my\nson, I mean,--my son. I didn\'t start early--had my dinner, I mean; I\nwent, and it\'s so what d\'you call it--so snowy, hard walking, and so\nthere I\'m what d\'you call it--late, I mean. And my son--is he at home?\nAt home? My son, I mean.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. No; he\'s gone to the town.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [sits down on a bench] I\'ve some business with him, d\'you see, some\nbusiness, I mean. I told him t\'other day, told him I was in need--told\nhim, I mean, that our horse was done for, our horse, you see. So we must\nwhat d\'ye call it, get a horse, I mean, some kind of a horse, I mean. So\nthere, I\'ve come, you see.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Nik\xc3\xadta told me. When he comes back you\'ll have a talk. [Goes to\nthe oven] Have some supper now, and he\'ll soon come. M\xc3\xadtritch, eh\nM\xc3\xadtritch, come have your supper.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Oh Lord! merciful Nicholas!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Come to supper.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. I shall go now. Good-night. [Exit].\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [gets down from the oven] I never noticed how I fell asleep. Oh\nLord! gracious Nicholas! How d\'you do, Daddy Ak\xc3\xadm?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Ah, M\xc3\xadtritch! What are you, what d\'ye call it, I mean?...\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Why, I\'m working for your son, Nik\xc3\xadta.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Dear me! What d\'ye call ... working for my son, I mean. Dear me!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. I was living with a tradesman in town, but drank all I had\nthere. Now I\'ve come back to the village. I\'ve no home, so I\'ve gone\ninto service. [Gapes] Oh Lord!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. But how\'s that, what d\'you call it, or what\'s name, Nik\xc3\xadta, what\ndoes he do? Has he some business, I mean besides, that he should hire a\nlabourer, a labourer I mean, hire a labourer?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What business should he have? He used to manage, but now he\'s\nother things on his mind, so he\'s hired a labourer.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Why shouldn\'t he, seeing he has money?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Now that\'s what d\'you call it, that\'s wrong, I mean, quite wrong,\nI mean. That\'s spoiling oneself.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh, he has got spoilt, that spoilt, it\'s just awful.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. There now, what d\'you call it, one thinks how to make things\nbetter, and it gets worse I mean. Riches spoil a man, spoil, I mean.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Fatness makes even a dog go mad; how\'s one not to get spoilt\nby fat living? Myself now; how I went on with fat living. I drank for\nthree weeks without being sober. I drank my last breeches. When I had\nnothing left, I gave it up. Now I\'ve determined not to. Bother it!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. And where\'s what d\'you call, your old woman?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. My old woman has found her right place, old fellow. She\'s\nhanging about the gin-shops in town. She\'s a swell too; one eye knocked\nout, and the other black, and her muzzle twisted to one side. And she\'s\nnever sober; drat her!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Oh, oh, oh, how\'s that?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. And where\'s a soldier\'s wife to go? She has found her right\nplace. [Silence].\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [to An\xc3\xadsya] And Nik\xc3\xadta,--has he what d\'you call it, taken anything\nup to town? I mean, anything to sell?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [laying the table and serving up] No, he\'s taken nothing. He\'s\ngone to get money from the bank.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [sitting down to supper] Why? D\'you wish to put it to another use,\nthe money I mean?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. No, we don\'t touch it. Only some twenty or thirty roubles as\nhave come due; they must be taken.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Must be taken. Why take it, the money I mean? You\'ll take some\nto-day I mean, and some to-morrow; and so you\'ll what d\'you call it,\ntake it all, I mean.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. We get this besides. The money is all safe.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. All safe? How\'s that, safe? You take it, and it what d\'you call\nit, it\'s all safe. How\'s that? You put a heap of meal into a bin, or a\nbarn, I mean, and go on taking meal, will it remain there what d\'you\ncall it, all safe I mean? That\'s, what d\'you call it, it\'s cheating.\nYou\'d better find out, or else they\'ll cheat you. Safe indeed! I mean\nyou what d\'ye call ... you take it and it remains all safe there?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I know nothing about it. Iv\xc3\xa1n Mos\xc3\xa9itch advised us at the time.\n"Put the money in the bank," he said, "the money will be safe, and\nyou\'ll get interest," he said.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [having finished his supper] That\'s so. I\'ve lived with a\ntradesman. They all do like that. Put the money in the bank, then lie\ndown on the oven and it will keep coming in.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. That\'s queer talk. How\'s that--what d\'ye call, coming in, how\'s\nthat coming in, and they, who do they get it from I mean, the money I\nmean?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. They take the money out of the bank.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Get along! \'Tain\'t a thing a woman can understand! You look\nhere, I\'ll make it all clear to you. Mind and remember. You see, suppose\nyou\'ve got some money, and I, for instance, have spring coming on, my\nland\'s idle, I\'ve got no seeds, or I have to pay taxes. So, you see, I\ngo to you. "Ak\xc3\xadm," I say, "give us a ten-rouble note, and when I\'ve\nharvested in autumn I\'ll return it, and till two acres for you besides,\nfor having obliged me!" And you, seeing I\'ve something to fall back\non--a horse say, or a cow--you say, "No, give two or three roubles for\nthe obligation," and there\'s an end of it. I\'m stuck in the mud, and\ncan\'t do without. So I say, "All right!" and take a tenner. In the\nautumn, when I\'ve made my turnover, I bring it back, and you squeeze the\nextra three roubles out of me.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Yes, but that\'s what peasants do when they what d\'ye call it, when\nthey forget God. It\'s not honest, I mean, it\'s no good, I mean.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. You wait. You\'ll see it comes just to the same thing. Now\ndon\'t forget how you\'ve skinned me. And An\xc3\xadsya, say, has got some money\nlying idle. She does not know what to do with it, besides, she\'s a\nwoman, and does not know how to use it. She comes to you. "Couldn\'t you\nmake some profit with my money too?" she says. "Why not?" say you, and\nyou wait. Before the summer I come again and say, "Give me another\ntenner, and I\'ll be obliged." Then you find out if my hide isn\'t all\ngone, and if I can be skinned again you give me An\xc3\xadsya\'s money. But\nsupposing I\'m clean shorn,--have nothing to eat,--then you see I can\'t\nbe fleeced any more, and you say, "Go your way, friend," and you look\nout for another, and lend him your own and An\xc3\xadsya\'s money and skin him.\nThat\'s what the bank is. So it goes round and round. It\'s a cute thing,\nold fellow!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [excitedly] Gracious me, whatever is that like? It\'s what d\'ye call\nit, it\'s filthy! The peasants--what d\'ye call it, the peasants do so I\nmean, and know it\'s, what d\'ye call it, a sin! It\'s what d\'you call, not\nright, not right, I mean. It\'s filthy! How can people as have learnt ...\nwhat d\'ye call it ...\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. That, old fellow, is just what they\'re fond of! And remember,\nthem that are stupid, or the women folk, as can\'t put their money into\nuse themselves, they take it to the bank, and they there, deuce take\n\'em, clutch hold of it, and with this money they fleece the people. It\'s\na cute thing!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [sighing] Oh dear, I see, what d\'ye call it, without money it\'s\nbad, and with money it\'s worse! How\'s that? God told us to work, but\nyou, what d\'ye call ... I mean you put money into the bank and go to\nsleep, and the money will what d\'ye call it, will feed you while you\nsleep. It\'s filthy, that\'s what I call it; it\'s not right.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Not right? Eh, old fellow, who cares about that nowadays? And\nhow clean they pluck you, too! That\'s the fact of the matter.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [sighs] Ah yes, seems the time\'s what d\'ye call it, the time\'s\ngrowing ripe. There, I\'ve had a look at the closets in town. What\nthey\'ve come to! It\'s all polished and polished I mean, it\'s fine, it\'s\nwhat d\'ye call it, it\'s like inside an inn. And what\'s it all for?\nWhat\'s the good of it? Oh, they\'ve forgotten God. Forgotten, I mean.\nWe\'ve forgotten, forgotten God, God I mean! Thank you, my dear, I\'ve\nhad enough. I\'m quite satisfied. [Rises. M\xc3\xadtritch climbs on to the\noven].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [eats, and collects the dishes] If his father would only take him\nto task! But I\'m ashamed to tell him.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. What d\'you say?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh! it\'s nothing.\n\n    Enter Nan.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Here\'s a good girl, always busy! You\'re cold, I should think?\n\nNAN. Yes, I am, terribly. How d\'you do, grandfather?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Well? Is he there?\n\nNAN. No. But Andriy\xc3\xa1n is there. He\'s been to town, and he says he saw\nthem at an inn in town. He says Dad\'s as drunk as drunk can be!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Do you want anything to eat? Here you are.\n\nNAN [goes to the oven] Well, it _is_ cold. My hands are quite numb.\n[Ak\xc3\xadm takes off his leg-bands and bast-shoes. An\xc3\xadsya washes up].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Father!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Well, what is it?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And is Mar\xc3\xadna living well?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Yes, she\'s living all right. The little woman is what d\'ye call\nit, clever and steady; she\'s living, and what d\'ye call it, doing her\nbest. She\'s all right; the little woman\'s of the right sort I mean;\npainstaking and what d\'ye call it, submissive; the little woman\'s all\nright I mean, all right, you know.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And is there no talk in your village that a relative of Mar\xc3\xadna\'s\nhusband thinks of marrying our Akoul\xc3\xadna? Have you heard nothing of it?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Ah; that\'s Mir\xc3\xb3nof. Yes, the women did chatter something. But I\ndidn\'t pay heed, you know. It don\'t interest me I mean, I don\'t know\nanything. Yes, the old women did say something, but I\'ve a bad memory,\nbad memory, I mean. But the Mir\xc3\xb3nofs are what d\'ye call it, they\'re\nall right, I mean they\'re all right.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'m that impatient to get her settled.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. And why?\n\nNAN [listens] They\'ve come!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Well, don\'t you go bothering them. [Goes on washing the spoons\nwithout turning her head].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [enters] An\xc3\xadsya! Wife! who has come? [An\xc3\xadsya looks up and turns\naway in silence].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [severely] Who has come? Have you forgotten?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Now don\'t humbug. Come in!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [still more severely] Who\'s come?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [goes up and takes him by the arm] Well then, husband has come.\nNow then, come in!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [holds back] Ah, that\'s it! Husband! And what\'s husband called?\nSpeak properly.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh bother you! Nik\xc3\xadta!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Where have you learnt manners? The full name.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Nik\xc3\xadta Ak\xc3\xadmitch! Now then!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [still in the doorway] Ah, that\'s it! But now--the surname?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [laughs and pulls him by the arm] Tchil\xc3\xadkin. Dear me, what airs!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Ah, that\'s it. [Holds on to the door-post] No, now say with\nwhich foot Tchil\xc3\xadkin steps into this house!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. That\'s enough! You\'re letting the cold in!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Say with which foot he steps? You\'ve got to say it,--that\'s\nflat.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [aside] He\'ll go on worrying. [To Nik\xc3\xadta] Well then, with the\nleft. Come in!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Ah, that\'s it.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. You look who\'s in the hut!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Ah, my parent! Well, what of that? I\'m not ashamed of my\nparent. I can pay my respects to my parent. How d\'you do, father? [Bows\nand puts out his hand] My respects to you.\n\n  [Illustration: THE POWER OF DARKNESS. ACT III.\n\n  AN\xc3\x8dSYA. Come in!\n\n  NIK\xc3\x8dTA. Ah, that\'s it.\n\n  AN\xc3\x8dSYA. You look who\'s in the hut!\n\n  NIK\xc3\x8dTA. Ah, my parent! Well, what of that? I\'m not ashamed of my\n  parent.]\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [does not answer] Drink, I mean drink, what it does! It\'s filthy!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Drink, what\'s that? I\'ve been drinking? I\'m to blame, that\'s\nflat! I\'ve had a glass with a friend, drank his health.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Go and lie down, I say.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Wife, say where am I standing?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Now then, it\'s all right, lie down!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. No, I\'ll first drink a samov\xc3\xa1r with my parent. Go and light the\nsamov\xc3\xa1r. Akoul\xc3\xadna, I say, come here!\n\n    Enter Akoul\xc3\xadna, smartly dressed and carrying their purchases.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Why have you thrown everything about? Where\'s the yarn?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. The yarn? The yarn\'s there. Hullo, M\xc3\xadtritch, where are you?\nAsleep? Asleep? Go and put the horse up.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [not seeing Akoul\xc3\xadna but looking at his son] Dear me, what is he\ndoing? The old man\'s what d\'ye call it, quite done up, I mean,--been\nthrashing,--and look at him, what d\'ye call it, putting on airs! Put up\nthe horse! Faugh, what filth!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [climbs down from the oven, and puts on felt boots] Oh,\nmerciful Lord! Is the horse in the yard? Done it to death, I dare say.\nJust see how he\'s been swilling, the deuce take him. Up to his very\nthroat. Oh Lord, holy Nicholas! [Puts on sheepskin, and exit].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [sits down] You must forgive me, father. It\'s true I\'ve had a\ndrop; well, what of that? Even a hen will drink. Ain\'t it true? So you\nmust forgive me. Never mind M\xc3\xadtritch, he doesn\'t mind, he\'ll put it up.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Shall I really light the samov\xc3\xa1r?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Light it! My parent has come. I wish to talk to him, and shall\ndrink tea with him. [To Akoul\xc3\xadna] Have you brought all the parcels?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. The parcels? I\'ve brought mine, the rest\'s in the sledge. Hi,\ntake this, this isn\'t mine!\n\n    Throws a parcel on the table and puts the others into her box. Nan\n    watches her while she puts them away. Ak\xc3\xadm does not look at his son,\n    but puts his leg-bands and bast-shoes on the oven.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [going out with the samov\xc3\xa1r] Her box is full as it is, and still\nhe\'s bought more!\n\n  [Illustration: THE POWER OF DARKNESS. ACT III.\n\n  NIK\xc3\x8dTA. Have you brought all the parcels?\n\n  AKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. The parcels? I\'ve brought mine, the rest\'s in the sledge.\n\n  AN\xc3\x8dSYA. Her box is full as it is, and still he\'s bought more!]\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [pretending to be sober] You must not be cross with me, father.\nYou think I\'m drunk? I am all there, that\'s flat! As they say, "Drink,\nbut keep your wits about you." I can talk with you at once, father. I\ncan attend to any business. You told me about the money; your horse is\nworn-out,--I remember! That can all be managed. That\'s all in our hands.\nIf it was an enormous sum that\'s wanted, then we might wait; but as it\nis I can do everything. That\'s the case.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [goes on fidgeting with the leg-bands] Eh, lad, "It\'s ill sledging\nwhen the thaw has set in."\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What d\'you mean by that? "And it\'s ill talking with one who is\ndrunk"? But don\'t you worry, let\'s have some tea. And I can do anything;\nthat\'s flat! I can put everything to rights.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [shakes his head] Eh, eh, eh!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. The money, here it is. [Puts his hand in his pocket, pulls out\npocket-book, handles the notes in it and takes out a ten-rouble note]\nTake this to get a horse; I can\'t forget my parent. I shan\'t forsake\nhim, that\'s flat. Because he\'s my parent! Here you are, take it! Really\nnow, I don\'t grudge it. [Comes up and pushes the note towards Ak\xc3\xadm who\nwon\'t take it. Nik\xc3\xadta catches hold of his father\'s hand] Take it, I tell\nyou. I don\'t grudge it.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. I can\'t, what d\'you call it, I mean, can\'t take it! And can\'t what\nd\'ye call it, talk to you, because you\'re not yourself, I mean.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I\'ll not let you go! Take it! [Puts the money into Ak\xc3\xadm\'s hand].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [enters, and stops] You\'d better take it, he\'ll give you no\npeace!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [takes it, and shakes his head] Oh! that liquor. Not like a man, I\nmean!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. That\'s better! If you repay it you\'ll repay it, if not I\'ll make\nno bother. That\'s what I am! [Sees Akoul\xc3\xadna] Akoul\xc3\xadna, show your\npresents.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. What?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Show your presents.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. The presents, what\'s the use of showing \'em? I\'ve put \'em\naway.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Get them, I tell you. Nan will like to see \'em. Undo the shawl.\nGive it here.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Oh, oh! It\'s sickening! [Climbs on the oven].\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [gets out the parcels and puts them on the table] Well, there\nyou are,--what\'s the good of looking at \'em?\n\nNAN. Oh how lovely! It\'s as good as Stepan\xc3\xadda\'s.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Stepan\xc3\xadda\'s? What\'s Stepan\xc3\xadda\'s compared to this? [Brightening\nup and undoing the parcels] Just look here,--see the quality! It\'s a\nFrench one.\n\nNAN. The print _is_ fine! Mary has a dress like it, only lighter on a\nblue ground. This _is_ pretty.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Ah, that\'s it!\n\n    An\xc3\xadsya passes angrily into the closet, returns with a tablecloth and\n    the chimney of the samov\xc3\xa1r, and goes up to the table.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Drat you, littering the table!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. You look here!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What am I to look at? Have I never seen anything? Put it away!\n[Sweeps the shawl on to the floor with her arm].\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. What are you pitching things down for? You pitch your own\nthings about! [Picks up the shawl].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. An\xc3\xadsya! Look here!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Why am I to look?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. You think I have forgotten you? Look here! [Shows her a parcel\nand sits down on it] It\'s a present for you. Only you must earn it!\nWife, where am I sitting?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Enough of your humbug. I\'m not afraid of you. Whose money are\nyou spreeing on and buying your fat wench presents with? Mine!\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Yours indeed? No fear! You wished to steal it, but it did not\ncome off! Get out of the way! [Pushes her while trying to pass].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What are you shoving for? I\'ll teach you to shove!\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Shove me? You try! [Presses against An\xc3\xadsya].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Now then, now then, you women. Have done now! [Steps between\nthem].\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Comes shoving herself in! You ought to keep quiet and remember\nyour doings! You think no one knows!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Knows what? Out with it, out with it! What do they know?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. I know something about you!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. You\'re a slut who goes with another\'s husband!\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. And you did yours to death!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [throwing herself on Akoul\xc3\xadna] You\'re raving!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [holding her back] An\xc3\xadsya, you seem to have forgotten!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Want to frighten me! I\'m not afraid of you!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [turns An\xc3\xadsya round and pushes her out] Be off!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Where am I to go? I\'ll not go out of my own house!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Be off, I tell you, and don\'t dare to come in here!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I won\'t go! [Nik\xc3\xadta pushes her, An\xc3\xadsya cries and screams and\nclings to the door] What! am I to be turned out of my own house by the\nscruff of the neck? What are you doing, you scoundrel? Do you think\nthere\'s no law for you? You wait a bit!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Now then!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'ll go to the Elder! To the policeman!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Off, I tell you! [Pushes her out].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [behind the door] I\'ll hang myself!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. No fear!\n\nNAN. Oh, oh, oh! Mother, dear, darling! [Cries].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Me frightened of her! A likely thing! What are you crying for?\nShe\'ll come back, no fear. Go and see to the samov\xc3\xa1r. [Exit Nan].\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [collects and folds her presents] The mean wretch, how she\'s\nmessed it up. But wait a bit, I\'ll cut up her jacket for her! Sure I\nwill!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I\'ve turned her out, what more do you want?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. She\'s dirtied my new shawl. If that bitch hadn\'t gone away,\nI\'d have torn her eyes out!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. That\'s enough. Why should you be angry? Now if I loved her ...\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Loved her? She\'s worth loving, with her fat mug! If you\'d have\ngiven her up, then nothing would have happened. You should have sent her\nto the devil. And the house was mine all the same, and the money was\nmine! Says she is the mistress, but what sort of mistress is she to her\nhusband? She\'s a murderess, that\'s what she is! She\'ll serve you the\nsame way!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Oh dear, how\'s one to stop a woman\'s jaw? You don\'t yourself\nknow what you\'re jabbering about!\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. Yes, I do. I\'ll not live with her! I\'ll turn her out of the\nhouse! She can\'t live here with me. The mistress indeed! She\'s not the\nmistress,--that jailbird!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. That\'s enough! What have you to do with her? Don\'t mind her. You\nlook at me! I am the master! I do as I like. I\'ve ceased to love her,\nand now I love you. I love who I like! The power is mine, she\'s under\nme. That\'s where I keep her. [Points to his feet] A pity we\'ve no\nconcertina. [Sings].\n\n        "We have loaves on the stoves,\n         We have porridge on the shelf.\n         So we\'ll live and be gay,\n         Making merry every day,\n         And when death comes,\n         Then we\'ll die!\n         We have loaves on the stoves,\n         We have porridge on the shelf ..."\n\n    Enter M\xc3\xadtritch. He takes off his outdoor things and climbs on the\n    oven.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Seems the women have been fighting again! Tearing each other\'s\nhair. Oh Lord, gracious Nicholas!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [sitting on the edge of the oven, takes his leg-bands and shoes and\nbegins putting them on] Get in, get into the corner.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Seems they can\'t settle matters between them. Oh Lord!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Get out the liquor, we\'ll have some with our tea.\n\nNAN [to Akoul\xc3\xadna] Sister, the samov\xc3\xa1r is just boiling over.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. And where\'s your mother?\n\nNAN. She\'s standing and crying out there in the passage.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Oh, that\'s it! Call her, and tell her to bring the samov\xc3\xa1r. And\nyou, Akoul\xc3\xadna, get the tea things.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. The tea things? All right. [Brings the things].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [unpacks spirits, rusks, and salt herrings] That\'s for myself.\nThis is yarn for the wife. The paraffin is out there in the passage, and\nhere\'s the money. Wait a bit, [takes a counting-frame] I\'ll add it up.\n[Adds] Wheat-flour, 80 kop\xc3\xa9ykas, oil ... Father, 10 roubles.... Father,\ncome let\'s have some tea!\n\n    Silence. Ak\xc3\xadm sits on the oven and winds the bands round his legs.\n    Enter An\xc3\xadsya with samov\xc3\xa1r.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Where shall I put it?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Here on the table. Well! have you been to the Elder? Ah, that\'s\nit! Have your say and then eat your words. Now then, that\'s enough.\nDon\'t be cross, sit down and drink this. [Fills a wine-glass for her]\nAnd here\'s your present. [Gives her the parcel he had been sitting on.\nAn\xc3\xadsya takes it silently and shakes her head].\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [gets down and puts on his sheepskin, then comes up to the table\nand puts down the money] Here, take your money back! Put it away.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [does not see the money] Why have you put on your things?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. I\'m going, going I mean; forgive me for the Lord\'s sake. [Takes up\nhis cap and belt].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. My gracious! Where are you going to at this time of night?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. I can\'t, I mean what d\'ye call \'em, in your house, what d\'ye call\n\'em, can\'t stay I mean, stay, can\'t stay, forgive me.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. But are you going without having any tea?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [fastens his belt] Going, because, I mean, it\'s not right in your\nhouse, I mean, what d\'you call it, not right, Nik\xc3\xadta, in the house, what\nd\'ye call it, not right! I mean, you are living a bad life, Nik\xc3\xadta,\nbad,--I\'ll go.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Eh now! Have done talking! Sit down and drink your tea!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Why, father, you\'ll shame us before the neighbours. What has\noffended you?\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Nothing what d\'ye call it, nothing has offended me, nothing at\nall! I mean only, I see, what d\'you call it, I mean, I see my son, to\nruin I mean, to ruin, I mean my son\'s on the road to ruin, I mean.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What ruin? Just prove it!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Ruin, ruin; you\'re in the midst of it! What did I tell you that\ntime?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. You said all sorts of things!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. I told you, what d\'ye call it, I told you about the orphan lass.\nThat you had wronged an orphan--Mar\xc3\xadna, I mean, wronged her!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Eh! he\'s at it again. Let bygones be bygones ... All that\'s\npast!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [excited] Past! No, lad, it\'s not past. Sin, I mean, fastens on to\nsin--drags sin after it, and you\'ve stuck fast, Nik\xc3\xadta, fast in sin!\nStuck fast in sin! I see you\'re fast in sin. Stuck fast, sunk in sin, I\nmean!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Sit down and drink your tea, and have done with it!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. I can\'t, I mean can\'t what d\'ye call it, can\'t drink tea. Because\nof your filth, I mean; I feel what d\'ye call it, I feel sick, very sick!\nI can\'t what d\'ye call it, I can\'t drink tea with you.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Eh! There he goes rambling! Come to the table.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. You\'re in your riches same as in a net--you\'re in a net, I mean.\nAh, Nik\xc3\xadta, it\'s the soul that God needs!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Now really, what right have you to reprove me in my own house?\nWhy do you keep on at me? Am I a child that you can pull by the hair?\nNowadays those things have been dropped!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. That\'s true. I have heard that nowadays, what d\'ye call it, that\nnowadays children pull their fathers\' beards, I mean! But that\'s ruin,\nthat\'s ruin, I mean!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [angrily] We are living without help from you, and it\'s you who\ncame to us with your wants!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. The money? There\'s your money! I\'ll go begging, begging I mean,\nbefore I\'ll take it, I mean.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. That\'s enough! Why be angry and upset the whole company! [Holds\nhim by the arm].\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [shrieks] Let go! I\'ll not stay. I\'d rather sleep under some fence\nthan in the midst of your filth! Faugh! God forgive me! [Exit].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Here\'s a go!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [reopens the door] Come to your senses, Nik\xc3\xadta! It\'s the soul that\nGod wants! [Exit].\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [takes cups] Well, shall I pour out the tea? [Takes a cup. All\nare silent].\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [roars] Oh Lord, be merciful to me a sinner! [All start].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [lies down on the bench] Oh, it\'s dull, it\'s dull! [To Akoul\xc3\xadna]\nWhere\'s the concertina?\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. The concertina? He\'s bethought himself of it. Why, you took it\nto be mended. I\'ve poured out your tea. Drink it!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I don\'t want it! Put out the light ... Oh, how dull I feel, how\ndull! [Sobs].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n    Autumn. Evening. The moon is shining. The stage represents the\n    interior of courtyard. The scenery at the back shows, in the middle,\n    the back porch of the hut. To the right the winter half of the hut\n    and the gate; to the left the summer half and the cellar. To the\n    right of the stage is a shed. The sound of tipsy voices and shouts\n    are heard from the hut.[5] Second Neighbour Woman comes out of the\n    hut and beckons to First Neighbour Woman.\n\n  [5] Where not otherwise mentioned in the stage directions, it is\n  always the winter half of the hut that is referred to as "the hut."\n  The summer half is not heated, and not used in winter under ordinary\n  circumstances.\n\n\nSECOND NEIGHBOUR. How\'s it Akoul\xc3\xadna has not shown herself?\n\nFIRST NEIGHBOUR. Why hasn\'t she shown herself? She\'d have been glad to;\nbut she\'s too ill, you know. The suitor\'s relatives have come, and want\nto see the girl; and she, my dear, she\'s lying in the cold hut and can\'t\ncome out, poor thing!\n\nSECOND NEIGHBOUR. But how\'s that?\n\nFIRST NEIGHBOUR. They say she\'s been bewitched by an evil eye! She\'s got\npains in the stomach!\n\nSECOND NEIGHBOUR. You don\'t say so?\n\nFIRST NEIGHBOUR. What else could it be? [Whispers].\n\nSECOND NEIGHBOUR. Dear me! There\'s a go! But his relatives will surely\nfind it out?\n\nFIRST NEIGHBOUR. They find it out! They\'re all drunk! Besides, they are\nchiefly after her dowry. Just think what they give with the girl! Two\nfurs, my dear, six dresses, a French shawl, and I don\'t know how many\npieces of linen, and money as well,--two hundred roubles, it\'s said!\n\nSECOND NEIGHBOUR. That\'s all very well, but even money can\'t give much\npleasure in the face of such a disgrace.\n\nFIRST NEIGHBOUR. Hush!... There\'s his father, I think.\n\n    They cease talking, and go into the hut.\n\n    The Suitor\'s Father comes out of the hut hiccoughing.\n\nTHE FATHER. Oh, I\'m all in a sweat. It\'s awfully hot! Will just cool\nmyself a bit. [Stands puffing] The Lord only knows what--something is\nnot right. I can\'t feel happy.--Well, it\'s the old woman\'s affair.\n\n    Enter Matry\xc3\xb3na from hut.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. And I was just thinking, where\'s the father? Where\'s the\nfather? And here you are, dear friend.... Well, dear friend, the Lord be\nthanked! Everything is as honourable as can be! When one\'s arranging a\nmatch one should not boast. And I have never learnt to boast. But as\nyou\'ve come about the right business, so with the Lord\'s help, you\'ll be\ngrateful to me all your life! She\'s a wonderful girl! There\'s no other\nlike her in all the district!\n\nTHE FATHER. That\'s true enough, but how about the money?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Don\'t you trouble about the money! All she had from her father\ngoes with her. And it\'s more than one gets easily, as things are\nnowadays. Three times fifty roubles!\n\nTHE FATHER. We don\'t complain, but it\'s for our own child. Naturally we\nwant to get the best we can.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. I\'ll tell you straight, friend: if it hadn\'t been for me,\nyou\'d never have found anything like her! They\'ve had an offer from the\nKarm\xc3\xadlins, but I stood out against it. And as for the money, I\'ll tell\nyou truly: when her father, God be merciful to his soul, was dying, he\ngave orders that the widow should take Nik\xc3\xadta into the homestead--of\ncourse I know all about it from my son,--and the money was to go to\nAkoul\xc3\xadna. Why, another one might have thought of his own interests, but\nNik\xc3\xadta gives everything clean! It\'s no trifle. Fancy what a sum it is!\n\nTHE FATHER. People are saying, that more money was left her? The lad\'s\nsharp too!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Oh, dear soul alive! A slice in another\'s hand always looks\nbig; all she had will be handed over. I tell you, throw doubts to the\nwind and make all sure! What a girl she is! as fresh as a daisy!\n\nTHE FATHER. That\'s so. But my old woman and I were only wondering about\nthe girl; why has she not come out? We\'ve been thinking, suppose she\'s\nsickly?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Oh, ah.... Who? She? Sickly? Why, there\'s none to compare with\nher in the district. The girl\'s as sound as a bell; you can\'t pinch her.\nBut you saw her the other day! And as for work, she\'s wonderful! She\'s a\nbit deaf, that\'s true, but there are spots on the sun, you know. And her\nnot coming out, you see, it\'s from an evil eye! A spell\'s been cast on\nher! And I know the bitch who\'s done the business! They know of the\nbetrothal and they bewitched her. But I know a counter-spell. The girl\nwill get up to-morrow. Don\'t you worry about the girl!\n\nTHE FATHER. Well, of course, the thing\'s settled.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Yes, of course! Don\'t you turn back. And don\'t forget me, I\'ve\nhad a lot of trouble. Don\'t forget ...\n\n    A woman\'s voice from the hut.\n\nVOICE. If we are to go, let\'s go. Come along, Iv\xc3\xa1n!\n\nTHE FATHER. I\'m coming. [Exeunt. Guests crowd together in the passage\nand prepare to go away].\n\nNAN [runs out of the hut and calls to An\xc3\xadsya] Mother!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [from inside] What d\'you want?\n\nNAN. Mother, come here, or they\'ll hear.\n\n    An\xc3\xadsya enters and they go together to the shed.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Well? What is it? Where\'s Akoul\xc3\xadna?\n\nNAN. She\'s gone into the barn. It\'s awful what\'s she\'s doing there! I\'m\nblest! "I can\'t bear it," she says. "I\'ll scream," she says, "I\'ll\nscream out loud." Blest if she didn\'t.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. She\'ll have to wait. We\'ll see our visitors off first.\n\nNAN. Oh mother! She\'s so bad! And she\'s angry too. "What\'s the good of\ntheir drinking my health?" she says. "I shan\'t marry," she says. "I\nshall die," she says. Mother, supposing she does die! It\'s awful. I\'m so\nfrightened!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. No fear, she\'ll not die. But don\'t you go near her. Come along.\n[Exit An\xc3\xadsya and Nan].\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [comes in at the gate and begins collecting the scattered hay]\nOh Lord! Merciful Nicholas! What a lot of liquor they\'ve been and\nswilled, and the smell they\'ve made! It smells even out here! But no, I\ndon\'t want any, drat it! See how they\'ve scattered the hay about. They\ndon\'t eat it, but only trample it under foot. A truss gone before you\nknow it. Oh, that smell, it seems to be just under my nose! Drat it!\n[Yawns] It\'s time to go to sleep! But I don\'t care to go into the hut.\nIt seems to float just round my nose! It has a strong scent, the damned\nstuff! [The guests are heard driving off] They\'re off at last. Oh Lord!\nMerciful Nicholas! There they go, binding themselves and gulling one\nanother. And it\'s all gammon!\n\n    Enter Nik\xc3\xadta.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. M\xc3\xadtritch, you get off to sleep and I\'ll put this straight.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. All right, you throw it to the sheep. Well, have you seen \'em\nall off?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Yes, they\'re off! But things are not right! I don\'t know what to\ndo!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. It\'s a fine mess. But there\'s the Foundlings\'[6] for that sort\nof thing. Whoever likes may drop one there; they\'ll take \'em all. Give\n\'em as many as you like, they ask no questions, and even pay--if the\nmother goes in as a wet-nurse. It\'s easy enough nowadays.\n\n  [6] The Foundlings\' Hospital in Moscow, where 80 to 90 per cent. of\n  the children die.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. But mind, M\xc3\xadtritch, don\'t go blabbing.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. It\'s no concern of mine. Cover the tracks as you think best.\nDear me, how you smell of liquor! I\'ll go in. Oh Lord! [Exit, yawning].\n\n    Nik\xc3\xadta is long silent. Sits down on a sledge.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Here\'s a go!\n\n    Enter An\xc3\xadsya.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Where are you?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Here.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What are you doing there? There\'s no time to be lost! We must\ntake it out directly!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What are we to do?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'ll tell you what you are to do. And you\'ll have to do it!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. You\'d better take it to the Foundlings\'--if anything.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Then you\'d better take it there yourself if you like! You\'ve a\nhankering for smut, but you\'re weak when it comes to settling up, I see!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What\'s to be done?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Go down into the cellar, I tell you, and dig a hole!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Couldn\'t you manage, somehow, some other way?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [imitating him] "Some other way?" Seems we can\'t "some other\nway!" You should have thought about it a year ago. Do what you\'re told\nto!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Oh dear, what a go!\n\n    Enter Nan.\n\nNAN. Mother! Grandmother\'s calling! I think sister\'s got a baby! I\'m\nblest if it didn\'t scream!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What are you babbling about? Plague take you! It\'s kittens\nwhining there. Go into the hut and sleep, or I\'ll give it you!\n\nNAN. Mammy dear, truly, I swear ...\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [raising her arm as if to strike] I\'ll give it you! You be off\nand don\'t let me catch sight of you! [Nan runs into hut. To Nik\xc3\xadta] Do\nas you\'re told, or else mind! [Exit].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [alone. After a long silence] Here\'s a go! Oh these women! What a\nfix! Says you should have thought of it a year ago. When\'s one to think\nbeforehand? When\'s one to think? Why, last year this An\xc3\xadsya dangled\nafter me. What was I to do? Am I a monk? The master died; and I covered\nmy sin as was proper, so I was not to blame there. Aren\'t there lots of\nsuch cases? And then those powders. Did I put her up to that? Why, had I\nknown what the bitch was up to, I\'d have killed her! I\'m sure I should\nhave killed her! She\'s made me her partner in these horrors--that jade!\nAnd she became loathsome to me from that day! She became loathsome,\nloathsome to me as soon as mother told me about it. I can\'t bear the\nsight of her! Well then, how could I live with her? And then it\nbegun.... That wench began hanging round. Well, what was I to do! If I\nhad not done it, someone else would. And this is what comes of it! Still\nI\'m not to blame in this either. Oh, what a go! [Sits thinking] They are\nbold, these women! What a plan to think of! But I won\'t have a hand in\nit!\n\n    Enter Matry\xc3\xb3na with a lantern and spade, panting.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Why are you sitting there like a hen on a perch? What did your\nwife tell you to do? You just get things ready!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What do you mean to do?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. We know what to do. You do your share!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. You\'ll be getting me into a mess!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. What? You\'re not thinking of backing out, are you? Now it\'s\ncome to this, and you back out!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Think what a thing it would be! It\'s a living soul.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. A living soul indeed! Why, it\'s more dead than alive. And\nwhat\'s one to do with it? Go and take it to the Foundlings\'--it will die\njust the same, and the rumour will get about, and people will talk, and\nthe girl be left on our hands.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. And supposing it\'s found out?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Not manage to do it in one\'s own house? We\'ll manage it so\nthat no one will have an inkling. Only do as I tell you. We women can\'t\ndo it without a man. There, take the spade, and get it done there,--I\'ll\nhold the light.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What am I to get done?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [in a low voice] Dig a hole; then we\'ll bring it out and get it\nout of the way in a trice! There, she\'s calling again. Now then, get in,\nand I\'ll go.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Is it dead then?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Of course it is. Only you must be quick, or else people will\nnotice! They\'ll see or they\'ll hear! The rascals must needs know\neverything. And the policeman went by this evening. Well then, you see\n[gives him the spade], you get down into the cellar and dig a hole right\nin the corner; the earth is soft there, and you\'ll smooth it over.\nMother earth will not blab to any one; she\'ll keep it close. Go then;\ngo, dear.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. You\'ll get me into a mess, bother you! I\'ll go away! You do it\nalone as best you can!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [through the doorway] Well? Has he dug it?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Why have you come away? What have you done with it?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'ve covered it with rags. No one can hear it. Well, has he dug\nit?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. He doesn\'t want to!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [springs out enraged] Doesn\'t want to! How will he like feeding\nvermin in prison! I\'ll go straight away and tell everything to the\npolice! It\'s all the same if one must perish. I\'ll go straight and tell!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [taken aback] What will you tell?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What? Everything! Who took the money? You! [Nik\xc3\xadta is silent]\nAnd who gave the poison? I did! But you knew! You knew! You knew! We\nwere in agreement!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. That\'s enough now. Nik\xc3\xadta dear, why are you obstinate? What\'s\nto be done now? One must take some trouble. Go, honey.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. See the fine gentleman! He doesn\'t like it! You\'ve put upon me\nlong enough! You\'ve trampled me under foot! Now it\'s my turn! Go, I tell\nyou, or else I\'ll do what I said.... There, take the spade; there, now\ngo!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Drat you! Can\'t you leave a fellow alone! [Takes the spade, but\nshrinks] If I don\'t choose to, I\'ll not go!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Not go? [Begins to shout] Neighbours! Heh! heh!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [closes her mouth] What are you about? You\'re mad! He\'ll go....\nGo, sonnie; go, my own.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'ll cry murder!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Now stop! Oh what people! You\'d better be quick.... As well be\nhung for a sheep as a lamb! [Goes towards the cellar].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Yes, that\'s just it, honey. If you know how to amuse yourself,\nyou must know how to hide the consequences.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [still excited] He\'s trampled on me ... he and his slut! But it\'s\nenough! I\'m not going to be the only one! Let him also be a murderer!\nThen he\'ll know how it feels!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. There, there! How she flares up! Don\'t you be cross, lass, but\ndo things quietly little by little, as it\'s best. You go to the girl,\nand he\'ll do the work. [Follows Nik\xc3\xadta to the cellar with a lantern. He\ndescends into the cellar].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And I\'ll make him strangle his dirty brat! [Still excited] I\'ve\nworried myself to death all alone, with Peter\'s bones weighing on my\nmind! Let him feel it too! I\'ll not spare myself; I\'ve said I\'ll not\nspare myself!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [from the cellar] Show a light!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [holds up the lantern to him. To An\xc3\xadsya] He\'s digging. Go and\nbring it.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. You stay with him, or he\'ll go away, the wretch! And I\'ll go and\nbring it.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Mind, don\'t forget to baptize it, or I will if you like. Have\nyou a cross?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'ll find one. I know how to do it. [Exit].\n\n    See at end of Act, Variation, which may be used instead of the\n    following.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. How the woman bristled up! But one must allow she\'s been put\nupon. Well, but with the Lord\'s help, when we\'ve covered this business,\nthere\'ll be an end of it. We\'ll shove the girl off without any trouble.\nMy son will live in comfort. The house, thank God, is as full as an egg.\nThey\'ll not forget me either. Where would they have been without\nMatry\xc3\xb3na? They\'d not have known how to contrive things. [Peering into\nthe cellar] Is it ready, sonnie?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [puts out his head] What are you about there? Bring it quick!\nWhat are you dawdling for? If it is to be done, let it be done.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [goes towards door of the hut and meets An\xc3\xadsya. An\xc3\xadsya comes\nout with a baby wrapped in rags] Well, have you baptized it?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Why, of course! It was all I could do to take it away--she\nwouldn\'t give it up! [Comes forward and hands it to Nik\xc3\xadta].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [does not take it] You bring it yourself!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Take it, I tell you! [Throws the baby to him].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [catches it] It\'s alive! Gracious me, it\'s moving! It\'s alive!\nWhat am I to ...\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [snatches the baby from him and throws it into the cellar] Be\nquick and smother it, and then it won\'t be alive! [Pushes Nik\xc3\xadta down]\nIt\'s your doing, and you must finish it.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [sits on the doorstep of the hut] He\'s tender-hearted. It\'s\nhard on him, poor dear. Well, what of that? Isn\'t it also his sin?\n\n    An\xc3\xadsya stands by the cellar.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [sits looking at her and discourses] Oh, oh, oh! How frightened\nhe was: well, but what of that? If it _is_ hard, it\'s the only thing to\nbe done. Where was one to put it? And just think, how often it happens\nthat people pray to God to have children! But no, God gives them none;\nor they are all still-born. Look at our priest\'s wife now.... And here,\nwhere it\'s not wanted, here it lives. [Looks towards the cellar] I\nsuppose he\'s finished. [To An\xc3\xadsya] Well?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [looking into the cellar] He\'s put a board on it and is sitting\non it. It must be finished!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Oh, oh! One would be glad not to sin, but what\'s one to do?\n\n    Re-enter Nik\xc3\xadta from cellar, trembling all over.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. It\'s still alive! I can\'t! It\'s alive!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. If it\'s alive, where are you off to? [Tries to stop him].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [rushes at her] Go away! I\'ll kill you! [Catches hold of her\narms; she escapes, he runs after her with the spade. Matry\xc3\xb3na runs\ntowards him and stops him. An\xc3\xadsya runs into the porch. Matry\xc3\xb3na tries to\nwrench the spade from him. To his mother] I\'ll kill you! I\'ll kill you!\nGo away! [Matry\xc3\xb3na runs to An\xc3\xadsya in the porch. Nik\xc3\xadta stops] I\'ll kill\nyou! I\'ll kill you all!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. That\'s because he\'s so frightened! Never mind, it will pass!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What have they made me do? What have they made me do? How it\nwhimpered.... How it crunched under me! What have they done with me?...\nAnd it\'s really alive, still alive! [Listens in silence] It\'s whimpering\n... There, it\'s whimpering. [Runs to the cellar].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [to An\xc3\xadsya] He\'s going; it seems he means to bury it. Nik\xc3\xadta,\nyou\'d better take the lantern!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [does not heed her, but listens by the cellar door] I can hear\nnothing! I suppose it was fancy! [Moves away, then stops] How the little\nbones crunched under me. Krr ... kr ... What have they made me do?\n[Listens again] Again whimpering! It\'s really whimpering! What can it\nbe? Mother! Mother, I say! [Goes up to her].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. What is it, sonnie?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Mother, my own mother, I can\'t do any more! Can\'t do any more!\nMy own mother, have some pity on me!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Oh dear, how frightened you are, my darling! Come, come, drink\na drop to give you courage!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Mother, mother! It seems my time has come! What have you done\nwith me? How the little bones crunched, and how it whimpered! My own\nmother! What have you done with me? [Steps aside and sits down on the\nsledge].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Come, my own, have a drink! It certainly does seem uncanny at\nnight-time. But wait a bit. When the day breaks, you know, and one day\nand another passes, you\'ll forget even to think of it. Wait a bit; when\nthe girl\'s married we\'ll even forget to think of it. But you go and have\na drink; have a drink! I\'ll go and put things straight in the cellar\nmyself.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [rouses himself] Is there any drink left? Perhaps I can drink it\noff! [Exit].\n\n    An\xc3\xadsya, who has stood all the time by the door, silently makes way\n    for him.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Go, go, honey, and I\'ll set to work! I\'ll go down myself and\ndig! Where has he thrown the spade to? [Finds the spade, and goes down\ninto the cellar] An\xc3\xadsya, come here! Hold the light, will you?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And what of him?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. He\'s so frightened! You\'ve been too hard with him. Leave him\nalone, he\'ll come to his senses. God help him! I\'ll set to work myself.\nPut the lantern down here. I can see.\n\n    Matry\xc3\xb3na disappears into the cellar.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [looking towards the door by which Nik\xc3\xadta entered the hut] Well,\nhave you had enough spree? You\'ve been puffing yourself up, but now\nyou\'ll know how it feels! You\'ll lose some of your bluster!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [rushes out of the hut towards the cellar] Mother! mother, I say!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [puts out her head] What is it, sonnie?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [listening] Don\'t bury it, it\'s alive! Don\'t you hear? Alive!\nThere--it\'s whimpering! There ... quite plain!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. How can it whimper? Why, you\'ve flattened it into a pancake!\nThe whole head is smashed to bits!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What is it then? [Stops his ears] It\'s still whimpering! I am\nlost! Lost! What have they done with me?... Where shall I go? [Sits down\non the step].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\nVARIATION\n\n    Instead of the end of Act IV. (from the words, "AN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'ll find\n    one. I know how to do it. [Exit]") the following variation may be\n    read, and is the one usually acted.\n\n\nSCENE 2.\n\n    The interior of the hut as in Act I.\n\n    Nan lies on the bench, and is covered with a coat. M\xc3\xadtritch is\n    sitting on the oven smoking.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Dear me! How they\'ve made the place smell! Drat \'em! They\'ve\nbeen spilling the fine stuff. Even tobacco don\'t get rid of the smell!\nIt keeps tickling one\'s nose so. Oh Lord! But it\'s bedtime, I guess.\n[Approaches the lamp to put it out].\n\nNAN [jumps up, and remains sitting up] Daddy dear,[7] don\'t put it out!\n\n  [7] Nan calls M\xc3\xadtritch "daddy" merely as a term of endearment.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Not put it out? Why?\n\nNAN. Didn\'t you hear them making a row in the yard? [Listens] D\'you\nhear, there in the barn again now?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What\'s that to you? I guess no one\'s asked you to mind! Lie\ndown and sleep! And I\'ll turn down the light. [Turns down lamp].\n\nNAN. Daddy darling! Don\'t put it right out; leave a little bit if only\nas big as a mouse\'s eye, else it\'s so frightening!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [laughs] All right, all right. [Sits down by her] What\'s there\nto be afraid of?\n\nNAN. How can one help being frightened, daddy! Sister did go on so! She\nwas beating her head against the box! [Whispers] You know, I know ... a\nlittle baby is going to be born.... It\'s already born, I think....\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Eh, what a little busybody it is! May the frogs kick her! Must\nneeds know everything. Lie down and sleep! [Nan lies down] That\'s right!\n[Tucks her up] That\'s right! There now, if you know too much you\'ll grow\nold too soon.\n\nNAN. And you are going to lie on the oven?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Well, of course! What a little silly you are, now I come to\nlook at you! Must needs know everything. [Tucks her up again, then\nstands up to go] There now, lie still and sleep! [Goes up to the oven].\n\nNAN. It gave just one cry, and now there\'s nothing to be heard.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas! What is it you can\'t hear?\n\nNAN. The baby.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. There is none, that\'s why you can\'t hear it.\n\nNAN. But I heard it! Blest if I didn\'t hear it! Such a thin voice!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Heard indeed! Much you heard! Well, if you know,--why then it\nwas just such a little girl as you that the bogey popped into his bag\nand made off with.\n\nNAN. What bogey?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Why, just his very self! [Climbs up on to the oven] The oven\nis beautifully warm to-night. Quite a treat! Oh Lord! Gracious Nicholas!\n\nNAN. Daddy! are you going to sleep?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What else? Do you think I\'m going to sing songs?\n\n    Silence.\n\nNAN. Daddy! Daddy, I say! They are digging! they\'re digging--don\'t you\nhear? Blest if they\'re not, they\'re digging!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What are you dreaming about? Digging! Digging in the night!\nWho\'s digging? The cow\'s rubbing herself, that\'s all. Digging indeed! Go\nto sleep I tell you, else I\'ll just put out the light!\n\nNAN. Daddy darling, don\'t put it out! I won\'t ... truly, truly, I won\'t.\nIt\'s so frightful!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Frightful? Don\'t be afraid and then it won\'t be frightful.\nLook at her, she\'s afraid, and then says it\'s frightful. How can it help\nbeing frightful if you are afraid? Eh, what a stupid little girl!\n\n    Silence. The cricket chirps.\n\nNAN [whispers] Daddy! I say, daddy! Are you asleep?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Now then, what d\'you want?\n\nNAN. What\'s the bogey like?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Why, like this! When he finds such a one as you, who won\'t\nsleep, he comes with a sack and pops the girl into it, then in he gets\nhimself, head and all, lifts her dress, and gives her a fine whipping!\n\nNAN. What with?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. He takes a birch-broom with him.\n\nNAN. But he can\'t see there--inside the sack!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. He\'ll see, no fear!\n\nNAN. But I\'ll bite him.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. No, friend, him you can\'t bite!\n\nNAN. Daddy, there\'s some one coming! Who is it? Oh gracious goodness!\nWho can it be?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Well, if some one\'s coming, let them come! What\'s the matter\nwith you? I suppose it\'s your mother!\n\n    Enter An\xc3\xadsya.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Nan! [Nan pretends to be asleep] M\xc3\xadtritch!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What\'s the lamp burning for? We are going to sleep in the\nsummer-hut.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Why, you see I\'ve only just got straight. I\'ll put the light\nout all right.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [rummages in her box and grumbles] When a thing\'s wanted one\nnever can find it!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Why, what is it you are looking for?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. I\'m looking for a cross. Suppose it were to die unbaptized! It\nwould be a sin, you know!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Of course it would! Everything in due order.... Have you found\nit?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Yes, I\'ve found it. [Exit].\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. That\'s right, else I\'d have lent her mine. Oh Lord!\n\nNAN [jumps up trembling] Oh, oh, daddy! Don\'t go to sleep; for goodness\'\nsake, don\'t! It\'s so frightful!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What\'s frightful?\n\nNAN. It will die--the little baby will! At Aunt Irene\'s the old woman\nalso baptized the baby, and it died!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. If it dies, they\'ll bury it!\n\nNAN. But maybe it wouldn\'t have died, only old Granny Matry\xc3\xb3na\'s there!\nDidn\'t I hear what granny was saying? I heard her! Blest if I didn\'t!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What did you hear? Go to sleep, I tell you. Cover yourself up,\nhead and all, and let\'s have an end of it!\n\nNAN. If it lived, I\'d nurse it!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [roars] Oh Lord!\n\nNAN. Where will they put it?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. In the right place! It\'s no business of yours! Go to sleep I\ntell you, else mother will come; she\'ll give it you! [Silence].\n\nNAN. Daddy! Eh, daddy! That girl, you know, you were telling about--they\ndidn\'t kill her?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. That girl? Oh yes. That girl turned out all right!\n\nNAN. How was it? You were saying you found her?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Well, we just found her!\n\nNAN. But where did you find her? Do tell!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Why, in their own house; that\'s where! We came to a village,\nthe soldiers began hunting about in the house, when suddenly there\'s\nthat same little girl lying on the floor, flat on her stomach. We were\ngoing to give her a knock on the head, but all at once I felt that\nsorry, that I took her up in my arms; but no, she wouldn\'t let me! Made\nherself so heavy, quite a hundredweight, and caught hold where she could\nwith her hands, so that one couldn\'t get them off! Well, so I began\nstroking her head. It was so bristly,--just like a hedgehog! So I\nstroked and stroked, and she quieted down at last. I soaked a bit of\nrusk and gave it her. She understood that, and began nibbling. What were\nwe to do with her? We took her; took her, and began feeding and feeding\nher, and she got so used to us that we took her with us on the march,\nand so she went about with us. Ah, she was a fine girl!\n\nNAN. Yes, and not baptized?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Who can tell! They used to say, not altogether. \'Cos why,\nthose people weren\'t our own.\n\nNAN. Germans?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What an idea! Germans! Not Germans, but Asiatics. They are\njust the same as Jews, but still not Jews. Polish, yet Asiatics. Curls\n... or, Curdlys is their name.... I\'ve forgotten what it is![8] We\ncalled the girl S\xc3\xa1shka. She was a fine girl, S\xc3\xa1shka was! There now, I\'ve\nforgotten everything I used to know! But that girl--the deuce take\nher--seems to be before my eyes now! Out of all my time of service, I\nremember how they flogged me, and I remember that girl. That\'s all I\nremember! She\'d hang round one\'s neck, and one \'ud carry her so. That\nwas a girl,--if you wanted a better you\'d not find one! We gave her away\nafterwards. The captain\'s wife took her to bring up as her daughter.\nSo--she was all right! How sorry the soldiers were to let her go!\n\n  [8] Probably Kurds.\n\nNAN. There now, daddy, and I remember when father was dying,--you were\nnot living with us then. Well, he called Nik\xc3\xadta and says, "Forgive me,\nNik\xc3\xadta!" he says, and begins to cry. [Sighs] That also felt very sad!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Yes; there now, so it is ...\n\nNAN. Daddy! Daddy, I say! There they are again, making a noise in the\ncellar! Oh gracious heavens! Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh, daddy! They\'ll do\nsomething to it! They\'ll make away with it, and it\'s so little! Oh, oh!\n[Covers up her head and cries].\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [listening] Really they\'re up to some villainy, blow them to\nshivers! Oh, these women are vile creatures! One can\'t say much for men\neither; but women!... They are like wild beasts, and stick at nothing!\n\nNAN [rising] Daddy; I say, daddy!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Well, what now?\n\nNAN. The other day a traveller stayed the night; he said that when an\ninfant died its soul goes up straight to heaven. Is that true?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Who can tell. I suppose so. Well?\n\nNAN. Oh, it would be best if I died too. [Whimpers].\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Then you\'d be off the list!\n\nNAN. Up to ten one\'s an infant, and maybe one\'s soul would go to God.\nElse one\'s sure to go to the bad!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. And how to the bad? How should the likes of you not go to the\nbad? Who teaches you? What do you see? What do you hear? Only vileness!\nI, though I\'ve not been taught much, still know a thing or two. I\'m not\nquite like a peasant woman. A peasant woman, what is she? Just mud!\nThere are many millions of the likes of you in Russia, and all as blind\nas moles--knowing nothing! All sorts of spells: how to stop the\ncattle-plague with a plough, and how to cure children by putting them\nunder the perches in the hen-house! That\'s what they know!\n\nNAN. Yes, mother also did that!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Yes,--there it is,--just so! So many millions of girls and\nwomen, and all like beasts in a forest! As she grows up, so she dies!\nNever sees anything; never hears anything. A peasant,--he may learn\nsomething at the pub, or maybe in prison, or in the army,--as I did. But\na woman? Let alone about God, she doesn\'t even know rightly what Friday\nit is! Friday! Friday! But ask her what\'s Friday? She don\'t know!\nThey\'re like blind puppies, creeping about and poking their noses into\nthe dung-heap.... All they know are their silly songs. Ho, ho, ho, ho!\nBut what they mean by ho-ho, they don\'t know themselves!\n\nNAN. But I, daddy, I do know half the Lord\'s Prayer!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. A lot you know! But what can one expect of you? Who teaches\nyou? Only a tipsy peasant--with the strap perhaps! That\'s all the\nteaching you get! I don\'t know who\'ll have to answer for you. For a\nrecruit, the drill-sergeant or the corporal has to answer; but for the\nlikes of you there\'s no one responsible! Just as the cattle that have no\nherdsman are the most mischievous, so with you women--you are the\nstupidest class! The most foolish class is yours!\n\nNAN. Then what\'s one to do?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. That\'s what one has to do.... You just cover up your head and\nsleep! Oh Lord!\n\n    Silence. The cricket chirps.\n\nNAN [jumps up] Daddy! Some one\'s screaming awfully! Blest if some one\nisn\'t screaming! Daddy darling, it\'s coming here!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Cover up your head, I tell you!\n\n    Enter Nik\xc3\xadta, followed by Matry\xc3\xb3na.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What have they done with me? What have they done with me?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Have a drop, honey; have a drop of drink! What\'s the matter?\n[Fetches the spirits and sets the bottle before him].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Give it here! Perhaps the drink will help me!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Mind! They\'re not asleep! Here you are, have a drop!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What does it all mean? Why did you plan it? You might have taken\nit somewhere!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [whispers] Sit still a bit and drink a little more, or have a\nsmoke. It will ease your thoughts!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. My own mother! My turn seems to have come! How it began to\nwhimper, and how the little bones crunched ... krr ... I\'m not a man\nnow!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Eh, now, what\'s the use of talking so silly! Of course it does\nseem fearsome at night, but wait till the daylight comes, and a day or\ntwo passes, and you\'ll forget to think of it! [Goes up to Nik\xc3\xadta and\nputs her hand on his shoulder].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Go away from me! What have you done with me?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Come, come, sonnie! Now really, what\'s the matter with you?\n[Takes his hand].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Go away from me! I\'ll kill you! It\'s all one to me now! I\'ll\nkill you!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Oh, oh, how frightened he\'s got! You should go and have a\nsleep now!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I have nowhere to go; I\'m lost!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [shaking her head] Oh, oh, I\'d better go and tidy things up.\nHe\'ll sit and rest a bit, and it will pass! [Exit].\n\n    Nik\xc3\xadta sits with his face in his hands. M\xc3\xadtritch and Nan seem\n    stunned.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. It\'s whining! It\'s whining! It is really--there, there, quite\nplain! She\'ll bury it, really she will! [Runs to the door] Mother, don\'t\nbury it, it\'s alive....\n\n    Enter Matry\xc3\xb3na.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [whispers] Now then, what is it? Heaven help you! Why won\'t you\nget to rest? How can it be alive? All its bones are crushed!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Give me more drink! [Drinks].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Now go, sonnie. You\'ll fall asleep now all right.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [stands listening] Still alive ... there ... it\'s whining! Don\'t\nyou hear?... There!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [whispers] No! I tell you!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Mother! My own mother! I\'ve ruined my life! What have you done\nwith me? Where am I to go? [Runs out of the hut; Matry\xc3\xb3na follows him].\n\nNAN. Daddy dear, darling, they\'ve smothered it!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH [angrily] Go to sleep, I tell you! Oh dear, may the frogs kick\nyou! I\'ll give it to you with the broom! Go to sleep, I tell you!\n\nNAN. Daddy, my treasure! Something is catching hold of my shoulders,\nsomething is catching hold with its paws! Daddy dear ... really, really\n... I must go! Daddy, darling! let me get up on the oven with you! Let\nme, for Heaven\'s sake! Catching hold ... catching hold! Oh! [Runs to the\nstove].\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. See how they\'ve frightened the girl.... What vile creatures\nthey are! May the frogs kick them! Well then, climb up.\n\nNAN [climbs on oven] But don\'t you go away!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Where should I go to? Climb up, climb up! Oh Lord! Gracious\nNicholas! Holy Mother!... How they have frighted the girl. [Covers her\nup] There\'s a little fool--really a little fool! How they\'ve frighted\nher; really, they are vile creatures! The deuce take \'em!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT V\n\n\nSCENE 1.\n\n    In front of scene a stack-stand, to the left a thrashing ground, to\n    the right a barn. The barn doors are open. Straw is strewn about in\n    the doorway. The hut with yard and out-buildings is seen in the\n    background, whence proceed sounds of singing and of a tambourine.\n    Two Girls are walking past the barn towards the hut.\n\nFIRST GIRL. There, you see we\'ve managed to pass without so much as\ngetting our boots dirty! But to come by the street is terribly muddy!\n[Stop and wipe their boots on the straw. First Girl looks at the straw\nand sees something] What\'s that?\n\nSECOND GIRL [looks where the straw lies and sees some one] It\'s\nM\xc3\xadtritch, their labourer. Just look how drunk he is!\n\nFIRST GIRL. Why, I thought he didn\'t drink.\n\nSECOND GIRL. It seems he didn\'t, until it was going around.\n\nFIRST GIRL. Just see! He must have come to fetch some straw. Look! he\'s\ngot a rope in his hand, and he\'s fallen asleep.\n\nSECOND GIRL [listening] They\'re still singing the praises.[9] So I\ns\'pose the bride and bridegroom have not yet been blessed! They say\nAkoul\xc3\xadna didn\'t even lament![10]\n\n  [9] This refers to the songs customary at the wedding of Russian\n  peasants, praising the bride and bridegroom.\n\n  [10] It is etiquette for a bride to bewail the approaching loss of her\n  maidenhood.\n\nFIRST GIRL. Mammie says she is marrying against her will. Her\nstepfather threatened her, or else she\'d not have done it for the world!\nWhy, you know what they\'ve been saying about her?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA [catching up the Girls] How d\'you do, lassies?\n\nGIRLS. How d\'you do?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. Going to the wedding, my dears?\n\nFIRST GIRL. It\'s nearly over! We\'ve come just to have a look.\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. Would you call my old man for me? Simon, from Zo\xc3\xbaevo; but surely\nyou know him?\n\nFIRST GIRL. To be sure we do; he\'s a relative of the bridegroom\'s, I\nthink?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. Of course; he\'s my old man\'s nephew, the bridegroom is.\n\nSECOND GIRL. Why don\'t you go yourself? Fancy not going to a wedding!\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. I have no mind for it, and no time either. It\'s time for us to\nbe going home. We didn\'t mean to come to the wedding. We were taking\noats to town. We only stopped to feed the horse, and they made my old\nman go in.\n\nFIRST GIRL. Where did you put up then? At Fy\xc3\xb3doritch\'s?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. Yes. Well then, I\'ll stay here and you go and call him, my\ndear--my old man. Call him, my pet, and say "Your missis, Mar\xc3\xadna, says\nyou must go now!" His mates are harnessing.\n\nFIRST GIRL. Well, all right--if you won\'t go in yourself.\n\n    The Girls go away towards the house along a footpath. Sounds of\n    songs and tambourine.\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA [alone, stands thinking] I might go in, but I don\'t like to,\nbecause I have not met him since that day he threw me over. It\'s more\nthan a year now. But I\'d have liked to have a peep and see how he lives\nwith his An\xc3\xadsya. People say they don\'t get on. She\'s a coarse woman, and\nwith a character of her own. I should think he\'s remembered me more\nthan once. He\'s been caught by the idea of a comfortable life and has\nchanged me for it. But, God help him, I don\'t cherish ill-will! Then it\nhurt! Oh dear, it was pain! But now it\'s worn away and been forgotten.\nBut I\'d like to have seen him. [Looks towards hut and sees Nik\xc3\xadta] Look\nthere! Why, he is coming here! Have the girls told him? How\'s it he has\nleft his guests? I\'ll go away! [Nik\xc3\xadta approaches, hanging his head\ndown, swinging his arms, and muttering] And how sullen he looks!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [sees and recognises Mar\xc3\xadna] Mar\xc3\xadna, dearest friend, little\nMar\xc3\xadna, what do you want?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. I have come for my old man.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Why didn\'t you come to the wedding? You might have had a look\nround, and a laugh at my expense!\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. What have I to laugh at? I\'ve come for my husband.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Ah, Mar\xc3\xadna dear! [Tries to embrace her].\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA [steps angrily aside] You\'d better drop that sort of thing,\nNik\xc3\xadta! What has been, is past! I\'ve come for my husband. Is he in your\nhouse?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. So I must not remember the past? You won\'t let me?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. It\'s no use recalling the past! What used to be is over now!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. And can never come back, you mean?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. And will never come back! But why have you gone away? You, the\nmaster,--and to go away from the feast!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [sits down on the straw] Why have I gone away? Eh, if you knew,\nif you had any idea ... I\'m dull, Mar\xc3\xadna, so dull that I wish my eyes\nwould not see! I rose from the table and left them, to get away from the\npeople. If I could only avoid seeing any one!\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA [coming nearer to him] How\'s that?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. This is how it is: when I eat, it\'s there! When I drink, it\'s\nthere! When I sleep, it\'s there! I\'m so sick of it--so sick! But it\'s\nchiefly because I\'m all alone that I\'m so sick, little Mar\xc3\xadna. I have no\none to share my trouble.\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. You can\'t live your life without trouble, Nik\xc3\xadta. However, I\'ve\nwept over mine and wept it away.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. The former, the old trouble! Ah, dear friend, you\'ve wept yours\naway, and I\'ve got mine up to there! [Puts his hand to his throat].\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. But why?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Why, I\'m sick of my whole life! I am sick of myself! Ah, Mar\xc3\xadna,\nwhy did you not know how to keep me? You\'ve ruined me, and yourself too!\nIs this life?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA [stands by the barn crying, but restrains herself] I do not\ncomplain of my life, Nik\xc3\xadta! God grant every one a life like mine. I do\nnot complain. I confessed to my old man at the time, and he forgave me.\nAnd he does not reproach me. I\'m not discontented with my life. The old\nman is quiet, and is fond of me, and I keep his children clothed and\nwashed! He is really kind to me. Why should I complain? It seems God\nwilled it so. And what\'s the matter with your life? You are rich ...\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. My life!... It\'s only that I don\'t wish to disturb the wedding\nfeast, or I\'d take this rope here [takes hold of the rope on the straw]\nand throw it across that rafter there. Then I\'d make a noose and stretch\nit out, and I\'d climb on to that rafter and jump down with my head in\nthe noose! That\'s what my life is!\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. That\'s enough! Lord help you!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. You think I\'m joking? You think I\'m drunk? I\'m not drunk! To-day\neven drink takes no hold on me! I\'m devoured by misery! Misery is eating\nme up completely, so that I care for nothing! Oh, little Mar\xc3\xadna, it\'s\nonly with you I ever lived! Do you remember how we used to while away\nthe nights together at the railway?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. Don\'t you rub the sores, Nik\xc3\xadta! I\'m bound legally now, and you\ntoo. My sin has been forgiven, don\'t disturb ...\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What shall I do with my heart? Where am I to turn to?\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. What\'s there to be done? You\'ve got a wife. Don\'t go looking at\nothers, but keep to your own! You loved An\xc3\xadsya, then go on loving her!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Oh, that An\xc3\xadsya, she\'s gall and wormwood to me, but she\'s round\nmy feet like rank weeds!\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. Whatever she is, still she\'s your wife.... But what\'s the use of\ntalking; you\'d better go to your visitors, and send my husband to me.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Oh dear, if you knew the whole business ... but there\'s no good\ntalking!\n\n    Enter Mar\xc3\xadna\'s husband, red and tipsy, and Nan.\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA\'S HUSBAND. Mar\xc3\xadna! Missis! My old woman! are you here?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. There\'s your husband calling you. Go!\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA. And you?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I? I\'ll lie down here for a bit! [Lies down on the straw].\n\nHUSBAND. Where is she then?\n\nNAN. There she is, near the barn.\n\nHUSBAND. What are you standing there for? Come to the feast! The hosts\nwant you to come and do them honour! The wedding party is just going to\nstart, and then we can go too.\n\nMAR\xc3\x8dNA [going towards her husband] I didn\'t want to go in.\n\nHUSBAND. Come on, I tell you! You\'ll drink a glass to our nephew Peter\'s\nhealth, the rascal! Else the hosts might take offence! There\'s plenty of\ntime for our business. [Mar\xc3\xadna\'s husband puts his arm around her, and\ngoes reeling out with her].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [rises and sits down on the straw] Ah, now that I\'ve seen her,\nlife seems more sickening than ever! It was only with her that I ever\nreally lived! I\'ve ruined my life for nothing! I\'ve done for myself!\n[Lies down] Where can I go? If mother earth would but open and swallow\nme!\n\nNAN [sees Nik\xc3\xadta, and runs towards him] Daddy, I say, daddy! They\'re\nlooking for you! Her godfather and all of them have already blessed her.\nTruly they have, they\'re getting cross!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [aside] Where can I go to?\n\nNAN. What? What are you saying?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I\'m not saying anything! Don\'t bother!\n\nNAN. Daddy! Come, I say! [Nik\xc3\xadta is silent, Nan pulls him by the hand]\nDad, go and bless them! My word, they\'re angry, they\'re grumbling!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [drags away his hand] Leave me alone!\n\nNAN. Now then!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [threatens her with the rope] Go, I say! I\'ll give it you!\n\nNAN. Then I\'ll send mother! [Runs away].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [rises] How can I go? How can I take the holy ic\xc3\xb3n in my hands?\nHow am I to look her in the face! [Lies down again] Oh, if there were a\nhole in the ground, I\'d jump in! No one should see me, and I should see\nno one! [Rises again] No, I shan\'t go ... May they all go to the devil,\nI shan\'t go! [Takes the rope and makes a noose, and tries it on his\nneck] That\'s the way!\n\n    Enter Matry\xc3\xb3na. Nik\xc3\xadta sees his mother, takes the rope off his neck,\n    and again lies down in the straw.\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [comes in hurriedly] Nik\xc3\xadta! Nik\xc3\xadta, I say! He don\'t even\nanswer! Nik\xc3\xadta, what\'s the matter? Have you had a drop too much? Come,\nNik\xc3\xadta dear; come, honey! The people are tired of waiting.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Oh dear, what have you done with me? I\'m a lost man!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. But what is the matter then? Come, my own; come, give them\nyour blessing, as is proper and honourable, and then it\'ll all be over!\nWhy, the people are waiting!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. How can I give blessings?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Why, in the usual way! Don\'t you know?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I know, I know! But who is it I am to bless? What have I done to\nher?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. What have you done? Eh, now he\'s going to remember it! Why,\nwho knows anything about it? Not a soul! And the girl is going of her\nown accord.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Yes, but how?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Because she\'s afraid, of course. But still she\'s going.\nBesides, what\'s to be done now? She should have thought sooner! Now she\ncan\'t refuse. And his kinsfolk can\'t take offence either. They saw the\ngirl twice, and get money with her too! It\'s all safe and sound!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Yes, but what\'s in the cellar?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [laughs] In the cellar? Why, cabbages, mushrooms, potatoes, I\nsuppose! Why remember the past?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I\'d be only too glad to forget it; but I can\'t! When I let my\nmind go, it\'s just as if I heard.... Oh, what have you done with me?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Now, what are you humbugging for?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [turns face downward] Mother! Don\'t torment me! I\'ve got it up to\nthere! [Puts his hand to his throat].\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Still it has to be done! As it is, people are talking. "The\nmaster\'s gone away and won\'t come; he can\'t make up his mind to give his\nblessing." They\'ll be putting two and two together. As soon as they see\nyou\'re frightened they\'ll begin guessing. "The thief none suspect who\nwalks bold and erect!" But you\'ll be getting out of the frying-pan into\nthe fire! Above all, lad, don\'t show it; don\'t lose courage, else\nthey\'ll find out all the more!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Oh dear! You have snared me into a trap!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. That\'ll do, I tell you; come along! Come in and give your\nblessing, as is right and honourable;--and there\'s an end of the matter!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [lies face down] I can\'t!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [aside] What has come over him? He seemed all right, and\nsuddenly this comes over him! It seems he\'s bewitched! Get up, Nik\xc3\xadta!\nSee! There\'s An\xc3\xadsya coming; she\'s left her guests!\n\n    An\xc3\xadsya enters, dressed up, red and tipsy.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Oh, how nice it is, mother! So nice, so respectable! And how the\npeople are pleased.... But where is he?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Here, honey, he\'s here; he\'s laid down on the straw and there\nhe lies! He won\'t come!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [looking at his wife] Just see, she\'s tipsy too! When I look at\nher my heart seems to turn! How can one live with her? [Turns on his\nface] I\'ll kill her some day! It\'ll be worse then!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Only look, how he\'s got all among the straw! Is it the drink?\n[Laughs] I\'d not mind lying down there with you, but I\'ve no time! Come,\nI\'ll lead you! It is so nice in the house! It\'s a treat to look on! A\nconcertina! And the women singing so well! All tipsy! Everything so\nrespectable, so nice!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. What\'s nice?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. The wedding--such a jolly wedding! They all say it\'s quite an\nuncommon fine wedding! All so respectable, so nice! Come along! We\'ll go\ntogether! I have had a drop, but I can give you a hand yet! [Takes his\nhand].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [pulls it back with disgust] Go alone! I\'ll come!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. What are you humbugging for? We\'ve got rid of all the bother,\nwe\'ve got rid of her as came between us; now we have nothing to do but\nto live and be merry! And all so respectable, and quite legal! I\'m so\npleased! I have no words for it! It\'s just as if I were going to marry\nyou over again! And oh, the people, they _are_ pleased! They\'re all\nthanking us! And the guests are all of the best: Iv\xc3\xa1n Mos\xc3\xa9itch is there,\nand the Police Officer; they\'ve also been singing songs of praise!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Then you should have stayed with them! What have you come for?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. True enough, I must go back! Else what does it look like! The\nhosts both go and leave the visitors! And the guests are all of the\nbest!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [gets up and brushes the straw off himself] Go, and I\'ll come at\nonce!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Just see! He listens to the young bird, but wouldn\'t listen to\nthe old one! He would not hear me, but he follows his wife at once!\n[Matry\xc3\xb3na and An\xc3\xadsya turn to go] Well, are you coming?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I\'ll come directly! You go and I\'ll follow! I\'ll come and give\nmy blessing! [The women stop] Go on! I\'ll follow! Now then, go! [Exit\nwomen. Sits down and takes his boots off] Yes, I\'m going! A likely\nthing! No, you\'d better look at the rafter for me! I\'ll fix the noose\nand jump with it from the rafter, then you can look for me! And the rope\nis here just handy. [Ponders] I\'d have got over it, over any sorrow--I\'d\nhave got over that. But this now--here it is, deep in my heart, and I\ncan\'t get over it! [Looks towards the yard] Surely she\'s not coming\nback? [Imitates An\xc3\xadsya] "So nice, so nice. I\'d lie down here with you."\nOh, the baggage! Well then, here I am! Come and cuddle when they\'ve\ntaken me down from the rafter! There\'s only one way! [Takes the rope and\npulls it].\n\n    M\xc3\xadtritch, who is tipsy, sits up and won\'t let go of the rope.\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Shan\'t give it up! Shan\'t give it to no one! I\'ll bring it\nmyself! I said I\'d bring the straw--and so I will! Nik\xc3\xadta, is that you?\n[Laughs] Oh, the devil! Have you come to get the straw?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Give me the rope!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. No, you wait a bit! The peasants sent me! I\'ll bring it ...\n[Rises to his feet and begins getting the straw together, but reels\nfor a time, then falls] It has beaten me. It\'s stronger ...\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Give me the rope!\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Didn\'t I say I won\'t! Oh, Nik\xc3\xadta, you\'re as stupid as a hog!\n[Laughs] I love you, but you\'re a fool! You see that I\'m drunk ... devil\ntake you! You think I need you?... You just look at me; I\'m a Non ...\nfool, can\'t say it--Non-commissioned Officer of Her Majesty\'s very First\nRegiment of Grenadier Guards! I\'ve served Tsar and country, loyal and\ntrue! But who am I? You think I\'m a warrior? No, I\'m not a warrior; I\'m\nthe very least of men, a poor lost orphan! I swore not to drink, and now\nI had a smoke, and ... Well then, do you think I\'m afraid of you? No\nfear; I\'m afraid of no man! I\'ve taken to drink, and I\'ll drink! Now\nI\'ll go it for a fortnight; I\'ll go it hard! I\'ll drink my last shirt;\nI\'ll drink my cap; I\'ll pawn my passport; and I\'m afraid of no one! They\nflogged me in the army to stop me drinking! They switched and switched!\n"Well," they say, "will you leave off?" "No," says I! Why should I be\nafraid of them? Here I am! Such as I am, God made me! I swore off\ndrinking, and didn\'t drink. Now I\'ve took to drink, and I\'ll drink! And\nI fear no man! \'Cos I don\'t lie; but just as ... Why should one mind\nthem--such muck as they are! "Here you are," I say; that\'s me. A priest\ntold me, the devil\'s the biggest bragger! "As soon," says he, "as you\nbegin to brag, you get frightened; and as soon as you fear men, then the\nhoofed one just collars you and pushes you where he likes!" But as I\ndon\'t fear men, I\'m easy! I can spit in the devil\'s beard, and at the\nsow his mother! He can\'t do me no harm! There, put that in your pipe!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [crossing himself] True enough! What was I about? [Throws down\nthe rope].\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [rises] You tell me not to fear men?\n\nM\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Why fear such muck as they are? You look at \'em in the\nbath-house! All made of one paste! One has a bigger belly, another a\nsmaller; that\'s all the difference there is! Fancy being afraid of \'em!\nDeuce take \'em!\n\n  [Illustration: THE POWER OF DARKNESS. ACT V.\n\n  NIK\xc3\x8dTA. True enough! What was I about?\n\n  M\xc3\x8dTRITCH. What?\n\n  NIK\xc3\x8dTA. You tell me not to fear men?\n\n  M\xc3\x8dTRITCH. Why fear such muck as they are? You look at \'em in the\n  bath-house!]\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [from the yard] Well, are you coming?\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Ah! Better so! I\'m coming! [Goes towards yard].\n\n\nSCENE 2.\n\n    Interior of hut, full of people, some sitting round tables and\n    others standing. In the front corner Akoul\xc3\xadna and the Bridegroom. On\n    one of the tables an Ic\xc3\xb3n and a loaf of rye-bread. Among the\n    visitors are Mar\xc3\xadna, her husband, and a Police Officer, also a Hired\n    Driver, the Matchmaker, and the Best Man. The women are singing.\n    An\xc3\xadsya carries round the drink. The singing stops.\n\nTHE DRIVER. If we are to go, let\'s go! The church ain\'t so near.\n\nTHE BEST MAN. All right; you wait a bit till the step-father has given\nhis blessing. But where is he?\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. He is coming--coming at once, dear friends! Have another glass\nall of you; don\'t refuse!\n\nTHE MATCHMAKER. Why is he so long? We\'ve been waiting such a time!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. He\'s coming; coming directly, coming in no time! He\'ll be here\nbefore one could plait a girl\'s hair who\'s had her hair cropped! Drink,\nfriends! [Offers the drink] Coming at once! Sing again, my pets,\nmeanwhile!\n\nTHE DRIVER. They\'ve sung all their songs, waiting here!\n\n    The women sing. Nik\xc3\xadta and Ak\xc3\xadm enter during the singing.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [holds his father\'s arm and pushes him in before him] Go, father;\nI can\'t do without you!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. I don\'t like--I mean what d\'ye call it ...\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [to the women] Enough! Be quiet! [Looks round the hut] Mar\xc3\xadna,\nare you there?\n\nTHE MATCHMAKER. Go, take the ic\xc3\xb3n, and give them your blessing!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Wait a while! [Looks round] Akoul\xc3\xadna, are you there?\n\nMATCHMAKER. What are you calling everybody for? Where should she be? How\nqueer he seems!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Gracious goodness! Why, he\'s barefoot!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Father, you are here! Look at me! Christian Commune, you are all\nhere, and I am here! I am ... [Falls on his knees].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Nik\xc3\xadta darling, what\'s the matter with you? Oh my head, my head!\n\nMATCHMAKER. Here\'s a go!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. I did say he was taking too much of that French wine! Come to\nyour senses; what are you about?\n\n    They try to lift him; he takes no heed of them, but looks in front\n    of him.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Christian Commune! I have sinned, and I wish to confess!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA [shakes him by the shoulder] Are you mad? Dear friends, he\'s\ngone crazy! He must be taken away!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [shakes her off] Leave me alone! And you, father, hear me! And\nfirst, Mar\xc3\xadna, look here! [Bows to the ground to her and rises] I have\nsinned towards you! I promised to marry you, I tempted you, and forsook\nyou! Forgive me, in Christ\'s name! [Again bows to the ground before\nher].\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. And what are you drivelling about? It\'s not becoming! No one\nwants to know! Get up! It\'s like your impudence!\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. Oh, oh, he\'s bewitched! And however did it happen? It\'s a\nspell! Get up! what nonsense are you jabbering? [Pulls him].\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [shakes his head] Don\'t touch me! Forgive me my sin towards you,\nMar\xc3\xadna! Forgive me, for Christ\'s sake!\n\n    Mar\xc3\xadna covers her face with her hands in silence.\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA. Get up, I tell you! Don\'t be so impudent! What are you thinking\nabout--to recall it? Enough humbug! It\'s shameful! Oh my poor head! He\'s\nquite crazy!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [pushes his wife away and turns to Akoul\xc3\xadna] Akoul\xc3\xadna, now I\'ll\nspeak to you! Listen, Christian Commune! I\'m a fiend, Akoul\xc3\xadna! I have\nsinned against you! Your father died no natural death! He was poisoned!\n\nAN\xc3\x8dSYA [screams] Oh my head! What\'s he about?\n\nMATRY\xc3\x93NA. The man\'s beside himself! Lead him away!\n\n    The folk come up and try to seize him.\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [motions them back with his arms] Wait! You lads, what d\'ye call\nit, wait, I mean!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Akoul\xc3\xadna, I poisoned him! Forgive me, in Christ\'s name!\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [jumps up] He\'s telling lies! I know who did it!\n\nMATCHMAKER. What are you about? You sit still!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Oh Lord, what sins, what sins!\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. Seize him, and send for the Elder! We must draw up an\nindictment and have witnesses to it! Get up and come here!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [to Police Officer] Now you--with the bright buttons--I mean, you\nwait! Let him, what d\'ye call it, speak out, I mean!\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. Mind, old man, and don\'t interfere! I have to draw up an\nindictment!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Eh, what a fellow you are; wait, I say! Don\'t talk, I mean, about,\nwhat d\'ye call it, \'ditements! Here God\'s work is being done.... A man\nis confessing, I mean! And you, what d\'ye call it ... \'ditements!\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. The Elder!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM. Let God\'s work be done, I mean, and then you, I mean, you do your\nbusiness!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. And, Akoul\xc3\xadna, my sin is great towards you; I seduced you;\nforgive me in Christ\'s name! [Bows to the ground before her].\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [leaves the table] Let me go! I shan\'t be married! He told me\nto, but I shan\'t now!\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. Repeat what you have said.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Wait, sir, let me finish!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [with rapture] Speak, my son! Tell everything--you\'ll feel better!\nConfess to God, don\'t fear men! God--God! It is He!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I poisoned the father, dog that I am, and I ruined the daughter!\nShe was in my power, and I ruined her, and her baby!\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. True, that\'s true!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. I smothered the baby in the cellar with a board! I sat on it and\nsmothered it--and its bones crunched! [Weeps] And I buried it! I did it,\nall alone!\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA. He raves! I told him to!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Don\'t shield me! I fear no one now! Forgive me, Christian\nCommune! [Bows to the ground].\n\n    Silence.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. Bind him! The marriage is evidently off!\n\n    Men come up with their belts.\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA. Wait, there\'s plenty of time! [Bows to the ground before his\nfather] Father, dear father, forgive me too,--fiend that I am! You told\nme from the first, when I took to bad ways, you said then, "If a claw is\ncaught, the bird is lost!" I would not listen to your words, dog that I\nwas, and it has turned out as you said! Forgive me, for Christ\'s sake!\n\nAK\xc3\x8dM [rapturously] God will forgive you, my own son! [Embraces him] You\nhave had no mercy on yourself, He will show mercy on you! God--God! It\nis He!\n\n    Enter Elder.\n\nELDER. There are witnesses enough here.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER. We will have the examination at once.\n\n    Nik\xc3\xadta is bound.\n\nAKOUL\xc3\x8dNA [goes and stands by his side] I shall tell the truth! Ask me!\n\nNIK\xc3\x8dTA [bound] No need to ask!
