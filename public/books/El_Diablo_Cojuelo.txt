Looks up] It\'s noon. Time to unharness. Gee up, get\nalong! Fagged out? Poor old beast! One more turn and back again, that\nwill be the last furrow, and then dinner. It was a good idea to bring\nthat chunk of bread with me. I\'ll not go home, but sit down by the well\nand have a bite and a rest, and Peggy can graze awhile. Then, with God\'s\nhelp, to work again, and the ploughing will be done in good time.\n\n    Enter Imp; hides behind a bush.\n\nIMP. See what a good fellow he is! Keeps calling on God. Wait a bit,\nfriend,--you\'ll be calling on the Devil before long! I\'ll just take away\nhis chunk. He\'ll miss it before long, and will begin to hunt for it.\nHe\'ll be hungry, and then he\'ll swear and call on the Devil.\n\n    Takes the chunk of bread and sits down behind the bush watching to\n    see what the Peasant will do.\n\nPEASANT [unharnesses the horse] With God\'s blessing! [Lets the horse\nloose, and goes towards the place where his coat is lying] I\'m awfully\nhungry. The wife cut a big chunk, but see if I don\'t eat it all. [Coming\nup to the coat] Gone! I must have put it under the coat. [Lifting the\ncoat] No, it\'s not here either! What has happened? [Shakes the coat].\n\nIMP [behind the bush] Go on, go on, search away! I\'ve got it safe!\n\nPEASANT [moves the plough and shakes his coat again] This is strange!\nVery strange! No one was here, yet the chunk is gone! If the birds had\nbeen at it there would be some crumbs left, but there\'s not a single\ncrumb! No one has been here, and yet some one has taken it!\n\nIMP [rises and looks out] Now he\'ll call on the Devil.\n\nPEASANT. Well, it seems there\'s no help for it! Never mind, I shan\'t\nstarve to death. If some one has taken it, he\'s taken it; let him eat\nit, and may it do him good.\n\nIMP [spits] Oh, the damned peasant! Instead of swearing properly, he\nonly says, "May it do him good." What can one do with such a fellow?\n\n    Peasant lies down to rest, makes the sign of the cross, yawns, and\n    falls asleep.\n\nIMP [comes out from behind the bush] It\'s all very well for the boss to\ntalk. The boss keeps on saying, "You don\'t bring enough peasants to\nHell! See what a lot of tradesmen, gentlefolk, and all sorts of people\nflock in every day, and how few peasants!" Now, how\'s one to get round\nthis one? There\'s no way of getting hold of him. Haven\'t I stolen his\nlast crust? What can I do better than that? And yet he didn\'t swear. I\'m\nat my wits\' end what to do! Well, I must go and report!\n\n    Disappears into the ground.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n    Hell. The Chief of the Devils sits in the highest place. The Devil\'s\n    Secretary sits lower down, at a table with writing materials.\n    Sentinels stand at each side. To the right are five Imps of\n    different kinds. To the left, by the door, the Doorkeeper. A\n    dandified Imp stands before the Chief.\n\n\nTHE DANDY IMP. The whole of my booty for the three years has been\n220,005 men. They\'re all in my power now.\n\nTHE CHIEF. All right. Thank you. Pass on.\n\n    The Dandy Imp goes to the right.\n\nTHE CHIEF [to the Secretary] I\'m tired! Is there much business left?\nWhose reports have we had, and whose are still to come?\n\nTHE SECRETARY [counts on his fingers and, as he counts, points to the\nImps to the right. When he mentions any Imp, the one referred to bows]\nWe\'ve had the Gentlefolks\' Devil\'s report. He\'s captured 1836 in all.\nAnd the Tradesmen\'s Devil\'s with 9643. From the Lawyers\', 3423. The\nWomen\'s we\'ve also just had: 186,315 married women, and 17,438 maids.\nOnly two Devils are left, the Officials\' and the Peasants\'. There are\naltogether 220,005 souls on the list.\n\nCHIEF. Well then, we\'d better finish it all to-day. [To the Doorkeeper]\nLet them in!\n\n    The Officials\' Devil enters, and bows to the Chief.\n\nCHIEF. Well, how have you got on?\n\nOFFICIALS\' IMP [laughing, and rubbing his hands] My affairs are all\nright, just as soot they are white! The booty is such that I don\'t\nremember anything like it since the creation of the world.\n\nCHIEF. What, have you captured a great many?\n\nOFFICIALS\' IMP. It\'s not so much the quantity. Only 1350 men in all, but\nsuch splendid fellows! Such fellows, they might shame any Devil! They\ncan embroil people better than we ourselves can. I\'ve introduced a new\nfashion among them.\n\nCHIEF. What\'s that new fashion?\n\nOFFICIALS\' IMP. Why, in former times lawyers were in attendance on the\njudges and deceived people. Now, I\'ve arranged for them to do business\nalso apart from the judges. Whoever pays most, is the one to whose\nbusiness they attend. And they\'ll take such trouble over it that they\'ll\nmake out a case where there is none! They and the officials between them\nembroil people far better than we Devils can.\n\nCHIEF. All right. I\'ll have a look at them. You may pass on.\n\n    The Officials\' Imp goes to the right.\n\nCHIEF [to Doorkeeper] Let in the last one.\n\n    Enter the Peasants\' Imp with the chunk of bread. He bows to the\n    ground.\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. I can\'t live like this any longer! Give me another\nappointment!\n\nCHIEF. What appointment? What are you jabbering about? Get up and talk\nsense. Give in your report! How many peasants have you captured this\nweek?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP [crying] Not one!\n\nCHIEF. What? Not one! What do you mean? What have you been doing? Where\nhave you been loafing?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP [whimpering] I\'ve not been loafing; I\'ve been straining\nevery nerve all the time, but I can\'t do anything! There now, I went and\ntook his last crust from under the very nose of one of them, and,\ninstead of swearing, he wished it might do me good!\n\nCHIEF. What?... What?... What are you mumbling there? Just blow your\nnose, and then speak sensibly! One can\'t make head or tail of what\nyou\'re saying.\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. Why, there was a peasant ploughing; and I knew he had\nbrought only a chunk of bread with him, and had nothing else to eat. I\nstole his crust. By rights he should have sworn; but what does he do? He\nsays, "Let him who has taken it eat it, and may it do him good!" I\'ve\nbrought the chunk of bread away with me. Here it is!\n\nCHIEF. Well, and what of the others?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. They\'re all alike. I could not manage to take a single\none.\n\nCHIEF. How dare you appear before me with empty hands? And as if that\nwere not enough, you must needs bring some stinking crust or other here!\nDo you mean to mock me? Do you mean to live in Hell and eat the bread of\nidleness? The others do their best, and work hard! Why, they [points to\nthe Imps] have each supplied 10,000 or 20,000, or even 200,000. And you\ncome with empty hands, and bring a miserable crust, and begin spinning\nyour yarns. You chatter, but don\'t work; and that\'s why you\'ve lost hold\nof them. But wait a bit, my friend, I\'ll teach you a thing or two!\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. Before you punish me, listen to what I\'ll tell you. It\'s\nall very well for those other Devils, who have to do with gentlefolk,\nwith merchants, or with women. It\'s all plain sailing for them! Show a\nnobleman a coronet, or a fine estate, and you\'ve got him, and may lead\nhim where you like. It\'s the same with a tradesman. Show him some money\nand stir up his covetousness, and you may lead him as with a halter. And\nwith the women it\'s also plain sailing. Give them finery and sweets--and\nyou may do what you like with them. But as to the peasants--there\'s a\nlong row to hoe with them! When he\'s at work from morn till\nnight--sometimes even far into the night--and never starts without a\nthought of God, how\'s one to get at him? Master, remove me from these\npeasants! I\'m tired to death of them, and have angered you into the\nbargain!\n\nCHIEF. You\'re humbugging, you idler! It\'s no use your talking about the\nothers. They\'ve got hold of the merchants, the nobles, and the women,\nbecause they knew how to treat them, and invented new traps for them!\nThe official one there--he has made quite a new departure. You must\nthink of something too! You\'ve stolen a crust, and brag about it! What a\nclever thing to do! Surround them with snares, and they\'ll get caught in\none or other of them. But loafing about as you do, and leaving the way\nopen for them, those peasants of yours have gained strength. They begin\nnot to care about their last crust. If they take to such ways, and teach\ntheir women the same, they\'ll get quite beyond us! Invent something! Get\nout of the hole as best you can.\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. I can\'t think how to set about it. Let me off! I can\nstand it no longer!\n\nCHIEF [angrily] Can\'t stand it! What do you think, then? Am I to do your\nwork for you?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. I can\'t!\n\nCHIEF. Can\'t? Wait a bit! Hollo, there! bring the switches; give him a\nthrashing.\n\n    The Sentinels seize the Imp and whip him.\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. Oh! Oh! Oh!...\n\nCHIEF. Have you thought of something?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. Oh, oh, I can\'t!\n\nCHIEF. Give him some more. [They whip] Well--thought of something?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. Yes--yes, I have!\n\nCHIEF. Well, tell us what it is.\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. I\'ve invented a dodge that will bring them all into my\ngrasp, if you\'ll only let me take a labourer\'s place with that peasant.\nBut I can\'t explain what it is beforehand.\n\nCHIEF. All right. Only remember, that if you don\'t atone for that crust\nwithin three years, I\'ll flay you alive!\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. They\'ll all be mine in three years\' time.\n\nCHIEF. All right. When the three years are past, I shall come and see\nfor myself!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n    A barn. Carts loaded with grain. The Imp as a Labourer. He is\n    shovelling grain off the cart, and the Peasant is carrying it away\n    in a measure.\n\n\nLABOURER. Seven!\n\nPEASANT. How many quarters?\n\nLABOURER [looks at the numbers marked on the barn door] Twenty-six\nquarters. And this is the seventh bushel of the twenty-seventh quarter.\n\nPEASANT. It won\'t all go in; the barn is nearly full!\n\nLABOURER. Shovel it nice and even.\n\nPEASANT. So I will.\n\n    Exit with measure.\n\nLABOURER [alone, takes off his cap, his horns appear] It will be some\ntime before he returns. I\'ll ease my horns a bit. [Horns rise] And I\'ll\ntake my boots off too; I can\'t do it when he\'s here. [Takes his boots\noff, his hoofs appear. Sits on the threshold] It\'s the third year now.\nIt\'s near the time of reckoning. There\'s more corn than there\'s room\nfor. Only one more thing left to teach him, and then let the Chief come\nand see for himself. I\'ll have something worth showing him! He\'ll\nforgive me for that crust!\n\n    Neighbour approaches. Labourer hides his horns and hoofs.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Good day to you.\n\nLABOURER. The same to you.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Where\'s your master?\n\nLABOURER. He\'s gone to spread the grain more even; it won\'t all go in.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Dear me, what a run of luck your master is having! More than\nhe has room for? We\'re all amazed at the harvests your master has had\nthese two years. It\'s as if some one had told him what was coming. Last\nyear was a dry season, and he had sown in the bog. Others had no\nharvest, but your threshing ground was covered with sheaves! This year\nwe\'ve a rainy summer, and he\'s been sharp enough to sow on the hill.\nEverybody\'s corn has rotted, but you have a splendid harvest. What\ngrain! Ah, what grain!\n\n    Takes some grain, weighs it in his hand, and chews it.\n\nPEASANT [enters with empty measure] How d\'ye do, neighbour?\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Good day. I was saying to your man here, how well you managed\nto guess where to sow your corn. Every one envies you. What heaps, what\nheaps of corn you have got! You\'ll not eat it all in ten years.\n\nPEASANT. It\'s all thanks to Nicholas here. [Points to Labourer] It was\nhis luck. Last year I sent him to plough, and what did he do but plough\nin the bog. I gave him a scolding, but he persuaded me to sow there. And\nso I did, and it turned out all for the best! And this year he again\nguessed right, and sowed on the hill!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. It\'s as if he knew what kind of season it would be. Yes, you\nhave got corn enough and no mistake! [Silence] And I have come to ask\nyou to lend me a sack of rye. Ours is all used up. I\'ll return it next\nyear.\n\nPEASANT. All right, you may have it.\n\nLABOURER [nudging the Peasant] Don\'t give it!\n\nPEASANT. No more words about it. Take it.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Thank you. I\'ll just run and fetch a sack.\n\nLABOURER [aside] He keeps to his old ways ... still goes on giving. He\ndoesn\'t always obey me. But just wait a bit. He\'ll soon stop giving\naway.\n\n    Exit Neighbour.\n\nPEASANT [sitting down on the threshold] Why should one not give to a\ngood man?\n\nLABOURER. Giving is one thing, getting back another! You know--\n\n        "It\'s a good world to lend in, a good world to spend in,\n         But to get back one\'s own, it\'s the worst world that\'s known."\n\nThat\'s what the old folk say.\n\nPEASANT. Don\'t worry. We\'ve plenty of corn.\n\nLABOURER. Well, what of that?\n\nPEASANT. We\'ve enough, not only till next harvest but for two years\nahead. What are we to do with it all?\n\nLABOURER. What are we to do with it? I could make such stuff of this\ncorn as would make you rejoice all the days of your life.\n\nPEASANT. Why, what would you make of it?\n\nLABOURER. A kind of drink. Drink, that would give you strength when you\nare weak, satisfy you when you are hungry, give you sleep when you are\nrestless, make you merry when you\'re sad, give you courage when you\'re\nafraid. That\'s the drink I\'d make!\n\nPEASANT. Rubbish!\n\nLABOURER. Rubbish indeed! It was just the same when I told you to sow in\nthe bog, and then on the hill. You did not believe me then, but now you\nknow! You\'ll find out about the drink the same way.\n\nPEASANT. But what will you make it of?\n\nLABOURER. Why, of this same corn.\n\nPEASANT. But won\'t that be a sin?\n\nLABOURER. Just hear him! Why should it be a sin? Everything is given for\na joy to man.\n\nPEASANT. And where did you get all your wisdom from, Nick? You seem a\nvery ordinary man to look at, and hard-working too. Why, I don\'t\nremember you so much as ever taking your boots off all these two years\nyou\'ve been with me. And yet you seem to know everything. Where did you\nlearn it?\n\nLABOURER. I\'ve been about a good deal!\n\nPEASANT. And so you say this drink will give one strength?\n\nLABOURER. Just wait till you try it and see the good that comes of it.\n\nPEASANT. And how are we to make it?\n\nLABOURER. It\'s not hard to make when you know how! Only we shall want a\ncopper and a couple of iron vessels.\n\nPEASANT. And does it taste nice?\n\nLABOURER. As sweet as honey. When once you\'ve tasted it you\'ll never\ngive it up.\n\nPEASANT. Is that so? Well, I\'ll go to the neighbour\'s; he used to have a\ncopper. We\'ll have a try!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n    A barn. In the middle a closed copper on the fire, with another\n    vessel, under which is a tap.\n\n\nLABOURER [holds a tumbler under the tap and drinks the spirit] Well,\nmaster, it\'s ready now.\n\nPEASANT [sitting on his heels and looking on] What a queer thing. Here\'s\nwater coming out of the mixture. Why are you letting this water off\nfirst?\n\nLABOURER. It\'s not water. It is the very stuff itself!\n\nPEASANT. Why is it so clear? I thought it would be yellow like grain.\nThis is just like water.\n\nLABOURER. But you just smell it!\n\nPEASANT. Ah, what a scent! Well, well, let\'s see what it\'s like in the\nmouth. Let me taste! [Tries to take the tumbler out of the Labourer\'s\nhand].\n\nLABOURER. Mind, you\'ll spill it! [Turns the tap off, drinks and smacks\nhis lips] It\'s ready! Here you are. Drink it!\n\nPEASANT [drinks, first sipping, then taking more and more, till he\nempties the glass and gives it back] Now then, some more. One can\'t tell\nthe taste from such a drop.\n\nLABOURER [laughing] Well, you seem to like it! [Draws some more].\n\nPEASANT [drinks] Eh, that\'s the sort! Let\'s call the missis. Hey,\nMartha! Come along! It\'s ready! Come on there!\n\n    Enter Wife and little girl.\n\nWIFE. What\'s the matter? Why are you kicking up such a row?\n\nPEASANT. You just taste what we\'ve been distilling. [Hands her the\nglass] Smell! What does it smell of?\n\nWIFE [smells] Dear me!\n\nPEASANT. Drink!\n\nWIFE. But perhaps it may do one some harm?\n\nPEASANT. Drink, fool!\n\nWIFE. True. It is nice!\n\nPEASANT [a little tipsy] Nice indeed! You wait and see what\'ll happen.\nNick says it drives all weariness out of one\'s bones. The young grow\nold. I mean, the old grow young. There now, I\'ve only had two glasses of\nit, and all my bones have got easy. [Swaggers] You see? Wait a bit, when\nyou and I drink it every day we\'ll grow young again! Come, Martha!\n[Embraces her].\n\nWIFE. Get along. Why, it\'s made you quite silly.\n\nPEASANT. There, you see! You said Nick and I were wasting the corn, but\njust see what stuff we\'ve concocted. Eh? It\'s good, ain\'t it?\n\nWIFE. Of course, it\'s good if it makes the old young again. Just see how\njolly it has made you! And I feel jolly too! Now then, join in! Ah ...\nAh ... Ah ... [Sings].\n\nPEASANT. Yes, that\'s the way! We\'ll all be young, all young.\n\nWIFE. We must call mother-in-law, for she\'s always sad and grumbling.\nShe needs renewing. When she\'s younger she\'ll get kinder.\n\nPEASANT [tipsy] Yes, call mother. Call her here, and grandfather too. I\nsay, Mary, run and call your granny and great-grandfather. Tell him he\nmust get down from the oven! We\'ll make him young again. Now then,\nquick! One, two, three, and away! Off like a shot! [Girl runs off. To\nWife] We\'ll have another glass.\n\n    Labourer fills and hands the glasses.\n\nPEASANT [drinks] At first we got young at the top, in the tongue; then\nit went down into the arms. Now it has reached the feet. I feel my feet\ngetting younger. They\'re moving of themselves. [Starts dancing].\n\nWIFE [drinks] You\'re a real clever \'un, Nick! Now then, strike up!\n\n    Labourer takes a balal\xc3\xa1yka[1] and plays. Peasant and Wife dance.\n\n  [1] The balal\xc3\xa1yka is an instrument (generally three-stringed) used by\n  Russian peasants, and answering to the negroes\' banjo.\n\nLABOURER [plays in the foreground of the scene, laughing and winking as\nhe watches them. Then he leaves off playing, but they still continue to\ndance] You\'ll pay for that crust! You\'ve done it now, my fine fellows.\nThey\'ll never get out of it. The Chief can come when he likes now!\n\n    Enter a fresh-looking elderly woman, and a very old white-haired\n    man, the Peasant\'s Grandfather.\n\nGRANDFATHER. What\'s the matter? Have you gone mad? Dancing while every\none else is at work!\n\nWIFE [dances and claps her hands] Oh--Oh--Oh-- [Sings]\n\n        "That I\'m sinning I will own,\n         Free from sin is God alone!"\n\nOLD WOMAN. Oh, you wretch! The oven\'s not cleaned out yet, and here you\nare dancing!\n\nPEASANT. Wait a bit, mother. See what has been happening here. We can\nmake old people young again! Here you are! Just drink this! [Passes\ntumbler].\n\nOLD WOMAN. There\'s plenty of water in the well. [Smells it] But what\nhave you put in? My--what a smell!\n\nPEASANT. You just drink it.\n\nOLD WOMAN [tastes] Dear me! But won\'t one die of it?\n\nWIFE. It will make you more alive. You\'ll grow young again!\n\nOLD WOMAN. Nonsense! [Drinks] But it\'s nice! Better than our drinks.\nHere, father, have some too.\n\n    Grandfather sits down and shakes his head.\n\nLABOURER. Never mind him. But granny must have another glass. [Hands\nsome to the old woman].\n\nOLD WOMAN. If only no harm comes of it. Oh dear, it does burn! But it is\nnice.\n\nWIFE. Drink it! Then you\'ll feel it running through your veins.\n\nOLD WOMAN. Well, I suppose I\'ll have to try. [Drinks].\n\nWIFE. Has it reached your feet yet?\n\nOLD WOMAN. True enough, it does run through you. I feel it here now! And\nit really makes one feel quite light. Come--give me some more. [Drinks\nagain] Fine! Now I\'m quite young again.\n\nPEASANT. Didn\'t I tell you?\n\nOLD WOMAN. Ah, it\'s a pity my old man is no longer here. He might have\nseen once more what I was like in my young days.\n\n    Labourer plays. Peasant and Wife dance.\n\nOLD WOMAN [comes into the middle] Do you call that dancing? Let me show\nyou. [Dances] That\'s the way! Then like this, and like that! Do you see?\n\n    Grandfather goes up to the vessel and lets the spirit run out on to\n    the ground.\n\nPEASANT [notices and rushes at his Grandfather] What are you up to, you\nold fool? Spilling such fine stuff! Oh, you old dotard! [Pushes him away\nand holds tumbler under tap] You\'ve emptied it all!\n\nGRANDFATHER. It\'s evil and not good! God has sent you a good harvest for\nyou to feed yourself and others, but you have turned the corn into\ndevils\' drink. No good will come of it. Give up this business. Else\nyou\'ll perish and ruin others! You think this is drink? It\'s fire, and\nwill burn you up! [Takes a brand from the fire and lights the spilt\nspirit. The spirit burns. They all look on with horror].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT V\n\n    Interior of hut. The Labourer alone, his horns and hoofs showing.\n\n\nLABOURER. There\'s lots of corn. More than there\'s room for, and he\'s now\ngot a taste for it. We\'ve been distilling again, and we\'ve filled a\nbarrel and hidden it away. We\'re not going to treat any one for nothing,\nbut when we want to get something out of a fellow, then we\'ll treat him!\nSo to-day I told him to invite the village elders and treat them, that\nthey should divide up the property between him and his grandfather, and\ngive everything to him and nothing to the old man! My three years are up\nto-day, and my work is finished. Let the Chief come and see for himself.\nI needn\'t be ashamed of his seeing it!\n\n    Chief appears out of the ground.\n\nCHIEF. Time\'s up! Have you redeemed your bread-blunder? I told you I\'d\ncome and see for myself. Have you managed the Peasant?\n\nLABOURER. Done him completely! Judge for yourself. Some of them will\nmeet here soon. Get into the oven, and see what they\'ll do. You\'ll be\nwell satisfied!\n\nCHIEF [climbs into the oven] We\'ll see!\n\n    Enter the Peasant and four old men. The Wife follows. The men sit\n    down round the table. The Wife lays the cloth, sets ox-foot brawn\n    and pies on the table. The old men exchange greetings with Labourer.\n\nFIRST ELDER. Well, have you made more of the drink?\n\nLABOURER. Yes, we\'ve distilled as much as we need. Why let valuable\nstuff be wasted?\n\nSECOND ELDER. And is it a success?\n\nLABOURER. Better than the first lot.\n\nSECOND ELDER. But where did you learn to make it?\n\nLABOURER. Going about in the world one learns many things!\n\nTHIRD ELDER. Yes, yes, you\'re a knowing fellow.\n\n    Wife brings spirits and glasses.\n\nPEASANT. Have a drop!\n\n    Wife takes a decanter and fills glasses.\n\nWIFE. Do us the honour!\n\nFIRST ELDER [drinks] Your health! Ah, that\'s good. It runs right through\nall one\'s joints. That\'s what I call proper drink!\n\n    The other three Elders do the same. Chief gets out of the oven.\n    Labourer goes and stands by him.\n\nLABOURER [to Chief] See what will happen now! I\'ll trip up the woman\nwith my foot and she\'ll spill the liquor. Formerly he did not grudge his\nlast crust, but now see what he\'ll do about a glass of spirits!\n\nPEASANT. Now then, wife, fill again and hand it round in due\norder--first to our friend here, then to Daddy Michael.\n\n    Wife fills a glass and goes round the table. The Labourer trips her\n    up; she stumbles and upsets the glass.\n\nWIFE. Gracious goodness, I\'ve spilt it! Why do you get in my way,\nconfound you?\n\nPEASANT [to Wife] There now, what a clumsy beast! Her fingers are all\nthumbs, and she goes swearing at others! See what fine stuff she goes\nspilling on the ground!\n\nWIFE. I didn\'t do it on purpose.\n\nPEASANT. On purpose indeed! Wait till I get up; I\'ll teach you how to\npour spirits on the ground. [To Labourer] And you too, you confounded\nfool, what are you prancing round the table for? Go to the Devil!\n\n    Wife again fills and hands the glasses round.\n\nLABOURER [goes back to the oven to the Chief] You see? Formerly he did\nnot grudge his last crust, and now for a glass of spirits he nearly beat\nhis wife and sent me to you--to the Devil!\n\nCHIEF. It\'s good, very good! I\'m satisfied.\n\nLABOURER. You wait a bit. Let them empty the bottle--and you\'ll see what\nwill happen. Even now they are giving each other smooth oily words;\npresently they\'ll start flattering each other,--as cunning as foxes.\n\nPEASANT. Well, old friends, what\'s your opinion of my business? My\ngrandfather has been living with me, and I have been feeding him and\nfeeding him, and now he\'s gone to live with my uncle, and wants to take\nhis share of the property and give it to uncle! Consider it well; you\nare wise men. We could as well do without our own heads as without you.\nThere\'s no one in the whole village to come near you. Take you for\nexample, Iv\xc3\xa1n Fed\xc3\xb3titch--doesn\'t every one say you\'re first among men?\nAnd as for me, I\'ll tell you the truth, Iv\xc3\xa1n Fed\xc3\xb3titch, I\'m fonder of\nyou than of my own father or mother. As for Michael Step\xc3\xa1nitch, he\'s an\nold friend.\n\nFIRST ELDER [to Peasant] It\'s good to talk with a good man. It\'s the way\nto get wisdom. It\'s just the same with you. One can\'t find any one to\ncompare with you either.\n\nSECOND ELDER. Wise and affectionate--that\'s what I like you for.\n\nTHIRD ELDER. You have my best sympathy. I can\'t find words to express\nit. I was saying to my old woman only to-day ...\n\nFOURTH ELDER. A friend, a real friend!\n\nLABOURER [nudges the Chief] Do you hear? All lies! They abuse one\nanother behind their backs, but see how thick they are laying it on\nnow,--like foxes wagging their tails! And it all comes from that drink.\n\nCHIEF. That drink is good, very good! If they take to lying like that,\nthey\'ll all be ours. Very good; I\'m satisfied!\n\nLABOURER. Wait a bit. When they\'ve finished a second bottle it will be\nbetter still!\n\nWIFE [serves] Do have another glass.\n\nFIRST ELDER. Won\'t it be too much? Your health! [Drinks] It\'s pleasant\nto drink in the company of a good man.\n\nSECOND ELDER. How can one help drinking? Health to the host and hostess!\n\nTHIRD ELDER. Friends, your health!\n\nFOURTH ELDER. This is a brew of the right sort! Let\'s be merry! We\'ll\narrange things for you. \'Cos it all depends on me!\n\nFIRST ELDER. On you? No, not on you, but on what your seniors say.\n\nFOURTH ELDER. My seniors are greater fools. Go where you came from!\n\nSECOND ELDER. What are you up to now? You fool!\n\nTHIRD ELDER. It\'s true what he\'s saying! \'Cos why? The host is not\nentertaining us for nothing. He means business. The business can be\narranged. Only you must stand treat! Show us due respect. \'Cos it\'s you\nas wants me, and not I you! You\'re own brother to the pig!\n\nPEASANT. And you\'re itself! What are you yelling for? Think to surprise\nme? You are all good at stuffing yourselves!\n\nFIRST ELDER. What are you giving yourself airs for? See if I don\'t twist\nyour nose to one side!\n\nPEASANT. We\'ll see whose nose will get twisted!\n\nSECOND ELDER. Think yourself such a marvel? Go to the Devil! I won\'t\nspeak to you--I\'ll go away!\n\nPEASANT [holds him] What, will you break up the company?\n\nSECOND ELDER. Let me go, or I\'ll call for help!\n\nPEASANT. I won\'t! What right have you to\xc2\xa0...?\n\nSECOND ELDER. This right! [Beats him].\n\nPEASANT [to the other Elders] Help me!\n\n    They fall on one another, and all speak at once.\n\nFIRST ELDER. That\'s why. \'Cos it means we\'re all having a spree-ee!\n\nSECOND ELDER. I can arrange everything!\n\nTHIRD ELDER. Let\'s have some more!\n\nPEASANT [to Wife] Bring another bottle!\n\n    All sit round the table again and drink.\n\nLABOURER [to Chief] Have you noticed? The wolf\'s blood in them was\naroused, and they\'ve turned as fierce as wolves.\n\nCHIEF. The drink is good! I\'m satisfied!\n\nLABOURER. Wait a bit. Let them empty a third bottle. Things will be\nbetter still!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT VI\n\n    The scene represents a village street. To the right some old women\n    are sitting on logs of wood with the Grandfather. In the centre, is\n    a ring of women, girls, and lads. Dance music is played and they\n    dance. Noise is heard from the hut, and drunken screams. An old man\n    comes out and shouts in a tipsy voice. The Peasant follows him and\n    leads him back.\n\n\nGRANDFATHER. Ah, what doings! what doings! One would think, what more\nwould any one want than to do his work on week days, and when Sunday\ncomes round, to have a good wash, clean the harness, and rest a bit and\nsit with his family; or go outside and have a talk with the old folk\nabout matters concerning the Commune. Or, if you\'re young, have a game.\nThere they are playing,--and it\'s pleasant to look at them. It\'s all\npleasant and good. [Screams inside the hut] But this sort of thing, what\nis it? It only leads men astray, and pleases the Devils. And it all\ncomes of fat living!\n\n    Tipsy men come tumbling out of the hut, shout, and catch hold of the\n    girls.\n\nGIRLS. Leave off, Daddy Tom! What do you mean by it?\n\nLADS. Let\'s go into the lane. It\'s impossible to play here.\n\n    Exeunt all who were playing in the ring.\n\nPEASANT [goes up to Grandfather] What have you got now? The Elders will\nallot everything to me! [Snaps his fingers at him] That\'s what you\'ll\nget! So there you are! It\'s all mine and you\'ve nothing! They\'ll tell\nyou so themselves!\n\n    The four Elders speak all at once.\n\nFIRST ELDER. \'Cos I know what\'s what!\n\nSECOND ELDER.\n\n        "\'Fore all I\'ll be heard,\n         \'Cos I\'m an old bird!"\n\nTHIRD ELDER. Friend! dear friend, dearest friend!\n\nFOURTH ELDER.\n\n        "Jog along hut, jog along bed,\n         The missis has nowhere to lay down her head!"\n\nNow then, come along!\n\n    The Elders take each other\'s arms in couples and go off reeling, one\n    couple following the other. The Peasant turns back to the hut, but\n    stumbles before he reaches it,--falls down, and lies muttering\n    incomprehensible words that sound like grunts. The Grandfather and\n    those he was with, rise and exeunt.\n\n    Enter Labourer and Chief of Devils.\n\nLABOURER. Did you see? Now the swine\'s blood has been roused in them,\nand from wolves they have turned into swine! [Points to Peasant] There\nhe lies in the dirt and grunts like a hog!\n\nCHIEF. You have succeeded! First like foxes, then like wolves, and now\nlike swine! Well, that is a drink! But tell me, how did you make it? I\nsuppose it\'s made of a mixture of foxes\', wolves\', and swine\'s blood?\n\nLABOURER. Oh no! I only supplied him with too much corn! As long as he\nhad only as much corn as he needed, he did not grudge his last crust,\nbut when he had more than he knew what to do with, the fox\'s, the\nwolf\'s, and the swine\'s blood in him awoke. He always had beast\'s blood\nin him, only it could not get the upper hand.\n\nCHIEF. Well, you\'re a fine fellow! You\'ve atoned for your crust-blunder.\nNow they only need to drink spirits, and they\'re altogether ours!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n                     END OF "THE FIRST DISTILLER."\n\n\n\n\n[ Transcriber\'s Note:\n\n  The following is a list of corrections made to the original.

Looks up] It\'s noon. Time to unharness. Gee up, get\nalong! Fagged out? Poor old beast! One more turn and back again, that\nwill be the last furrow, and then dinner. It was a good idea to bring\nthat chunk of bread with me. I\'ll not go home, but sit down by the well\nand have a bite and a rest, and Peggy can graze awhile. Then, with God\'s\nhelp, to work again, and the ploughing will be done in good time.\n\n    Enter Imp; hides behind a bush.\n\nIMP. See what a good fellow he is! Keeps calling on God. Wait a bit,\nfriend,--you\'ll be calling on the Devil before long! I\'ll just take away\nhis chunk. He\'ll miss it before long, and will begin to hunt for it.\nHe\'ll be hungry, and then he\'ll swear and call on the Devil.\n\n    Takes the chunk of bread and sits down behind the bush watching to\n    see what the Peasant will do.\n\nPEASANT [unharnesses the horse] With God\'s blessing! [Lets the horse\nloose, and goes towards the place where his coat is lying] I\'m awfully\nhungry. The wife cut a big chunk, but see if I don\'t eat it all. [Coming\nup to the coat] Gone! I must have put it under the coat. [Lifting the\ncoat] No, it\'s not here either! What has happened? [Shakes the coat].\n\nIMP [behind the bush] Go on, go on, search away! I\'ve got it safe!\n\nPEASANT [moves the plough and shakes his coat again] This is strange!\nVery strange! No one was here, yet the chunk is gone! If the birds had\nbeen at it there would be some crumbs left, but there\'s not a single\ncrumb! No one has been here, and yet some one has taken it!\n\nIMP [rises and looks out] Now he\'ll call on the Devil.\n\nPEASANT. Well, it seems there\'s no help for it! Never mind, I shan\'t\nstarve to death. If some one has taken it, he\'s taken it; let him eat\nit, and may it do him good.\n\nIMP [spits] Oh, the damned peasant! Instead of swearing properly, he\nonly says, "May it do him good." What can one do with such a fellow?\n\n    Peasant lies down to rest, makes the sign of the cross, yawns, and\n    falls asleep.\n\nIMP [comes out from behind the bush] It\'s all very well for the boss to\ntalk. The boss keeps on saying, "You don\'t bring enough peasants to\nHell! See what a lot of tradesmen, gentlefolk, and all sorts of people\nflock in every day, and how few peasants!" Now, how\'s one to get round\nthis one? There\'s no way of getting hold of him. Haven\'t I stolen his\nlast crust? What can I do better than that? And yet he didn\'t swear. I\'m\nat my wits\' end what to do! Well, I must go and report!\n\n    Disappears into the ground.\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT II\n\n    Hell. The Chief of the Devils sits in the highest place. The Devil\'s\n    Secretary sits lower down, at a table with writing materials.\n    Sentinels stand at each side. To the right are five Imps of\n    different kinds. To the left, by the door, the Doorkeeper. A\n    dandified Imp stands before the Chief.\n\n\nTHE DANDY IMP. The whole of my booty for the three years has been\n220,005 men. They\'re all in my power now.\n\nTHE CHIEF. All right. Thank you. Pass on.\n\n    The Dandy Imp goes to the right.\n\nTHE CHIEF [to the Secretary] I\'m tired! Is there much business left?\nWhose reports have we had, and whose are still to come?\n\nTHE SECRETARY [counts on his fingers and, as he counts, points to the\nImps to the right. When he mentions any Imp, the one referred to bows]\nWe\'ve had the Gentlefolks\' Devil\'s report. He\'s captured 1836 in all.\nAnd the Tradesmen\'s Devil\'s with 9643. From the Lawyers\', 3423. The\nWomen\'s we\'ve also just had: 186,315 married women, and 17,438 maids.\nOnly two Devils are left, the Officials\' and the Peasants\'. There are\naltogether 220,005 souls on the list.\n\nCHIEF. Well then, we\'d better finish it all to-day. [To the Doorkeeper]\nLet them in!\n\n    The Officials\' Devil enters, and bows to the Chief.\n\nCHIEF. Well, how have you got on?\n\nOFFICIALS\' IMP [laughing, and rubbing his hands] My affairs are all\nright, just as soot they are white! The booty is such that I don\'t\nremember anything like it since the creation of the world.\n\nCHIEF. What, have you captured a great many?\n\nOFFICIALS\' IMP. It\'s not so much the quantity. Only 1350 men in all, but\nsuch splendid fellows! Such fellows, they might shame any Devil! They\ncan embroil people better than we ourselves can. I\'ve introduced a new\nfashion among them.\n\nCHIEF. What\'s that new fashion?\n\nOFFICIALS\' IMP. Why, in former times lawyers were in attendance on the\njudges and deceived people. Now, I\'ve arranged for them to do business\nalso apart from the judges. Whoever pays most, is the one to whose\nbusiness they attend. And they\'ll take such trouble over it that they\'ll\nmake out a case where there is none! They and the officials between them\nembroil people far better than we Devils can.\n\nCHIEF. All right. I\'ll have a look at them. You may pass on.\n\n    The Officials\' Imp goes to the right.\n\nCHIEF [to Doorkeeper] Let in the last one.\n\n    Enter the Peasants\' Imp with the chunk of bread. He bows to the\n    ground.\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. I can\'t live like this any longer! Give me another\nappointment!\n\nCHIEF. What appointment? What are you jabbering about? Get up and talk\nsense. Give in your report! How many peasants have you captured this\nweek?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP [crying] Not one!\n\nCHIEF. What? Not one! What do you mean? What have you been doing? Where\nhave you been loafing?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP [whimpering] I\'ve not been loafing; I\'ve been straining\nevery nerve all the time, but I can\'t do anything! There now, I went and\ntook his last crust from under the very nose of one of them, and,\ninstead of swearing, he wished it might do me good!\n\nCHIEF. What?... What?... What are you mumbling there? Just blow your\nnose, and then speak sensibly! One can\'t make head or tail of what\nyou\'re saying.\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. Why, there was a peasant ploughing; and I knew he had\nbrought only a chunk of bread with him, and had nothing else to eat. I\nstole his crust. By rights he should have sworn; but what does he do? He\nsays, "Let him who has taken it eat it, and may it do him good!" I\'ve\nbrought the chunk of bread away with me. Here it is!\n\nCHIEF. Well, and what of the others?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. They\'re all alike. I could not manage to take a single\none.\n\nCHIEF. How dare you appear before me with empty hands? And as if that\nwere not enough, you must needs bring some stinking crust or other here!\nDo you mean to mock me? Do you mean to live in Hell and eat the bread of\nidleness? The others do their best, and work hard! Why, they [points to\nthe Imps] have each supplied 10,000 or 20,000, or even 200,000. And you\ncome with empty hands, and bring a miserable crust, and begin spinning\nyour yarns. You chatter, but don\'t work; and that\'s why you\'ve lost hold\nof them. But wait a bit, my friend, I\'ll teach you a thing or two!\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. Before you punish me, listen to what I\'ll tell you. It\'s\nall very well for those other Devils, who have to do with gentlefolk,\nwith merchants, or with women. It\'s all plain sailing for them! Show a\nnobleman a coronet, or a fine estate, and you\'ve got him, and may lead\nhim where you like. It\'s the same with a tradesman. Show him some money\nand stir up his covetousness, and you may lead him as with a halter. And\nwith the women it\'s also plain sailing. Give them finery and sweets--and\nyou may do what you like with them. But as to the peasants--there\'s a\nlong row to hoe with them! When he\'s at work from morn till\nnight--sometimes even far into the night--and never starts without a\nthought of God, how\'s one to get at him? Master, remove me from these\npeasants! I\'m tired to death of them, and have angered you into the\nbargain!\n\nCHIEF. You\'re humbugging, you idler! It\'s no use your talking about the\nothers. They\'ve got hold of the merchants, the nobles, and the women,\nbecause they knew how to treat them, and invented new traps for them!\nThe official one there--he has made quite a new departure. You must\nthink of something too! You\'ve stolen a crust, and brag about it! What a\nclever thing to do! Surround them with snares, and they\'ll get caught in\none or other of them. But loafing about as you do, and leaving the way\nopen for them, those peasants of yours have gained strength. They begin\nnot to care about their last crust. If they take to such ways, and teach\ntheir women the same, they\'ll get quite beyond us! Invent something! Get\nout of the hole as best you can.\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. I can\'t think how to set about it. Let me off! I can\nstand it no longer!\n\nCHIEF [angrily] Can\'t stand it! What do you think, then? Am I to do your\nwork for you?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. I can\'t!\n\nCHIEF. Can\'t? Wait a bit! Hollo, there! bring the switches; give him a\nthrashing.\n\n    The Sentinels seize the Imp and whip him.\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. Oh! Oh! Oh!...\n\nCHIEF. Have you thought of something?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. Oh, oh, I can\'t!\n\nCHIEF. Give him some more. [They whip] Well--thought of something?\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. Yes--yes, I have!\n\nCHIEF. Well, tell us what it is.\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. I\'ve invented a dodge that will bring them all into my\ngrasp, if you\'ll only let me take a labourer\'s place with that peasant.\nBut I can\'t explain what it is beforehand.\n\nCHIEF. All right. Only remember, that if you don\'t atone for that crust\nwithin three years, I\'ll flay you alive!\n\nPEASANTS\' IMP. They\'ll all be mine in three years\' time.\n\nCHIEF. All right. When the three years are past, I shall come and see\nfor myself!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT III\n\n    A barn. Carts loaded with grain. The Imp as a Labourer. He is\n    shovelling grain off the cart, and the Peasant is carrying it away\n    in a measure.\n\n\nLABOURER. Seven!\n\nPEASANT. How many quarters?\n\nLABOURER [looks at the numbers marked on the barn door] Twenty-six\nquarters. And this is the seventh bushel of the twenty-seventh quarter.\n\nPEASANT. It won\'t all go in; the barn is nearly full!\n\nLABOURER. Shovel it nice and even.\n\nPEASANT. So I will.\n\n    Exit with measure.\n\nLABOURER [alone, takes off his cap, his horns appear] It will be some\ntime before he returns. I\'ll ease my horns a bit. [Horns rise] And I\'ll\ntake my boots off too; I can\'t do it when he\'s here. [Takes his boots\noff, his hoofs appear. Sits on the threshold] It\'s the third year now.\nIt\'s near the time of reckoning. There\'s more corn than there\'s room\nfor. Only one more thing left to teach him, and then let the Chief come\nand see for himself. I\'ll have something worth showing him! He\'ll\nforgive me for that crust!\n\n    Neighbour approaches. Labourer hides his horns and hoofs.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Good day to you.\n\nLABOURER. The same to you.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Where\'s your master?\n\nLABOURER. He\'s gone to spread the grain more even; it won\'t all go in.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Dear me, what a run of luck your master is having! More than\nhe has room for? We\'re all amazed at the harvests your master has had\nthese two years. It\'s as if some one had told him what was coming. Last\nyear was a dry season, and he had sown in the bog. Others had no\nharvest, but your threshing ground was covered with sheaves! This year\nwe\'ve a rainy summer, and he\'s been sharp enough to sow on the hill.\nEverybody\'s corn has rotted, but you have a splendid harvest. What\ngrain! Ah, what grain!\n\n    Takes some grain, weighs it in his hand, and chews it.\n\nPEASANT [enters with empty measure] How d\'ye do, neighbour?\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Good day. I was saying to your man here, how well you managed\nto guess where to sow your corn. Every one envies you. What heaps, what\nheaps of corn you have got! You\'ll not eat it all in ten years.\n\nPEASANT. It\'s all thanks to Nicholas here. [Points to Labourer] It was\nhis luck. Last year I sent him to plough, and what did he do but plough\nin the bog. I gave him a scolding, but he persuaded me to sow there. And\nso I did, and it turned out all for the best! And this year he again\nguessed right, and sowed on the hill!\n\nNEIGHBOUR. It\'s as if he knew what kind of season it would be. Yes, you\nhave got corn enough and no mistake! [Silence] And I have come to ask\nyou to lend me a sack of rye. Ours is all used up. I\'ll return it next\nyear.\n\nPEASANT. All right, you may have it.\n\nLABOURER [nudging the Peasant] Don\'t give it!\n\nPEASANT. No more words about it. Take it.\n\nNEIGHBOUR. Thank you. I\'ll just run and fetch a sack.\n\nLABOURER [aside] He keeps to his old ways ... still goes on giving. He\ndoesn\'t always obey me. But just wait a bit. He\'ll soon stop giving\naway.\n\n    Exit Neighbour.\n\nPEASANT [sitting down on the threshold] Why should one not give to a\ngood man?\n\nLABOURER. Giving is one thing, getting back another! You know--\n\n        "It\'s a good world to lend in, a good world to spend in,\n         But to get back one\'s own, it\'s the worst world that\'s known."\n\nThat\'s what the old folk say.\n\nPEASANT. Don\'t worry. We\'ve plenty of corn.\n\nLABOURER. Well, what of that?\n\nPEASANT. We\'ve enough, not only till next harvest but for two years\nahead. What are we to do with it all?\n\nLABOURER. What are we to do with it? I could make such stuff of this\ncorn as would make you rejoice all the days of your life.\n\nPEASANT. Why, what would you make of it?\n\nLABOURER. A kind of drink. Drink, that would give you strength when you\nare weak, satisfy you when you are hungry, give you sleep when you are\nrestless, make you merry when you\'re sad, give you courage when you\'re\nafraid. That\'s the drink I\'d make!\n\nPEASANT. Rubbish!\n\nLABOURER. Rubbish indeed! It was just the same when I told you to sow in\nthe bog, and then on the hill. You did not believe me then, but now you\nknow! You\'ll find out about the drink the same way.\n\nPEASANT. But what will you make it of?\n\nLABOURER. Why, of this same corn.\n\nPEASANT. But won\'t that be a sin?\n\nLABOURER. Just hear him! Why should it be a sin? Everything is given for\na joy to man.\n\nPEASANT. And where did you get all your wisdom from, Nick? You seem a\nvery ordinary man to look at, and hard-working too. Why, I don\'t\nremember you so much as ever taking your boots off all these two years\nyou\'ve been with me. And yet you seem to know everything. Where did you\nlearn it?\n\nLABOURER. I\'ve been about a good deal!\n\nPEASANT. And so you say this drink will give one strength?\n\nLABOURER. Just wait till you try it and see the good that comes of it.\n\nPEASANT. And how are we to make it?\n\nLABOURER. It\'s not hard to make when you know how! Only we shall want a\ncopper and a couple of iron vessels.\n\nPEASANT. And does it taste nice?\n\nLABOURER. As sweet as honey. When once you\'ve tasted it you\'ll never\ngive it up.\n\nPEASANT. Is that so? Well, I\'ll go to the neighbour\'s; he used to have a\ncopper. We\'ll have a try!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV\n\n    A barn. In the middle a closed copper on the fire, with another\n    vessel, under which is a tap.\n\n\nLABOURER [holds a tumbler under the tap and drinks the spirit] Well,\nmaster, it\'s ready now.\n\nPEASANT [sitting on his heels and looking on] What a queer thing. Here\'s\nwater coming out of the mixture. Why are you letting this water off\nfirst?\n\nLABOURER. It\'s not water. It is the very stuff itself!\n\nPEASANT. Why is it so clear? I thought it would be yellow like grain.\nThis is just like water.\n\nLABOURER. But you just smell it!\n\nPEASANT. Ah, what a scent! Well, well, let\'s see what it\'s like in the\nmouth. Let me taste! [Tries to take the tumbler out of the Labourer\'s\nhand].\n\nLABOURER. Mind, you\'ll spill it! [Turns the tap off, drinks and smacks\nhis lips] It\'s ready! Here you are. Drink it!\n\nPEASANT [drinks, first sipping, then taking more and more, till he\nempties the glass and gives it back] Now then, some more. One can\'t tell\nthe taste from such a drop.\n\nLABOURER [laughing] Well, you seem to like it! [Draws some more].\n\nPEASANT [drinks] Eh, that\'s the sort! Let\'s call the missis. Hey,\nMartha! Come along! It\'s ready! Come on there!\n\n    Enter Wife and little girl.\n\nWIFE. What\'s the matter? Why are you kicking up such a row?\n\nPEASANT. You just taste what we\'ve been distilling. [Hands her the\nglass] Smell! What does it smell of?\n\nWIFE [smells] Dear me!\n\nPEASANT. Drink!\n\nWIFE. But perhaps it may do one some harm?\n\nPEASANT. Drink, fool!\n\nWIFE. True. It is nice!\n\nPEASANT [a little tipsy] Nice indeed! You wait and see what\'ll happen.\nNick says it drives all weariness out of one\'s bones. The young grow\nold. I mean, the old grow young. There now, I\'ve only had two glasses of\nit, and all my bones have got easy. [Swaggers] You see? Wait a bit, when\nyou and I drink it every day we\'ll grow young again! Come, Martha!\n[Embraces her].\n\nWIFE. Get along. Why, it\'s made you quite silly.\n\nPEASANT. There, you see! You said Nick and I were wasting the corn, but\njust see what stuff we\'ve concocted. Eh? It\'s good, ain\'t it?\n\nWIFE. Of course, it\'s good if it makes the old young again. Just see how\njolly it has made you! And I feel jolly too! Now then, join in! Ah ...\nAh ... Ah ... [Sings].\n\nPEASANT. Yes, that\'s the way! We\'ll all be young, all young.\n\nWIFE. We must call mother-in-law, for she\'s always sad and grumbling.\nShe needs renewing. When she\'s younger she\'ll get kinder.\n\nPEASANT [tipsy] Yes, call mother. Call her here, and grandfather too. I\nsay, Mary, run and call your granny and great-grandfather. Tell him he\nmust get down from the oven! We\'ll make him young again. Now then,\nquick! One, two, three, and away! Off like a shot! [Girl runs off. To\nWife] We\'ll have another glass.\n\n    Labourer fills and hands the glasses.\n\nPEASANT [drinks] At first we got young at the top, in the tongue; then\nit went down into the arms. Now it has reached the feet. I feel my feet\ngetting younger. They\'re moving of themselves. [Starts dancing].\n\nWIFE [drinks] You\'re a real clever \'un, Nick! Now then, strike up!\n\n    Labourer takes a balal\xc3\xa1yka[1] and plays. Peasant and Wife dance.\n\n  [1] The balal\xc3\xa1yka is an instrument (generally three-stringed) used by\n  Russian peasants, and answering to the negroes\' banjo.\n\nLABOURER [plays in the foreground of the scene, laughing and winking as\nhe watches them. Then he leaves off playing, but they still continue to\ndance] You\'ll pay for that crust! You\'ve done it now, my fine fellows.\nThey\'ll never get out of it. The Chief can come when he likes now!\n\n    Enter a fresh-looking elderly woman, and a very old white-haired\n    man, the Peasant\'s Grandfather.\n\nGRANDFATHER. What\'s the matter? Have you gone mad? Dancing while every\none else is at work!\n\nWIFE [dances and claps her hands] Oh--Oh--Oh-- [Sings]\n\n        "That I\'m sinning I will own,\n         Free from sin is God alone!"\n\nOLD WOMAN. Oh, you wretch! The oven\'s not cleaned out yet, and here you\nare dancing!\n\nPEASANT. Wait a bit, mother. See what has been happening here. We can\nmake old people young again! Here you are! Just drink this! [Passes\ntumbler].\n\nOLD WOMAN. There\'s plenty of water in the well. [Smells it] But what\nhave you put in? My--what a smell!\n\nPEASANT. You just drink it.\n\nOLD WOMAN [tastes] Dear me! But won\'t one die of it?\n\nWIFE. It will make you more alive. You\'ll grow young again!\n\nOLD WOMAN. Nonsense! [Drinks] But it\'s nice! Better than our drinks.\nHere, father, have some too.\n\n    Grandfather sits down and shakes his head.\n\nLABOURER. Never mind him. But granny must have another glass. [Hands\nsome to the old woman].\n\nOLD WOMAN. If only no harm comes of it. Oh dear, it does burn! But it is\nnice.\n\nWIFE. Drink it! Then you\'ll feel it running through your veins.\n\nOLD WOMAN. Well, I suppose I\'ll have to try. [Drinks].\n\nWIFE. Has it reached your feet yet?\n\nOLD WOMAN. True enough, it does run through you. I feel it here now! And\nit really makes one feel quite light. Come--give me some more. [Drinks\nagain] Fine! Now I\'m quite young again.\n\nPEASANT. Didn\'t I tell you?\n\nOLD WOMAN. Ah, it\'s a pity my old man is no longer here. He might have\nseen once more what I was like in my young days.\n\n    Labourer plays. Peasant and Wife dance.\n\nOLD WOMAN [comes into the middle] Do you call that dancing? Let me show\nyou. [Dances] That\'s the way! Then like this, and like that! Do you see?\n\n    Grandfather goes up to the vessel and lets the spirit run out on to\n    the ground.\n\nPEASANT [notices and rushes at his Grandfather] What are you up to, you\nold fool? Spilling such fine stuff! Oh, you old dotard! [Pushes him away\nand holds tumbler under tap] You\'ve emptied it all!\n\nGRANDFATHER. It\'s evil and not good! God has sent you a good harvest for\nyou to feed yourself and others, but you have turned the corn into\ndevils\' drink. No good will come of it. Give up this business. Else\nyou\'ll perish and ruin others! You think this is drink? It\'s fire, and\nwill burn you up! [Takes a brand from the fire and lights the spilt\nspirit. The spirit burns. They all look on with horror].\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT V\n\n    Interior of hut. The Labourer alone, his horns and hoofs showing.\n\n\nLABOURER. There\'s lots of corn. More than there\'s room for, and he\'s now\ngot a taste for it. We\'ve been distilling again, and we\'ve filled a\nbarrel and hidden it away. We\'re not going to treat any one for nothing,\nbut when we want to get something out of a fellow, then we\'ll treat him!\nSo to-day I told him to invite the village elders and treat them, that\nthey should divide up the property between him and his grandfather, and\ngive everything to him and nothing to the old man! My three years are up\nto-day, and my work is finished. Let the Chief come and see for himself.\nI needn\'t be ashamed of his seeing it!\n\n    Chief appears out of the ground.\n\nCHIEF. Time\'s up! Have you redeemed your bread-blunder? I told you I\'d\ncome and see for myself. Have you managed the Peasant?\n\nLABOURER. Done him completely! Judge for yourself. Some of them will\nmeet here soon. Get into the oven, and see what they\'ll do. You\'ll be\nwell satisfied!\n\nCHIEF [climbs into the oven] We\'ll see!\n\n    Enter the Peasant and four old men. The Wife follows. The men sit\n    down round the table. The Wife lays the cloth, sets ox-foot brawn\n    and pies on the table. The old men exchange greetings with Labourer.\n\nFIRST ELDER. Well, have you made more of the drink?\n\nLABOURER. Yes, we\'ve distilled as much as we need. Why let valuable\nstuff be wasted?\n\nSECOND ELDER. And is it a success?\n\nLABOURER. Better than the first lot.\n\nSECOND ELDER. But where did you learn to make it?\n\nLABOURER. Going about in the world one learns many things!\n\nTHIRD ELDER. Yes, yes, you\'re a knowing fellow.\n\n    Wife brings spirits and glasses.\n\nPEASANT. Have a drop!\n\n    Wife takes a decanter and fills glasses.\n\nWIFE. Do us the honour!\n\nFIRST ELDER [drinks] Your health! Ah, that\'s good. It runs right through\nall one\'s joints. That\'s what I call proper drink!\n\n    The other three Elders do the same. Chief gets out of the oven.\n    Labourer goes and stands by him.\n\nLABOURER [to Chief] See what will happen now! I\'ll trip up the woman\nwith my foot and she\'ll spill the liquor. Formerly he did not grudge his\nlast crust, but now see what he\'ll do about a glass of spirits!\n\nPEASANT. Now then, wife, fill again and hand it round in due\norder--first to our friend here, then to Daddy Michael.\n\n    Wife fills a glass and goes round the table. The Labourer trips her\n    up; she stumbles and upsets the glass.\n\nWIFE. Gracious goodness, I\'ve spilt it! Why do you get in my way,\nconfound you?\n\nPEASANT [to Wife] There now, what a clumsy beast! Her fingers are all\nthumbs, and she goes swearing at others! See what fine stuff she goes\nspilling on the ground!\n\nWIFE. I didn\'t do it on purpose.\n\nPEASANT. On purpose indeed! Wait till I get up; I\'ll teach you how to\npour spirits on the ground. [To Labourer] And you too, you confounded\nfool, what are you prancing round the table for? Go to the Devil!\n\n    Wife again fills and hands the glasses round.\n\nLABOURER [goes back to the oven to the Chief] You see? Formerly he did\nnot grudge his last crust, and now for a glass of spirits he nearly beat\nhis wife and sent me to you--to the Devil!\n\nCHIEF. It\'s good, very good! I\'m satisfied.\n\nLABOURER. You wait a bit. Let them empty the bottle--and you\'ll see what\nwill happen. Even now they are giving each other smooth oily words;\npresently they\'ll start flattering each other,--as cunning as foxes.\n\nPEASANT. Well, old friends, what\'s your opinion of my business? My\ngrandfather has been living with me, and I have been feeding him and\nfeeding him, and now he\'s gone to live with my uncle, and wants to take\nhis share of the property and give it to uncle! Consider it well; you\nare wise men. We could as well do without our own heads as without you.\nThere\'s no one in the whole village to come near you. Take you for\nexample, Iv\xc3\xa1n Fed\xc3\xb3titch--doesn\'t every one say you\'re first among men?\nAnd as for me, I\'ll tell you the truth, Iv\xc3\xa1n Fed\xc3\xb3titch, I\'m fonder of\nyou than of my own father or mother. As for Michael Step\xc3\xa1nitch, he\'s an\nold friend.\n\nFIRST ELDER [to Peasant] It\'s good to talk with a good man. It\'s the way\nto get wisdom. It\'s just the same with you. One can\'t find any one to\ncompare with you either.\n\nSECOND ELDER. Wise and affectionate--that\'s what I like you for.\n\nTHIRD ELDER. You have my best sympathy. I can\'t find words to express\nit. I was saying to my old woman only to-day ...\n\nFOURTH ELDER. A friend, a real friend!\n\nLABOURER [nudges the Chief] Do you hear? All lies! They abuse one\nanother behind their backs, but see how thick they are laying it on\nnow,--like foxes wagging their tails! And it all comes from that drink.\n\nCHIEF. That drink is good, very good! If they take to lying like that,\nthey\'ll all be ours. Very good; I\'m satisfied!\n\nLABOURER. Wait a bit. When they\'ve finished a second bottle it will be\nbetter still!\n\nWIFE [serves] Do have another glass.\n\nFIRST ELDER. Won\'t it be too much? Your health! [Drinks] It\'s pleasant\nto drink in the company of a good man.\n\nSECOND ELDER. How can one help drinking? Health to the host and hostess!\n\nTHIRD ELDER. Friends, your health!\n\nFOURTH ELDER. This is a brew of the right sort! Let\'s be merry! We\'ll\narrange things for you. \'Cos it all depends on me!\n\nFIRST ELDER. On you? No, not on you, but on what your seniors say.\n\nFOURTH ELDER. My seniors are greater fools. Go where you came from!\n\nSECOND ELDER. What are you up to now? You fool!\n\nTHIRD ELDER. It\'s true what he\'s saying! \'Cos why? The host is not\nentertaining us for nothing. He means business. The business can be\narranged. Only you must stand treat! Show us due respect. \'Cos it\'s you\nas wants me, and not I you! You\'re own brother to the pig!\n\nPEASANT. And you\'re itself! What are you yelling for? Think to surprise\nme? You are all good at stuffing yourselves!\n\nFIRST ELDER. What are you giving yourself airs for? See if I don\'t twist\nyour nose to one side!\n\nPEASANT. We\'ll see whose nose will get twisted!\n\nSECOND ELDER. Think yourself such a marvel? Go to the Devil! I won\'t\nspeak to you--I\'ll go away!\n\nPEASANT [holds him] What, will you break up the company?\n\nSECOND ELDER. Let me go, or I\'ll call for help!\n\nPEASANT. I won\'t! What right have you to\xc2\xa0...?\n\nSECOND ELDER. This right! [Beats him].\n\nPEASANT [to the other Elders] Help me!\n\n    They fall on one another, and all speak at once.\n\nFIRST ELDER. That\'s why. \'Cos it means we\'re all having a spree-ee!\n\nSECOND ELDER. I can arrange everything!\n\nTHIRD ELDER. Let\'s have some more!\n\nPEASANT [to Wife] Bring another bottle!\n\n    All sit round the table again and drink.\n\nLABOURER [to Chief] Have you noticed? The wolf\'s blood in them was\naroused, and they\'ve turned as fierce as wolves.\n\nCHIEF. The drink is good! I\'m satisfied!\n\nLABOURER. Wait a bit. Let them empty a third bottle. Things will be\nbetter still!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n\n\nACT VI\n\n    The scene represents a village street. To the right some old women\n    are sitting on logs of wood with the Grandfather. In the centre, is\n    a ring of women, girls, and lads. Dance music is played and they\n    dance. Noise is heard from the hut, and drunken screams. An old man\n    comes out and shouts in a tipsy voice. The Peasant follows him and\n    leads him back.\n\n\nGRANDFATHER. Ah, what doings! what doings! One would think, what more\nwould any one want than to do his work on week days, and when Sunday\ncomes round, to have a good wash, clean the harness, and rest a bit and\nsit with his family; or go outside and have a talk with the old folk\nabout matters concerning the Commune. Or, if you\'re young, have a game.\nThere they are playing,--and it\'s pleasant to look at them. It\'s all\npleasant and good. [Screams inside the hut] But this sort of thing, what\nis it? It only leads men astray, and pleases the Devils. And it all\ncomes of fat living!\n\n    Tipsy men come tumbling out of the hut, shout, and catch hold of the\n    girls.\n\nGIRLS. Leave off, Daddy Tom! What do you mean by it?\n\nLADS. Let\'s go into the lane. It\'s impossible to play here.\n\n    Exeunt all who were playing in the ring.\n\nPEASANT [goes up to Grandfather] What have you got now? The Elders will\nallot everything to me! [Snaps his fingers at him] That\'s what you\'ll\nget! So there you are! It\'s all mine and you\'ve nothing! They\'ll tell\nyou so themselves!\n\n    The four Elders speak all at once.\n\nFIRST ELDER. \'Cos I know what\'s what!\n\nSECOND ELDER.\n\n        "\'Fore all I\'ll be heard,\n         \'Cos I\'m an old bird!"\n\nTHIRD ELDER. Friend! dear friend, dearest friend!\n\nFOURTH ELDER.\n\n        "Jog along hut, jog along bed,\n         The missis has nowhere to lay down her head!"\n\nNow then, come along!\n\n    The Elders take each other\'s arms in couples and go off reeling, one\n    couple following the other. The Peasant turns back to the hut, but\n    stumbles before he reaches it,--falls down, and lies muttering\n    incomprehensible words that sound like grunts. The Grandfather and\n    those he was with, rise and exeunt.\n\n    Enter Labourer and Chief of Devils.\n\nLABOURER. Did you see? Now the swine\'s blood has been roused in them,\nand from wolves they have turned into swine! [Points to Peasant] There\nhe lies in the dirt and grunts like a hog!\n\nCHIEF. You have succeeded! First like foxes, then like wolves, and now\nlike swine! Well, that is a drink! But tell me, how did you make it? I\nsuppose it\'s made of a mixture of foxes\', wolves\', and swine\'s blood?\n\nLABOURER. Oh no! I only supplied him with too much corn! As long as he\nhad only as much corn as he needed, he did not grudge his last crust,\nbut when he had more than he knew what to do with, the fox\'s, the\nwolf\'s, and the swine\'s blood in him awoke. He always had beast\'s blood\nin him, only it could not get the upper hand.\n\nCHIEF. Well, you\'re a fine fellow! You\'ve atoned for your crust-blunder.\nNow they only need to drink spirits, and they\'re altogether ours!\n\n\n                                Curtain.\n\n\n                     END OF "THE FIRST DISTILLER."\n\n\n\n\n[ Transcriber\'s Note:\n\n  The following is a list of corrections made to the original.
